Polish MPs have passed a controversial new media ownership law that could lead to the country’s largest remaining independent TV station losing its licence, but at the cost of several key votes that put the government’s longterm future in doubt.

After a night of protests in Warsaw and 80 other towns and cities against the bill, which opponents see as an attempt to silence an often critical broadcaster, the law passed on Wednesday by 228 votes to 216 in the 460-seat lower house.

The vote came amid stormy scenes after the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, on Tuesday fired his deputy, Jarosław Gowin, the leader of the junior coalition member Accord, prompting the party to leave the government.

The law – which is expected to be defeated in the senate before returning to the lower house, where an absolute majority will be needed to secure its passage – would prevent non-EU companies from holding a controlling stake in Polish media.

That would force the US media group Discovery to sell its majority stake in TVN, one of Poland’s biggest private TV networks, whose news channel, TVN24, is often highly critical of the Law and Justice party (PiS) that has governed Poland since 2015.

Discovery said in a statement after the vote it was “extremely concerned” but remained “resolute”. It said the bill was “an attack on core democratic principles of freedom of speech [and] the independence of the media”.

The channel appealed to the senate and the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, to oppose the bill and prevent it from becoming law. “Poland’s future as a democratic country in the international arena and its credibility in the eyes of investors depend on this,” it said.

The 13 MPs who formally belong to the Accord group have been increasingly at odds with the main partner in the United Right coalition, the populist PiS, and their departure deprived the government of its one-vote majority.

Gowin said his party was leaving the government “with our heads held high” after expressing deep disagreements over planned tax changes – the so-called Polish deal, intended to win the government re-election in 2023 – and the media bill.

However, PiS successfully persuaded enough MPs from smaller parties to vote in favour of the bill, which has drawn fierce criticism from both the EU and Washington, with Polish media reporting cash and other inducements were on offer.

Earlier the government lost four key votes, including one to suspend the session and postpone a vote on the media law. To howls of “Fraudsters”, the speaker, Elzbieta Witek, a PiS member, ordered another vote, which the government won.

The lost votes do not mean that the end of the government, which would require a formal vote of no confidence, but commentators agree PiS has been weakened and may now need to rely on a critical far-right party, Confederation, for informal support.

The government denies the measure is aimed at any one broadcaster, saying it seeks to prevent potential media acquisitions by non-EU countries such as Russia and China, and has rejected proposals to restrict the ownership ban to non-OECD countries.

But the move follows a sustained government drive to control Poland’s media in which public service outlets such as the state-run TVP television station become propaganda organs for the ruling party, while private, independent media have been steadily driven out of business.

The opposition Civic Platform, led since July by the former Polish prime minister and European Council president Donald Tusk, is determined to defeat PiS and has seized on media freedom as an issue that could unite a broad opposition alliance.

Radosław Sikorski, Tusk’s former foreign minister and a Civic Platform MEP, tweeted on Wednesday: “Our parliament will today be voting to disenfranchise TVN, Poland’s largest, American-owned independent TV station. If the bill passes, we will likely cross the point of no return toward a kleptocratic autocracy.”

Tusk tweeted after the vote: “The parliamentary majority, glued together with the mud of corruption and blackmail, is crumbling before our eyes. It may go on for a while but it is no longer able to govern.”

Washington has urged Warsaw to rethink, saying the proposed law would inevitably harm “defence, business and trade relations” between Poland and the US. Hundreds of Polish journalists and editors have also signed an open letter calling on the government to halt “the destruction of media freedom in our country”.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@German police have arrested a British man who worked at the British embassy in Berlin on suspicion of spying for Russian intelligence in exchange for cash bribes, according to prosecutors.

Germany’s highest public prosecutor said the man, identified only as David S, was arrested at his Potsdam apartment at 2.20pm on Tuesday, and his home and embassy workplace were searched.

The 57-year-old Briton is understood not to be a diplomat but a private contractor working as a security guard at the Berlin embassy and therefore does not hold diplomatic immunity.

He is suspected of having worked for a Russian intelligence agency at least since November 2020, at least once passing on documents he had acquired through his work to a handler.

He is alleged to have been paid a cash bribe to pass information to Russian intelligence.

He is a British national and was under surveillance by British and German investigators, believed to have included MI5, but officials reluctant to discuss when that started.

The operation that led to David S being suspected was “intelligence-led”.

He is alleged to have received cash payments of an as yet unspecified sum in exchange for information. Citing prosecutors’ circles, the German news magazine Focus reported on Wednesday that the information passed on related to counter-terrorism issues.

Germany’s public prosecutor said the arrest was the result of a joint investigation by German and British authorities. The Metropolitan police said the investigation into David S had involved Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism officers.

“The man was arrested in the Berlin area on suspicion of committing offences relating to being engaged in ‘intelligence agent activity’ (under German law),” the Metropolitan police said.

“Primacy for the investigation remains with German authorities. Officers from the counter-terrorism command continue to liaise with German counterparts as the investigation continues.”

The Met’s counter-terrorism command is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of the Official Secrets Act.

A spokesperson for the British Home Office said: “An individual who was contracted to work for the government was arrested yesterday by the German authorities. It would not be appropriate to comment further as there is an ongoing police investigation.”

Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said the allegations potentially amounted to a “serious breach of UK national security”.

“All measures must now be taken – urgently – to establish exactly what information has been passed to Russian intelligence and the impact this has on the UK, as well as that of our allies,” he said.

“This is yet another example of the real threat posed by Russia, so it is unacceptable that Conservative ministers have been so slow to enact the measures necessary to protect the UK, including implementing the recommendations of the Russia report.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Taliban have captured the key Afghan city of Pul-e-Khumri, 140 miles north of the capital Kabul, giving the insurgents control of a strategic road junction linking Kabul to the north and west, according to insurgents and local officials.

Two officials in the city told the Guardian it fell to Taliban after heavy fighting on Tuesday, with officials and security forces abandoning their compounds.

“Pul-e-Khumri fell to the Taliban, they are everywhere,” one official said in a phone interview during which the sound of heavy gunfire could be heard.

“Taliban fighters broke through the frontlines in several directions during the afternoon. After heavy clashes, officials and security forces abandoned the governorate, intelligence and police headquarters. Heavy clashes are ongoing. We are deciding where to retreat now.”

A Taliban spokesperson on Twitter also claimed the capture of the city, the capital of Baghlan province. Images on social media showed the Taliban’s flag at city gates and insurgent fighters inside the city.

If confirmed, Pul-e-Khumri would be the eighth out of 34 provincial capitals captured by the hardline Islamist movement in less than a week.

The city’s fall to the Taliban would be a massive blow to the Afghan government, threatening the remaining cities in the north of Afghanistan not already under insurgent control including Mazar-i-Sharif and Faizabad.

Earlier on Tuesday, a senior EU official warned that the Taliban’s strategy in northern Afghanistan appeared to be to cut off the capital, Kabul, from forces to the north that could support it.

On Tuesday Joe Biden said he does not regret his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, noting that Washington has spent more than $1 trillion over 20 years and lost thousands of troops.

“Afghan leaders have to come together,” Biden told reporters at the White House, saying the Afghan troops outnumber the Taliban and must want to fight. “They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation.”

He said the United States continues to provide significant air support, food, equipment and salaries to Afghan forces.

The latest gains in the Taliban’s lightning advance came as a US peace envoy to Afghanistan warned the Taliban that any government that comes to power through force in Afghanistan would not be recognised internationally.

The US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad went to Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office, to tell the group that there was no point in pursuing victory on the battlefield because a military takeover of Kabul would guarantee they would be global pariahs.

Khalilzad’s comments came as the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, warned of a mounting campaign by the Taliban targeting current and former government officials and family members for “summary execution” and destruction of their homes and other property.

According to the EU about 400,000 Afghans have been displaced by the fighting in recent months.

Khalilzad and others hope to persuade Taliban leaders to return to peace talks with the Afghan government as US and Nato forces finish pulling out from the country.

During the past two months the Taliban has rapidly expanded the territory it controls to about 65% of the country, including a large proportion of rural areas. A third of the country’s provincial capitals are under threat.

The Taliban military chief released an audio message to his fighters on Tuesday ordering them not to harm Afghan forces and government officials in territories they conquered.

In the nearly five-minute audio Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of the late Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, also told the insurgents to stay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who had fled, to leave marketplaces open and to protect places of business, including banks.

It was not immediately clear if Taliban fighters on the ground would heed Yaqoob’s instructions. There have been reports by civilians who have fled Taliban advances of heavy-handed treatment by the insurgents – of schools being burned down and of repressive restrictions on women.

In a separate intervention on Tuesday, the UN human rights chief urged an end to the Taliban offensive on Afghan cities and said her office was receiving reports of possible war crimes.

“The Taliban must cease their military operations in cities. Unless all parties return to the negotiating table and reach a peaceful settlement, the already atrocious situation for so many Afghans will become much worse,” Bachelet said in a statement.

Bachelet’s remarks came as heavily armed fighters flooded into Farah city on Tuesday morning, with the Taliban announcing that its “special forces” had arrived in the city.

The Taliban also posted pictures of its triumphant fighters standing in front of city’s main administrative building.

Following a now familiar pattern, an official in Farah who spoke to the Guardian described a fruitless request for government reinforcements and desertions.

“No help has so far arrived from Kabul, and we no longer expect them, if they wanted to send help they should have sent it,” the official said. “One of the intelligence officers switched sides last night and joined the Taliban with several of his men.”

Another local official said earlier on Tuesday: “The Taliban have been active in outskirts of Farah city for weeks but they started their big assault last night and were pushed back. But now they are advancing again.” The official was surrounded by the Taliban in a government compound and the Guardian was unable to reach him after fall of the city.

The fall of Farah followed the Taliban capture of Zaranj on Friday, which was followed two days later by the huge symbolic capture of Kunduz, a strategic city close to the border with Tajikistan and an important political and military hub. The group has also claimed Sheberghan, the capital of the northern Jawzjan province, Taloqan in Takhar province, Sar-e Pul in the northern province of the same name and Aybak in the province of Samangan.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@US officials have warned that Afghanistan’s government could fall in 90 days, with Kabul isolated in as little as a month, as the Taliban overran the central Sarposa prison in Kandahar, the country’s second largest city, releasing almost 1,000 prisoners.

The fall of Kandahar – sometimes called the capital of the south – would be a devastating blow for the Afghan government after a week in which the Taliban have swept up provincial capitals around the country in a lightning offensive.

The latest setback for Afghan government forces came as Joe Biden urged Afghan leaders to “fight for their nation” after rapid advances by the Taliban.

The White House spokesperson, Jen Psaki, repeated the administration line on Wednesday, saying: “They have what they need. What they need to determine is whether they have the political will to fight back, and if they have the ability to unite as leaders to fight back.”

She added: “We will continue to provide close air support. We’ll continue to resupply their forces with food and equipment, and pay all their salaries.”

Asked whether US air support for Afghan forces would stop on 31 August, the formal end to the US war in Afghanistan, she said: “I don’t have any update on that.” But she noted: “It’s a good question.”

With foreign embassies in Kabul, including the US embassy, discreetly accelerating evacuation planning in the event of the situation worsening, the Taliban’s succession of victories on the battlefield has caught out western capitals that have long sustained the Afghan government.

India announced on Wednesday that it was evacuating consular staff from the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, one of the last remaining cities in that region not under Taliban control.

Confirming the fall of the prison, an official in Kandahar told the Guardian: “The Taliban broke into Kandahar prison around evening, they now have control over it. They started their attack on the prison last night.

“There are still a few places in Kandahar city under government control but the Taliban are in Ahmad Wali Khan Square. I don’t exactly don’t know the number of released inmates. But it is a lot.”

“The prison is on eastern outskirts of the city,” said another official. “The Taliban attacked that and hundreds of inmates were released. As far as I know many of them were criminals as political detainees were mostly transferred to Kabul in recent days.”

A Taliban spokesperson said that during the fight for the prison Afghan security forces had surrendered. “Kandahar central prison was conquered this afternoon after long-time siege,” he said. “Hundreds of inmates were released. Security personnel at the prison surrendered and gave them their ammunition.”

While western analysts and policymakers were already dubious about the ability of the Afghan security forces to withstand a fully fledged Taliban offensive, many had assumed the government could hold out for at least six months.

Retired general Joseph Votel, a former commander of US Central Command, said: “I‘m not surprised that the Taliban is putting a lot of pressure on the Afghan forces, particularly in the wake of our departure, and of most of the coalition forces as well. What I am surprised about is how quickly they are moving and seem to be consolidating.”

But with the Taliban claiming daily new advances, even the timescale of 90 days appears optimistic as the Afghan government – which the US has backed at a cost of $1tn over 20 years – appears to be collapsing in the face of the offensive.

The Taliban now control 65% of Afghanistan, senior EU officials say, and they have taken, or threatened to take, 11 provincial capitals.

US defence and intelligence officials, quoted anonymously in several media outlets on Wednesday, said the new assessment of how long Kabul could stand was due to the rapid gains the Taliban had made.

“But this is not a foregone conclusion,” one official told Reuters, adding that the Afghan security forces could reverse the momentum by putting up more resistance.

The dire predictions came as Faizabad, the provincial capital of the northern Badakhshan province, fell hours after the Taliban’s capture on Tuesday of Pul-e-Khumri, capital of the northern province of Baghlan, where Afghan security forces retreated toward the Kelagi desert.

After the latest catastrophic news from the battlefield, an official suggested that the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, had replaced his army chief of staff.

“Afghan leaders have to come together,” Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday night, saying Afghan troops outnumbered the Taliban. “They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation.”

With the reported fall of Faizabad, the Taliban have captured most of the country’s biggest northern cities, with Mazar-i-Sharif and Maymana remaining outside their control. Taliban forces are already attacking Maymana and claim to have entered the city of Gardiz, provincial capital of Paktia province.

The Afghan government and military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the latest military setbacks.

However, on Wednesday Ghani went to Mazar-i-Sharif to seek the support of two warlords there to push back against the Taliban advance. Hours before he arrived, pictures posted on official government social media accounts showed the notorious warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum boarding a plane in Kabul for Mazar along with a contingent of commandos. “I’m going to [the north] to defeat the enemy,” Dostum said.

The speed and consequence of the collapse of Afghan government forces was underlined in reports, initially in the Washington Post, quoting unnamed US officials, which raised the spectre of a complete collapse of the Afghan government.

“Everything is moving in the wrong direction,” one source told the paper.

Biden said he did not regret his decision to withdraw troops from the country, noting Washington had spent more than $1tn over 20 years and lost thousands of troops.

Ghani said he was seeking help from regional militias, with whom he has squabbled for years. He appealed to civilians to defend Afghanistan’s “democratic fabric”.

The loss of Afghanistan’s northern cities is doubly significant, as for years the north was Afghanistan’s most peaceful region, with only a minimal Taliban presence. The militants’ strategy appears to be to take the north, and border crossings in the north, west and south, then close in on Kabul.

The government’s tactic of withdrawing from hard-to-defend rural districts to focus on holding population centres appears to have backfired as the Taliban have moved quickly to surround cities.

The significance of the capture of Faizabad will not be lost on Afghans, as it was a city the Taliban could not capture during their rule in the 1990s when they had control of more than 90% of the country’s territory.

“The city has been surrounded by the Taliban for more than a month,” a senior official in the city said by phone. “In the past week they attacked the city twice. Last night they advanced from four directions and the city fell at 11 pm. They’ve overrun the city and all of Badakhshan province.”

A resident of the city said: “The situation is calm now but there were some clashes during the night. There are not many people on the streets, and many are hiding in their homes.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ethiopian government forces have been systematically raping and abusing hundreds of women and girls in the current conflict in Tigray, according to a new report from Amnesty International.

Adding to a growing body of evidence that rape is being used as a weapon of war in the northern region of Ethiopia, Amnesty’s research offers a snapshot of the extent of the crimes in an area where communications with the outside world have been deliberately restricted by federal authorities.

The report comes as Ethiopia’s government this week called on “all capable Ethiopians” to join the military to stop resurgent forces from the Tigray region “once and for all”, in an apparent abandonment of its unilateral ceasefire in June.

The war in Africa’s second-most populous country has risked destabilising the Horn of Africa region since it broke out in November, when the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, a Nobel peace laureate, declared war on the regional government, controlled by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which had ruled Ethiopia for almost 30 years.

The report, based on the accounts of 63 Tigrayan women and medical professionals, details how women have been routinely subjected to mutilation, gang rape, sexual slavery and other forms of torture by members of Ethiopia’s army, the Ethiopian National Defence Force; the Eritrean Defence Forces, which are allied to Ahmed’s government; and Amharan militia fighters as the Tigray conflict continues, said Amnesty.

The presence of Eritrean troops, and an Amharan militia group called Fano, fighting against the TPLF forces, has caused outrage and brought international sanctions. According to researchers at Belgium’s University of Ghent, there have been at least 10,000 reported deaths and 230 massacres. Thousands have suffered horrific abuses, according to the UN.

Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said: “The severity and scale of the sexual crimes committed are particularly shocking, amounting to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. It makes a mockery of the central tenets of humanity.

“It’s clear that rape and sexual violence have been used as a weapon of war to inflict lasting physical and psychological damage on women and girls in Tigray. Hundreds have been subjected to brutal treatment aimed at degrading and dehumanising them.”

She said the Ethiopian government must take immediate action and called on the African Union and UN to bring an end to the conflict.

Rights groups and aid organisations, whose activities have been restricted, must be granted access, she added.

Twelve of the women interviewed by Amnesty said they had been raped by soldiers in front of their family members, including children. Five of the women were pregnant at the time.

In one account, a 20-year-old woman, referred to as Lena*, told Amnesty she was attacked in her home in November last year. Three armed men who spoke Amharic and wore a mixture of military uniforms and civilian clothing raped and threatened to kill her, she said.

“I did not scream; they gestured to me not to make any noise or they would kill me. They raped me one after the other … I was four months pregnant. I don’t know if they realised I was pregnant – I don’t know if they realised I was a person,” she told Amnesty.

A 35-year-old mother with two children, referred to as Nigist*, said she and four other women were raped by Eritrean soldiers in Sheraro on 21 November.

“Three of them raped me in front of my child. There was an eight-months pregnant lady with us, they raped her too,” she said. “They raped the women and slaughtered the men.”

Amnesty said Tigrayan health facilities recorded 1,288 cases of gender-based violence between February and April. Many of the women interviewed for the report said they had not visited clinics.

In May, a nun in Tigray told the Guardian that rape by security forces was occurring daily.

“Rape is starting at the age of 8 and to the age of 72,” she said. “It is so widespread, I go on seeing it everywhere, thousands. This rape is in public, in front of family, husbands, in front of everyone. Their legs and their hands are cut, all in the same way.”

TPLF forces have also been accused of potential war crimes during a conflict where historic and ethnic divisions have intensified. Ahmed has repeatedly said that any crimes would be investigated.

Despite Ethiopia announcing early victories, it was forced to declare a ceasefire in June as resurgent Tigrayan forces retook much of the region. TPLF forces have since marched on the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions. Ethiopia’s government has vowed to summon its “entire defensive capability” against Tigray.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Prince Andrew cannot hide behind his wealth and power from allegations he sexually abused a child, a lawyer for his accuser has said, warning the duke that he risks a “default judgment” if he ignores the civil case brought against him in the US.

David Boies, representing Virginia Giuffre, has said he and his client have tried everything they can to resolve the matter after alleging that the Duke of York had sex with her while she was 17 – knowing she had been trafficked by his former friend, the disgraced former financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Boies said people “ignore the courts at your peril”, adding: “It would be very ill-advised for Prince Andrew to ignore judicial process.”

He told the BBC: “If he does, it will be a default judgment against him that will be, in effect, enforced not only in the United States, but in virtually every civilised country in the world.”

Boies added that his client wanted to send a message to rich and powerful men that the behaviour in which she accuses Andrew of engaging was “not acceptable and that you cannot hide behind wealth and power and palace walls”.

And, in an interview with Channel 4 News, he said his client expected “vindication”, adding: “Her hope is calling the rich and powerful abusers to account will have some effect on reducing the chance that other young girls will suffer what she suffered.”

Boies said Giuffre wanted compensation for damage she said was done to her – and to donate money to a charity to help sex-trafficking survivors.

Andrew is named as the sole defendant in a civil suit filed at a New York federal court under the state’s Child Victims Act. Giuffre claims she was “lent out for sexual purposes” by Epstein – including while she was a minor under US law. The document also frequently mentions Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.

It is alleged that Giuffre, then known as Virginia Roberts, was sexually abused at Maxwell’s London home and Epstein’s homes in New York and the Caribbean.

Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges and faces trial in November. Epstein took his own life in a US federal jail in August 2019, a month after he was arrested on the same charges.

The duke is accused of engaging in the sexual acts without Giuffre’s consent, while aware of her age and while “knowing that she was a sex-trafficking victim”.

Boies told Channel 4 News: “The evidence in terms of what [Andrew] knew about Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation is something that obviously will be for the jury to decide. I think that everybody who was closely associated with Jeffrey Epstein knew that he had these young girls, these young women who he was trafficking.”

Andrew’s representatives declined to comment on Wednesday. Speaking about Giuffre’s allegations in 2019, the duke said he could not remember meeting her.

In a later statement, he said: “I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure … Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Justin Trudeau has condemned as “absolutely unacceptable and unjust” China’s jailing of Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor for 11 years on charges of spying.

Canada’s prime minister said: “The verdict for Mr Spavor comes after more than two-and-a-half years of arbitrary detention, a lack of transparency in the legal process, and a trial that did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law.”

The verdict, delivered by a court in Dandong on Wednesday morning, comes as Beijing steps up pressure ahead of a Canadian court ruling on whether to hand over Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou to face US criminal charges.

Spavor’s arrest in 2018 came just days after Meng’s arrest in Canada in connection with possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran, drawing accusations by critics of “hostage diplomacy”.

Spavor, and fellow Canadian Michael Kovrig, have spent 975 days in detention, and were tried separately in secret earlier this year. In March China’s state media tabloid, the Global Times, said Spavor – who lived near the North Korean border and arranged cultural exchanges – was accused of supplying intelligence to Kovrig, a former diplomat turned analyst for the International Crisis Group. Canadian authorities have said the charges are baseless.

On Wednesday, the court in Dandong announced Spavor had been found guilty of spying and illegally providing state secrets to other countries. He was sentenced to 11 years in jail, confiscation of personal property, and fined 50,000 yuan ($7,715), according to a statement by the Liaoning Dandong intermediate people’s court.

Canadian ambassador Dominic Barton said he was disappointed with the long sentence. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this [decision] which was rendered without due process or transparency.”

Barton said he was able to have a consular visit with Spavor, who thanked his supporters and said he was in good spirits but wanted to get home.

The court had also ordered Spavor be deported but it was not clear when this would occur. Barton told the media they had interpreted the judgment to mean deportation after the sentence, but “hopefully there is a way for him to get home a little earlier”.

Beijing-based lawyer Mo Shaoping told Reuters that deportation generally takes place after the person has finished serving the sentence but may happen earlier for special cases.

Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at the University of Ottawa’s graduate school of public and international affairs, said there was precedent in a similar 2014 case, in which Canadian couple Kevin and Julia Garratt were detained, charged and sentenced in China after Canada extradited Su Bin, a suspected spy, to the US. They were released and deported in 2017 soon after Su cut a deal in the US.

“[Spavor’s case] may be a signal that the Chinese are willing to deport him at whatever time the Canadian government creates the right conditions for him to leave – in other words Meng being released to return to China,” she said.

Spavor has two weeks to appeal against the ruling, but China’s notoriously opaque justice system rarely grants appeals and routinely posts conviction rates of more than 99.9%.

Spavor’s family have maintained he was innocent of the accusations against him, saying he had done much as a businessman to “build constructive ties” between Canada, China and North Korea.

Separately on Tuesday, a court rejected the appeal of a third Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, whose prison term in a drug case was abruptly increased to death after the executive’s arrest. Canada’s foreign ministry condemned that verdict, which it labelled a “cruel and inhumane punishment”. The statement prompted a rebuke from China’s embassy in Canada that it had violated China’s judicial sovereignty.

All three cases are suspected to be linked to the ongoing extradition hearing in Canada, where Meng and her lawyers have made their case to a judge that her extradition should be tossed out. In the coming days, the Canadian government will argue that the extradition should proceed.

Western governments have accused China of engaging in “hostage diplomacy” by arresting citizens and linking their fates to bilateral disagreements or, in Canada’s case, legal action against Chinese nationals. Diplomats from dozens of countries gathered at Canada’s embassy in Beijing on Wednesday to hear the Spavor verdict, in a show of solidarity with Canada.

Beijing denies its prosecution of Schellenberg, Spavor and Kovrig are retaliation for Meng’s arrest. Trudeau, has previously said the charges against Spavor and Kovrig were “trumped-up” and that Chinese officials were “very clear” the cases were connected.

Canada and other governments including Australia and the Philippines face growing pressure from China in disputes over human rights, coronavirus and territorial claims. Washington has warned Americans they face “a heightened risk of arbitrary detention” in China for reasons other than to enforce the law.

“It’s hard to know whether or not China actually believes that we have a legal system that is separate from government interference. I genuinely don’t know if they appreciate that reality,” said Stephanie Carvin, a professor of international relations at Carleton university. “But the fact is, there’s no coincidence that these verdicts are happening this week.”

While Spavor’s sentencing has been condemned by Canadian officials and allies, it nonetheless represents movement in the case. “There is the thinnest of silver linings; as the legal processes march towards some kind of conclusion, we do move towards more of an endgame,” said Carvin.

She also pointed to the Garratt case, noting it wasn’t until the whole process was complete that China released the Garratt family.

“While there are elements of similarity in the cases, I do worry that China of 2015 isn’t the China of today. We’ve seen a far more aggressive foreign policy and security policy coming out of the country,” Carvin said.

That aggression – and a series of frosty meetings between US and Chinese officials – has dampened hopes that a deal between the two nations could be imminent.

At the same time, legal experts have previously said Meng’s case could take nearly a decade if she pursues appeals all the way to Canada’s supreme court.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Walter Yetnikoff, the record label executive who championed the career of Michael Jackson and others, has died aged 87 due to bladder cancer.

As president of CBS Records, Yetnikoff oversaw hits such as Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, Pink Floyd’s The Wall, Barbra Streisand’s Guilty – her biggest-selling album – and “Weird Al” Yankovic’s phenomenally successful comedy records.

But it was his stewardship of Michael Jackson that generated the biggest success, after he – initially reluctantly – oversaw the signing of the Jackson 5 from Motown Records in 1975. Yetnikoff allowed Michael to start recording his own music, leading to a string of hit solo albums including the biggest-selling album of all time, Thriller.

Yetnikoff lobbied for the single Billie Jean to be played on MTV, threatening to pull the rest of his roster from the channel if they didn’t accede. The Jackson estate has paid tribute to his efforts after his death, writing: “It is difficult today to imagine the level of cultural apartheid at the music channels in 1983 … Yetnikoff was ferocious on Michael’s behalf and didn’t hesitate to play corporate chicken with the powerful music channel. In short order, Billie Jean was added to MTV in heavy rotation, opening the flood gates for Michael’s extraordinary success and also for a whole generation of black artists. Walter forced that to happen, and with that decision, the wall came tumbling down.”

At the 1984 Grammy awards, Jackson hailed Yetnikoff as “the best president of any record company”.

Born in Brooklyn in 1933, Yetnikoff studied law at university and joined CBS as a lawyer in 1962, having served in the US army in the mid-1950s. He rose through the ranks, becoming president of the label’s international arm in 1971 and president and chief executive of the whole company in 1975.

Known as a relationship manager more than a seeker of new talent, he developed stars including Cyndi Lauper and Gloria Estefan, and signed Paul McCartney, who he paired with Jackson and Stevie Wonder for hit duets. Other key albums during his tenure included Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell, and a string of hits with Billy Joel.

He assisted in the $2bn sale of CBS to Sony in 1988, but left in 1990 amid a dispute with executive Tommy Mottola, and struggles with depression and addiction. Having emerged unscathed from a payola scandal at CBS in the mid-1980s, Yetnikoff later wrote in his 2004 memoir: “I might have been middle-aged, but I adopted the youthful battle cry of more sex, drugs and rock’n’roll. I wanted more of everything, and I wanted it with a vengeance.” He entered rehab in 1989.

Later ventures, including his own label Velvel, did not match his CBS success, and an attempt to produce a Miles Davis biopic starring Wesley Snipes failed.

Yetnikoff was married three times, and had two sons with his first wife, June May Horowitz, called Michael and Daniel. They survive him along with his wife, Lynda.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Washington state man who was involved in an armed brawl at a contentious protest in downtown Portland over the weekend was also charged, along with his son, over his presence during the attack on the Capitol in Washington DC on 6 January.

Jeffrey Grace’s ongoing participation in far-right street politics since January – which has included trips to the southern border – indicates that widespread charges against those involved in the Capitol attack have not deterred at least some militant pro-Trump supporters from further direct actions.

Grace, 62, of Battle Ground in south-west Washington, was captured by a photographer at the scene of the clash, which involved antifascists on one hand, and on the other armed rightwing demonstrators.

Some of thedemonstrators appeared to be members of the Proud Boys, which is designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and is banned as a terrorist group in Canada.

The rightwingers, including Grace, had assembled in defense of a religious service led by Artur Pawlowski, a Polish-Canadian preacher whose events have long attracted antifascist counterprotests in Canada and abroad.

Saturday’s service was reportedly disrupted by antifascists, which led to street fighting involving pepper spray, paintball guns, batons and other weapons. One of the far- right group was captured by a reporter on camera brandishing a long gun in the streets.

Grace was captured leaving the scene of the brawl in the back of a truck, holding a baton.

The next morning on his Instagram account, he admitted that “I went down in support of a pastor’s right to speak”, and that “we did perimeter security”.

At another point in the video, Grace said “people say you can’t fight Antifa with these”, held up his fists, and continued “well, guess what, you can”.

Grace uses his social media channels to promote his web store, where he sells merchandise including T-shirts featuring images of the Capitol over the slogan “OUR HOUSE”.

Federal charging documents alleged that federal agents found in the trash folder of Grace’s cellphone “a “selfie-style” video that depicts him and an individual believed to be his son Jeremy outside the USCapitol building, both repeatedly saying: “Our house”.

In local media interviews, Grace has admitted to the central charge in the document: that he unlawfully entered the Capitol building. Grace did not respond to several Guardian attempts to contact him.

Pawlowski, the preacher, has attracted significant controversy in his home province of Alberta after adopting a range of far-right political positions. He once attributed Alberta floods to divine displeasure over homosexuality and he has participated in tiki torch anti-lockdown rallies in Calgary.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Thai government has been forced by a court injunction to rescind an order banning news that “causes public fear”, as it faces growing protests over its handling of the Covid pandemic.

The government, which had sought to restrict news that causes public fear, even if it is true, had been accused by journalists and human rights groups of trying to prevent negative reporting and silence critics. The civil court issued an injunction against the regulation last week and it was revoked on Tuesday.

Thai officials are facing increasing public anger over their response to a recent wave of Covid-19, including over the country’s slow vaccination campaign. Protesters took to the streets over the weekend and again on Tuesday, with police firing rubber bullets, teargas and water cannon to disperse them.

Thousands had gathered for Tuesday’s “car mob” protest in Bangkok, where they drove cars and motorbikes through the city, stopping at buildings associated with government figures to condemn their management of the pandemic. Organisers believed the style of protest would reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading.

Gatherings of more than five people are banned, and a 9pm curfew is in place in Bangkok and many other provinces.

Police said demonstrators had violated emergency laws by holding a rally, and that nine officers were injured when clashes broke out, including one officer who was shot in the leg. Two police booths were also set alight, police said. A total of 48 people were detained, and more than 100 motorbikes were impounded.

It is not clear how many protesters were injured.

Prior to Tuesday’s rally, police detained several key activists who led mass protests last year calling for reform of the monarchy – an institution protected by a draconian lese majesty law and which has long been considered beyond criticism. Among those arrested were Parit Chiwarak, who is known by the nickname Penguin, Panupon Jadnok, known as Mike Rayong, Jatupat Boonpattararaksa, known as Pai, and Anon Nampa.

Anti-establishment protests had fallen in number since 2020, partly due to fatigue among demonstrators and fresh outbreaks of Covid-19. However, the latest wave of infections, which began in April and is the most severe Thailand has experienced since the start of the pandemic, has fuelled fresh public anger. Celebrities and even former supporters of the government have criticised its sluggish vaccination campaign. About 6% of the population is fully vaccinated.

The outbreak, driven by the Delta variant, has led to more than 6,500 deaths and has put hospitals under severe pressure.

A further protest has been called for Wednesday. Kissana Phathanacharoen, a deputy spokesman for the Royal Thai Police, said legal action would be taken against people who took part in violent incidents on Tuesday, as well as “fake news producers and those who share false information”.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@China will establish a blacklist of karaoke songs to ban those containing “illegal content” from karaoke venues across the country starting from 1 October, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.

The ministry said banned content would include that which endangers national unity, sovereignty or territorial integrity, violates state religious policies by propagating cults or superstitions, or which encourages illegal activities such as gambling and drugs.

Content providers to karaoke venues will be responsible for auditing the songs, the ministry said on its website on Tuesday, adding that China has nearly 50,000 entertainment outlets with a basic music library of more than 100,000 songs, making it difficult for venue operators to identify illegal tracks.

The ministry said it encouraged content providers to supply “healthy and uplifting” music to these venues.

China heavily regulates and scrubs content that includes violence, pornography, or politically sensitive commentary from social media and websites and has in recent months punished livestreaming to video platforms for hosting content it deems “low taste”.

Although extremely rare, a blood clot syndrome after the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine carries a high risk of death and can occur in otherwise young and healthy people, UK researchers have found.

In those aged under 50, blood clots occur in around one in 50,000 people who have received the vaccine, data suggests.

Researchers examined the symptoms, signs and outcomes in 220 confirmed and probable cases who presented in UK hospitals between 22 March and 6 June.

“It’s important to stress that this kind of reaction to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is very rare,” said Dr Sue Pavord, consultant haematologist at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead author of the analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

But for those who do develop blood clots, the results “can be devastating,” she added. “It often affects young, otherwise healthy vaccine recipients and has high mortality. It is particularly dangerous when the patient has a low platelet count and bleeding in the brain.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Chinese state media articles quoting a Swiss biologist accusing the US of politicising Covid origin investigations have been quietly deleted, after the Swiss government said no such person exists.

On 24 July, a Facebook post by an account named Wilson Edwards claimed to have witnessed or learned of US efforts to politicise the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 investigations from within.

Edwards cited unnamed WHO sources and “fellow researchers” complaining of having endured “enormous pressure and even intimidation from the US side as well as certain media outlets”.

“The WHO sources told me the US is so obsessed with attacking China on the origin-tracing issue that it is reluctant to open its eyes to the data and findings.”

The Facebook post was picked up widely by Chinese state media, including the Global Times, the People’s Daily – which headlined its story as “US attempts to overturn report, leveraging WHO into political tool” – China Daily, and CGTN in multiple languages.

Edwards’ growing fame caught the eye of the Swiss embassy, prompting staff to search citizen records and academic publications for any mention of him. On Tuesday, it posted to Twitter: “Looking for Wilson Edwards, alleged [Swiss] biologist, cited in press and social media in China over the last several days. If you exist, we would like to meet you!” it said.

“But it is more likely that this is a [sic] fake news, and we call on the Chinese press and netizens to take down the posts.”

An attached statement said the Chinese reports were false, and there was no registered Swiss citizen named Wilson Edwards, or any academic articles in the biology field under his name.

On Wednesday, Chinese state media articles began disappearing from the internet, including from the Global Times and CGTN. The Wilson Edwards Facebook account – which was created on the same day it published its only post, with a profile photo of a library at Oxford University, and had just three friends – also appeared to have been deleted.

Facebook posts by the People’s Daily and at least one China Daily article remained live on Wednesday afternoon.

The origins of the Covid-19 virus, which are still unknown, have become a key point of hostility between China and other countries – in particular the US.

China has consistently rejected theories and accusations that the virus may have come from a lab leak in Wuhan. An investigation in January by a joint China-WHO team – which was criticised for lacking transparency and access amid claims the investigators were not given the data they requested – determined that the lab leak theory was less likely than other scenarios but did not rule it out.

The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, later said the push to discount the theory had been “premature” but China seized on the finding. It has since refused to cooperate with a WHO proposal to further explore the possibility and to audit Chinese labs as part of the investigation’s next phase. Instead, foreign ministry officials and state media have heavily pushed unevidenced theories that the virus leaked from a US facility.

The Guardian has contacted the Chinese outlets for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Reaching herd immunity is “not a possibility” with the current Delta variant, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group has said.

Giving evidence to MPs on Tuesday, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard said the fact that vaccines did not stop the spread of Covid meant reaching the threshold for overall immunity in the population was “mythical”.

“The problem with this virus is [it is] not measles. If 95% of people were vaccinated against measles, the virus cannot transmit in the population,” he told the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on coronavirus.

“The Delta variant will still infect people who have been vaccinated. And that does mean that anyone who’s still unvaccinated at some point will meet the virus … and we don’t have anything that will [completely] stop that transmission.”

Although the existing vaccines are very effective at preventing serious Covid illness and death, they do not stop a fully vaccinated person from being infected by the virus that causes Covid-19.

The concept of herd or population immunity relies on a large majority of a population gaining immunity – either through vaccination or previous infection – which, in turn, provides indirect protection from an infectious disease for the unvaccinated and those who have never been previously infected.

Data from a recent React study conducted by Imperial College London suggests that fully vaccinated people aged 18 to 64 have about a 49% lower risk of being infected compared with unvaccinated people. The findings also indicated that fully vaccinated people were about half as likely to test positive after coming into contact with someone who had Covid (3.84%, down from 7.23%).

About 75% of all UK adults have now received both their jabs.

The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Tuesday that plans were in place to start offering Covid booster jabs to the most vulnerable groups in the UK from next month. He said that the flu jab would be offered at the same time.

But Pollard – who chairs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) but is not specifically a member of the Covid JCVI committee – questioned whether boosters would be needed.

“The time we would need to boost is if we see evidence that there was an increase in hospitalisation – or the next stage after that, which would be people dying – amongst those who are vaccinated. And that is not something we are seeing at the moment,” he said.

Even if vaccine-induced antibody levels waned, our immune systems would probably remember the vaccination for decades and offer a degree of protection if exposed to the virus, he said. “So, there isn’t any reason at this moment to panic. We’re not seeing a problem with breakthrough severe disease.”

The question of whether or not to vaccinate under-16s, as countries including the US, Ireland and Israel have done, has also provoked scientific debate in the UK.

The JCVI has recommended only vulnerable children aged 12 to 15 be vaccinated, and those who live with at-risk adults. Some critics have said that rich countries with high adult vaccine coverage, such as the UK, should not be hoarding doses for children but should donate those doses to poor countries, many of which have barely vaccinated any of their most at-risk populations.

But Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out that the only vaccine authorised for use in children aged 12 to 15 in the UK was the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

“I think actually the real issue is not about vaccinating kids versus the world – it’s what do we do about boosters that is being discussed in rich countries, because those are the doses that could be going abroad,” she said.

“Luckily … we have a very effective vaccine in AstraZeneca that can be used for the world, but it’s not going to solve our children issue here.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The head of a phoney church who is in jail in Colombia awaiting extradition to the US to face trial for selling bleach fluids as a “miracle cure” for Covid-19 is continuing to tout the potentially fatal products from his prison cell through social media and text messages.

The Guardian has learned that Mark Grenon, who calls himself the “archbishop” of the Genesis II “church”, is distributing bleach to at least 75 other prisoners in La Picota penitentiary in Bogotá, where he is being held captive. He has revealed that he is obtaining the product through secret channels and that the chemicals are in plentiful supply in the jail.

“You can’t get it on the outside, but we got it on the inside,” he said in a phone call, a recording of which has been heard by the Guardian. He added that more than 75 prisoners were taking the “cure” as a remedy for a range of ailments including diabetes and gastritis.

Grenon appears to have use of a clandestine phone, which allows him to remain in full contact with the outside world and on the internet despite the fact that he is facing serious criminal charges in the US relating to his bleach-peddling activities. He regularly advocates for bleach as a miracle cure from his prison cell using private pages on Facebook and the mobile messaging app Telegram.

Grenon and three of his sons were indicted by a grand jury in Miami in April. They face potentially long prison sentences for fraudulently marketing and selling a product they call MMS or “Miracle Mineral Solution”, which they say is a miracle cure for Covid, cancer, malaria and many other illnesses.

In fact, the chemicals are routinely used as bleach in textile and other industrial processes.

Grenon’s son Joseph is being held with him at La Picota. The two other sons, Jonathan and Jordan, are in jail in Miami awaiting trial scheduled for March.

The US Food and Drug Administration has been attempting over the past several months to clamp down on illegal sales of bleach products as miracle cures. The agency has issued stern warnings that the chemicals can be fatal when consumed.

The FDA describes MMS as a “powerful bleach typically used for industrial water treatment or bleaching textiles, pulp and paper”. The agency says imbibing it can cause diarrhea and severe vomiting that can in turn depress blood pressure with life-threatening consequences.

Fiona O’Leary, a campaigner against medical misinformation, said that Grenon’s on-going activities from prison were a cause for great concern. “The man is bleaching other prisoners and continuing to push bleach to parents with young children. He is endangering young lives.”

Among Grenon’s recent private posts on Facebook is one in which he complains about his treatment at the hands of the FDA. “What would you do if this happened to you?” he wrote. “Kidnapped by the justice system to silence you from helping people to be healthy.”

Despite his incarceration, Grenon remains a powerhouse of medical misinformation. He circulates anti-vaxxer videos attempting to dissuade people from getting vaccinated against Covid.

He also continues to encourage parents of children as young as six who have been infected with Covid to give their kids baths in bleach solution and to make them swallow bleach powder in capsule form as a purported remedy for the illness.

“Children do pretty good,” he said in one exchange with a parent of a six-year-old. “Give the child two or three drops [of bleach] every couple of hours.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ministers have started ordering vaccines for a booster campaign in autumn 2022, with Pfizer reportedly being asked to supply the UK with a further 35m doses.

The government has still not give the final go-ahead for the vaccine booster programme expected this autumn, but it is understood to have placed the order with Pfizer despite the company raising its prices.

According to a report in the Times (paywall), the government is paying £22 a dose – compared with an earlier price of £18 a dose – because global demand is pushing up prices. The EU has signed a contract with Pfizer to buy 900m doses, with an option to buy the same amount again.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not deny the story on Wednesday. It said it did not comment on commercial vaccine supply arrangements, but it also said it was confident it would have enough vaccine to “support potential booster programmes in the future”.

Sajid Javid, the health secretary, confirmed this week that he expected this year’s vaccine booster programme to start “in early September”. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has not yet given its final advice, but in an interim recommendation in June it said that, if boosters were offered, they should go to the over-50s, other at-risk adults, and adults living with people who are immunosuppressed.

There are more than 30 million people in these groups and, if the full booster programme goes ahead, they are expected to be offered mostly Pfizer or Moderna jabs. Most over-40s have been already been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, and there is some evidence that a “mix and match” approach to top-up vaccines may be more effective.

A DHSC spokesperson said: “We have secured access to more than 500m doses of Covid-19 vaccines and we are confident our supply will support potential booster programmes in the future. The potential booster programme will be based on the final advice of the independent JCVI.”

Although there appears to be broad public support for a vaccine booster programme, within the scientific community there are doubts whether it is needed, or whether it can be justified in the light of the very low vaccination rates in the developing world.

On Wednesday, Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the JCVI, told BBC Breakfast that although some immunosuppressed people would almost certainly need a booster this autumn, there was still some doubt as to whether all over-50s would need to be included in the programme.

“We need to review evidence as to whether people who receive vaccines early on in the programme are in any serious risk of getting serious disease and whether the protection they’ve got from those first two doses is still strong,” he said. “We clearly don’t want to be giving vaccines to people that don’t need them.”

On Tuesday, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group that developed the AstraZeneca jab, told MPs a booster programme would be needed if the protection provided by vaccines started to wane, and that so far the evidence did not show this was happening.

He also said having a booster programme in the UK could result in fewer vaccines being available for the developing world. He said that for people in Britain to be getting three doses, while people in many parts of the world had not had one, would highlight “a moral failure”.

He continued: “There’s also the messaging, because that says to other countries, ‘well if the UK needs three doses, we need three doses’. And so that has a huge implication for sucking even more doses out of the system.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Facebook has removed hundreds of accounts linked to a mysterious advertising agency operating from Russia that sought to pay social media influencers to smear Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

A network of 65 Facebook accounts and 243 Instagram accounts was traced back to Fazze, an advertising and marketing firm working on behalf of an unknown client.

The network used fake accounts to spread misleading claims that disparaged the safety of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. One claimed AstraZeneca’s shot would turn a person into a chimpanzee. The accounts targeted audiences in India, Latin America and, to a lesser extent, the US, using several social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.

Russia has been actively marketing its Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, abroad in what some analysts see as an effort to score geopolitical points. Facebook representatives did not speculate on the possible motivation behind the smear campaign.

The Fazze network also contacted social media influencers in several countries with offers to pay them for reposting the misleading content. That ploy backfired when influencers in Germany and France exposed the network’s offer. Along with removing the network’s accounts, Facebook also banned Fazze from its platforms. Messages seeking comment from the company were not immediately returned on Tuesday.

Fazze’s effort did not get much traction online, with some posts failing to get even a single response. But, while the campaign may have wilted, it is noteworthy because of its effort to enlist social media influencers, according to Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy.

“Although it was sloppy and didn’t have very good reach, it was an elaborate setup,” Gleicher said on a conference call announcing Tuesday’s actions.

As social media companies have improved their ability to spot and remove fake accounts, disinformation campaigns have had to adjust. Paying social media influencers to repost their content provides the potential of exposure to the influencer’s audience, but there is the risk that influencers will refuse or, as happened in this case, call them out.

Facebook investigators say some influencers did post the material, but later deleted it when stories about Fazze’s work began to emerge.

The French YouTuber Léo Grasset was among those contacted by Fazze. He said in May he was asked to post a 45- to 60-second video on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube criticising the mortality rate of the Pfizer vaccine.

When Grasset asked Fazze to identify its client, the firm declined. Grasset refused the offer and went public with his concerns.

The offer from Fazze urged influencers not to mention that they were being paid, and also suggested they criticise the media’s reporting on vaccines.

“Too many red flags,” Grasset said. “I decided not to do it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Authorities in northern Germany have appealed to thousands of people to get another shot of Covid vaccine after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with a saline solution.

The nurse is suspected of injecting salt solution into people’s arms instead of genuine doses at a vaccination centre in Friesland – a rural district near the North Sea coast – in the early spring.

“I am totally shocked by this episode,” Sven Ambrosy, a local councillor, said on Facebook as local authorities issued the call on Tuesday to about 8,600 residents who may have been affected.

While saline solution is harmless, most people who got vaccinated in Germany in March and April when the suspected switch took place are elderly and at high risk of catching Covid.

Police investigator Peter Beer, speaking earlier at a news conference covered by German media, said that based on witness statements there was “a reasonable suspicion of danger”.

The motive of the nurse, who was not named, was not clear but she had aired sceptical views about vaccines in social media posts, police investigators said.

It was not immediately clear whether the suspect had been arrested or charged in the case, which according to broadcaster NDR has been handed to a special unit that investigates politically motivated crimes.

Local police declined to comment outside normal working hours.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Plastic bottles dominate waste in the ocean, with an estimated 1m of them reaching the sea every minute. The biggest culprit is polyethylene terephthalate (Pet) bottles.

Last month, a study found two bacteria capable of breaking down Pet – or, as the headlines put it, “eating plastic”. Known as Thioclava sp. BHET1 and Bacillus sp. BHET2, the bacteria were isolated in a laboratory – but they were discovered in the ocean.

The bacteria are the latest example of new organisms that appear to be growing in a unique environment: the vast amounts of plastic at sea.

Like the atmosphere, magnetosphere and hydrosphere, the plastisphere is a region. But it is also an ecosystem, like the Siberian steppe or coral reefs – a plasticised marine environment. The best-known concentration of seaborne plastic waste is the Great Pacific garbage patch, a sort of plastic soup spread over an area roughly twice the size of France, but plastic is everywhere.

First described in a 2013 study to refer to a collective of plastic-colonising organisms, including bacteria and fungi, the term has since expanded. It now loosely encompasses larger organisms, from crabs to jellyfish, which raft across oceans on marine plastics.

The term was coined by Linda Amaral-Zettler, a marine microbiologist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research.

“In 2010, we were planning to collect plastic samples for an upcoming cruise to characterise the biofilms [organisms that stick to each other and other things] on plastic,” says Amaral-Zettler. “I was trying to think of a convenient term to describe the community and came up with […] ‘plastisphere’.”

Although the term may be recent, the phenomenon is not. “The plastisphere has been around for as long as plastic has existed,” Amaral-Zettler says.

What is new is our understanding of just how complex an ecosystem the world of plastic can be. In the plastisphere there are organisms that photosynthesise; there are predators and prey; symbionts and parasites, allowing for “a full gamut of interactions possible, as in other ecosystems”, says Amaral-Zettler.

“If we take the definition of an ecosystem as ‘a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment’, then this is almost certainly true of the plastisphere,” says Robyn Wright, of the pharmacology department at Dalhousie University in Canada, and author of the June study.

Another unique feature of the plastisphere is that humans invented it. Every other ecosystem has evolved over millions of years. The meaning of that is not yet clear.

“I don’t think it’s necessarily important that it’s not natural in origin, because all of the members of the plastisphere are still ‘natural’, but it’s more an issue of scale,” Wright says. Unlike most naturally occurring materials, plastic is highly durable and persistent, allowing the growth and spread of attached organisms over a massive area.

Additionally, a study last year discovered that certain colours of plastic affected the diversity of the microbes colonising them: communities on blue microplastics had a richer diversity than those on yellow or transparent plastics.

There are also concerns about plastic-colonising organisms that can travel around the world. Amaral-Zettler’s 2013 study discovered Vibrio, a type of bacteria known to contain several species of pathogens, including some associated with gastroenteritis.

Though there is potential for the plastisphere to harbour pathogens, Wright is sceptical. “There isn’t really any concrete proof that plastics pose any more danger than any other surface that bacteria colonise, or any other area of the environment,” she says.

For the scientists, the plastisphere’s sheer presence is a less obvious concern than its potential health hazards. Most plastic ends up in landfill, but nearly a third of it ends up in the sea. The majority sinks, but a lot does not, becoming a home for all sorts of microbes that might not otherwise have a home.

The bacteria move in because when plastics are submerged in water they attract carbon, iron, nitrogen and phosphorus, which in turn attracts microbes. This is sometimes called the Zobell effect, after the marine microbiologist Claude E ZoBell.

[Microbes on] plastics are going to be the key place to look in the fight against plastic Robyn Wright, researcher

What happens then is largely unknown.

“At the moment that’s still very much an active area of research,” Wright says. There are two main fields of investigation: potential pathogens in the plastisphere, and the potential for some microbes to biodegrade hydrocarbons, such as the plastic-eaters identified last month.

Those are not unique to the ocean. In 2016, scientists in Japan discovered Ideonella sakaiensis, a species of bacteria at a rubbish tip that had evolved an enzyme that enabled it to eat plastic.

But another study in the same year found that, compared with bacteria in the surrounding waters, those in the plastisphere possessed an enriched collection of genes, suggesting that they had adapted for a “surface-attached lifestyle”.

Scientists caution that it’s important not to think of these as recent mutants.

“While plastics are a relatively new material on an evolutionary timescale, the chemicals that they’re made from aren’t new – mainly constituents of oil,” Wright says. “Bacteria have therefore had millions of years to develop mechanisms to degrade the chemicals that they’re made from.”

Could the plastisphere evolve in such a way that bacteria would essentially eat it, or at least help us identify ways to break down our plastic waste? “I’d definitely agree that [microbes on] plastics are going to be the key place to look in the fight against plastic,” says Wright.

But though Amaral-Zettler admits that some microbes can indeed feed off already UV-degraded plastic, she cautions against overstating the possibilities.

“It is important to realise that studies that look at plastic-‘eating’ bacteria only provide these bacteria with a single source of carbon,” she says. “This is in contrast to what is found in nature.”

Lab studies also do not take into account oceanic conditions, explains Wright, such as different temperatures, weather or the presence of other organisms. “But,” she adds, “even just knowing that this is theoretically possible is a really great step in the right direction.”

Just like our own gastrointestinal microbiome, which is massively important to our overall health, the plastisphere’s microbiome also has “an important role to play”, says Amaral-Zettler. Since we have modified our planet to the extent that these microbes have evolved to fit our plasticised oceans, understanding the new ecosystem we seem to have accidentally created is crucial.

“For better or for worse, like plastic,” she says, “the plastisphere is here to stay.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@They call the Soča the emerald river. To my eyes it’s turquoise, or sometimes a shocking shade of sapphire. Or like crushed crystal, coaxed into flow. Either way, it’s irresistible. Our trail runs by it and, step after step, our heads are made motionless by those blue-green waters.

I’m in Slovenia but I’m not anywhere easily found on a map. Here, at the far east of the Julian Alps, is a land of water and woods. Half the country is forested, but the part we’re walking through is especially remote. Triglav national park is one of Europe’s oldest. In the middle sits the eponymous Triglav, Slovenia’s tallest mountain, spiritual summit of the nation’s fables and myths.

However, this ancient woodland has had a contemporary twist. As tourists poured into Slovenia over the past decade, encouraged by word-of-mouth news about its uncommon beauty, it was to Triglav they flowed. So, in 2019, the Slovenians designed the Juliana Trail, a route covering 270km, split into 16 stages on a circuit around Triglav.

That was all pre-Covid. After the country won a series of awards – Hottest Destination in the World 2019, National Geographic’s gong for most sustainable tourism in 2017 – managing the tourists attracted by such publicity became paramount. The pandemic paused the tourism, but only temporarily. And given that Covid has only further roused the appetite for immersive experiences in unspoiled forests and pristine lakes, Slovenia’s plan to protect its natural riches is proving invaluable.

“We asked ourselves, ‘How can we host our guests sustainably?’’’ says Grega Šilc, my guide. “The Juliana Trail spreads tourists more evenly, showing them paths they never see. And it takes them to villages that rarely get visitors, which helps the locals.” Born and raised in the park, Grega has that unfailing cheerfulness you often see in people who spend their days immersed in nature.

It’s 7am on our first day, and Goreljek meadow, the starting point of stage six, is submerged in mist. Ahead lies 22km through valley and woodland. Grega leads me and my photographer through pine-fresh forest, past fairytale-like chalets with gables as broad as summer hats and piles of firewood beneath their rims, each hut bearing a name and insignia like a boy scout. Mushroom hunters drift between the trees, backs stooped to gather them in.

My calves are tight, my bare arms sore from sunlight, but my mind is clear and bright and free

Soon we break free of the forest and into a valley. The mist lifts, and in the folds of the meadow we see cows chewing the glistening alpine grass.

“Only one has a cowbell,” Grega says, “and it’s the cow who knows the area best.”

Ancestral wisdom runs through Triglav like a river. As we descend into the Bohinj valley, we witness villagers engaged in autumnal rituals. An old man pours apples into a barrel, ready for homemade schnapps. A woman drapes hay on to a traditional hayrack barn called a kozolek. “Dober dan,” they call, good day.

After we break for lunch. Grega takes us atop a steep promontory where we feast like eagles in a nest, gulping spring water until it trickles down our chins. Then we take our fill of the view: mountains look like houses and houses like pebbles.

“That’s Stara Fužina,” Grega says, pointing. “It has 400 inhabitants. And tonight, it will have 402.”

Now we’re descending, tumbling down steep slopes with the uncertain tread of foals, following Grega’s chestnut locks through sunshine and shadow. The talk stops and starts, then stops for what must be two hours. They say that to walk is to heal. One foot goes in front of the other, and the motion carries you out of the ceaseless, self-centred thoughts and into your body. Your only mission is to keep walking until you reach your bed. As the afternoon light grows dense and syrupy, sleepy Stara Fužina rises before us. My calves are tight, my bare arms sore from sunlight, but my mind is clear and bright and free.

Great rows of pine and spruce shield us from the sun, and we make light work of the mountainside

We stay at Majerca, a family-run hotel in the hamlet with an alpine-facing terrace. My phone says I’ve walked 30,000 steps, which is corroborated by my appetite at dinner. Our meal is an edible simile of the valley we’ve spent the day walking: truffles, mushrooms, juice from neighbouring farms, pork in cider sauce, and wines from vineyards within walking distance (well, for hikers at least). Our waitress pours us Bovec schnapps, reciting the recipe: gather armfuls of pine needles that are not quite green, not yet dead, and stick them in a jar for 40 days and 40 nights. I tumble into bed, my body, mind and soul sated.

“First stop, the village of Ribčev Laz,” Grega announces in the morning, bright-eyed and loose-limbed, “on the shores of Lake Bohinj.”

At either side of the lake, two peaks shed their garlands of mist revealing rugged shoulders and perilous contours, ribbons of vapour trailing around them. Within minutes, the valley lights up, and whatever breath I have left from the early-morning trot is taken from me. A bone-white medieval church overlooks a statue of the Four Brave Men, dedicated to the team who first summited Triglav. The lawns of the hamlet are bursting with the crimson and tangerine of late-summer blooms.

A coffee in the square, then we’re climbing more than 1,000 vertical metres, out of the Bohinj valley. My legs soon shake off their hiking hangover. Great rows of pine and spruce shield us from the sun, and we make light work of the mountainside.

Halfway up, we pause on a ridgeback to gaze on the valley, our achievement laid bare.

“All the water on this side of the mountain,” Grega says, pointing below, “flows into the Danube, and eventually the Black Sea. All the water on this side” – he gestures to where we’re heading – “flows into the Adriatic.”

There’s another frontier, too. We pass a rock demarcating the boundary between Italy and Yugoslavia. The year 1920 is carved in stone which has outlasted both kingdoms and now sits unobserved and forgotten. We’re travelling westward to the Soča valley, by the cusp of the Italian border. Kobarid – better known as Caporetto – is our home for the night. I peer into the windows of the town’s award-winning war museum, vowing to return.

And then, on our final morning, there it is: the Soča River, a clear and singular epiphany. Grega sneaks us off the beaten track to Kozjak waterfall, whose roar fills the silence with awesome noise. The rest of the morning is spent clambering up and down the wooded slopes bracketing the Soča. Here it’s emerald, there it’s sapphire, and everywhere it glistens.

We’re greeted by other hikers with a friendly dober dan – only the third group we’ve seen. So is the Juliana Trail working? “Two hundred and sixty kilometres,” Grega puffs out his cheeks. “It’s a lot. So yes, our tourists are now deeper within the landscape, and less likely to get stuck in masses.”

Tomorrow we’re leaving, and the walking now feels somber and vital. As we enter the final village, exhausted into silence, we pass a sign for motorists. I ask Grega what Nasvidenje means.

“We use it to mean goodbye, but it translates as ‘until we meet again’.” I look back at the path, the patchwork of old routes now known as the Juliana Trail, at the beautifully preserved heirlooms of yesterday nestled in the valley, and I say it aloud: “Nasvidenje. Until we meet again.”

Grega laughs. “You see, that’s why we needed the Juliana Trail. People visit, and then they always want to come back!”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Not long before Christmas in 2014, Steve Mallen began to worry about the eldest of his three children. Edward, who had just turned 18, was good at everything. A gifted pianist, a talented sportsman and a nurturing big brother, he had secured a place at the University of Cambridge.

Then Edward stopped playing the piano. He became withdrawn and began to eat less and lose sleep. On 22 January 2015, he went to see the family’s GP, near their home in a village outside Cambridge. He revealed that he had suicidal feelings and had begun to self-harm, something he felt too ashamed to share at home. He had no known history of mental health problems.

The appointment triggered an urgent referral to NHS mental health services, but no swift action. Letters went missing, communication channels failed and the teenager’s parents were kept in the dark about his symptoms and treatment.

While they waited for help, the family booked an appointment with a private psychiatrist. Edward saw the psychiatrist on Friday 6 February and said it had gone well. He watched TV with the family that weekend and enjoyed his favourite dinner, spaghetti bolognese. On Sunday, he worked his usual shift at a bookshop in Cambridge. “I remember him coming home that evening and looking very tired,” Mallen says. “But we knew that we had got him some help. We were expecting letters from the NHS. His mum was making his favourite food …” His voice trails off.

The next day, Edward caught the train to Cambridge to hand in a maths assignment at his sixth-form college, then headed back to the village. Mallen was home alone that afternoon when there was a knock at the door. “Four big policemen in hi-vis jackets came in and informed me that my son had died horrifically, 500 yards from my front door,” he says. “And then they left. It was like someone had thrown a hand grenade into my house.”

I meet Mallen, 55, at the botanic garden in Cambridge, more than six years after Edward killed himself at his local train station. We sit on memorial benches outside the glasshouses and stroll among July blooms. “We used to spend whole days here with a picnic,” Mallen says. “Edward loved the natural world.”

Mallen has come dressed for business, in a suit over an open-necked shirt. He has an easy charm, but at times deep pain and anger inflect his voice. His face reveals the strain of grief and a personal mission that has cost him his privacy and his career.

In the weeks and months after that knock at the door, Mallen came to realise how badly Edward had been failed by the NHS, society – and his father. Almost immediately, Mallen, a commercial property consultant, began to direct his anger and guilt, as well as his astute business mind, into a new life.

In 2017, he co-founded the Zero Suicide Alliance, which has government funding and the backing of multiple NHS trusts. The alliance, which works with businesses, charities and bereaved families, has delivered online suicide-awareness training to more than 1.7 million people. It is part of a global “zero suicide” movement designed to shake up prevention strategies and attitudes at every level of society. Mallen does not believe we can eradicate suicide. “But if zero isn’t the right number to aim for, then what is?” he asks.

Mallen regularly testifies to select committees in Westminster as part of overdue moves in parliament to improve mental health services. In an act he describes as “putting my head in the dragon’s mouth”, he became a governor at the NHS trust that he blames for his son’s death. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the health and social care select committee, has described Mallen as “the country’s most formidable campaigner on suicide prevention”.

“Tireless” does not do Mallen justice, nor is it correct. He is exhausted – and constantly aware of the potential impact of his work and profile on his wife and their surviving children, who are 22 and 19 (Edward would be 25). He prefers not to name the other family members or the village in which they live. Yet, with their support, Mallen is unbowed and driven by a promise.

“When Edward died, people would come up and say it was an accident, or like being struck by lightning,” Mallen says, his voice getting louder. “And they meant well, but what happened was a woeful indictment on our society. Edward should be alive. And I stood in front of his coffin and made him a public promise that I would investigate his death and seek reform. I don’t intend to let him down twice.”

Mallen is worried about the effects of the pandemic on young people, in particular the disruption and isolation they have endured. “This is going to scar a whole generation,” he says, sharing the concerns of mental health charities. There is no evidence yet of a related spike in suicides, but one study last year recorded a rise in suicidal feelings among young people. Suicides among people aged 10-24 (15-24 in Scotland) were already becoming more common in Great Britain, having increased in 2019 for the second year in a row, to 601 deaths in England and Wales (74% of them male) and 110 deaths in Scotland (70% of them male). There were slightly more than 6,500 suicides in Great Britain in 2019 – about 18 a day. (The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, which collates the figures for that country, has not published complete data for 2019.)

These deaths sometimes seem to defy explanation. A third of teenaged suicide victims have no known history of suicidal ideas or self-harm, plus low rates of risk factors such as substance misuse or adversity, according to a study last year by the Centre for Mental Health and Safety at the University of Manchester. “Suicidal ideas may develop rapidly in this age group and crisis services should therefore be widely available,” the researchers wrote. “Future prevention cannot rely on explicit expressions of risk.”

Edward’s inquest, in 2016, laid bare the failings that contributed to his death. After the urgent referral by the GP, 18 days before Edward’s death, a liaison practitioner decided the teenager did not need urgent help, despite conversations about suicide and daily train journeys. Instead, the clinician scrawled some support websites on a scrap of paper.

Edward was prescribed antidepressants, but he was not warned that initially they might make him feel worse. A letter, sent to Edward on 29 January 2015, about an appointment with a psychiatrist on 24 February, never arrived; it was incorrectly addressed. Meanwhile, Edward’s parents knew nothing; Edward was an adult, but he had given his consent for his parents to be told about his suicidal thoughts and treatment. “He felt ashamed and asked one of the clinicians to ‘tell my mum’ – and nobody even bothered to pick up the phone,” Mallen says.

The coroner was so concerned about the failings of Cambridge and Peterborough NHS foundation trust that she issued a “regulation 28” report – a requirement when action must be taken to prevent future deaths. The trust apologised. “While there are elements in what occurred that may well not have been foreseeable, there were also things we could have done better,” it said after the inquest, adding that it would act on the coroner’s direction and its own inquiry.

Under new leadership, the trust invited Mallen to become a governor in 2018. “Steve’s contribution is vital in helping us understand the needs of family members and patients,” says Tracy Dowling, the trust’s chief executive since 2017, in an email. “We have encouraged all our staff and indeed everyone we know to take the training offered by the Zero Suicide Alliance.”

Mallen, who was born near Tottenham in north London, started his mission by educating himself. He realised that he knew nothing about mental health or suicide prevention. “It’s really easy to throw rocks at stuff, but that’s not the same as doing the homework and getting inside the system,” he says.

An “Edward” folder on Mallen’s computer used to contain family photos and school documents. Mallen then added a subfolder and called it “RIP”. “It started off with his death certificate and letters from the coroner – that kind of thing,” Mallen says. “It now has over 60,000 files in it, from policy documents and letters to peer-reviewed academic journals from all over the world.”

Mallen blames decades of underinvestment in the NHS, as well as reforms introduced in 2013 by the Health and Social Care Act, for fragmenting health services, leading to a postcode lottery in funding and quality. He has also been struck by the varying levels of knowledge and commitment of the people he has met and challenged in government and beyond. “You quickly realise that, when you pull a lever in Westminster, there isn’t much on the end of it,” he says.

He felt ashamed and asked one of the clinicians to ‘tell my mum’ – and nobody even bothered to pick up the phone

The Zero Suicide Alliance represents Mallen’s search for a functioning lever. The alliance, founded with Joe Rafferty, the head of Mersey Care NHS foundation trust and a zero-suicide pioneer in the UK, soon won government backing and funding, which has since hit £2m. Part of the zero approach involves providing education and information in all areas of life, from hairdressers’, schools and workplaces to late-night taxis, clifftops and bridges. “Intervening early is infinitely easier, and certainly a lot cheaper, than when somebody is in crisis,” Mallen says.

The alliance offers free interactive, online training, featuring case studies and “what would you do?” quizzes. A virtual coach offers advice, including on what to say to someone who seems withdrawn or has stopped doing the things they enjoyed (“they call that anhedonia,” Mallen says). Sleep or appetite loss is also a warning sign. The course cautions against using stigmatising language such as: “You’re not going to do something silly, are you?”

“It’s OK to have difficult conversations with your children,” Mallen says, wishing he had known six years ago a fraction of what he has learned. “It’s OK to say: ‘Are you OK?’ It’s OK to say: ‘Are you hurting yourself?’ or: ‘Have you thought about taking your own life?’”

Mallen was walking in the woods recently when he saw a woman sitting alone, clearly upset. He sat down with her and asked if she was OK. “I just got her to laugh and smile and made sure she had somewhere safe to go,” he says. “Does that make me a good samaritan? No, because it’s how we should all behave.”

Mallen is also big on “postvention”: what happens to a family bereaved by suicide, for whom rates of divorce, mental health struggles and suicide rise immediately. “Most families don’t survive this kind of trauma,” he says.

In 2018, Mallen was on his way home after a dinner when he was attacked by a drunk person. Mallen fell heavily against a shopfront. A huge cut to his face and head required 50 stitches and a blood transfusion. “Within 24 hours of being discharged, I was contacted by victim support and the police. I was given a case officer by the courts and was put in touch with a criminal compensation authority,” he says, running a finger along his scar. (His attacker received a two-year suspended sentence for grievous bodily harm.) “When my son got taken away from me in horrific circumstances, there was nothing.” Thanks in large part to his work, a commitment to suicide bereavement support services in all trusts by 2024 is part of the government’s NHS long-term plan.

Mallen is also working on prevention in prisons and schools. He is working with the government on guidelines for consent and confidentiality in families when there is an imminent risk to life. He is pleased that the levers of change are beginning to move – and celebrates a “social revolution” in discussions about mental health. After we met, NHS England announced plans for new waiting time standards for mental health patients, including one-hour responses in extreme cases. Charities welcomed the move while questioning the service’s ability to deliver, given growing demand and staff shortages.

Mallen is aware that he is privileged to be able to campaign full-time (even though most of his savings are gone). “I stand shoulder to shoulder with lots of other mums and dads who can’t do that,” he says. Their emails reach his inbox weekly; he has guided several families through grief and the trauma of inquests.

Yet campaigning has also been cathartic. Mallen can’t imagine doing anything else. He says he is often the only person in a room with dry eyes. But he often cracks, usually when he is alone and thinking about Edward’s death. “As much as I blame the system and the NHS for the loss of my boy, my son was dying in front of me and I couldn’t see it,” he says. “The feeling that one should have done better will never go away.”

As he heads off to get the same train home that Edward caught just before his death, Mallen says: “Grief is like glitter: no matter how hard you try, you never quite pick it all up. But you do rebalance.” He says he won’t stop campaigning until he can be confident that a boy like Edward, with the same symptoms today, would get the help he needed. “I will always stand next to my boy,” he says. “But we have a long way to go.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@At the end of June, Raye smashed through the shiny and carefully controlled veneer that usually surrounds music stars. The British pop singer’s numerous hit singles had made her one of the world’s 200 most popular artists on Spotify, but her label Polydor hadn’t allowed her to make even one album from a four-album record deal she signed back in 2014.

“I’ve done everything they asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week, ask anyone in the music game, they know,” she vented on Twitter. “I’m done being a polite pop star.” Polydor responded saying they were “saddened” to read Raye’s tweets and the two have since parted ways.

She had released one mini-album, five EPs and over 20 singles both as a lead and featured artist (and had written songs for other artists such as Beyoncé, Little Mix and Anne-Marie). One of her newest singles, Bed, with Joel Corry and David Guetta, is the biggest song so far in 2021 to be released by a British female artist. So why had her label left her in limbo?

She is far from alone, and the reasons for artists being stifled by the music business are numerous. Perhaps the artist’s creative vision is at odds with the label’s, or they’re sidelined after the person who signed them leaves the company. A lack of commercial success might make a label reluctant to spend more money on an artist’s career, or if the album they made isn’t deemed to be good enough. These pitfalls mean that the majority of artists never make it – stats from UK music trade body BPI say that only one in 10 signed artists are expected to succeed commercially, although industry insiders suggest this is a generous estimate – and if the relationship does fall apart, any music an artist has made typically remains owned by the label.

Kimberly Anne, who goes by the artist name of Lanta, signed to Polydor in 2013 and found herself in a similar situation to Raye. She spent three years with the label, “being a good artist, doing everything they said,” and changing genres so many times that she felt she lost her “creative compass”.

She lived off the £25,000 advance she’d been given and then spent a year negotiating her way out of the contract. After leaving, she says her self-confidence and mental health were shattered. “I think I have underlying anxiety issues but the whole experience definitely exacerbated it. I became depressed. I didn’t see how I could make music and represent myself any more, my confidence was at zero.” (In response, Polydor said it was the first they had heard of Lanta’s feelings, “which we were very sorry to read – given the substantial changes in the label’s management and staffing since 2013, we can’t comment on them. We take artists’ mental health very seriously and over recent years we have developed a number of resources to support the wellbeing of both our existing artists and those moving on.”)

Pop singer and songwriter Marney, who spent five years stuck in a deal with Sony without releasing any music after the A&R who signed her left the company, says she feels she lost her 20s. “You come out the other end and your friends have mortgages, they’re senior members of staff or just qualified as lawyers or doctors. Whereas you feel like you’ve got nothing to show.”

Singer and songwriter Bruno Major was given the A-list treatment when he signed to the since-dissolved Virgin in the US, which included a first-class flight, a stay in a beautiful hotel in Los Angeles and the pick of musicians he wanted to record with. He even had, he says, a private chef who baked him pies with his name on them. The high life ended abruptly when the label head who signed him was dismissed and the higher-ups decided his album was, Major says, “rubbish” and they wouldn’t release it.

Major says he was devastated and describes the experience as “the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. I had no confidence, no money. And it’s a long way down – when you become the guy that signs a record deal and goes to LA and then you get dropped, it’s humbling.” He has a pragmatic view on the situation now, saying it gave him the impetus to record new music and release it independently, but it taught him a harsh lesson about the reality of major record labels.

“It’s a giant illusion,” he says, comparing it to a TV talent show search. “People think in order to be famous or successful, you go on and the powers-that-be bestow upon you the magic wand of success. But the vast majority of people on the show actually get sunk and legally bound in deals that mean they are never able to release music and they are fucked, basically. The major label system is really not that different, just a little bit more finessed.”

Music industry adviser Mike Burgess explains the labels’ thinking: “There are a huge amount of acts that are signed because they might have the thing the label is looking for, or they might not. But it’s safer to hoover them up anyway, sign them and retain them.”

The problem, though, is that labels often seem to forget that they’re signing a human being rather than a prospect. Ted Cockle, who spent 15 years as head of record label Virgin EMI, where he worked with Lewis Capaldi, Amy Winehouse and Bastille before joining Hipgnosis Songs, says that the decision to delay a Raye album could make sense from a purely commercial perspective: her mini album Euphoric Sad Songs didn’t chart when it arrived last year. But does it make sense from a human one? “At some point, if the artist is seeing themselves as a recording artist and they’ve signed an album deal, in order to keep them energised, satiated and focused, you have to let them make an album,” he says. “It’s a rite of passage.” The artist-development process usually takes around two to three years before acts are deemed ready to release an album – less than half of the time Raye (who would not comment for this article) was kept waiting.

A lack of substantial record sales might also be the fault of a label’s development approach, rather than an artist whose destiny lies elsewhere. Grammy award-winning producer Jim Abbiss, who has worked with Adele and Arctic Monkeys, says that labels sometimes “try every combination of every genre and style” with a pop star – just as Polydor did with Raye and Lanta – who then “loses sight of what they are. Then, it’s very easy for the label or the management to never commit to things.” Raye’s songs have had productions ranging from deep house to Afrobeats, R&B and dance-pop, and she has arguably lost a strong sense of identity because of it.

There is anecdotal evidence to suggest this process may disproportionately affect women and people of colour. Songwriter Coco Morier, who has written for Britney Spears and Demi Lovato, says she’s seen plenty of young female artists “lectured and berated” by the male studio teams they are collaborating with, and who are “deemed a creation of the label and the producers behind them, instead of them being signed on their talent and allowed to have their creative vision.”

A Black female artist, who wished to remain anonymous, wanted to get out of her deal with Island Records for the vast majority of the time she was signed, and says she was pushed to be “super R&B” and told by her A&R that the chords on her songs “don’t sound Black enough”. She says: “With Black women, sometimes they’ll push you into the more commercially white realm or, in my personal experience, they refuse to see you outside of a stereotype of Blackness and make you feel like if you don’t conform to that, no one will believe you as an artist.” (Island said they would not comment on the allegations of an anonymous artist.)

Singer VV Brown has recently written about this, saying she “hated being immediately categorised as R&B” even though she’d written a pop-punk song. Throughout her career, she said she’s seen “countless” Black artists ending up in the same position as Raye. “I experienced it myself. For two years I was unable to release music and was completely neglected.”

These issues aren’t unique to major labels. Another artist I speak to was blocked from releasing her self-financed and self-produced album for two years by the independent label she was signed to, after they said it dealt with “women’s issues” that people didn’t want to hear about. It nearly devastated her financially. “In no other industry would this happen where someone says to you, ‘Oh, here’s a job contract but actually, we don’t want you to come into work, we’re not going to pay you and you can’t go and find another job.’”

For their part, record labels spend a lot of money on developing and promoting new music talent. In the UK, the BPI says that labels pump £250m a year into artist development (A&R) and another £150m on global marketing, which is over 35% of the total £1.118bn labels made from recorded music in 2020. The costs for one artist project alone can reach millions and when artists leave labels, they don’t have to pay back their advances. And thanks to the growing number of companies such as AWAL and BMG, which offer a more flexible alternative to traditional labels, artists now don’t have to enter into restrictive deals in order to get their music released.

Cockle refers to albums as an “artist appeasement tool”, because promoting albums in today’s track-led streaming age can be expensive and thankless. In 2010, Take That’s Progress was the best-selling album of the year with 1.84m sales, but in 2020, Lewis Capaldi’s Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent topped the list with 456,000, so there is an argument to be had over whether artists are too focused on albums when success and revenue span a multitude of areas (including playing live, merchandise sales, writing songs for others, branding deals and licensing music to film and TV).

Are album deals outdated, then? Yes, says music lawyer Robert Horsfall, who still sees “many contracts from the pre-streaming era that call for the old-fashioned ‘album’ format to be delivered and released”. This seems to be an issue Raye faced: although she’d released enough tracks to fill multiple albums, contractually, she hadn’t yet delivered one.

To their credit, Polydor allowed Raye to leave her deal swiftly and she’s now free to pursue a career as an independent artist. But what about those who end up trapped, unable to release the music they have poured their hearts and souls into? Many of those I spoke to called for better education about the reality of deals in music, as well as some sort of HR department that exists specifically for artists, where they feel supported to air grievances.

When putting this idea to the three major labels, one pointed to its artist relations department, who “support artists in a wide range of ways”. The second said that the company works in partnership with artists and managers “to ensure that creative choices are discussed and decisions are made collaboratively”. The third label said it has an informal reporting process but no formal mechanisms in place. The Musicians’ Union also offers support and advice to members for their contracts and relationships with music companies.

This sort of system isn’t a perfect solution – as Raye tweeted, artists often don’t speak “out of fear” of repercussions on their career. But if more can find their voices, the more likely it is that they will, finally, be heard.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Initially, this year’s Friends reunion didn’t exactly offer much in the way of entertainment. There was Justin Bieber dressed as a potato, and there was that meme about Matt LeBlanc looking like someone’s Irish uncle. Apart from that, the whole thing felt like an elaborate attempt to give James Corden even more air time.

But that was then. Because now that David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston are dating, the Friends reunion has become an important historical document and must be preserved for ever.

Now, it’s important to state here that Schwimmer and Aniston might not be dating. This whole kerfuffle seems to come from two pieces of information. The first was the segment from the Friends reunion – the only segment, really, that offered any new information – where they admitted they had secret crushes on each other while they were filming Friends. The second is that, after the reunion, Schwimmer apparently flew to Aniston’s home in LA so they could visit a vineyard together.

There are hundreds of reasons why Schwimmer might want to visit Aniston, many completely mundane. But the internet wants the two to date, so that’s it. They’re dating. They’re definitely dating, and it’s definitely amazing, and they call each other “my lobster” while they stroke each other’s hair in bed, and spend their days dancing around in fountains and wearing all of Chandler’s clothes and shouting “Pivot!”

Sure, a couple of years ago the internet hoped against hope that Aniston would get back with Brad Pitt, but that’s old news now. There’s something oddly defeated about a woman reuniting with an ex-husband. But a co-star? A co-star who her character had an on-off relationship with, on a sitcom that stopped being made 17 years ago? That’s much more exciting. Get it on already. Call each other Ross and Rachel while you’re doing it. Go on, hurry up, we’re all watching.

True, there may be something genuinely icky about deliberately confusing an actor with the role they play on television. We’re only interested in Schwimmer and Aniston getting together because we saw them act out a mimicry of infatuation on a show we liked. Had they played brother and sister on Friends, the internet might not have exploded with the same level of joy. But because we invested a decade of our stupid lives hoping Ross would end up with Rachel, it is suddenly of the utmost importance that Schwimmer follows the exact rote beats of this fictional relationship with Aniston. We demand it.

The optimist in me hopes this is all true. That two people in their 50s, who have both been beaten up by love in the past, have finally found lasting happiness with an old friend. It hopes that Schwimmer and Aniston will now have the most meaningful relationship of their lives, and find the lasting trust and companionship that has thus far eluded them.

But the cynic in me knows better than this. It knows that interest in the Friends cast is higher than usual post-reunion, and this may be nothing more than an attempt to stay in the headlines. It has seen the Instagram posts of Schwimmer self-consciously hawking T-shirts featuring Ross and Rachel embracing, and it has a horrible lurching feeling that this entire romance is nothing more than an opportunity to sell a range of sub-Redbubble tat.

Besides, everyone knows Rachel should have ended up with Bruce Willis.

The play originated from Speakers’ Corner, a political safe space in Bradford where a group of young Muslim women suggested doing something to de-stigmatise their brothers’ love of cars and Islam. The group originally held a car rally in Bradford’s city centre, where motor enthusiasts of all backgrounds met and talked about their shared pride. After that was a success, Common Wealth decided there was more to explore in the subculture.

It’s creative. When they see someone else’s car they appreciate it as art

Written by Zia Ahmed, the production is a typical of Common Wealth’s collaborative approach. The actors, all of whom have day jobs, contributed real-life stories that made it into the play, while six women from Speakers’ Corner also served as co-directors alongside Evie Manning.

Iram Rehman is one of them and says the project is about informing and unpicking some well-worn stereotypes about Bradford’s Asian population, who make up 20% of the city’s residents. “Because of the Bradford riots, there’s a lot of stigma around Muslim men,” she says. “The impression is that they are violent because of what happened, and they don’t really have a voice themselves. These are normal, Muslim men. They are passionate about certain things in life but they just want to live their lives.”

Ahmed, who is from south London, spent time with the three lead actors, listening to their stories and crafting a play that delivers a deeper look into the daily experiences of the three protagonists, from everyday racism and religious bigotry to harassment and street violence. “Casper talks a lot about his faith in the play. Faith is what brings him peace, but it’s also the thing that puts him under surveillance.”

Real-life stories … ‘There’s a lot of stigma around Muslim men’

Manning says the dedication and skills they devote to their cars is somehow lost in the mix of moral panic headlines and a general distrust of Asian men that has festered since 2001. “It’s creative, it really is like art to them,” says Manning. “And when they see someone else’s car they appreciate it as art because they know how much work goes into it.”

Ali, who founded Bradford Modified Club which holds meets for car enthusiasts, explains that since the Covid-19 lockdowns, driving while brown in Bradford has become increasingly difficult. He estimates he’s been stopped more than 10 times in the last two months and faced fines that amount to hundreds of pounds. “It’s taking the piss,” he says.

That anger and tension builds through the play as the cars themselves begin to “speak” with the actors and map out the political moments that shaped the men’s experiences: from the formation of the BNP in the early 80s, to the Manningham riots in 1995 and the start of the Prevent strategy after 9/11.

The result is a rare – and often funny – peek into the psyches of British Muslim men and a shocking reminder of what two decades of Islamophobic media coverage and government policy has delivered.

Common Wealth are based in both Bradford and Cardiff and have built a reputation for their challenging, site-specific work. Peaceophobia is similarly rooted in its locality. Bradford’s Telegraph and Argus newspaper is peppered with stories about car crime and associated antisocial behaviour, while the lyrics and videos of local bassline acts like Bad Boy Chiller Crew constantly reference car culture..

“This play could only come from Bradford,” says Manning, who will be touring it around the country from September.

Yet despite the hyperlocal nature of the piece, Manning says Peaceophobia is about the universal problem of being misunderstood. These men are essentially geeks, she says. Nerds with an addiction to buffing their cars, rather than antisocial petrolheads. “There’s none of that easy stereotype thing of, like, boys who drive cars are tough. It’s just not that at all.”

Changing that perception is one of the reasons Sohail joined the project. “I just want people to understand us,” he says. “A lot of people who see a car come past think either he’s a drug dealer or up to no good. So if people have the confidence to approach us and talk to us after seeing the play – that would be a win in my eyes.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Academic papers often take time to leach out into public consciousness. One that did not filter through was a study from Anglia Ruskin University that analysed “nodes of persisting complexity”, in the face of “global decomplexification event”. What’s that, you ask. Places you can probably still get electricity and toilet paper when climate breakdown destroys the rest of the world. New Zealand and Finland top the list. Perhaps coincidentally, it recently emerged that Google founder Larry Page has been granted New Zealand residency.

The recently released “last chance saloon” Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report will surely add pressure on governments to “do something” about all this. After all, we can’t all move to a nice “persistent node”. But doing something, as we know, is hard. So, what we can expect instead is for governments to redouble their usage of a time-tested rhetoric of distraction called “getting back to normal”.

Instead, of telling us that we need to truly transform the way we live and organise society, we will be told that we can still carry on as we were, except perhaps with our fossil fuels and one-use goods replaced with green energy and recyclables. Maybe a bit less air travel, but still ‘back to normal’ with green edges.

This way of thinking is perhaps as dangerous as the climate crisis itself. While banging on about inflation as a threat to the poor is a rhetoric of reaction, getting back to normal is a rhetoric of distraction. Rather than pandering to our prejudices, it builds directly upon how our psychology has evolved over millennia – it plays upon two things that we are hardwired to believe.

The first is what statisticians call “mean reversion”. Basically, if you see someone really tall, that person is labelled an outlier. Most people are of middling height and so we all reasonably expect most of the people we encounter to be our “normal” size. Nassim Nicholas Taleb famously demolished this line of thinking with his idea of “black swan” events. The fact that you expect only short people to show up makes you vulnerable to the appearance of tall people. Apply to banking crises, pandemics etc. This type of thinking makes us vulnerable to extreme events.

The second is that there is equilibrium associated with that middle-of-the-distribution model where things don’t change very much. Just as I assume there are no 8ft people in my home town (simply because I have not seen one yet), I presume that shocks to the world I live in (meeting an 8ft neighbour) are temporary deviations from some kind of stable self-generating order (hanging around with folks under 6ft is normal).

These ideas portray a comforting world because it implies, in the case of markets for example, that big crises can happen, but after a while, we will get back to normal. Or, in the case of pandemics and novel viruses, yes, that was a global crisis, but now with vaccines we can get back to normal. For everything there is a season etc.

The black swan is an ever present problem. But the equilibrium assumption may be even more pernicious because it rests upon a belief that human societies, and the natural systems that support them, have powerful self-equilibrating tendencies. Push too much one way and things break, sure, but then the system provides feedback and we restore the equilibrium – we get back to normal.

The economy is ground zero for such thinking. Not only is economics explicitly based on ideas of equilibrium, but in terms of policy we can normalise anything no matter how odd it truly is. Consider that when the global financial system was bailed out in 2008-9 by the world’s central banks, actions such as quantitative easing were supposed to be emergency measures. But over the following decade propping up markets became the new normal, so when the pandemic hit governments everywhere added 30% to the global debt stock while at the same time talking about getting back to normal.

But this pretence does not work with climate breakdown, it is a giant non-linear outcome generator with wicked convexities. In plain English, there is no mean, there is no average, there is no return to normal. It’s one way traffic into the unknown. As study after study shows, the one thing humans hate dealing with is uncertainty. Risk – odds you can count on – is fine. But systems with truly random outcomes freak us out. We are also terrible at dealing with scale. As evolutionary psychologists put it, “Our modern skulls house a stone age mind.” It evolved to solve problems in a pretty stable mean-reverting world with face-to-face interactions. When we encountered things that freaked us out in such a world, we filled in the gaps with a mutually agreed story (religion or political ideology, for example) that helped us ignore what we could not explain.

But now we live in a world we can explain, and yet rather than accept what we know and act upon that knowledge, we increasingly imagine our world to be different from how it actually is. That we can get back to normal (albeit with a few modifications) and that normal is a place of stability and comfort. “Yes, there are wildfires, but there are also floods, so it balances out, right?” Our coping mechanism is to ignore the big picture and focus on the local, which gives us a greater illusion of control at the price of increasingly misunderstanding the world we actually live in.

So, if you hear a politician talking about “getting back to normal”, remember that while this is comforting they are peddling a dangerous idea we are hardwired to accept. And if we keep accepting it as a plausible goal in the area of climate crisis, we will end up further away than ever from where we really need to be. As well as accepting the facts, it’s time to give up on getting back to normal and face the fact that there is no normal to return to. As the IPCC report makes clear, there are now only unknown and unfamiliar alternative futures that we can choose from. Embracing that uncertainty, rather than denying it, is the first step to choosing the right one.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The amazing thing about Andrew Cuomo’s announcement that he is stepping down as governor of New York is not that he left office; it is that it took this long for him to resign. And among the most troubling parts of the saga is how many crimes he and New York politicians normalized in the process – because so many of these officials were complicit, too.

Cuomo resigned in the wake of Attorney General Tish James’s report detailing his sexual crimes. But here’s the truth that’s hard to say aloud: if the New York governor had not been a sex pest, he likely would have gotten away with hiding thousands of people’s deaths in nursing homes and shielding his healthcare industry donors from any liability – all while profiting off a $5m book deal and being venerated by liberals and corporate media outlets as a shining star.

In fact, unless things suddenly change, he will get away with those crimes. With US attorneys so far declining to prosecute Cuomo on those matters – and with New York’s legislature refusing to begin impeachment proceedings on those issues – the federal and state political systems made sure these crimes weren’t considered transgressions at all. Same goes for many New York Democratic voters – a new poll shows that even now, a plurality of them say they approve of the way Cuomo has done his job.

To be sure, Democratic assemblyman Ron Kim’s nursing home crusade, and his allegations that Cuomo tried to bully him into silence, created a singular political earthquake that shook the New York political system and media into finally scrutinizing the gubernatorial monster that had long been rampaging through Albany. But the refusal to prosecute or impeach Cuomo over that epic scandal has further normalized that kind of unethical behavior.

Indeed, presiding over the mass death of elderly people and shielding the perpetrators all to ingratiate oneself with political financiers is now just regular politics. That’s now what politicians are allowed – and even expected – to do, everywhere. While President Biden’s former top aide lobbies the White House on behalf of the nursing home industry, the Biden justice department recently said it will not open an investigation into nursing home negligence and Covid-related deaths in New York and other states. Case closed.

The nursing home scandal is just one of many examples of Cuomo lawlessness that should have elicited a law enforcement response – but didn’t. The Albany Times Union details eight other scandals that Cuomo presided over. And those don’t include other questionable dealings, like reportedly giving his book publisher special tax breaks and funneling bond deals to his donors.

On Tuesday, the New Yorker reported that Cuomo tried to strong-arm the Obama White House in 2014, to get the justice department to stop probing his decision to shut down an anti-corruption panel. Obama officials said nothing publicly about this for years, and decided only to speak their piece when Cuomo was unpopular and disempowered, so they would be safe from any blowback from MSNBC watchers and #TeamBlue enforcers.

Up until the last few months, media outlets, Democratic politicians, and Democratic voters averted their eyes from Cuomo’s crime spree, instead seeing him as an idol to be worshiped, endorsed and supported as the great Cuomosexual future of the party.

In light of his rampage, Cuomo leaving office only because of his grotesque sexual aggressions is not enough. Not even close. It’s good thing and the downfall is well-deserved – especially when sexual harassment, assault, and abuse are so pervasive and perpetrators are rarely punished. But the Cuomo misdeeds that remain unpunished also send a message about what we continue to tolerate – and that tolerance isn’t passive or accidental. It is deliberate.

Punishing Cuomo for his deadly dealings with nursing home and health care donors would scandalize similarly unethical ties between these corporate interests and other politicians. For example: the health care lobby group that donated to Cuomo and drafted his nursing home immunity bill also funneled large sums of cash to New York Democratic legislators who passed that bill. And once that immunity bill was signed into law, Republican politicians then copied and pasted the language into their own state and federal bills, while raking in cash from health care interests.

Prosecuting or impeaching a governor over such unethical behavior could threaten this entire system of legalized bribery, which politicians of both parties benefit from. And so even as brave Democratic legislators such as Kim and state Senator Alessandra Biaggi tried to blow the whistle, that system effectively granted Cuomo the same immunity he gave to his nursing home industry donors, while thousands of elderly people perished. Impeachment and resignation only entered the discourse in response to his grotesque interpersonal behavior – in part because that could be portrayed as merely a problem of one bad apple in the barrel.

The trouble is, we also have a barrel problem.

We live in an era of politicians screaming “law and order”, while they champion corporate immunity, authorize ethics waivers, and oversee law enforcement machines that have reduced prosecutions of political corruption and white collar crime.

This is a bipartisan affair – at the federal level, there’s a continuous theme from George W Bush loading up his administration with corporate cronies, to Barack Obama refusing to prosecute a single banker involved in the financial crisis, to Donald Trump’s lawless rampage through Washington. On the I-95 corridor, it’s been the same bipartisan phenomenon in miniature – corruption scandals in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts are the blue and red corners of the same quilt of corruption.

This quilt is now over our head, suffocating our country – and Cuomo’s departure leaves its links intact. It’s great that Cuomo is leaving, but make no mistake: his legacy of lawlessness lives on, arguably stronger than ever – and it will continue to do so until voters start demanding something different.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Obviously look away now if you have ever personally employed me, but: I don’t think I’ve ever done an afternoon’s work in my life. It’s just not really my vibe. I learned a long time ago that most of my focus happens to me in the morning. There’s a fairly juicy period of concentration between 10am and 1pm, but once I’ve been to Pret and picked out an egg sandwich it really is game over for the rest of my day. You’re welcome to email me, of course, and sometimes you will get a reply. If you look at me at my desk, I do a very good pantomime of doing work (a furrowed brow, some frenzied clicking, spinning a pen on my fingers). But fundamentally nothing’s getting done again until tomorrow; 60% of my salaried working life I just spent looking at football forums and browsing eBay. Nobody has ever, ever noticed this about me.

This is because most office jobs aren’t really real.

This should be a talking point, this week, but it isn’t, because fundamentally we had one chance at building society correctly and we messed it up, and now we have a Conservative government and conservative bloggers telling us all to get back to the office, you workshy wastrels! To catch you up: a global pandemic affected the working operation of literally everything in the world some time in early 2020. This led to a lot of people in Britain, by necessity, working from home or remotely for a proportion of the year (though, obviously, not everyone: while 48% of London’s workforce had to download Zoom then Microsoft Teams then Zoom again, the figures are more like a third in other parts of the country). After a year of that, and the slow staccato reopening of shops and restaurants and pubs, some people have decided it is time for those in England to get back to the grind, and anyone who thinks otherwise should … hold on, am I reading this correctly? “Have their pay cut”?

“People who have been working from home aren’t paying their commuting costs so they have had a de facto pay rise, so that is unfair on those who are going into work,” an anonymous government minister told the Daily Mail this week, in a story about getting civil servants back into Whitehall, and to be fair I would rescind my name from publication too if I was chatting such wham. Meanwhile an anonymous PR firm owner writes in the Times, “It’s no longer the workplace, it’s the wokeplace. My business partner and I employ about 20 members of staff, many aged under 30, and it’s a serious struggle to get them back to the office.” At least Rishi Sunak had the nuts to put his name to comments made to LinkedIn News last week, where he credited the office environment (not going to public school, or then attending Oxford) with the connections he made in his early career. “I doubt I would have had those strong relationships if I was doing my internship or my first bit of my career over Teams and Zoom,” he said. Remember when he wanted us all back in the office in September 2020? How did that go, in the end?

Things I am not going to get into: the hellish nightmare so many people have had with juggling their full-time jobs with full-time childcare with full-time being locked in their own houses this past year; the fact that years of wage stagnation and the massive inflation of necessities such as housing mean that very few people in the UK have been paid a fair wage for years now; how being at home more does not necessarily mean spending less money, by the way. Things I am going to get into instead: what’s so good about the office, anyway?

Even on the mornings when I actually did things, I have never been in an office environment that has been conducive to work. Think of the constant emails about the shared fridges; the radio that is on for some reason; the guy making an ostentatiously loud phonecall on Bluetooth headphones. Never in my life have I seen a photocopier or central printer placed in a position where the sound and smell of it doesn’t disturb at least three people.

“Hi guys, quick meeting please, I know some of you are in the middle of something but I just need to see your faces.” “Hi guys, it’s the annual one-on-one where we make you fill out a four-page form assessing your own performance at work then I quietly tell you you’re not getting a pay rise again.” “Hi guys, Friday afternoon so I’m going to make up a 40-minute presentation on the spot, you all have to stand and watch me mumble through it.” How is this good? How are we meant to work amid this? What is that strange smell? The only toilets with actually private cubicles have flooded, you find out. The repairs to the toilet flood damage somehow take eight months of constant drilling, you find out. Come into the office! You get to have short-notice meetings with other people who keep getting pulled from one task to another without ever really completing any, then will be forced on the spot to think of a creative idea! Come on, this is fun! Someone’s going to microwave their lunchtime fish in a minute!

Thing is, we have a once-in-a-generation chance to build office work from the ground up: to re-evaluate the old nine-to-five, to relocate city centre offices that don’t have any real reason to be in there, to let people work tight four-day weeks to let their life breathe around their jobs, to allow people to take dentist appointments in the middle of the day, to realise that working smart is better than the old-fashioned idea of working hard. We could even consider not cutting pay from people for taking – in the middle of a global emergency – an opportunity to have more flexible working, and even offer (gasp) pay rises to the key workers who chugged on through it throughout. But we won’t do any of that because the people in charge have only ever got to their positions by turning up to the office every day for years in a row, even when they had a cold, and as a result “discipline” is the only working mechanic they understand, and now we’ll be stuck with it until the sun burns us out of the sky. Welcome! Back!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@How we rebuild our high streets and town centres after the pandemic is one of the most urgent questions facing communities across Britain. The answer has often come in the form of corporate-led regeneration schemes that prioritise demolition, dispossess local communities, and provide scant “affordable” housing. To build a sustainable and inclusive economy, we need to move away from this model. In Tottenham, north London, a pioneering solution is under way that could provide an alternative.

After struggling for 15 years against a widely criticised regeneration plan, traders and residents in Tottenham have won the opportunity to restore a listed historic building and celebrated market for the benefit of the community. The Wards building opened in 1901 as one of London’s “grand department stores” and for decades formed an iconic gateway into Tottenham. Yet the construction of the Victoria line saw their compulsory purchase by Transport for London (TfL). They were derelict until 1985, when a market serving migrant communities opened on the ground floor. Years of underinvestment by TfL left the buildings dilapidated and in 2002, Haringey council designated the site for regeneration, with Grainger – one of Britain’s biggest build-to-rent developer – selected in 2004 as their preferred partner and awarded significant public funds to design proposals for the site.

Grainger’s plans would have demolished the entire Wards Corner block, including the locally listed Edwardian Wards building and Seven Sisters Indoor Market. Known locally as the Latin Village or Pueblito Paisa, the market is an important retail and cultural hub for London’s Latin American communities. A 2011 report by Trust for London found that 85% of London’s Latinx diaspora rely on the clusters of businesses at Seven Sisters and Elephant and Castle to directly experience their culture – with both areas threatened by intensive regeneration. This threat was underscored in 2017, when United Nations human rights experts warned Grainger’s plan would have “a disproportionate impact on people belonging to minorities and their right to equal participation in economic, social and cultural rights”.

Not a single affordable or social-rent home would have been provided at Wards Corner as part of Grainger’s scheme. Instead, it would have built 190 private flats and provided space for several chain stores, encouraged by planning policy that sought to gentrify the area, placing existing residents at risk of displacement. This outdated scheme was conceived in another era, before the pandemic accelerated the high street crisis that had been instigated by the shift to online retail, which has seen a 20% decline in high street visitors and 50,000 shops across the UK close in the past decade. Citing viability concerns and the changed economic landscape, Grainger’s withdrawal is a major victory for all those who want to see urban development for people, not profit.

The community plan to save the market and restore the Wards buildings, first developed by El Pueblito Paisa Ltd in 2007, evolved over several iterations through public meetings, workshops, and events before gaining planning permission in 2014 and again in 2019, when it received hundreds of letters of support. The fourth iteration of the plan, co-designed by the architectural cooperative Unit 38, would sustainably restore the existing buildings and provide over 3,000 sq metres of retail space and cafe space with an enhanced market at its heart, alongside 650 sq metres of affordable workspaces and new community facilities, including a childcare centre. On the wider site, there is the potential for social housing development in collaboration with the council and the community.

The buildings will be democratically owned and operated by a community benefit society led by local people on a one member, one vote basis. Grant funding, community shares and ethical investment will meet the estimated £12.9m cost of the refurbishment. Instead of extracting profits for remote shareholders, the surplus generated from the restored building will be reinvested in further community wealth-building initiatives in Tottenham: financial modelling commissioned by the West Green Road/Seven Sisters Development Trust suggests this could total as much as £84m over 60 years. The community plan represents more than the restoration of a neglected market and heritage building: it is a new, democratic model of urban development that benefits the people who live in an area, rather than distant corporate interests.

Now all efforts must turn to delivering the community plan as soon as possible. Since the compulsory purchase process began, the urban block earmarked for development has sharply deteriorated, with vacant or dilapidated units becoming magnets for fly-tipping and antisocial behaviour, market tenants victimised and existing residents evicted and left destitute. After the most recent market operator declared insolvency in 2020, TfL were forced to step in as operator as a last resort. It uncovered serious health and safety breaches – including fire safety, electrical and gas risks – which it said left the market too unsafe to open. The market remains closed, nearly 18 months later, leaving traders without access to their livelihoods, and the community without crucial support throughout the pandemic. It is therefore imperative that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, extends his financial hardship scheme for traders until a temporary or permanent market is in place, and for that market to be provided by the end of 2021.

We now call on Khan to join Haringey council in offering his full support for the community plan and ensuring that the future development of Wards Corner delivers the maximum benefit for local people. As we emerge from the pandemic to face the stark reality of the climate crisis, how – and for whom – we undertake urban development will be critical to building a sustainable and just economy. The Wards Corner Community Plan is a viable and coherent answer to this question, which could offer a model for communities across the country seeking to rethink urban change. The late David Graeber – a friend of the campaign – once wrote: “The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.” Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in our cities.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Maybe this will be my Paul Krugman moment. The Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist was famously the winner of a study to establish which op-ed commentator was most consistently correct. In 1998, he also famously claimed, “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” I am not nearly so storied in accomplishments as Krugman. But I do make my living offering predictions and forecasts. So I might as well say it: I predict that the metaverse won’t happen.

The “metaverse,” for those who don’t know, is a still-mostly-hypothetical virtual world accessed by special virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology. The idea is to create a sort of next-level Internet overlaid on our physical world. People plugged into the metaverse exist in our physical world like everyone else but can see and interact with things that others can’t. Think The Matrix or the Star Trek Holodeck or the Fortnite-esque brandscapes of Ready Player One.

The concept of the metaverse isn’t new. The phrase was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science-fiction novel Snow Crash, which was set in a near future in which the virtual world and the physical world are inextricably interconnected. Silicon Valley’s tech billionaires seem increasingly convinced that an actual metaverse is just over the horizon; the previously niche concept has been mentioned on earnings calls for Microsoft and Facebook. In a recent interview with The Verge, an enthusiastic Zuckerberg described the metaverse as “the successor to the mobile internet,” and a kind of “embodied internet, where instead of just viewing content – you are in it.”

At the same time as the metaverse discourse has been heating up, it’s been a breakout year for the crypto community. The non-fungible token (NFT) took the art world’s imagination by storm this winter. Elon Musk stoked – and then popped – a truly wild Bitcoin bubble. Now, neither Zuckerberg nor Bill Gates tethered their concept of the metaverse to crypto. But I find it interesting that both the centralizers – tech giants whose power and influence rival nation states – and the decentralizers – crypto innovators who remain something of an influential subculture – see the new chapter in technological progress in roughly the same terms: to escape reality.

It’s important to throw some cold water on this by remembering that the concept of virtual reality – which is really what the metaverse is – dates back a long time. Virtual reality was popularized by computer scientist and tech contrarian Jaron Lanier in the 1980s; his company VPL Research, short for Virtual Programming Languages, achieved such success that the toymaker Mattel licensed their “DataGlove” device – a kind of wired glove – to create a Nintendo game controller.

Yet it’s been more than three decades. Virtual and augmented reality of any kind hasn’t exactly taken off. Despite all the chatter about Oculus – the VR headset company that Facebook acquired, to much fanfare, in 2014 – few of even my most technophilic friends have hopped on the Oculus train. I’ve only encountered the Oculus VR gear as a forlorn gadget in startup HQs – a novelty unceremoniously dumped next to the WiFi router. As tech analyst Benedict Evans recently tweeted, “My son is approximately 1000x more interested in Roblox” – an online game platform on which users can create their own games for other users to try – “than in getting my VR headset out of the cupboard. Different models of the future.” VR was the techno-utopian future that Generation X was promised. But as the Substack writer Paul Skallas recently noted: “Back in 1999/2000 people would tell you VR was right on the cusp of taking over. That it would change everything. It’s 2020. Where is it.”

VR – and AR after it – have run into a continual problem: people mostly like reality. People have liked visual entertainment for as long as there have been screens, for as long as there have been theaters. But, like all entertainment, visual entertainment has its time and its place. Remember Google Glass? I had a pair. It was abominable to use. Who wants email notifications obscuring their field of vision all day? My phone is distraction enough. The synthesis of wearable tech and augmented reality pretty quickly parted ways. Augmented reality became fun Snapchat filters that make you look like a Pixar character. Wearable tech became Apple watches to count your steps and alert you if you’re having a heart attack.

Two factors determine whether new technology catches on: capacity and incentive. Not all things that tech can do (capacity), people want (incentive). Think back to the mid-2000s, or rewatch David Fincher’s 2010 classic The Social Network. The building blocks of social networking existed long before Zuckerberg created Facebook. In fact, several social networks already existed. Remember Friendster and MySpace? The capacity was there. But what was the incentive? To get people to join his network in droves, Zuckerberg added two ingredients that the earlier social networks lacked: exclusivity and status.

When Facebook first launched, only those who attended a small group of prestigious colleges could join. I graduated high school in 2005, and I’m ashamed to say that Facebook influenced my school choice. Facebook in the early days was additive. It was where you found friends before you arrived on campus, solidified nascent relationships, shared boozy and embarrassing memories. My question for metaverse boosters is this: what does the metaverse add to everyday life?

I’ve used Oculus goggles before. I found they had a weird time distortion effect. When I took them off, I felt vaguely tired. Coming out of the pandemic, which has reminded everyone that a Zoom call is very much not the same thing as hugging your mom, I’m skeptical that Zoom-fatigued workers will be interested in leveling up to working in the metaverse – whatever that may mean. A new youth survey by Dazed reports that just 9% of Gen Zers want to stay on social media; fatigue with digital substitutes for real life may be even broader than just the Zoom-fatigued legions working from home.

Tech oligarchs like Zuckerberg, with his Sauron-like ambition to own the One Ring to rule them all, seem like the worst choice to put in charge of building a new world. I’m more sympathetic to the crypto community’s nascent interest in the metaverse. The promise of crypto, it seems to me, is its potential to spark decentralization in an already overly centralized world, to play Gutenberg to the next generation’s Martin Luthers. The metaverse proposes a smoothed-out and rationalized version of our messy and chaotic world. The question that crypto seems to face most pressingly is: Why should crypto matter to everyone? If crypto is to be truly revolutionary, then it will have to give an answer that formats digital life down to a human scale, not up to a megalomaniac’s.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ruinous, eye-watering, crippling, stratospheric, massive. That’s the cost to the UK of beating the climate crisis, according to those who portray getting to net zero emissions as economic suicide that is being thrust on an unwilling population by posh eco-fundamentalists and zealots.

This is not just wrong, it is the exact opposite of reality. The delusions come from those with histories of climate change scepticism and could be dismissed as the latest mutant variant thrown up by the death throes of denial. But they are having a real-world impact, slowing action at the precise moment acceleration is needed.

So how did we get here? In 2019, the then chancellor, Phillip Hammond, wrote a letter to the prime minister claiming the cost of the UK getting to net zero would exceed £1tn. Then, in July of this year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated the investment needed for net zero by 2050 was £1.4tn. These figures are the source of the hot air.

But this is only one side of the balance sheet. The other, conveniently ignored by the critics, carries huge cost savings due to more efficient vehicles and buildings, and the economic boost of many thousands of good jobs in the green industries that will be the growth story of the 21st century. And that’s just the start.

Getting to net zero avoids the terrible costs and suffering that unrestrained global heating is beginning to wreak on the world, as starkly laid out in the week’s IPCC report. Cutting fossil fuel burning also brings benefits such as slashed air pollution, which still kills about 40,000 people a year in the UK.

Let’s put some of that into numbers. Once the fuel efficiency savings are included, the OBR’s cost estimate falls by about 75%, to 0.4% of GDP a year. The OBR also said delaying decisive climate action by a decade could double the cost to the government.

Chris Stark, head of the government’s advisers, the Climate Change Committee, estimates that the cost of getting to net zero by 2050 would mean a mere four-month delay in economic growth over 30 years, even without considering the wider benefits to society. Given the alternative – climate chaos – Stark says: “I would argue we can’t afford not to do net zero.”

Swiss Re, the insurance giant whose business is risk, agrees. It calculates a 10% loss of global GDP by 2050 without further climate action now, similar to other recent analyses. Another study suggests that breaking the 1.5C temperature limit outlined in the Paris agreement will cost far more than acting to hold temperatures down, even if rich nations have to pay for action in poorer nations. Basically, climate action is a bargain.

In the face of this, why do some still make hysterical claims of ruinous costs? The first reason is blinkered nationalism – the UK’s emissions are just 1% of the globe’s, they say. The problem here is that the UK is holding the vital Cop26 climate summit in November – why should anyone act to save the world if the host is not? Failing to act would also cede competitive advantage in green industries to other nations: kiss goodbye to “Global Britain”.

The second reason for the hysterical claims is rooted in inane free-market ideology. It is true that there are upfront costs for green technology. Electric cars cost more to buy for now, but are already cheaper to own overall.

The solution here, proposed as much by centre-right voices as the left, is ensuring the less well-off get the help they need, such as subsidised electric vehicles or payments funded by carbon taxes levied on the high consumption of the wealthy. To those further to the right, such state redistribution is anathema, which may be why none of those complaining of the costs of net zero seem able to come up with any alternative plans.

They claim to be concerned about struggling families, but as Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, says: “If we were to pursue the alternative approach of not mitigating climate change, unfairnesses in society would be exacerbated. Low-income households, for example, are disproportionately exposed to flood risk.”

The cries of “crippling net zero costs” may be laughable, but they are causing damage, and not just because they are helping delay cuts to carbon emissions. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is dragging his feet over urgently needed green policies, such as the plan to phase out gas boilers, at just the moment when the UK needs to be leading the way ahead of Cop26.

A reckoning is coming. The Treasury must publish its review of the costs of the net zero transition in the coming months, which is said to be being redrafted after a first attempt that was considered overly pessimistic in its high projected costs. If the final report accepts the compelling logic that climate action is both vital and affordable, the UK may yet lead Cop26 to the successful outcome the world desperately needs. If not, the cynics – those who know “the price of everything and the value of nothing” – will have won, and the world will continue to burn.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“I could have worse tags than ‘Air Miles Andy’”, Prince Andrew once remarked, “although I don’t know what they are.” Yeah, well … SPOILERS. I’m not sure if the Duke of York would have better luck if he considered the question again today, in light of Various Events of the past few years. His infamous Newsnight interview revealed him to be a man of such baroque stupidity that in some ways its most sensational revelation was that Prince Edward must have been the clever one.

And so to events overnight in New York. For the first time, the Queen’s second son has been made the subject of a US lawsuit, a civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre, formerly Roberts, teenage victim of Andrew’s former close friend, the late underage sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre alleges that the Queen’s second son sexually abused her when she was a minor on three occasions – in London, in New York, and in the US Virgin Islands. Quite a lot of air miles, there, though I fear we can rule out HRH cashing them in for a free flight to the US any time soon. The prince has not commented on the case but he has always denied the claims saying they’re false and without foundation.

He won’t be sweating even now, of course – as Andrew famously explained, he is biologically incapable of perspiration because he OD’d on adrenaline in the Falklands. And you know, no matter how many times I type that, I always need to take a moment to get my eyebrows down off the roof.

Anyway, this latest development may well represent Giuffre’s last available option for personal agency in pursuit of justice for her claims. Otherwise, she can only await the glacial creep of the various investigations into the now-dead Epstein and his associates, including the financier’s alleged procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, who is herself awaiting trial in the US.

Alas, accounts differ as to the level of the prince’s assistance with any of these various inquiries. Last January, the then–US attorney for the southern district of New York, Geoffrey Berman, declared HRH had offered “zero cooperation” up to that point. According to Berman, not a lot had changed six months later. “If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open,” he reiterated last summer, “and we await word of when we should expect him.” Reading that, you might have felt minded to pencil him in for the 12th of never, but the prince’s legal team countered that he had “on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DOJ”. In the suit filed on Monday, the documents state: “Again Prince Andrew stonewalled - ignoring (the) plaintiff’s letter and emails without any reply or response, thereby making this action necessary now.”

Let’s move on, then, to a recap on the three locations referenced in Giuffre’s case. The Virgin Islands relates to Epstein’s private property in the territory, apparently known locally – though perhaps not altogether opaquely – as “Paedophile Island”. On the New York allegation, Prince Andrew has already asserted that he couldn’t have had “activity” with Giuffre at Epstein’s Manhattan address that night as he was staying with the then British consul general in New York, Sir Thomas Harris. Or as Harris put it: “It doesn’t sound like he stayed with me,” adding that he had “no recollection” of the claimed royal visit, and it had not appeared in the Court Circular as would be convention. The London allegation arguably comes with the most helpful aide memoire for the prince, what with the existence of a photo of Andrew with his hand resting on the bare hip of Giuffre in an upstairs room of Ghislaine Maxwell’s home. Maxwell herself is smirking in the background of the picture, allegedly taken after a visit by her, the prince, and Epstein to Tramp nightclub.

All sorts of claims have been made about this photograph and what it shows. Placing those allegations and denials to one side for a moment, let’s just focus on what we can see, and ask ourselves a basic question. Namely: what are three big-hitters in their 40s doing hanging round late at night with a 17-year-old runaway? Is this the behaviour of non-weirdos? Not really, let’s face it. Virginia Roberts wasn’t a whole lot older than Andrew’s eldest daughter at the time, which perhaps ought to have crystallised his thinking. Far better to take her to Pizza Express than to run the gauntlet of the aged slimeballs at Tramp.

Nor was it the behaviour of a non-weirdo to continue to hang out with a Tier 1 sex offender AFTER he had been to prison for procuring an underage girl for prostitution, as the Duke of York undeniably did in the case of Epstein. And let’s not forget it wasn’t just one girl, in some kind of he-said, she-said situation. As the Palm Beach police chief who ran the case summarised: “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the shes all basically told the same story.”

As for what’s next for Andy, I wouldn’t pin hopes on him being a blockbuster Tower of London exhibit for autumn. It was almost exactly two years ago that the fallout of his Epstein friendship hotted up for him again, and back then the prince headed straight to join the Queen’s summer retreat to Balmoral, where he was accompanied by his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson. Andrew was even prominently displayed in the prime seat next to his mother in the car on the way to the local church. He and Fergie then private-jetted off for a second time to Sotogrande – though oddly some random private plane Meghan and Harry had recently taken was deemed of far more febrile and condemnatory interest to most of Fleet Street at the time.

You certainly wouldn’t bet against the same pattern being followed this year. Prince Andrew and Fergie are already reported to be imminently expected at Balmoral, suggesting he is not exactly the Banned Old Duke of York. Perhaps we shall see him with mama again, pursing his lips with the grave satisfaction of one who knows that Balmoral’s humble kirk does not actually have an extradition treaty with hades.

In the immediate wake of the Newsnight interview, a YouGov poll found that a mere 6% of the UK public believed Prince Andrew to be telling the truth. It does seem particularly notable that he asserts he was “acting honourably” in flying all the way to New York in 2010, supposedly to end his friendship with Epstein. Strangely, he has yet to regard it as a matter of honour to fly to New York to clear his own name. If he fails to take up this new opportunity to do so in a court of law, he and his surrogates can hardly complain about being tried in the court of public opinion.

This article was amended on 10 August 2021 to refer to the US Virgin Islands, not British Virgin Islands, and on 11 and 16 August 2021 because an earlier version, referring to January 2020, gave Berman’s role incorrectly as “attorney general of New York”, and a later version, due to an editing error, gave it as “US attorney general for the southern district of New York”. In fact he held the role of US attorney for the southern district of New York.




@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The sixth assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is no ordinary publication. Its 4,000 pages were written by hundreds of independent scientists from 66 countries. It was commissioned by 195 governments and all of them signed off on the conclusions after reviewing them line by line and word by word. These governments, whether supportive, ambivalent or hostile to climate action, now own the messages in the report. So what does it say?

The report concludes that there is now “unequivocal” evidence that human actions are changing our climate. Behind this are alarming findings. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has led to levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that are higher today than at any time in the past 2 million years. Alongside methane and other greenhouse gases, this has driven Earth to be warmer than at any point in the past 125,000 years. The impacts of this can be seen in the loss of Arctic sea ice, accelerating sea level rise, hotter and more frequent heatwaves, increased and more frequent extreme rainfall events and, in some regions, more intense droughts and fires.

As scientists, we can now clearly and unambiguously join all the dots, linking these “climate-impact drivers” back to global heating and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use. Today’s global temperature rise of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels confirms the predictions of climate scientists more than 30 years ago. The increases in heatwaves and extreme rainfall events were also long foreseen. Those in power may have heard the warnings in previous reports, but they did not listen.

The current wave of devastation from heatwaves, fires and floods is causing misery across the world. Even the world’s wealthiest countries, such as Canada and Germany, are woefully ill-prepared for the escalating effects of the climate crisis. Destructive events are the consequences of failing to act on past warnings. As a result, the climate emergency is no longer a future hypothesis: it is with us here and now.

Global emissions of carbon dioxide are rising again after their temporary fall during the Covid lockdowns. According to the International Energy Authority, unless new policies are enforced, CO2 emissions will probably hit record levels in 2023. And, as if that were not enough bad news, extreme heatwaves, rainfall events and droughts will get worse until carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to zero.

It is hard to make sense of all this. How do we even think of a time as hot as 125,000 years ago? At that point, humans were coexisting with Neanderthals. As much carbon dioxide as two million years ago? Our species hadn’t even evolved by then. It is no wonder these incredible changes feel existential. But we must urgently make sense of them, and act fast.

The problem is ultimately that the use of fossil fuels is a “progress trap”. Decades ago, fossil fuels improved lives compared alternative energy sources, but now their use does the opposite, actively destroying lives and livelihoods. Fossil fuels have gone from an ingenious enabler of human progress to a trap that undermines it. The climate crisis is not caused by vague “human actions”; nor is it a result of some innate aspect of human nature. It is caused by specific investments by specific people in specific things. Change those, and we can change the future.

It may feel uncomfortable saying that fossil fuel companies, their investors and the politicians who enable them are the enemies of progress. But if we care about our collective future we need to say it, again and again, without flinching: using fossil fuels today is destroying our future.

The fossil fuel industry is a powerful and complex enemy. Historically, it is where the world’s most influential lobbyists have worked. Their efforts have secured subsidies, military campaigns and a free licence to pollute, all justified in the name of access to fossil energy. Oil, coal and gas are also intimately involved in our lives, from heating our homes to powering transport. There is no single policy, technological breakthrough or activist campaign that alone can help us escape this trap.

Instead we need a three-pronged attack on fossil fuels: target the industry directly, join broad social movements to secure the political changes needed to end the fossil fuel era and make changes to reduce our demand for fossil fuels. That might mean asking your pension provider to divest from fossil fuels, joining the next Extinction Rebellion protest or replacing your polluting gas cooker with a modern electric one. In this, there is a role for everyone.

What also matters is talking about the climate emergency and the urgent need to end the fossil fuel era. We should be bringing this up at home, at work, at school and with our friends. While the sweeping changes needed must ultimately come from government regulation, it is us who must demonstrate that the desire for change exists.

The new sixth assessment report was not all bad news. It included one unambiguously positive finding: the level of devastation we face is in our collective hands. If the world slashes emissions now and reduces them to net zero by 2050 we would keep the global temperature rise close to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

To achieve this, politicians will need to hear that the clamour of millions of people’s voices is greater than the might of the fossil fuel lobby. Governments accept the science of climate change. Now they need to be forced to act on what they know is true, and help us escape the fossil fuel progress trap.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Even Lionel Messi seemed wowed by the power of Paris Saint-Germain’s new strikeforce, as he described the prospect of combining with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé as “madness”. In scenes very different to his tearful adieu to Barcelona three days earlier, the Argentinian was unveiled by his new club at a press conference at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday while a large and giddy crowd gathered outside to sing hymns of praise.

“The reception from the people of Paris has been amazing, I will try to live up to your expectations,” said Messi, who felt “incredible happiness” at joining a team that he believes can help him win his fifth Champions League and his first since 2015. Asked, in particular, about playing with Neymar and Mbappé, he replied: “It’s madness to be able to work with such great players on a daily basis,” adding that his admiration was not confined to those new teammates, since Sergio Ramos, Georginio Wijnaldum, Achraf Hakimi and Gianluigi Donnarumma have also joined this summer.

“PSG have made spectacular signings on top of the players that were already here,” Messi said. “I’m eager to get playing and I’m going to be doing it alongside some of the best players in the world. It’s going to be a marvellous experience every day. I hope I can continue to win titles. I have the same hunger as when I was younger.”

He said he was not sure when he would be ready to play, explaining: “I have been inactive for the last month so I basically have to do a pre-season by myself.”

PSG’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, said that Messi’s arrival should help convince Mbappé to pledge his future to the club. The Frenchman has resisted attempts to secure him to a new contract, with his deal expiring next year. Khelaifi said he expected Mbappé to stay because “now he has no excuse to do anything else”.

Khelaifi also said Messi’s arrival would generate enormous revenue for PSG, suggesting those benefits would help the club to comply with financial fair play regulations. Asked specifically how the club that already offers huge salaries could afford to hire Messi on an annual wage of nearly £30m for at least the next two years, Khelaifi thanked the journalist for asking “a very great question” before replying: “We have always followed FFP regulations from day one and we always will. Before doing anything strategically we look with our commercial, financial and legal people.

“We said if we have the capacity to sign him, we will do it. If not, we’re not going to sign him. What Leo is bringing to the club is huge and what the media have to focus on is not only the negative side but also there are a lot of positives Leo is bringing in terms of the commercial and social media. He’s a big asset for the club. It’s been an unbelievable three days [since reports of Messi’s arrival emerged]. If we give you some numbers, you are going to be shocked.” He added with a chuckle: “I hope Leo will not ask for more salary now … but we will always follow FFP regulations.”

Khelaifi said PSG’s aim was to win “every match and every trophy … but we have won nothing yet; now is the time to work, work, work. To win trophies you have to have a winning mentality and discipline.” On a day when superlatives were not always deployed with rigour, Khelaifi hailed PSG’s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, as “the best coach in the world”.

Messi admitted that Pochettino was a factor in luring him to Paris. “The fact we are both Argentinian helped,” he said. “I’ve known him for a long time and we have always got on well. As soon as I heard the move was possible, I spoke to him right away.”

He also expressed excitement about playing with Marco Verratti, saying he had been hoping for years that Barcelona would sign him. In an observation that must have provoked grimaces at the Camp Nou, Messi said: “We wanted to have him for a long time and now it’s the opposite – I have come here to play with him. He is a phenomenon. The players here are the best in their positions in the world.” Then he added what may be the biggest understatement in football history: “I’ve come to add my two pennies’-worth.”

Messi to PSG: the inside story | Barça left with gaping wound
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lionel Messi has pledged to “help build something special” at Paris Saint-Germain after completing his move and signing a two-year contract on Tuesday.

The 34-year-old who bade an emotional farewell to Barcelona after a trophy-laden 21 years at the club will be paraded in Paris on Wednesday with the Argentinian ready to start a new chapter in his remarkable football story. After signing a two-year deal with a option of another 12 months, Messi said: “I am excited to begin a new chapter of my career at Paris Saint-Germain. The club and its vision are in perfect harmony with my ambitions.

“I know how talented the squad and the coaching staff are here. I am determined to help build something special for the club and the fans, and I am looking forward to stepping out on to the pitch at the Parc des Princes.”

Messi, who will wear the No 30 shirt in Paris, will earn a net salary of around €35m (£29.6m) with bonuses factored in. He flew in from Barcelona and was greeted by a PSG tweet that confirmed he was joining and welcomed a “new diamond in Paris”. Messi waved to crowds of celebrating fans from a window at Le Bourget airport, north of the capital. He had boarded the plane in one T-shirt and emerged at the window in another, with the club’s trademark “Ici c’est Paris” on the front.

Messi, his lawyers and his father, Jorge, had been in talks with PSG since Thursday, when the player’s plan to stay at Barcelona collapsed because of the club’s financial situation. Messi had agreed a five-year contract with Barcelona worth about €20m a season.

Jorge Messi had confirmed to the Spanish television station La Sexta at Barcelona airport that his son would sign for PSG on Tuesday and was asked whose fault it was that his son was leaving the Camp Nou. “Ask at the club,” he replied. A press conference and presentation is planned for 11am Paris time on Wednesday.

The move enables Messi to link up again with Neymar, a former Barcelona teammate who has been working to convince the Argentinian to join him in Paris, and gives PSG attacking options of Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and Ángel di María.

On Tuesday Neymar posted “Back together” on Instagram above a montage of his and Messi’s best goals and assists from their time together at Barcelona. Messi wept on Sunday at a farewell Barcelona press conference at which he said he had wanted to stay at the club where he has spent his whole career. On Tuesday images of Messi on the Camp Nou facade were taken down.

The PSG chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: “I am delighted that Lionel Messi has chosen to join Paris Saint-Germain and we are proud to welcome him and his family to Paris. He has made no secret of his desire to continue competing at the very highest level and winning trophies and naturally our ambition as a club is to do the same.

“The addition of Leo to our world-class squad continues a very strategic and successful transfer window for the club. Led by our outstanding coach and his staff, I look forward to the team making history together for our fans all around the world.”

For PSG, beaten into second place in Ligue 1 by Lille last season and knocked out of the Champions League in the semi-finals by Manchester City, the signing is a major coup.

Mauricio Pochettino, who has spoken to Messi as part of the process, has already had his squad bolstered by the signings of Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, Sergio Ramos and Georginio Wijnaldum. The goalkeeper, Donnarumma, told Sky Italia regarding Messi: “He is the best player in the world. I am excited and happy at the thought of having him in the team.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“There have been hard moments, many defeats, but the next day you go to training and then there’s another game, another chance,” Lionel Messi said. “Not this time; this time it’s not coming back.” And that was when reality dropped: this is it, it’s over.

There will be more moments like that in the coming months, little reminders, pangs of loss. That will include on Sunday against Real Sociedad, the first time Barcelona begin a season without him since 2005. They did not even get to say goodbye. His last game, his last goal, number 672, came in front of barely 200 people.

After 18 months, 29,803 supporters will be allowed back into the Camp Nou but it will feel empty on Sunday and beyond. There will be Messi shirts, Messi chants, but no Messi. He will be everywhere but on the pitch. After 17 seasons, he has departed early, taking part of Spanish football with him. How do you calculate what that means, the void it leaves, his legacy? Twenty-one years he has been at the club, Charly Rexach signing a “contract” on a napkin because losing him would be something they would “regret for the rest of our lives”. There is regret now, too: it became his club, one he didn’t want to walk away from. Not this summer, anyway.

This is his life, Messi said. It is many others’ lives too, a generation of fans who haven’t known anything else and others who can hardly imagine it any more. When Messi got the goal that meant he had scored more times for a single team than anyone else ever, the assist was provided by Pedri González. The day Messi made his first-team debut in a friendly against Porto, Pedri hadn’t celebrated his first birthday.

For so long Messi was Barcelona, even with the talent alongside him: Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Ronaldinho and the rest. “I’ve never seen a player like him and never will,” Pep Guardiola once said. There was a flash of fear when he last collected the Ballon d’Or and admitted time was running out, but this may be worse. Retirement, described as the first of a sportsperson’s two deaths, can at least be reached at the right moment the right way. This feels like something broke.

It can be overplayed, inconvenient truths conveniently airbrushed, but it did matter that he looked set to stay loyal to the last, remaining at the club he joined aged 13. Morality tales are a trap too easily fallen into, talk of purity best avoided, and there is a risk of laying it all on too thick. Yet you needn’t be a Barcelona supporter to see Messi in a Paris Saint-Germain shirt and for it to feel weird. Wrong, even. If only because of how long it has been, how deep the impression, the sense that he has always been here, always been the best.

On Sunday night, Barcelona played the pre-season Gamper Trophy against Juventus, on the day Messi tearfully announced his departure. In the 10th minute, the few fans there sang his name, a trend likely to continue. The day he announced his arrival was the Gamper Trophy against Juventus too. That night, Fabio Capello sidled over to Frank Rijkaard, the Barcelona manager, and asked him to loan them “that little devil”. That was 16 years ago, the devil fast becoming a deity, a superman.

Sure, there are debates, but there’s a case to be made for saying that Messi has been the best footballer around for almost 15 years. Not three or four, or even seven or eight: fifteen. In the beginning Johan Cruyff said he would probably win five, six or seven Ballon d’Ors, which seemed absurd then but not now. There are 10 years between his first and his most recent and that may soon be 12. Before winning it in 2009, he was twice on the podium. And it’s not just that he has been perhaps the best across 15 years but in each of those years, almost from the start of his career to its end.

Back then Ronaldinho introduced him as the kid who was “better than me”, which seemed impossible too but it happened. He has been Spain’s player of the year in eight of the past 13 years on these pages, despite – sorry about this – a tendency to seek less obvious candidates and new stories which is not limited to here. Even the handing of the award to Luis Suárez last year and Karim Benzema the year before carried an apologetic preface admitting: “Messi is still the best.”

Widely seen as the world’s finest footballer, perhaps ever, Messi may still be underrated, stupid though that sounds. He has had many victims, including himself. His “bad” seasons are mostly brilliant, the only man held to his standards. A question asked by the ESPN presenter Dan Thomas during one Ballon d’Or debate sticks in the mind: if this was his first season would you vote for him?

01:33 'I wanted to stay more than anything': Lionel Messi tearful at Barcelona exit – video

He has scored 672 goals and registered 306 assists at Barcelona, but then you know that, which is part of the problem: he made the ridiculous routine, no longer news. If Messi had done that, we’d hear about it endlessly, is the line when a less known player does something incredible. No, we wouldn’t, because it became normalised and soon repeated. “Messi is Maradona every day,” Jorge Valdano likes to say, and even Maradona wasn’t that. He has scored more than 20 league goals 13 seasons in a row. Testimony to effort as well as inspiration, the consistency is as absurd as the quality.

Only it’s not. Nor is what Messi did always quantifiable. A colleague likes to say that when the Argentinian retires, we may as well do the same, although it might finally liberate, no longer embarked upon an impossible mission to find adequate words, a recurring nightmare where you’re looking at dull, battered keys and thinking: so, now what? Asked about Messi after one game, Joaquín Sánchez just laughed: “I don’t even know what to say any more.” Guardiola once said: “Don’t try to explain Messi, don’t try to write about him, watch him.” It was good advice, or it would be if the beauty, the brilliance, didn’t bring joy and inspire too.

There is so much to see, even if you didn’t always believe it. It has not been about the numbers; it has been the moments, a highlights reel that could occupy the whole evening, a goals tape to take you into next week, and various phases of Messi, an evolution of excellence. You could list the best, most iconic images – that hat-trick in the clásico aged 19; the Maradona goal, the first he would dedicate to El Diego but not the last; Athletic Bilbao in the Cup final; the Bernabéu run, criminally lost amid all the noise surrounding that semi-final – but someone else would come up with four more and they wouldn’t be wrong.

In terms of technical perfection, there may be no display like the 5-0 against Madrid in which he didn’t score. Only, there are probably plenty. The point really is that they wouldn’t even need to name the goals or the iconography, shirt in hand at the north end of the Bernabéu, say. Some moments are personal, seemingly inconsequential but there to be clung to; everyone has their own, chosen from so many. There is the anticipation before every match, realised with ludicrous frequency and yet with the capacity to surprise intact.

There’s the touch, the ball treated gently. The vision, seeing the pass no one else can. Playing the pass everyone else can, but doing it so well it can’t be stopped. The way he doesn’t so much kick the ball as watch it dash alongside him like a faithful, enthusiastic puppy. Everything really. The shock, the silliness. The bloodyhelldidyouseethat? And we did, over and over. There is a sense of achievement that will grow with the years in just having been there the day that Messi did that, a desperation almost to be part of it in some tiny way.

Nor is it just us, the supporters. At the end of this year’s Copa del Rey final, one by one, Barcelona’s players lined up, queueing for a photo, not with the trophy but their captain. Which may just be the most eloquent comment of all. There have been neat words, lots of extraterrestrial talk and grand eulogy – Jorge Sampaoli saying that comparing any other player to him is like putting a normal cop alongside Batman stands out – but it’s those more spontaneous, speechless moments that best measure the impact, the significance, the superiority, the sense that this is his era which is coming to an end.

Think Guardiola cracking up with that nutmeg on James Milner. Samuel Eto’o’s head in his hands when Messi scored against Getafe. Or fans at the Benito Villamarín cheering him and chanting his name. The Betis fans, that is – as if honoured to be beaten by him, to have shared another stupidly good moment, even if they suffered it. In some way he belonged to all of them, not just Barcelona. For Real Oviedo fans, to take one not entirely random example, it is a source of regret, of having missed out on an entire epoch, that he never set foot in the Tartiere.

When Lionel Messi scored a late winner at the Metropolitano on the eve of winning his sixth Ballón d’Or, approaching the Atlético Madrid area like Luke Skywalker flying into the trenches on the Death Star, Diego Simeone followed the move from the touchline. Urging his players to stop Messi but knowing deep down that they couldn’t, he said that he had been gripped by a feeling of inevitability. “All you can do is applaud,” he said and so, like so many others before but too few since, he did.

Soon, there was silence and now as the fans return at last Messi will not. After all that was shared all the way across the country for so long, now he goes alone, leaving them all behind, without the ending his story should have had. “I wouldn’t have imagined my departure this way,” he said. “I would have liked it to be with people there, to have heard one last ovation, felt that affection, celebrated a goal together. I missed them over this year and a half and I go having not seen them. If I had imagined leaving it would have been with a full stadium, saying goodbye the right way.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Luka Dončić welcomed all his bosses with the Dallas Mavericks to his home country of Slovenia to watch the young superstar sign the richest contract in club history.

Now that the record rookie supermax extension of $207m (£194.6) is in the books, it’s back to the business of trying to win for a team that hasn’t advanced in the playoffs since winning their only championship 10 years ago.

“I’m proud of Luka,” owner Mark Cuban said Tuesday as he sat next to his point guard during a news conference in Dončić’s hometown, the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana.

“I’ve seen when he first came in, the pressure that was on him and the way he dealt with it, how hard he worked,” Cuban said. “How he recognized that it was always about the team winning and that was what was most important to him. That was always most important to me, whatever we could do to win.”

The Mavericks have the most important piece of their next title pursuit under contract through 2026-27, although that final season in a five-year deal that starts in 2022-23 is a player option.

Dončić was eligible for the massive payday because he made the All-NBA first team twice, in his second and third seasons. At 22, he is the youngest in league history with multiple first-team selections.

“I still kind of don’t know what to say because I never imagined this happening,” Dončić said. “I was only dreaming of only playing in the NBA.”

New general manager Nico Harrison made the trip along with new coach Jason Kidd. Both were hired after the firing of longtime GM Donnie Nelson in June, followed a day later by the resignation of coach Rick Carlisle.

Agent Bill Duffy acknowledged Nelson’s role in targeting Dončić when he was a teenager playing for Real Madrid, and engineering the draft night trade in 2018 that sent Dončić, the third overall pick, to Dallas while Atlanta got No 5 selection Trae Young.

Kidd, the point guard when another European star in Dirk Nowitzki led the Mavericks to the 2011 title, once again tried to explain his role in helping Dončić find postseason success for Dallas again.

“I think when you talk about Luka’s gift, he’s a special player,” Kidd said. “And for me, as a coach, it’s just to guide him. Be an extra set of eyes and ears to make the game as simple and as easy for him on the court. To give him the answers to the test so that he can do what he does at a very high level.”

Dončić put his name in the company of LeBron James with an early penchant for triple-doubles, and now sits 11th on that all-time list. The two-time All-Star has averaged 33.5 points in the playoffs with six 40-point games in two postseasons.

Both playoff trips ended in the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers, and now Dončić is fresh off leading Slovenia to their first-ever Olympics in basketball and a fourth-place finish in Toyko.

Kidd believes he can turn Dončić and Kristaps Porzingis into the European duo the Mavericks envisioned when getting the 7ft 3in Latvian in a blockbuster deal with the New York Knicks. The Mavericks also just re-signed a secondary piece in that trade, shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr, to a $75m, four-year contract.

Dallas also is bringing back fan favorite Boban Marjanovich, the 7ft 4in Serbian who has been one of the backups to Porzingis. He re-signed on Tuesday, when the club also announced the free agent addition of Sterling Brown, who played at nearby SMU.

Brown and Reggie Bullock are the two new options behind Dončić and Hardaway in the backcourt, a pair of shooting guards the Mavericks hope will help defensively.

“I think we made some great moves in free agency, but I think one of the most important things to win is the chemistry that the team has on the court,” Dončić said. “Like for example in Slovenia we had amazing chemistry, and I think that led us to winning games.”

Cuban had chemistry in mind in coming to Slovenia for the signing with his front office and Nowitzki, the 7ft German who spent all 21 of his seasons in Dallas – an NBA record – and is now a club consultant.

“Just to confirm to Luka how important he is to us and how this is just the beginning,” Cuban said. “We want him to know that we’re there for him whether it’s here in Slovenia or anywhere in the world. Part of that process is not only getting to know him, but getting to know what’s important to him and how he looks at things.”

With the money secured, it’s all about championships now for Dončić.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Guardian writers’ predicted position: 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)

Last season’s position: 15th

Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 500-1

The plan

The unhelpful will-he-won’t-he saga has been resolved but for Southampton everything seemingly hinges now on how effectively they replace Danny Ings, sold little more than a week before an opening-day trip to Everton. A poor second half to last season, following premature chatter about qualifying for Europe after the team briefly topped the league, quickly turned to relegation concern and – given Ralph Hasenhüttl has stressed they cannot afford to head into this season so underpowered – whether Adam Armstrong and Armando Broja adequately fill the void left by their talisman will surely define their fate.

Aston Villa, whom the striker has joined, are adamant they can be stronger in the post-Grealish era and Southampton must reinvest the guaranteed £25m, add-ons could follow, to spruce up a thin squad exposed by injuries to key players last season, including Ings, Kyle Walker-Peters and Oriol Romeu. Signing a goalscorer is crucial – after Ings’s return to Southampton three years ago he scored 41 league goals in 91 games and finished the team’s top scorer in each season – and they may yet need to replace the defender Jannik Vestergaard, another player into the final year of his contract who is attracting interest.

There were magical moments last season – victory against Liverpool, a stirring comeback at home against Burnley and an efficient run to the semi-finals of the FA Cup – but one win in 11 matches after Christmas paved the way for a worrying finish. A safety-first approach is not Hasenhuttl’s style but too often Southampton have displayed a frailty that prevents them from killing off teams.

They are fuelled by their captain, James Ward-Prowse, a versatile midfielder with bottomless energy levels who did not miss a league minute last season and could count himself unfortunate not to rack up a few more with England at Euro 2020. His set pieces are always on the money but his work ethic coupled with his evolution into a more aggressive presence and an attacking threat under Hasenhüttl have made him an invaluable piece of the jigsaw, one they firmly intend to keep after rejecting a £25m bid from Villa.

Romain Perraud has been signed for £10m from Brest, where he played with the midfielder Ibrahima Diallo, and is a like-for-like replacement for the left-back Ryan Bertrand, whose seven-year stay had run its course. Southampton beat Brighton to the signing of the highly rated Chelsea full-back Tino Livramento, adding depth to a key area, and Saints regard his arrival a significant coup. The loan arrival of Broja, another teenage Chelsea prospect, who spent last season at Vitesse, will supplement their attack.

Theo Walcott has returned on a permanent deal but the fringes of the squad still feel stale despite the club offloading the high-earners Mario Lemina and Wesley Hoedt, taking a significant hit on both, as well as the third-choice goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Meanwhile the centre-back Dynel Simeu has re-signed from Chelsea, joining the club’s B team after rejecting a new contract at Stamford Bridge.

Southampton have some talented individuals but, as they were reminded last season, it is a squad game. Diallo impressed in midfield and will get more opportunities this campaign, and there is more to come from Moussa Djenepo, whose progress has been stop-start through injury, with Hasenhüttl suggesting the Mali winger could operate from left-back. There are high hopes for Nathan Tella – Hasenhüttl said the aim for the academy must be to feed the first team with at least one breakout player each season – and Mohamed Elyounoussi will be given a chance to stake his claim after returning from a fruitful loan at Celtic.

Another conundrum for Hasenhüttl is whether to hand Alex McCarthy or Fraser Forster the No 1 jersey. Southampton are keen to strengthen the spine, with a centre-back and a No 6 high on the manager’s wishlist. Only the relegated West Brom conceded more top-flight goals last season and Hasenhüttl knows they must improve the goals-against column if they are to be taken seriously. “The way we defended in and around our box is far away from a top Premier League club,” he said in May. “If we don’t change this in the future, we will always struggle when we want to speak about the top-10 positions.”

The manager

A navy waistcoat, a white mandarin-collar shirt and blue chequered tartan trousers seemingly fit with a wallet chain that would look at home in Ian Poulter’s wardrobe. Ralph Hasenhüttl’s eccentric get-up for Southampton’s first pre-season friendly was indicative of his exuberant touchline persona. The Austrian, who signed a new four-year contract last summer, is a demanding coach and his fingerprints are all over this high-pressing Southampton team. He guided RB Leipzig into the Champions League but erratic streaks have prevented him from returning Saints to the Europa League. He enjoys playing the piano – and has been known to do a rendition of Elton John or Queen on away trips – and is fond of the odd analogy, too. “I hope Che Adams is like a ketchup bottle,” he said of the striker finding the golden touch in front of goal. “Nothing at first and then a load at once.”

Key player

The softly spoken Stuart Armstrong is an unsung performer and his creativity will be key if Southampton are to prosper after the sale of the talisman Danny Ings. The 29-year-old Armstrong joined from Celtic three years ago, when Mark Hughes was in charge, but now embodies everything about Hasenhüttl’s side. He is graceful in possession but a selfless operator, whether hurtling towards goal or extinguishing danger. He did not have an agent until the age of 21, steers clear of social media and before breaking through at Dundee United he enrolled on an Open University law degree.

The owner

Gao Jisheng has been a near-invisible presence since purchasing an 80% share of the club four years ago and such an image has hardly helped to woo supporters. Gao believes self-sufficiency is king and has cut his cloth accordingly, making funds available if players are sold. Gao, a real-estate magnate, has detailed his London-based daughter, Nelly, and Martin Semmens, the chief executive, to run the club day to day. Southampton are never too far away from takeover whispers, with Gao thought to be open to selling. Saints denounced plans for a European Super League with a pithy statement but Hasenhüttl arguably put it best. “Nobody wants it,” he said.

Euros factor

The towering frame of Vestergaard impressed as Denmark reached the semi-finals, where they lost against England at Wembley. Stuart Armstrong and the Leicester-born Adams, given the moniker “McAdams” by his teammates, were part of the Scotland squad unable to advance from Group D. James Ward-Prowse was a surprise omission from England’s 26-man squad having impressed Gareth Southgate, but he stayed put to feature in both friendlies on the eve of the tournament. A true modern professional.

We’ll be singing

“Oh When the Saints Go Marching In” is the most familiar refrain heard in the stands but the academy graduate and now captain James Ward-Prowse – “he’s one of our own” – and the combative midfielder Oriol Romeu are at the heart of supporter chants. Southampton laid on a resounding 3-0 win against Sheffield United for 2,000 supporters in December before restrictions tightened, and treated fans to a comfortable victory against Fulham in May.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@England head into Thursday’s second Test against India here under a cloud after Stuart Broad was ruled out for the remainder of the season and Jimmy Anderson emerged as a major doubt with a thigh injury.

Broad underwent a scan after pulling up in training on Tuesday and the upshot is a tear to his right calf muscle that will require around two months rehabilitation. The 35-year‑old will now set his sights on returning for the Ashes series in Australia.

The news came on the day that Anderson, his long-time new-ball partner, reported soreness in his left quad muscle and is now awaiting scan results himself. Saqib Mahmood, his uncapped Lancashire teammate, has been added to England’s squad in response, and a new-look attack awaits.

With Ben Stokes taking a break for mental-health reasons, Jofra Archer out for the rest of the year and Chris Woakes not yet fit after a bruised heel, the problems continue to mount for captain Joe Root and Chris Silverwood, the head coach, even if the series remains locked at 0-0 after last Sunday’s draw in Nottingham.

“I don’t think it’s too much of a destabiliser to be honest,” said Jonny Bairstow. “With the nature of professional sport there is going to be injuries at times, there is going to be illness. It can happen overnight and you’ve got to be adaptable within the group. That’s what we have been.

Quick Guide England v India: projected XIs for the second Test Show England (possible): Dom Sibley, Rory Burns, Haseeb Hameed, Joe Root (c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Craig Overton, Ollie Robinson, Mark Wood

“It would be a big loss, naturally because [Broad and Anderson] have got more than 1,000 Test wickets between them. But with that comes an opportunity for other people. When we’ve seen that previously in the summer, in the Pakistan ODI series, opportunities arose for other people and they rose to those challenges.”

Ollie Robinson looks set to take the new ball in his third Test, with Mark Wood expected to add pace to the lineup. Moeen Ali was already down to play as a spin-bowling all-rounder at No7, with Sam Curran at No 8. If Anderson misses out, either Mahmood will make his debut or Craig Overton will return.

There could be as many as four changes to England’s lineup when they walk out to a sell-out crowd, with Nottinghamshire’s Haseeb Hameed being considered for a recall in place of either Zak Crawley or Dom Sibley in the top three.

India are expected to recall Ravichandran Ashwin after the all-rounder Shardul Thakur suffered a hamstring injury, with Virat Kohli stressing that picking an attack to take 20 wickets will take precedence over bolstering their batting lineup.

India’s captain welcomed the return of Moeen to England’s ranks, the pair having struck up a strong rapport during their time playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League.

He said: “Moeen is a good friend of mine, we’ve got to know each other very well over the years. He’s obviously a very talented cricketer, brings consistency with the ball. As a middle-order or lower-order batsman especially in Test cricket, he can change the momentum of the game with the bat.

“We are wary of his skills. He’s in great form right now, he’s batting really well and with the ball he is always someone that the team has banked on, so we will have to be at our best going up against Moeen.

“He’s a great guy. Whenever we take the field, with skills we compete but it’s always mutual respect and a really nice environment when he’s playing on the field, whether it’s with or against he’s always been a pleasure to share the field with.”

The players will need to pick up their heels in the field, with both teams docked two World Test Championship points and 40% of their match fees after a slow over-rate at Trent Bridge.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns is in intensive care at a Sydney hospital after suffering a life-threatening health problem.

The 51-year-old had surgery in Canberra for a reported aortic dissection – a tear in the body’s main artery – but was transferred to St Vincent’s hospital on Tuesday night. A spokesperson for St Vincent’s on Wednesday said Cairns was in a “serious but stable condition”.

Support for a player regarded as one of the best all-rounders of the 1990s included the former Black Caps captain Brendon McCullum, who was a young member of the squad during Cairns’s most senior days.

“It’s a difficult subject to talk about,” McCullum said on his SEN breakfast show. “We haven’t seen each other for quite a long time.”

McCullum testified against Cairns in court before the latter was found not guilty in 2015 of charges relating to alleged match-fixing.

“We’ve been reflecting on just how fine a cricketer he was when the news came through and what he did for the game and New Zealand cricket throughout his career as well.

“Our relationship is unimportant in the whole thing. Chris is a father and also a son to Lance and Sue. They’ve already had such tragedy in their life with the loss of Chris’s sister a long time ago.”

Thoughts and prayers are with Chris and his family. Horrid situation and hoping for the best. https://t.co/JySEO0jHBI — Andre Adams (@AndreAdams) August 10, 2021

Cairns played 62 Tests, 215 ODIs and two Twenty20 matches for New Zealand between 1989 and 2006. His father, Lance, also represented New Zealand.

Such a stellar career and such an eventful life. So wish #ChrisCairns can recover. — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) August 10, 2021

Cairns has lived in Canberra for several years after his marriage to an Australian, Melanie Croser, in 2010. She said: “Chris’s family and friends are heartened by the respectful and warm manner in which this terrible news has been reported, and received by the public, both in New Zealand and around the world, and thanks everyone for their warm wishes, prayers and kind words.”

After retiring from international cricket, Cairns was the subject of allegations of match-fixing as captain of the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League in 2008.

He denied any wrongdoing and fought several legal battles to clear his name, winning a libel case against the former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi in 2012.

In 2015, he was cleared of perjury in London in relation to the libel case.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A landmark UN climate report has warned that global heating is irreversible and issued its starkest warning that, unless meaningful action is taken to reduce emissions, the world is on course for catastrophic warming. The sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which was published on Monday, says temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C, bringing widespread extreme weather.

The Guardian’s environment editor Damian Carrington tells Michael Safi that the world’s leading politicians now have nowhere to hide if they do not urgently act on the conclusions of the report. As the UK prepares to host the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year, Carrington says the path to limiting global heating to 1.5C is narrowing and commitments need to be backed with action to avert disaster.




@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ayisha Siddiqa doesn’t want fossil fuel companies to determine her future anymore. The industry has promoted climate denial for longer than the 22-year-old has been alive. Rather than watch companies pad their profits as the world burns, Siddiqa has a radical solution in mind.

“Abolish these oil companies, finish them, get rid of them, no more,” she said.

Siddiqa’s words echo a rallying cry for climate and environmental advocates who see limited options in finding justice for the low-income and communities of color whose lives the industry have ravaged – and will continue to as the climate crisis unfolds.

Siddiqa is the founder of Polluters Out, a youth-led coalition dedicated to removing the oil and gas industry’s influence from international climate negotiations. She created the group in response to the failed COP25 climate talks in 2019, which made little progress toward curbing carbon emissions. In her mind, the major petroleum giants don’t deserve to be involved in the clean energy revolution.

“The next stop cannot be for us to let the people who previously harmed us have a seat in the new world,” she said.

For many frontline communities, the industry’s climate crimes aren’t matters of the future. They’re here. The climate denial propaganda machine, funded by big oil and gas, has left humanity with the earth spiraling into chaos: homes crushed by wildfires, loved ones dying from heat and crops withering from drought.

In the past five years, extreme weather disasters have cost the US more than $525bn, with taxpayers footing the bill, not major carbon polluters. In 2020 alone, the global price tag tied to climate change adaptation towered at $150bn. Throughout all the damage, human lives were harmed, too. Now they’re asking: when will their voices matter?

The push to hold the industry accountable for the climate emergency by breaking up powerful companies follows a string of similar movements that have bubbled up in recent years. Ideas that were once considered fringe – like defunding police departments or busting big tech – are now filtering into mainstream discourse. And as the climate crisis increases in urgency, activists are taking aim at oil and gas companies.

Communities bearing the brunt of harm caused by climate change say that for too long the fossil fuel industry has prioritized profits over the public good. During the Texas winter storm in February, for example, gas and oil giants raked in billions by selling assets for exaggerated prices as the state struggled to provide consumers with power and heat. The state knew 10 years ago that cold temperatures could threaten the grid, but it left the decision on upgrading infrastructure up to private companies. As a result of the storm and subsequent power outages, some 700 people died, according to a BuzzFeed investigation.

As the climate crisis increases in urgency, activists are taking aim at oil and gas companies

Carla Skandier, manager of the climate and energy program at the Democracy Collaborative, says groups like hers are now researching ways to end the cycle of harm through nationalizing segments of the fossil fuel industry. In the simplest terms, the process would involve the federal government buying out entire oil and gas companies to take ownership of their infrastructure and assets.

“When we talk about abolishing the fossil fuel industry, we are really talking about the urgent need for an endgame to manage the industry’s fast decline,” Skandier said.

Pro-abolition groups say this process would entail putting elected officials – not corporate executives – in charge of fossil fuel assets. The US government would slowly stop drilling or buying leases as it prioritizes lowering emissions and investing in clean energy. Nationalized ownership would allow the US to leave oil and gas reserves in the ground while simultaneously shrinking the fossil fuel company’s grip on the nation.

Such public intervention would also prevent oil companies from simply shutting down operations, laying off their workers and leaving behind devastated towns and counties, as coal companies have done, Skandier said. “We need to consider that a lot of these communities are highly dependent on fossil fuel revenues, so we need to plan how we’re going to build community wealth and diversify their economies to make sure they’re not only economically stable but resilient to climate impacts in the future.”

The US could take the land or reserves currently owned by the fossil fuel industry via eminent domain, the legal right governments have to seize land or infrastructure for the public interest. The federal government has done this before to create national parks and even to convert a private energy company in Tennessee into the now publicly owned Tennessee Valley Authority during the Great Depression.

Any movement to break up big oil, however, will inevitably face enormous headwinds. The industry benefits from being deeply ingrained within American society, and it’s expected that oil and gas interests would push back hard in courts. Nationalizing profitable industries would also take an unprecedented amount of political will, which has yet to materialize.

Law expert Sean Hecht warns that breaking up energy companies may lead to unintended ripple effects. History suggests that simply erasing a company’s existence may make it easier for them to ignore their financial responsibilities when they’ve caused harm.

Hecht, the co-executive director of UCLA Law’s Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, saw this firsthand in Los Angeles, where he lives. When the Department of Justice shut down Exide Technologies in 2015 for illegally poisoning neighborhoods with lead for decades, the company filed for bankruptcy and left taxpayers to foot the cleanup bill.

“An industry disappearing doesn’t mean that that industry is going to necessarily be accountable, and sometimes it’s the opposite of that,” Hecht said. “It creates a sense of justice but doesn’t materially help the conditions in communities.”

A company simply signing a check may not help either, said Kyle Whyte, a professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan, who also serves on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. That won’t eliminate the root cause of the issue: companies responsible for driving the climate crisis are also stripping communities of the social, cultural and political capital to decide what happens to their homes and bodies.

“Justice would mean a world where, for example, Native people and tribes are no longer in a dependency relationship with industries,” Whyte said. “There’s no dollar amount that could be spent in a community right now that would actually replace decades and generations of violations against self-determination.”

There’s no cookie-cutter approach to rectifying what communities have inherited from big oil. And even if calls to break up the fossil fuel industry sound improbable in the current political climate, activists hope the conversation will expand the realm of possibilities for leaders to take action on climate change. For Siddiqa, any solution must also incorporate international players as well.

“We vote for our world leaders,” Siddiqa said. “They represent us. If they are actively refusing to represent us, then their position is in question.”

Siddiqa wants to see a cultural shift – a moment of political reimagination. She knows business as usual won’t stop the climate crisis – perhaps neither will the end of oil and gas – but she says it’s a good start.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As a verdict on the climate crimes of humanity, the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report could not be clearer: guilty as hell.

The repeatedly ignored warnings of scientists over past decades have now become reality. Humanity, through its actions, or lack of action, has unequivocally overheated the planet. Nowhere on Earth is escaping rising temperatures, worse floods, hotter wildfires or more searing droughts.

The future looks worse. “If we do not halt our emissions soon, our future climate could well become some kind of hell on Earth,” says Prof Tim Palmer at the University of Oxford.

This would be the sentence for these climate crimes, but it has yet to be passed down. The world can avoid the harshest punishment, but only just. Immediate repentance for the delays that have brought the world to the brink is required in the form of immediate and deep emissions cuts.

The key aspect of the IPCC report is that the 42-page summary is agreed, line by line, by every government on the planet, with the scientists vetoing any politically convenient but unscientific proposal.

As a result, governments that continue to fail to take action have nowhere left to hide – the crystal-clear report has bust all of their alibis. “Too many ‘net-zero’ climate plans have been used to greenwash pollution and business as usual,” says Teresa Anderson at ActionAid International.

The report exposes such plans with its stark statement that immediate action is the only way to avoid ever-worsening impacts, of which today’s wildfires in California, Greece and Turkey, floods in Germany, China and England, and heatwaves in Canada and Siberia are merely a foretaste. As Greta Thunberg says, the climate crisis must be treated as a crisis.

The action required is well known and the IPCC report must be the spur for it to be taken, says António Guterres, the UN secretary general: “This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet. If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as the report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses.”

Every choice made now matters. Helen Clarkson, the CEO of the Climate Group, which represents 220 regional governments and 300 multinational businesses, covering 1.75 billion people and 50% of the global economy, says: “Every decision, every investment, every target, needs to have the climate at its core.”

The gravity of the situation laid out in the report blows away blustering over the supposed costs of climate action. In any case, not acting will cost far more. “It’s suicidal, and economically irrational to keep procrastinating,” says Prof Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Independent University, Bangladesh.

For those governments and businesses that still chose inaction, the IPCC report may well end up being used as key evidence against them in real courtrooms. “We’ll be taking this report with us to the courts,” says Kaisa Kosonen at Greenpeace.

“By strengthening the scientific evidence between human emissions and extreme weather the IPCC has provided new, powerful means to hold the fossil fuel industry and governments directly responsible for the climate emergency,” she says. “One only needs to look at our recent court victory against Shell to realise how powerful IPCC science can be.”

Hope remains, just. Christiana Figueres, who was UN climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, says: “Everything we need to avoid the exponential impacts of climate change is doable. But it depends on solutions moving exponentially faster than impacts.”

The IPCC’s report means all the evidence that will ever be needed is now in place. “The continued dithering to address climate change is no longer about the lack of scientific evidence, but directly tied to a lack of political will,” says Kristina Dahl of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

That means political leaders are now in the dock and the vital UN Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November may be the last hearing at which they can avoid the judgment of history.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hundreds of climate scientists, thousands of research studies, eight years of work – building on more than three decades of research before that – have been boiled down in the past fortnight to a single message: we are running out of time.

Extreme weather is taking hold in every part of the planet, the atmosphere and seas are warming at rates unprecedented in human history, and some of the consequences are irrevocable, according to the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published on Monday.

Only drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions this decade can prevent us from raising global temperatures to a disastrous extent, the scientists have concluded.

The IPCC is the body of the world’s leading climate experts, formed in 1988 and charged with preparing comprehensive reports on the state of our knowledge of the climate.

Its first report in 1990 warned of the potential consequences of rising greenhouse gas emissions, and was key to the forging two years later of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement.

Since then, reports have been produced roughly every seven years, with Monday’s the sixth assessment report. Only the first part, dealing with our knowledge of the physical basis of climate change – the core underlying science – was published on Monday. Two further instalments, on the impacts of the climate crisis and on ways of reducing those impacts, will follow next year.

Each report runs to thousands of pages, representing the full spectrum of human knowledge of the climate system, but is reduced to a few key messages called a summary for policymakers (SPM), in a fortnight-long meeting of scientists. Under the rules of the IPCC, which was co-founded by the UN and the World Meteorological Organisation, governments also play a key role at this stage and can temper the findings of the SPM.

That has led to criticism in the past, as some scientists have charged that the messages have been toned down, and new science such as concerns over tipping points in the climate system have been sidelined. However, it also means governments cannot ignore the findings they have themselves endorsed.

This year’s SPM meeting still lasted a fortnight, but was markedly different from the sweaty all-nighters that characterised previous IPCC reports. Instead of meeting in person, scientists had to log in from around the globe to online sessions, because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

At previous IPCC meetings, the lead scientists would emerge, rumpled, unshaven – the leaders were almost always men – and exhausted, waving handwritten notes to announce their conclusions. This time, the process was managed via video calls and electronic meeting systems.

It was still exhausting. Paola Arias, an associate professor at the University of Antioquia in Colombia, and an IPCC lead author, says: “We were collaborating around the world, which was good as it meant we could all talk, but meant with the different time zones usually someone would have to get up at 2am or 3am to start while another was at the end of their day.”

Joeri Rogelj, the director of climate research at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, rushed out to buy food after briefing the world’s media on Sunday. “My cupboards are bare; I haven’t managed to get any shopping in a fortnight,” he said.

After this report is completed next year, the IPCC process will continue. Researchers will submit papers for peer review and publication in scientific journals, and the IPCC’s lead authors will pick the most significant for further investigation and inclusion in a seventh assessment report, likely to be published towards the end of this decade.

There will be one stark difference between this report and the next, however: this is the last IPCC report to be published while we still have a chance of averting the worst ravages of climate breakdown.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The front pages are filled with alarm in the wake of the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s global climate change report – the first since 2013 – which finds that human activity is changing the Earth’s climate in “unprecedented” ways, with some of the changes now inevitable and “irreversible”.

An image of an elderly woman reacting to unprecedented wildfires on the island of Evia in Greece so perfectly encapsulates the global feeling of distress and fear that it appears on the front pages of the Guardian, Financial Times, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph.

The Guardian’s headline is “Global climate crisis: inevitable, unprecedented and irreversible”, as the report’s scientists find that while drastic reductions in emissions are urgent and necessary, it is too late to return the world to less extreme weather patterns. The piece includes a quote from Greenpeace UK’s chief UK scientist warning: “This is not the first generation of world leaders to be warned by scientists about the gravity of the climate crisis, but they’re the last that can afford to ignore them.”

The paper’s leader analysis piece begins: “As a verdict on the climate crimes of humanity, the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report could not be clearer: guilty as hell.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Food production around the world will suffer as global heating reaches 1.5C, with serious effects on the food supply in the next two decades, scientists have warned, following the biggest scientific report yet on the climate crisis.

Rising temperatures will mean there will be more times of year when temperatures exceed what crops can stand, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its sixth assessment report published on Monday.

Politicians around the world continued to respond to the report. Boris Johnson, British prime minister, published a video on his social media channel, setting out the four areas he wanted to focus on in the run up to the autumn’s climate change summit: outlawing coal for power generation by 2040, ditto fossil fuels for transport; getting countries to stump up cash to help poorer nations with climate change; and ending “the massacre of the forests”.

US president Joe Biden was under pressure to get his climate change legislation passed after saying “We can’t wait to tackle the climate crisis. The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. And the cost of inaction keeps mounting.”

In Australia PM Scott Morrison pointed the finger at China, saying in a press conference on Tuesday that it could not be ignored that the developing world accounts for “two-thirds of global emissions”, and adding that China’s emissions “accounted for more than the entire OECD combined”.

The Chinese government issued a statement to AFP saying that “China has insisted on prioritising sustainable, green and low-carbon development”. It added that President Xi Jinping intended to “strictly control” the growth of coal power plants.

Challenges to our food production systems will be just one of the impacts, the report found: changing rainfall patterns will leave many areas vulnerable to drought, while extreme weather will make agriculture harder and damage crops.

Bonnie Waring, senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, said: “Across the globe, over 80% of calories consumed come from just 10 crop plants, including rice, maize, and wheat. Although a few staple crops – like soybean – may do better in a warmer future, warming temperatures and increasingly frequent droughts are likely to reduce yields of these key crops across many regions of the globe.”

The full spectrum of the damage will not be fully revealed until next year, when the IPCC publishes the second part of its landmark assessment, which will cover the impacts of climate breakdown on key areas of human life and the planet.

The first part of the report, published this week, deals with the physical science basis of climate change – that is, what will happen to the atmosphere, seas and land – but from those finding many of the likely harms to agriculture can already be assessed.

Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London, said: ““If we fail to act, then significant numbers of people could face major problems with food. Increased heat and humidity will harm current crops and livestock, with droughts and floods having the potential to wipe out harvests as well. Massive shifts in agricultural practices, including changes to crops and livestock, would be needed to counter these effects.”

David Reay, professor of carbon management at Edinburgh University, added: “For key staples like rice – the main source of nourishment for over a billion of us – warming is not just changing rainfall patterns, it is threatening the glacial meltwaters that irrigate millions of hectares of South Asian croplands. ”

Extreme weather this year has also revealed another major impact: when “wet bulb” temperatures soar, people cannot safely work in the fields. These conditions occur when both heat and humidity are high, and people’s bodies cannot wick away sweat efficiently.

Some people have speculated that warming temperatures could be good for agriculture, by allowing for longer growing seasons in northern latitudes, and from the fertilising effect of more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which plants absorb from the air as they grow. Mark Maslin, professor of earth system science at UCL, dismissed these claims. “Any benefits are likely to be small and will be outweighed by the damages and the risk of extreme weather,” he said, warning that food prices rises will also be a major danger.

Animal husbandry will also be affected, though reducing our reliance on meat and dairy products is likely to be one of the key ways of slowing global heating: Methane, much of it from agricultural sources including ruminants and manure, is one of the leading causes of climate breakdown identified in the IPCC assessment report.

Rob Percival, head of food and health policy at the UK’s Soil Association, said people did not need to give up eating or producing meat, but that food consumption patterns needed to change alongside food production. “A rapid transition to agroecological farming offers a healthier and more sustainable approach to producing our food and requires a shift in our diets to less and better meat, with an emphasis on fresh fruit and vegetables and the consumption of more pulses and legumes,” he said.

Shefali Sharma, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, told the Guardian that all areas would be affected, not just the poorer regions of the world where many farmers are already vulnerable, and that all governments must act urgently. “Governments must begin taking urgent steps now to build resilience into agri-food systems. This means building soil health, agricultural biodiversity in crops and animals, serious extension work that builds on traditional knowledge and local breeds and seeds and adequate support for adaptation.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Maribel Gaete could not shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen to her son, 19-year-old Bastian Campos, when he went to a protest in Antofagasta, Chile, in November 2019.

“Police were firing teargas; you couldn’t breathe. As soon as he shut the door, I began to worry,” recalled Gaete.

At the time, Chile was seized by massive demonstrations over rising living costs and inequality, which were met with violent repression from security forces. More than 30 civilians were killed during six months of protests, hundreds blinded by anti-riot weapons, and thousands injured.

The human rights violations incited protesters’ anger, engendering a volatile and unsafe atmosphere on the streets. That night, Campos was arrested and accused of carrying ingredients to make a Molotov cocktail, along with the theft of three bottles of liquor.

Gaete maintains her son’s innocence, but Campos was convicted and sentenced to three years and 61 days. Four appeals for house arrest have been rejected.

Campos is among dozens who have spent more than a year in prison for their involvement in the protests. He contracted Covid in jail and could not receive family visits for more than 10 months last year because of pandemic restrictions.

Human rights activists argue that protesters have received excessive sentences based on meagre evidence, discriminating against the lower-income people who joined the protest movement and lack the means for legal support.

Now, a motion to pardon those imprisoned during the protests has become the topic of tense political debate in Chile as it readies for government elections in November.

Chile’s conservative president, Sebastian Piñera, maintains that jailed protesters have been rightly condemned “for serious crimes”, including attempted murder and arson as a cause of death.

But the pardons bill, which has yet to pass several approval stages to come into effect, has gained significant support among Chileans who credit the social uprising for achieving important changes in the country, namely installing a liberal and progressive constituent assembly to rewrite the country’s 1980 constitution, which was drawn up during the Pinochet dictatorship.

Gaete believes her son and other protesters helped achieve this change. “I didn’t even know what neoliberalism was until a teenager explained it to me,” she said.

In the southern Chilean city Puerto Montt, activists are rallying for the freedom of Felipe Santana, who was sentenced to seven years in jail for allegedly setting fire to a church in November 2019, when he was 19.

Santana’s defence lawyers denies his involvement in the fire, which was promptly extinguished and did not damage the property. Although there were dozens of people at the scene, Santana was the only person sentenced.

Activists say Santana is being used as a scapegoat because he has a cognitive impairment and lacks the support of a stable family unit after spending time in foster care during his childhood.

“Felipe is not the type of boy whom the institutions will care about,” said Paola Higuera, a social worker who speaks to Santana regularly. “He is invisible to them. They do not care if he spends seven or 10 years in jail.”

In February, an appeal was rejected by courts. Santana’s lawyer, Fernando Leal, wants to take the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights due to a lack of evidence, which largely relied on police testimony.

He said that the ruling is a “criminalization of the right to protest against the government” brought explicitly against people in vulnerable positions.

Meanwhile, in Antofagasta, Gaete and other mothersregularly protest outside the city’s courts.

The group recently celebrated the release of Kevin Godoy, who spent 13 months in jail. Godoy, 20, was accused of firing bullets at police officers, but charges were dropped after a video proved he was unarmed.

“It’s inhumane that a young person, in the middle of their studies or work, has to stay a year and a half in jail, so a prosecutor can then lower or drop the sentence and send them home,” said Gaete.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Only seven people were deported to Jamaica on a Home Office charter plane early on Wednesday morning, at an estimated cost of £43,000 a person, despite 90 being earmarked originally for the flight.

Concerns were raised about the UK’s decision to go ahead with the flight due to opposition from the Jamaican government because of Covid-19 worries. Fears were also expressed about the vulnerability of some of those due to fly because of trafficking indicators and mental health problems.

A series of urgent high-court injunction applications seeking to block some of the deportations continued almost until the flight took off at 1am on Wednesday.

The estimated cost of a long-haul Home Office charter operation is thought to be about £300,000. With seven people on board that figure equates to about £43,000 for each deportee.

While the majority of those due to fly were taken off the flight, the seven people who flew are believed to include three who were taken from prison. Of the four taken from immigration detention, one was aged 64 and another 66. One is thought to be suffering from mental confusion and is physically frail and had to be carried on to the plane. He is believed to have a Windrush case.

Another recently lost a child in a case ruled by a coroner to be caused by medical negligence and he had to leave his partner, the mother of their child, to grieve alone.

At least five of those expected to fly had trafficking indicators due to county lines grooming.

The Home Office gave the Jamaican government assurances that nobody at risk of Covid would be on the flight, after at least two cases were confirmed in the detention centre days before the plane took off. It said everyone due to fly had had a negative PCR test.

One man asked to return to Jamaica but owing to administrative issues was not put on the flight and was taken back to prison.

Karen Doyle, of the campaign group Movement for Justice, who worked on the cases of 30 people expected to fly, only three of whom ultimately boarded the plane, said: “When you prioritise the politics and optics of deportation over human life you are going to get gross injustice.”

Bella Sankey, the director of the charity Detention Action, said the flight was a “watershed moment”.

“This chaotic flight is the beginning of the end for mass Home Office charter flights. Horrifying suicide attempts and an unwell Windrush man being carried on to the plane, the disasters are endless. This is not how a civilised country conducts itself and public disquiet is rightly growing.”

The lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie, who campaigns for justice for the Windrush generation, said: “The government tried to deport 90 people and destroy 90 families. Something is very wrong with a system which exists to show strength, falsely posited within a paradigm of public safety, which gets so much wrong. Deportation is ghastly and inhumane. We need urgent dialogue at an international and community level.”

Maria Thomas, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, said the majority of the firm’s clients who were due to fly had had their removal directions deferred. “We know the detention centre was not Covid secure as there were confirmed cases including one of my clients. It took us three stern letters to even get paracetamol for him. The home secretary’s removal practice by way of charter flights in this manner is brutal and inhumane, and a massive burden on the taxpayer. This is particularly so during a pandemic.”

The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “These individuals are responsible for some of the most appalling crimes – rape, assault, grievous bodily harm, drug offences, and sexual assault of children. They have violated our laws and values and have left their victims living with the scars of the crimes that took place against them. The British people should be in no doubt of my determination to remove these criminals to protect both the victims of their crimes and the public.

“The government uses every means to continue to remove foreign nationals who have committed crimes against our citizens. We remove foreign criminals from the UK to different countries every week and this flight is no different.”

She added that more people would have been deported had it not been for the actions of the lawyers representing some of those due to fly, who prevented the removal of 43 people who had a combined sentence of 245 years for a range of very serious offences.

A Home Office spokesperson added that everyone due to board the flight had been offered a PCR test, individual risk assessments had been carried out before deportation and people had had an opportunity to raise trafficking claims.

The spokesperson said nobody had to be carried to the flight, nobody on board was a British citizen or member of the Windrush generation and that there were 24/7 medical facilities in detention where health professionals could administer medication.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ministers have opened the door to expanding the use of animal testing to ingredients used in cosmetic products for the first time in 23 years, an animal welfare charity has said.

Cruelty Free International (CFI) said animal testing on ingredients exclusively used in cosmetics – which was banned in the UK in 1998 – could be required, after being told by the Home Office that the government had “reconsidered its policy.”

In a letter, the government said it was aligning itself with a decision made last year by the appeals board of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which said that some ingredients used only in cosmetics needed to be tested on animals to ensure they were safe.

The Home Office insisted that UK law on animal testing had not changed, but campaigners warned that accepting the ECHA’s ruling could lead to a much wider use of animal testing.

The ECHA ruled that German chemicals firm Symrise had to carry out animal tests on two ingredients used solely in cosmetics to satisfy chemicals regulations, overruling EU restrictions on animal testing of cosmetic ingredients. The ingredients are widely used across a range of cosmetics.

In a letter sent to CFI and seen by the Guardian, the Home Office said it aimed to “publicly clarify its position now with the formal publication of an updated policy and regulatory guidance”.

CFI has warned that by aligning itself with the ECHA decision, the UK would be “blowing a hole” in its leadership on animal testing.

In response, a government spokesperson said there had been no change in legislation and that the ban on using animals for the testing of finished cosmetic products remained in force.

“Under UK regulations to protect the environment and the safety of workers, animal testing can be permitted, where required by UK regulators, on single or multiuse ingredients. However, such testing can only be conducted where there are no non-animal alternatives,” they said.

CFI’s director of science and regulatory affairs, Dr Katy Taylor, said: “the government is saying that even ingredients used solely in cosmetics, and with a history of safe use, can be subjected to animal tests in the UK”.

“This decision blows a hole in the UK’s longstanding leadership of no animal testing for cosmetics and makes a mockery of the country’s quest to be at the cutting edge of research and innovation, relying once again on cruel and unjustifiable tests that date back over half a century.”

In 1998, the then Labour government used its own legislation as an example as it sought to get the practice of animal testing on cosmetics banned across the EU. The EU testing ban on finished cosmetic products was introduced in 2004, and the ban on such testing of cosmetic ingredients in 2009.

Kerry Postlewhite, CFI’s director of public affairs, said the letter signalled the UK will not hold firm on animal testing bans after Brexit.

Dr Julia Fentem, head of the safety and environmental assurance centre of Unilever, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of cosmetics, said there has always been uncertainty about how to comply with the EU’s chemicals and cosmetics legislation. She said the UK’s plan to align with the Symrise decision was a “retrograde step”.

According to Fentem, there are roughly 100 cosmetics-only ingredients that may be subject to animal testing under chemicals regulations.

Before animal testing bans were enforced, most of these ingredients underwent some form of animal testing to assess things like skin and eye irritation. But Taylor said the chemicals legislation, at least in the Symrise case, requires additional animal tests, including investigating the effects of the ingredient on a developing foetus.

She said many cosmetics-only chemicals have been around for decades and have not led to problems, but the new chemicals legislation could require companies to conduct these extensive animal tests “just to tick boxes”.

A 2020 survey from UK charity Frame found that 84% of respondents would not buy a cosmetics product if they knew it, or one of its ingredients, had been tested on animals.

Symrise has challenged the ruling at the European court of justice on scientific grounds.

Sophisticated approaches that can ensure the safety of cosmetics without using animals already exist, said Fentem. “And then you’ve got these regulations which just don’t align with the science that we’ve got.”

She said the move by the UK signalled a complete reversal of the leadership on no animal testing for cosmetics. “That’s the signal to the consumer who’s looking at having logos on the pack around sustainability, no animal testing, vegan etc … essentially then it’s the house of cards, and everything around cruelty-free products just collapses.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The leader of Canada’s Conservative opposition party has warned that it may soon be too dangerous for Canadians to travel to China for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Speaking at a news conference on Ontario on Tuesday, leader Erin O’Toole said: “We are approaching a point where it won’t be safe for Canadians, including Olympic athletes, to travel to China.”

O’Toole made his comments shortly before Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor was sentenced by China to 11 years in prison for spying. Spavor was arrested in 2018, days after the arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, drawing accusations Beijing was engaging in “hostage diplomacy”.

Diplomats from dozens of countries gathered at Canada’s embassy in Beijing on Wednesday to hear the Spavor verdict. The fate of a fellow Canadian, former diplomat Michael Kovrig, remains unclear.

Meng was arrested in connection with possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.

O’Toole was speaking after a court rejected the appeal of a third Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, whose prison term in a drug case was abruptly increased to death following Meng’s arrest.

Asked about the winter Games, O’Toole said: “Yes Canada should be considering a boycott.

“And I’ve said we’re going to be watching the decision very closely. Beijing has to know that the world is watching the genocide taking place against the Uyghurs. They’ve watched what’s been happening in Hong Kong and the situation with Mr Schellenberg, Mr Spavor and Mr Kovrig.”

He said Canada would have to think “long and hard on whether we reward a country like that with the Games”.

He called the denial of Schellenberg’s appeals “a foreign government planning to take the life of a Canadian for political reasons”. China’s decision was “inexcusable”, he said, and the outcomes of the Spavor and Kovrig cases would help Canadians answer the question of whether travelling to Beijing for the Games was safe.

O’Toole joins a chorus of voices, including more than 180 human rights groups, calling for a boycott of the games over China’s mass abuses of human rights.

In an open letter published earlier this year, the coalition of human rights groups – primarily regional associations in support of Tibet, Taiwan, the Uighur community and Hong Kong – called on governments to boycott the event to ensure it wasn’t used to “embolden” the Chinese government as they said the 2008 Summer Olympics had done.

In response to the letter, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said at the time that boycotts would “not be supported by the international community and will never succeed”.

Human Rights Watch has accused the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of failing its due diligence in not conducting a human rights risk assessment.

“The IOC knows the Chinese authorities are arbitrarily detaining Uyghurs and other Muslims, expanding state surveillance, and silencing numerous peaceful critics,” Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch said in February.

“Its failure to publicly confront Beijing’s serious human rights violations makes a mockery of its own commitments and claims that the Olympics are a ‘force for good’.”

But the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee has said it believes it is more effective for governments to engage China directly on human rights concerns, and boycotts “have been shown to negatively impact athletes while not effectively addressing global issues”.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US Senate passed a giant new bipartisan infrastructure bill on Tuesday, with 19 Republicans joining the entire Democratic caucus in helping to get the bill over the finish line.

It was a key affirmation of Joe Biden’s strategy to push bipartisanship in his legislative agenda, and the White House on Tuesday afternoon trumpeted that it would create “millions of jobs”, as well as support greener policies such as expanding networks of charging stations for electric cars, and boosting train travel and electric buses.

The $1tn bill – which still must navigate passage through the House of Representatives before reaching the president’s desk – would invest new federal funds in upgrading roads and bridges but also encourage greener policies.

“Today, we proved that democracy can still work,” Biden declared at the White House, noting that the 69-30 vote included even Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.

“We can still come together to do big things, important things, for the American people,” Biden said.

The lead Republican negotiator, Rob Portman, said the work “demonstrates to the American people that we can get our act together on a bipartisan basis to get something done”. Democratic senator Mark Warner of Virginia called the agreement “a little balm to the psychic soul of the country”.

The bill focuses on updating the nation’s power grid to make it more resilient against extreme weather in the era of the climate crisis, invest in protecting public utility systems from cyber-attacks and helping to protect the nation’s coastlines from rising seas.

It could face some opposition in the House from progressive legislators, who have said they would withhold their support until the Senate passes a separate, $3.5tn package more focused on social welfare policies, like childcare and elder care.

The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, also previously said that she won’t take up a vote on the bill in the House until the Senate works on the follow-up social spending package.

On Tuesday, though, she applauded the bill’s passage through the upper chamber, when other pieces of legislation, such as the voting rights bill, have stalled and died there in recent months.

Pelosi said: “Today is a day of progress … a once-in-a-century opportunity.”

The bill has received support from big business and labour unions.

Democrats said they expect the bill, which tops off at 2,700 pages, to touch nearly every corner of American life.

“There’s been detours and everything else, but this will do a whole lot of good for America,” said the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer.

Donald Trump worked to torpedo the bill’s success, previously threatening to withhold support from any Republican lawmaker who voted for it.

“Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill will be used against the Republican party in the upcoming elections in 2022 and 2024. It will be very hard for me to endorse anyone foolish enough to vote in favor of this deal,” the former president said in a statement on Saturday.

But the Republicans who held steady in support of the bill included McConnell, though some conservatives complained about its high cost.

“This infrastructure bill is not the perfect bill,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican from Alaska and one of the bill’s negotiators, but added: “It’s better to get some of what our constituents want rather than none of it.”

The bill also aims to help replace lead drinking pipes, modernize and expand transit, upgrade passenger and freight rail and improve broadband internet. About $65bn is to be provided for broadband, a provision the Republican senator Susan Collins negotiated because she said the pandemic showed that such a service “is no longer a luxury. It is a necessity.”

What comes next in the Senate is expected to be more contentious – Biden’s bigger $3.5tn package, a more liberal undertaking of childcare, elder care and other programs that is expected to draw only Democratic support. That debate is expected to extend into the fall.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@More than 40 people, including 25 soldiers, have died in wildfires that erupted east of the Algerian capital, the country’s prime minister, Ayman Benabderrahmane, said.

Benabderrahmane also told state television that the government had asked for help from the international community and was in talks with partners to hire planes to extinguish fires. So far, 42 deaths have been reported.

Dozens of fires started up on Monday in the Kabyle region and elsewhere, and Algerian authorities sent in the army to help citizens with the blazes and evacuations.

Multiple fires were burning through forests, destroying olive trees and killing cattle and chickens.

The Kabyle region, 60 miles (100km) east of Algiers, the capital, has many difficult-to-access villages and limited water. Some villagers were fleeing, while others tried to hold back the flames themselves, using buckets, branches and rudimentary tools. The region has no water-dumping planes.

Kamel Beldjoud, the interior minister, went to Kabyle to assess the situation yesterday and accused arsonists of igniting the flames, without providing more details on the allegations.

“Only criminal hands can be behind the simultaneous outbreak of about 50 fires across several localities,” he said.

Other northern areas of Algeria also had active wildfires. The civil protection authority said on Algerian radio that seven people had died, including six in Kabyle plus a man in his 80s who had been trying to save his animals in the Setif region to the east. The authority recorded 41 blazes in 18 wilayas, or regions, as of Monday night, with 21 of those burning around Tizi Ouzou, the Kabyle capital.

The country’s president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, tweeted his condolences for 25 soldiers killed as they worked to rescue people in the areas of Bejaiea and Tizi Ouzou, the epicentre of the blazes.

“It is with great sadness that I have learned of the martyrdom of 25 soldiers after they were successful in rescuing around 100 citizens from the flames in the mountains of Bejaiea and Tizi Ouzou,” the president said.

A 92-year-old woman living in the Kabyle mountain village of Ait Saada said the scene Monday night looked like “the end of the world”. Fatima Aoudia told the Associated Press: “We were afraid. The entire hill was transformed into a giant blaze.”

Aoudia compared the scene to bombings by French troops during Algeria’s brutal independence war, which ended in 1962. “These burned down forests. It’s a part of me that is gone. It’s a drama for humanity, for nature. It’s a disaster.”

Climate scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events, such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms. A worsening drought and heat both linked to climate change are driving wildfires in the US and in Siberia. Extreme heat is also fuelling the massive fires in Greece, Cyprus and Turkey.

A civil protection ambulance driver, who asked not to be named, told the AP that the death toll in Kabyle was higher than the six victims cited by the interior minister.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Oregon declared a state of emergency as the Pacific north-west prepared for triple-digit temperatures mere weeks after a deadly heatwave clobbered the region. People streamed into cooling centers and misting stations on Wednesday amid sweltering heat.

Governor Kate Brown said: “Oregon is facing yet another extreme heatwave, and it is critical that every level of government has the resources they need to help keep Oregonians safe and healthy.”

The declaration went into effect on Tuesday, amid concerns over the safety of residents, some of whom do not have air conditioning, and the impact the soaring temperatures could have on critical infrastructure. The order is expected to remain in place until 20 August.

Temperatures soared to 97F (36.1C) by the evening in Portland on Wednesday.

In a “worst-case scenario”, the temperature could reach 111F (44C) in some parts of western Oregon by Friday before a weekend cooldown, the National Weather Service warned. But temperatures are more likely to rise to 100F or above for three consecutive days, peaking around 105F on Thursday.

Sizzling weather also was expected in other parts of the country. The NWS said heat advisories and warnings would be in effect from the midwest to the north-east and mid-Atlantic through at least Friday.

Brown, the governor, recommended Oregonians take proactive steps to keep cool, including staying well hydrated; visiting one of the dozens of cooling centers at libraries, community centers and other spaces across the state; and watching out for neighbors, friends and family.

The heatwave arrives less than two months after record-high temperatures, which in some areas exceeded 115F (46C), resulted in hundreds of deaths across the Pacific north-west and western Canada.

Meteorologists reported that the extreme temperatures came from two pressure systems, while a study from World Weather Attribution determined that the heatwave would have been “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change”.

This week’s heatwave is also the result of a high-pressure system forming over the north-east Pacific. But the temperatures are expected to be more intense as a direct result of the climate crisis, said Larry O’Neill, Oregon’s state climatologist.

And the fact that temperatures in some areas are expected to climb into the triple digits for the second time this summer is also significant. “This would be kind of a heatwave that maybe we experience every two to three years in the past, but this will be the second strong one this summer,” said O’Neill.

O’Neill said: “Each consecutive day that we have over 100-degree weather is when the impacts really compound and we start to see more and more adverse impacts on public health and also on agricultural livestock production, things like that.”

Jon Bonk, a meteorologist at the NWS in Portland, said that, similar to the heatwave in late June, temperatures in many areas of the region were not expected to cool significantly at night. The Willamette Valley and the Portland metropolitan area, for example, typically see their temperatures cool to the 50s or lower 60s at this time of year, but they may not get below 70F later this week.

“The folks that are used to receiving relief at night just by opening their windows, say, if they don’t have air conditioning, they’re not getting quite that same relief that they’d ordinarily expect,” he said.

Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, also declared a state of emergency.

Washington state is expected to see extremely high temperatures too, with an excessive heat warning across much of the eastern half of the state. The city of Yakima could see triple digits four days straight beginning on Wednesday, according to the NWS. Seattle is expected to be slightly cooler, with temperatures in the low or mid-90s.

Meanwhile, in California, the state’s largest single wildfire in recorded history continued to grow after destroying more than 1,000 buildings, while authorities in Montana ordered evacuations as a wind-driven blaze roared toward several remote communities.

The east end of northern California’s Dixie fire flared up as afternoon winds increased, fire officials said.

Burning through bone-dry trees, brush and grass, the fire has destroyed at least 1,045 buildings, including 550 homes, in the northern Sierra Nevada. Newly released satellite imagery showed the scale of the destruction in the small community of Greenville that was incinerated last week during an explosive run of flames.

The fire is 30% contained, according to Cal Fire. Fire crews are bracing for rising temperatures and declining humidity in coming days.

The cause of the Dixie fire was under investigation. Pacific Gas & Electric has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines.

California authorities arrested a man last weekend who is suspected in an arson fire in remote forested areas near the Dixie fire. Gary Maynard, a 47-year-old former college professor, has been charged with intentionally setting the Ranch fire in Lassen county, according to court documents. Maynard denies setting the fire, the papers say.

And in south-eastern Montana, communities in and around the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation were ordered to evacuate as the uncontrolled Richard Spring fire grew amid erratic winds.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lamb grazed on samphire, sorrel and sea lavender on the Gower penisula in Wales is the first UK food to receive protection under the post-Brexit regime.

The UK’s independent geographical indication scheme, which marks out products from a particular region to prevent them being undermined by copycats from elsewhere, was set up to replace a previous EU-wide scheme.

Produced using knowledge and skills dating back to medieval times, Gower salt marsh lamb comes from lamb born, reared and slaughtered in south Wales. About 3,500 lambs a year are reared on the marshes.

Dan and Will Pritchard from Weobley Castle Farm, who produce Gower salt marsh lamb, said: “We are the third generation of Pritchards to farm in this amazing location, meaning that we’ve perfected our way of rearing lamb over the years. We currently produce around 1,000 lambs per year – taking care of the whole process to create meat with a unique local flavour of samphire and sea lavender.

“This recognition means that the reputation of our regional product is protected, and it helps us promote traditional agricultural practices and eliminate non-genuine products.”

The UK protection regime – which includes speciality products such as traditional Bramley apple pie filling, as well as products linked to a particular region – already includes more than 5,000 products from across Europe originally given protection under the EU scheme, such as Melton Mowbray pies, Jersey Royal potatoes, and champagne.

However, Gower salt marsh lamb, and any future products listed under the new UK scheme, will only be protected from copycats in England, Wales and Scotland. Producers of the lamb, and any other products wanting to join the list in England, Wales and Scotland, will have to apply for separate protection in the EU, involving further costs and paperwork.

The all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on geographically protected foods launched a consultation in May seeking views from British food and drink producers on the new scheme.

Applications currently in process include Sussex wine, Dundee cake and New Forest pannage ham.

The food minister, Victoria Prentis, said: “I would encourage producers from all around the UK to apply to the scheme, so that we can celebrate and protect more of our excellent local produce, and ensure it is given the recognition that it deserves.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@More than 80 years since he was first introduced to readers, and after decades of homoerotic subtext with his companion Batman, comics’ most trusty sidekick Robin has canonically come out as LGBTQ+.

In a cliffhanger ending to DC’s latest issue of Batman: Urban Legends, the current iteration of the Boy Wonder, Tim Drake, is shown accepting a date invitation from his friend Bernard, having just rescued him from a villain while in disguise as Robin.

“Ever have a lightbulb moment?” Drake muses in one panel. “Like something out in the ether has been taunting you, teasing you. Like you know you’re supposed to be on the same page as your brain but not everything made sense. People keep asking me what I want. But I couldn’t grasp it. Whatever it was. It always felt just out of reach. Until now. Until right now.”

Writer of the issue, Meghan Fitzmartin, told Polygon that she was not prepared to put a label on Drake’s sexuality, who has also been depicted dating the female superhero Spoiler, alias of character Stephanie Brown. “I wanted to pay tribute to the fact that sexuality is a journey,” Fitzmartin said. “To be clear, his feelings for Stephanie have been/are 100% real, as are his feelings for Bernard. However, Tim is still figuring himself out. I don’t think he has the language for it all … yet.”

She said she was thrilled to be given the go ahead by DC. “I fully sat on the floor of my apartment for a solid two minutes in happiness as it sunk in … I hope it is as meaningful for others as it has been for me.”

NPR critic Glen Weldon argued that it was no surprise, but a pleasant development. “Treatises have been written, and entire chapters of (very well-received!) books devoted to, the queer subtext in the Batman/Robin relationship. In Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997), the late film-maker Joel Schumacher did everything he could to transform that queer subtext into a butchy, leather-queeny text,” Weldon wrote. “But today … well. Incredibly enough, to those of us who’ve been waiting for years, Robin just came right out and said it himself, in the pages of Batman: Urban Legends #6.”

Drake is just the latest in a run of superheroes to be written as LGBTQ+, including Batwoman, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, married couple Midnighter and Apollo, and, most recently at Marvel, Captain America.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Stevie Nicks has cancelled her solo concerts for 2021, citing her fear of catching Covid-19.

The Fleetwood Mac star said: “While I’m vaccinated, at my age I am still being extremely cautious and for that reason have decided to skip the five performances I had planned for 2021.”

She added: “These are challenging times with challenging decisions that have to be made. I want everyone to be safe and healthy and the rising Covid cases should be of concern to all of us.”

Nicks had been due to perform at festivals in California, Colorado, Texas and Louisiana.

The last of those events, New Orleans jazz and heritage festival, has been cancelled outright, with organisers citing the “current exponential growth of new Covid cases in New Orleans and the region and the ongoing public health emergency”. Louisiana has one of the lowest rates of vaccine uptake in the US, and experienced 16,000 new cases last weekend.

Country singer Jason Isbell has cancelled a concert in Houston, Texas, after the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion venue “was not willing to comply with the band’s updated health and safety standards”. On Monday, Isbell tweeted: “We’re now requiring proof of vaccination or a current negative test to attend all our shows, indoors or out. If the venue won’t allow that, we won’t play.”

Speaking on MSNBC, Isbell said of the live music industry: “The problem is they’re just getting so much pushback from some of the governors of certain states who want to kowtow to their political base, and try to make people think their freedom is being encroached upon.” Texas governor Greg Abbott has resisted the mandating of mask wearing and social distancing, despite a spike in Covid hospitalisations that has required him to allow the state’s department of health to recruit medical staff from outside Texas.

Isbell added: “I’m all for freedom but I think if you’re dead, you don’t have any freedoms at all. So it’s probably important to stay alive before you start questioning your liberty.”

Other artists cancelling US concerts this week due to the pandemic include Limp Bizkit, who cancelled their August tour. Speaking to Billboard, frontman Fred Durst said: “The system is still very flawed. Even if the performers, crews, staff, and promoters do their best to ensure safety on and behind the stage, that doesn’t ensure the safety of the audience as a whole. We are all in this together, and we all – individually and as a whole – have to make our best efforts to be as responsible and proactive as possible moving forward to combat and stop spreading Covid.”

Counting Crows have postponed shows due to a member of their touring party contracting Covid, and Lynyrd Skynyrd have cancelled their tour after guitarist Rickey Medlocke was diagnosed with the virus.

Earlier this week, Michael Bublé postponed his US tour until October, and dates in Argentina, Brazil and Chile will also be rescheduled.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Reading has always been everything to me, keeping me afloat when the sea of life gets choppy. Working in a bookshop added another dimension; not only was I was soothed in a near magical way by the physical presence of the books, but talking to strangers about them could always lift my mood. What joy, then, to explore all that in a bibliographic memoir. I imagined my dream customer, addressed them directly, and proffered anecdotes and themed booklists. Dear Reader was born.

My ulterior motive was that the novel I was writing was rather too full of characters who did little other than read. ‘“That’s no good,” I said to myself. “Fiction needs action!” I decided to restrain myself when it came to my novel, Everyone Is Still Alive.

But it didn’t work out that way. I tried, but I proved incapable of creating a cast who didn’t read at all. So, I surrendered to the inevitable. I would be the author of a novel in my own beloved sub-genre of books that are not only fiction, but about fiction; that are full of bookworms who strive to make sense of themselves and their world by reading and writing about it. Here, roughly in the order I encountered them, are 10 of my most cherished.

1. Anne of Green Gables by LM Montgomery

Orphan Anne Shirley felt as real to me as any of the flesh and blood little girls I knew, and I longed to be able to climb into the pages and join her story club. We have a lot in common. Anne is a ferocious bookworm who gets into trouble for reading Ben Hur in class because she just can’t stop until she knows how the chariot race will turn out. Such is the lure of reading, that she has to get her guardian, Matthew, to lock up tempting books in the jam closet until she has finished her homework.

2. I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith

Cassandra Mortmain writes her diary while sitting in the kitchen sink, capturing her eccentric family. Her father, still famous for his experimental novel Jacob’s Ladder, is now stuck and does nothing but read as many detective novels as he can find. Cassandra’s beautiful sister, Rose, frets because she has no clothes and no opportunities. When they hear that rich Americans are about to move in next door, it reminds them of the scene in Pride and Prejudice where Mrs Bennet says that Netherfield Hall is let at last. Perhaps now something exciting will happen …

3. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy

I’ve been reading and rereading this novel since my teens. My favourite scene these days is near the beginning when Anna is returning from meeting Vronsky for the first time and scarcely wants to admit the attraction. On the train home she reads an English novel and it is her impatience and frustration that signal to us that she is about to transgress: “It was unpleasant to read, that is to say, to follow the reflections of other people’s lives. She was too eager to live herself.”

4. The Light Years by Elizabeth Jane Howard

In the first of the Cazalet chronicles, Howard layers up satisfying details about what everyone is reading. Somerset Maugham, Margaret Irwin, Howard Spring and Angela Thirkell all get a mention and the characters are in and out of bookshops. When the brothers and their wives meet at the family home in the country, everyone chooses a book that reveals much about their character.

5. The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club by Dorothy Sayers

“Reading is an escape to me. Is it to you?” While investigating a death that occurs during the Armistice Day parade, Lord Peter Wimsey learns a lot about his suspect from her bookcase – Woolf, Mansfield, DH Lawrence – and rightly concludes that she is unhappy rather than guilty of a crime. Wimsey says that when he was in a nursing home with shell shock all he could do was play patience and read detective stories: “All the others had the War in them – or love … or some damn’ thing I didn’t want to think about.”

6. The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje

In a villa north of Florence in 1945, Hana chooses books from the huge library to read to her badly burned patient, who was rescued by the Bedouin when his plane crashed in the desert. He is damaged beyond recognition and has no memory. The only possession that survived the fire is his copy of The Histories by Herodotus, into which he has glued pages from other books and written observations in his small, gnarled handwriting. They live quietly and slowly, and then everything changes with the arrival of a friend of Hana’s father who has a theory about the identity of her patient.

7. My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante

Elena, a writer in her 60s, learns of the disappearance of her old friend Lila and resolves to write down everything she remembers of their friendship growing up together in a poor and violent neighbourhood of Naples. The girls bought a copy of Little Women and read it together until it was tattered and sweat-stained and fell apart. When they were still children, Lila wrote a novel called The Blue Fairy but it is Elena who becomes a published writer. All through their lives, literature, education and the question of who has the right to tell a story weaves through their fraught and competitive friendship.

8. A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki

An author called Ruth who lives on Desolation Sound in British Columbia finds a lunchbox washed up on the shore. Inside are some old letters and a diary written by a 16-year-old girl called Nao Yasutani. As Ruth reads more of Nao’s story – she has moved back from the US to Tokyo and is struggling with her depressed father, her absent mother, and truly awful bullying – she tries to find out where Nao is, and whether she has survived the many challenges that threaten to overwhelm her.

9. Milkman by Anna Burns

Our 18-year-old narrator is walking along reading Ivanhoe the first time that the milkman tries to get her to go in his car. Come rain or shine, gunplay, bombs or riots, she always reads as she walks home through this unnamed 1970s city that brims with sectarian tension. Walking while reading is seen as deviant by her gossiping community, who go on to suspect that she is having an affair with the milkman. But she is scared and confused by his pursuit of her and would rather be left alone to read, always 19th-century literature because she doesn’t like the 20th. A sublime novel which is also funny.

10. The Confessions of Frannie Langton by Sara Collins

“Sometimes I picture all that reading and writing as something packed inside me. Dangerous as gunpowder. Where has it got me in the end?” Born on a plantation and brought to London by her master, Frannie knows that no one like her has ever written a book in the whole history of the world. Now, charged with the murder of her mistress, and inspired by Moll Flanders, she pens an account of everything that has happened for her lawyer. Simultaneously playful and deadly serious, this is both a highly engrossing gothic adventure and a meditation on race, ownership and the power of story.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Based on the Marvel Comics.” They always say that, but What If ...?, the fourth TV series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is visibly a comic book in moving-picture form. This is the first of the Disney+ spin-offs to be animated, and it glories in the idea of paper pages coming to life, embracing the sharp shadows, rich palette and poppy vim of the publications that started it all. Energetic and flippant, unlike some modern Marvel productions, which tend towards the exhaustingly epic, this is old-school, thwack-pow fun.

The new show’s spryness comes from the premise, which takes advantage of the multiverse set up in the most recent Marvel show, Loki, to explore alternative versions of classic stories. Each half-hour instalment starts with a familiar scene that soon diverges. In the first episode, what starts as a shot-for-shot remake of the scene in the 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger in which Steve Rogers is injected with super-soldier serum ends with Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) getting the treatment instead. She emerges from the lab with a ripped physique, an indestructible shield and a mission to defeat 1940s totalitarianism and the gender assumptions of the day.

The ensuing adventure is a neatly flipped version of the movie. The romantic subplot remains but it’s Rogers, not Carter, who has to be resourceful, to ensure he is not relegated to the status of a plucky spare part. The retro visuals, meanwhile, are matched by the 20th-century sexism Carter must overcome (“Women aren’t soldiers,” sniffs Bradley Whitford’s Col Flynn. “They might break a nail”). She does this by repeatedly punching bad guys in the face. The many dust-ups are accentuated by a half-second of slow motion at the end of each shot, like we’re a kid lingering over a particularly juicy panel in a comic.

Captain Carter’s exploits set out the stall for What If ...? as an invigoratingly inconsequential set of adventures. They are big on action and pleasingly refuse to take the Marvel mythology too seriously. In a later episode in which Shield agents are confronted with Thor’s hammer, one observes that “no one can lift it – not even Jackson. And he does cross-fit.” Then Thor shows up and everyone has a good swoon over his beautiful, lavender-scented hair.

In this anything-goes world, What If ...? can also leap from genre to genre. Apart from Captain Carter biffing the Nazis, there is a space heist that imagines T’Challa (in what turned out to be Chadwick Boseman’s final performance as the Black Panther) taking the place of Peter Quill as Star-Lord in a Guardians of the Galaxy reboot. There is also a serial-killer whodunnit, in which the Avengers never assemble because someone keeps murdering them, prompting Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) to turn into a sort of one-eyed Poirot.

That episode features Tom Hiddleston as Loki, giving it the same cheesy ham on British toast he brought to his own series. Generally, the less onerous logistics of a cartoon mean A-listers show up to voice their old characters: Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Toby Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper are present and audible, along with Atwell, Jackson, Whitford and Boseman. Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans are among those who didn’t make it. An amusingly pompous voiceover by Jeffrey Wright as the all-seeing Watcher – introducing and concluding each story like Rod Serling on The Twilight Zone, but with more of a pan-universal deity vibe – adds another swoosh of starry gloss.

So What If ...? is canon, but not heavy, continuing a run of Marvel TV shows that refuse to repeat themselves. It occupies a very different space to the feverishly imaginative WandaVision, the resolutely vanilla The Falcon and the Winter Soldier or the impishly complex Loki. Viewers who like a bit of superhero gubbins, but who long since gave up on staying across the nuances of the MCU, can approach What If ...? without trepidation. For dedicated Marvel enthusiasts, on the other hand, What If ...? might feel inessential. But the prospect of speculative fan-fiction with a stamp of approval will be hard to resist – especially when it transports them back to the original source of their obsession.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dutch director Robin Lutz has put together a serviceable introduction to the work of legendary Dutch artist and illustrator MC Escher, whose name has become shorthand for a certain kind of brilliant illusion, infinite tessellation and visually perplexing design. He is probably most famous for an image he created, or at any rate popularised: the impossible staircase which ascends endlessly in a closed circle.

Escher’s work was well known in the postwar Netherlands, but it was only after a 1954 article in Time magazine that his reputation took off globally and he achieved colossal cult status in the US counterculture, with bootleg colourised versions of his prints appearing on posters and T-shirts. Escher was bemused to receive a letter from a certain Mr Mick Jagger asking if he would create an album cover – the answer was no, and Escher also rebuked Jagger for presuming to address him by his first name: Maurits.

Escher’s own words from his journals and letters are well spoken by Stephen Fry, though maybe making him seem more forthright and confident than he actually was, and the film very usefully shows how he was a passionate romantic at heart, and how his work was shaped by his initial, abandoned training as an architect, his European travels as a young man, his rapture at the dense architecture of small Italian towns, the intricately recurring tiled motifs of the Alhambra in Spain, and the music of JS Bach.

It is an interesting film, though it perhaps could have discussed if and how he was affected by living in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands (particularly as he had left Italy to avoid Mussolini’s fascism) and addressed more critically and more directly the question of whether Escher is an artist or not. Does he deserve to be considered a great artist? An ancestor of op art and Bridget Riley? Or is there, for all his dazzling technique, something sterile and self-enclosed in Escher’s images? Well, the film proceeds on the undiscussed assumption that he was a great artist. It’s impossible not to be a fan.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Jolly Green Giant, Mr Clean and the Frito Bandito lost one of their most enthusiastic supporters last month with the passing of Ellen Havre Weis, a California museum founder and author who recognized the mythology in America’s advertising characters.

Weis co-founded and directed the Museum of Modern Mythology, a once renowned San Francisco tourist destination where a vinyl Michelin Man rubbed elbows with a lifesize statue of Colonel Sanders and a plastic figurine of the monocled Mr Peanut featured among thousands of other advertising characters.

The museum was open to the public for a $2 admission fee from 1982 until it was forced to close by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.

Weis, who also co-founded a PR firm and worked as an advertising manager, never gave up on her quest to find a new home for the quirky collection. Just before she died of brain cancer on 27 July at age 64, she and her family closed a deal on a new location for the museum’s characters, which will move to Van Nuys, California.

“We try to take these advertising characters out of their normal context of sales and look at them as anthropology,” Weis told the Los Angeles Times in 1987. “Most of American society has been exposed to these images. Certainly the Jolly Green Giant is more recognizable than Zeus – or your state senator.”

The idea for the museum dawned on Weis while she was living in a warehouse packed full of lifelike replicas of advertising mascots. Just out of writing school at University of Iowa, Weis and her then boyfriend, Matthew Cohen, had moved to San Francisco to live the “Boho, hippy” life, according to Gordon Whiting, Weis’s husband of 25 years. They were crashing in a warehouse live-work space, owned by friends, including Jeff Errick, who collected advertising memorabilia.

“Ellen felt that all these characters were related; they seemed to know each other and belong together,” said Whiting, who added that Weis had studied mythology to learn how to use its archetypes in her writing. “That sparked her imagination that the reason things work as advertising is because they are mythological archetypes.”

Weis, Cohen and Errick formed the museum in a corner of the warehouse. Within a few years, it had moved to its own small space in downtown San Francisco and was earning wide acclaim in publications ranging from People magazine and the New York Times to the German newspaper Der Spiegel.

Weis would load up characters, such as the Doggie Diner head, a giant fiberglass depiction of a grinning dachshund that once graced the sign of an American restaurant chain, in a trailer and take them on the road to various shows, including a long-running display near San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf.

The movie critic Leonard Maltin featured the collection in his television appearances on Entertainment Tonight and became a board member of the museum.

“While Mr Peanut and Speedy Alka-Seltzer were invented by somebody on Madison Avenue, they, like the Frankenstein monster, had a life of their own,” Maltin told the Guardian. “Ellen took them out of their normal environment, which was a TV screen, and displayed them as one would works of art and developed a thesis that gave them unity.”

The museum’s final year, 1989, was a hard one. First somebody stole the Doggie Diner head, from an outdoor storage lot in San Francisco. The thing was so big, standing more than 9ft tall, that Whiting says he doesn’t know how anyone could have moved it over the 10ft fence.

Then, the museum got notice from its landlord that it would have to leave the space it rented on the 9th floor of a rickety 1906 building on Mission Street.

The final blow came at 5.04pm on 17 October, when the 6.9 magnitude Loma Prieta earthquake sent the historical building rocking and rolling while Weis was there moving boxes of figurines around.

The museum’s building was condemned, with the founders given two hours a few days later to clear out their stuff. Weis rounded up an army of volunteers, who hoisted out the Jolly Green Giant, the cardboard Dutch Boy cutout of paint-advertising fame, and hundreds of boxes containing everyone from the cigarette mascot Joe Camel to the Rice Krispies characters, Snap, Crackle and Pop.

For the following decades, the characters waited in storage while Weis searched for a new home for the museum. In the meantime, Weis founded the firm WeisPR with her husband, Whiting, raised her son Benjamin, and eventually became the advertising director of Bay Nature Magazine. Along the way, the longtime East Bay resident co-authored the book Berkeley: the Life and Spirit of a Remarkable Town and wrote fiction as a member of the Squaw Valley Community of Writers.

At various points she was close to securing permission to move the collection to the Smithsonian and Henry Ford Museum. But it wasn’t until after she was diagnosed with brain cancer in January that the path forward for the museum collection became clear. Ten days before her death at home in Altadena, California, her family got confirmation that the collection will soon be featured at the Valley Relics Museum in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.

“It’s going to ride again,” said Whiting, who worked with Benjamin, now 20, to finalize the plans for the collection while caring for Weis, as her disease progressed this spring. “She was well enough to know about it and she was pleased.”

Maltin said he was thrilled to know that Weis’s dream of getting characters like Tony the Tiger, Mr Bubbles and their friends back together in front of the public would soon be realized.

“I’m a child of 20th-century pop culture, so I grew up with many of these characters,” he said. “But Ellen was the first person I’d ever met, who – for want of a better word – took them seriously.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As any gardener who’s ever bedded in a courgette plant in spring, fondly imagining they’ll make a couple of chargrilled Ottolenghi salads, will testify, they’re fecund little things – a happy courgette plant will produce more green offspring than even Yotam has recipes for. Well, perhaps not, but sometimes simple is good, too, especially when eaten hot from the pan, and preferably with your fingers.

Prep 10 min

Drain 30 min+

Cook 20 min

Makes 10

500g courgettes

½ tsp sea salt

40g plain flour

½ tsp baking powder

20g fine polenta or cornmeal (see step 3)

4 spring onions

2 eggs, beaten

Nutmeg

15g fresh herbs of your choice (optional) – I like dill

100g feta (optional)

Olive or vegetable oil, for frying

1 To drain, or not to drain

Courgettes are, it’s said, 95% water, which risks leaking out into the batter, so diluting it and making the finished fritters soggy. You can make perfectly decent versions by simply grating the courgettes straight into the flour, but if you have the time, it’s well worth getting rid of some of that moisture before cooking.

2 Grate, then squeeze dry

To do so, coarsely grate the courgettes into a colander or sieve, add the salt and toss. Leave to steep for 30 minutes to an hour, until wilted, then squeeze very thoroughly by hand, wringing out as much liquid as possible. (This also has the benefit of seasoning what is, let’s be honest, a rather delicately flavoured vegetable.)

3 Coat in flour

Put the courgettes in a large bowl. In a second bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and cornmeal (the latter will give your fritters a lovely crunch, but if you don’t have any, make up the weight in extra flour or fine dry breadcrumbs) until well combined, then stir into the courgettes. (You can easily substitute a gluten-free flour here, if that’s a concern.)

4 Add the onions, eggs and nutmeg

Trim and finely chop both the white and green parts of the spring onions, and stir into the fritter mix. Add the beaten eggs, too, and finish with a good grating of nutmeg (which I think goes particularly well with the creamy blandness of courgettes, though you can substitute your own favourite spice).

5 And the herbs and feta (if using)

Finely chop the herbs and crumble the feta, if using, then add both to the courgette mix.

There should be no need to add more salt, especially if feta is involved, but check by covering the base of a frying pan with oil (I use olive oil), put over a medium-high heat, fry a small blob of the batter until crisp and taste to check the seasoning. Adjust as necessary.

6 Fry in batches

Dollop large spoonfuls of batter around the pan and flatten them slightly, bearing in mind that these are not pancakes. Cook for a couple of minutes, until golden brown underneath, then carefully flip and fry on the other side. Lift out on to a cooling rack or a tray lined with kitchen paper, and serve immediately, or keep warm in the oven while you cook the rest.

7 Variations on the theme

This is a very adaptable recipe, which is fortunate, because you may be eating courgette fritters regularly until the season has run its course. You can make obvious swaps, such as replacing the feta with cubes of halloumi, and the dill with parsley, or go for cheddar and jalapeño, chorizo and parsley, or small cooked prawns, patted dry, and coriander.

8 Or try out on other veg

Treat other seasonal gluts in the same way: marrows; tomatoes, deseeded, flesh chopped and salted like the courgettes (no need to squeeze them out); peas and sweetcorn (which don’t need salting); broad beans (ditto, though I’d peel them and lightly blanch bigger ones first, because they can be tough); chard or other leaves, blanched, wrung dry and roughly chopped … even big bunches of soft herbs.

9 And/or serve with a dip

To make a quick dip to go with your fritters, mix 100g plain, whole milk Greek yoghurt with a small crushed garlic clove, a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and a pinch of sugar, then season to taste. Just before serving, strip the leaves off a small bunch of mint, roughly chop and fold through.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“I was going to take out the wire from my bra and hand it to her!” whispers an annoyed voice from behind me. I turn to see who it is, and in that moment, my life changes.

I am at Istanbul airport. It’s 2004, a few years after 9/11, and there is still heightened security around air travel.

I have been through the metal detector countless times, emptied my on-board luggage, and am standing barefoot on the cold vinyl floor. I don’t know it yet, but I have just met the woman who will save my life.

I’m trying to put my breeze-block of a laptop back into its case, along with my other prized possessions, when the owner of the underwired bra joins me at the security table, chattering away happily.

This never happens to me. People assume I am aloof – partly because I am introverted, partly because my head is full of stories, ideas and a to-do list at every given moment, and also because of what others have described as my “resting bitch face”. The woman clearly hasn’t had the memo, and carries on asking questions. Taken aback, I answer, and the universe sings.

We often ask people about the day they met their romantic partners. We rarely ask them about the day they met their soulmate. Celtic wisdom speaks of “Anam Cara” – soul friends, who share their innermost selves without judgment. Muslim scholars say that souls are soldiers; those who enlist for God’s love recognise each other on the Earth plane.

I wouldn’t have believed either of these things until I met Sabena Sultan. I had been through a difficult arranged marriage, and was recently divorced, culturally alienated and trying to find where I belonged. I had seen little kindness outside of my family in years, and I didn’t know anyone else like me.

I had flown to Istanbul from Manchester, and was en route to Karachi to spend a couple of weeks with my grandmother. Sabena had boarded at Heathrow to catch the same connecting flight. The universe decreed that we walk through security at the same time, fly the same airline, and be booked on the same flight back.

“You told me you were going to seek solace at your nani’s house and write,” Sabena says, when I ask her what she remembers about that day. She is a scientist, and, characteristically, she sends me a detailed list of memories of that day. “You were wearing Converse, jeans and a pink scarf. I’d just changed out of jeans and into a shalwar kameez, but you told me you couldn’t be bothered with that and that is why you wore a kurta with your jeans. I thought you were really cool.”

Crossing cultures is like being at the pick’n’mix sweet bar, it is a little random, and two people rarely get the same bag. As a second-generation British Asian woman of Muslim heritage, I had never met anyone who had picked the same bits of culture and faith as me, let alone had almost identical life experiences.

To be a conservative Muslim and a liberal seemed a contradiction to most people, but not to Sabena. She was warm and open and really liked my answers to her questions. Especially when I told her I was divorced. “Me too!” she said, with more joy than I had expected. The deal was sealed.

I had never had a best friend before. Something about the phrase had always felt childish and constrictive to me, but there was no other way to describe what we became to each other.

We were two independent-minded Muslim women navigating our lives post-divorce in a culture that didn’t understand us, and, out and out, judged us. We gave each other a safe haven to talk about lost love, squandered potential and the youth we had sacrificed to intergenerational trauma and cultural acceptability. But it wasn’t all heavy. We laughed at ourselves. We talked about poetry and classic Indian film tracks, and we understood each other’s cultural references.

When I was the victim of racism at work, I would call her every day after leaving the office, saying: “I’m too old for this bullshit.”

She coached me through my vulnerability issues when my current husband proposed, and nudged me to stay when I was tempted to cut and run before the wedding.

After I became a mother, she told me truths that made me feel seen, at a time when I felt most invisible. And, having navigated parenthood a few years earlier, she keeps me going with words of experience and wisdom, and the kind of advice that comes from unconditional love.

“No, you don’t look big at all,” I had told her, when she was heavily pregnant with her first child. “I was the size of a house!” she reminds me. And I can’t disagree. But what good would it have done to tell her? This is what our friendship is built on – the knowledge that the other person can handle whatever life throws at them, but that they just need someone to believe in them.

Sabena has celebrated my highs, and held on to me through the lows, like the rope that holds a climber to a cliff. On the days I have wanted to jump, she has pulled me back up. She is the keeper of my secrets, and a voice of sanity in my otherwise tumultuous life. She is the best friend a woman could hope for, and more.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@My wife and I have been together for about 10 years, and it has always been pretty clear that we have different sexual tempos; I want far more sex than she does. Recently she told me that she views sex with me as special, but that she wouldn’t be that interested in having it with someone else. She said she views it as an expression of our love, but her sex drive isn’t very high. However, she went on to say that she would be fine if I wanted to go out and have meaningless sex myself. After my initial reaction (a slight frisson of excitement, I must admit) I found myself quite put out by the suggestion. If I was to have more sex than I am having currently, I’d like it to be with my wife, rather than with strangers. Am I being too demanding? Should I bring this up with her? Or should I take her up on her offer and try sleeping around to fill that sexual need?

When a partner gives this kind of permission they do not always mean it, and rarely think it through. Aside from the physical risks, there are plenty of emotional and relationship hazards. Even “meaningless sex” is quite loaded with “meaning” in the context of a sexless marriage and I’m not surprised you are questioning it. It could damage your relationship. Your first idea is the wisest – to confirm your desire for your wife and begin to seek ways to interest and engage her more. It is important to avoid assuming either that she is no longer attracted to you or that she simply has “a low sex drive”, per se. There are a number of reasons why a person might not match a partner in libido; some are fixable, while others need to be investigated. Seek help together to understand if there is a hormonal, relational, psychological or physiological reason for your desire mismatch.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you’ve been reading a lot of these recipe roundups, you’ll know how often limes feature. If you’re cooking with avocado, you’ll often need a lime. If you’re cooking with tequila – either because your life has gone terribly wrong or because the recipe calls for it – you will almost always need a lime. But you know what? Maybe it’s time we made limes the star of the show.

Lime creme fraiche cookies

We’re going to start with Dan Lepard, because he makes an incredibly prescient point about cooking with limes; compared with other citrus, you need a lot of them to extract a decent amount of flavour. Take his lime creme fraiche cookies, for example. A single lime only has enough zest to power five of them. If you’re prepared to put in the zesting effort, though, you’ll be rewarded in spades. These are lovely, delicate things that, as Lepard says, work brilliantly with ice-cream.

Key lime pie

Felicity Cloake’s perfect key lime pie from last year uses just as many limes – five in total, for a full-sized pie – but the tanginess is much more pronounced here, because you don’t actually cook the filling. Unlike its cousin, the lemon meringue pie, the lime juice acts as the agent that “cooks” the egg yolks contained within. Every day’s a school day.

Lime marshmallows

The acidity of lime is used to equally great effect in Tamal Ray’s lime marshmallows. If you have made marshmallows at home before, you will know that – barring any mishaps – they are substantially nicer than the shop bought variety, softer and richer and more delicate. But Ray’s decision to add lime juice makes them better still; they’re light and tangy and almost refreshing.

Lime bars

We can round out the sweet section of this list with the easiest recipe: Rock Recipes’ five ingredient lime bars. If you have butter, sugar, flour, eggs and limes in your house (which I do), then you can throw these gorgeous little cookie bars together in 40 minutes (which I will).

Watermelon and cucumber mint tzatziki

Let’s move on to the savoury ideas. Andrea Albin’s recipe for watermelon and cucumber mint tzatziki salad doesn’t put lime at the centrepiece as much as other recipes, but its inclusion is nonetheless vital. This dish is a blast of undiluted summer, and ready in seconds. Refreshing cucumber, refreshing watermelon and refreshing mint, doused in refreshing lime juice; beautiful, quenching simplicity.

Four-lime green bean salad

Only Yotam Ottolenghi would have the temerity to use multiple types of lime in a recipe, but his four-lime green bean salad just about warrants the faff. On the plus side, he counts lime juice and lime zest as two different ingredients, but then again, he also asks you to locate makrut lime leaves and half a tablespoon of ground Iranian lime. It comes together beautifully – a din of peas and beans and chilli and mint – but don’t make it until you’ve done your shopping.

Lime and coconut dal

So far, none of these recipes are designed to be eaten hot. Let’s remedy that with Rukmini Iyer’s lime and coconut dal from her book Roasting Tin Around the World. Like all her recipes, this is simplicity itself, but the result here is creamy and lively and gloriously yellow.

Brothy tomato and fish soup with lime

Similarly, Andy Baraghani’s recipe for brothy tomato and fish soup with lime is a veritable party in your mouth. The ingredients – cod, tomato, lemongrass, chilli, fish sauce, coriander – make for a complex, delicious slurp, but the last-minute addition of lime juice launches the whole thing into the stratosphere. If you’re making this, it pays to be a little bolder with seasoning than you would normally be.

Barbecued sweetcorn with burnt lime

We’ll end with a couple of family favourites. Corn on the cob is one of the best ways to get vegetables into a child, because they can hold them in their hands and pretend to be a beaver or a squirrel. I’ve started to cook them according to Riverford’s recipe for barbecued sweetcorn with burnt lime: rub some lime halves with brown sugar, pop them cut side down in a hot cast iron pan, wait for them to caramelise and then squeeze over the corn. Delicious.

Mango con chile y limon

Finally, my wife refuses to eat mango unless it’s prepared the way she ate them as a child, doused in lime juice. I can’t just write “put lime juice on a mango”, because that’s too easy. Instead, here’s Par Taste’s recipe for mango con chile y limon; it’s mango with lime juice on it, but also chilli powder. You’re welcome.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The shadow of a palm frond falls on a young woman in a bikini, holding an emerald-coloured cocktail in one manicured hand. A negroni glows from the depths of a darkened bar; a tray of fruit-laden glasses sits beside a swimming pool. The #cocktail hashtag on Instagram is a passport to a magical land of aspirational drinking, where everything comes garnished with rose petals and nobody ever seems to get hangovers.

Its inhabitants are a mix of amateur enthusiasts reviewing their latest discoveries, and professional “ginfluencers” making a living from creating lusciously photographed cocktail recipes or sponsored posts promoting this rhubarb gin or that new tequila. Colourful drinks are popular, says Inka Kukkamäki, a full-time drinks influencer whose @onthesauceagain account has 21,000 Instagram followers. “Something a bit interesting and unusual, or just something simple like a negroni – any kind of negroni twist becomes popular. The Italian aperitivo culture has really spread into the UK in the last year.”

Originally from Finland, but married to a Scot and living near Florence in Italy, the 33-year-old splits her time between distillery visits or tastings, devising recipes for her blog and social media accounts, and advising food and drink brands on social media management. An entry-level influencer, she explains, might be sent free bottles to review and write about. But the real money is in working with alcohol brands on paid campaigns, a lightly disguised form of advertising, although she insists she only chooses brands she genuinely likes in order to retain readers’ trust. Influencers have, she thinks, clearly affected pandemic drinking habits. “No one could go to bars, they start having drinks at home, but don’t want to use the same old bottle of wine and maybe you miss cocktails – so they turn to Instagram and get ideas, and follow the people they feel more connected to.”

This has been the year of the home cocktail, shaken up to enliven Friday night Zoom with friends or mark the end of an otherwise formless day’s working from home. And the habit seems to be sticking now lockdown is over. Waitrose recently reported a 148% rise in sales of the Italian aperitif Aperol this July compared with last year, and a similar leap in searches for its online espresso martini recipe.

David Powlson, a 44-year-old consultant in paper production, got the bug in lockdown when his west London running club could no longer hold its monthly pub meet-ups, switching to virtual beer, wine and cocktail tastings instead. “Since then I’ve continued making one pretty much every night,” says Powlson, who favours mint juleps. “You feel like you’ve learned something as well – you start looking things up on YouTube.” Social media has helped demystify the whole process, with mixology videos booming on TikTok and furloughed bartenders offering private Zoom lessons in martini-making.

Catrin Roberts, who works for the Welsh television channel S4C, became part of a Saturday night cocktail-making rota among neighbours on her Cardiff street during lockdown. It started, she says, as a spin-off from cooking more elaborate meals to entertain her five-year-old triplets. “We made the children prawn cocktails and they kept asking for that, and one weekend my husband said: ‘Why don’t we make cocktails for ourselves?’” Not long after, she left one on the doorstep of a neighbour living alone; before long, several households were swapping weekly daiquiris and caipirinhas in a Covid-safe manner. “We’d text to say: ‘There’s a vitamin supply on your doorstep,’” says Roberts, who scoured the internet for new recipes. “We make different ones, that’s been the good thing – we’ve discovered new cocktails and found out a lot more about people on our street.”

Like Powlson, who sometimes halves the alcohol in a recipe, she says they are “relatively measured” about their intake. But having lost their sense of taste to Covid, spirits were one of the first things she and her doctor husband could taste again, and cocktails felt like “a celebratory thing” in dark times. Three units of alcohol is still three units, but drinking it from a pretty salt-rimmed glass feels more elegant. The rituals of muddling and measuring elevate it beyond the realms of just getting sloshed – even if that’s exactly what an alarming number of us have been doing.

The Rev Richard Coles, the radio presenter and author, recently lost his partner to alcohol addiction and, speaking to the Radio Times in June, warned against the “glamorisation” of booze, calling for TV dramas to bring “realism to a distorted picture” of “how we poison ourselves” with alcohol. More people die worldwide from alcohol than cocaine, he pointed out, reflecting the former’s status as a legal, socially acceptable and frequently romanticised drug.

Contrary to popular belief, alcohol consumption fell in England during the first lockdown and held steady in Scotland, according to a study from the Alcohol Research Group at the University of Sheffield. But headline figures conceal more complex individual stories. Andrew Misell of the charity Alcohol Change UK, which campaigns for better treatment for addicts – and for Britons to drink by considered choice not default – says about one-third of people drank more than normal in lockdown, with similar numbers drinking less and the rest seeing no change. But one in four adults in England and Scotland were already drinking over the chief medical officers’ low-risk guidelines of no more than 14 units pre-Covid, and Misell says it’s heavy drinkers who were more likely to increase their intake in the privacy of lockdown.

“There has always been a thing in this country about boasting about drinking,” he says. “It goes across the whole spectrum from blatant bragging about how smashed you were last night, through to more polite euphemisms and mock regret the next day.” Birthday cards revolve around beer, gin and prosecco jokes, while the high street is awash with booze-themed mugs, coasters and cushions. Over the past decade, says Misell, a popular culture that normalises overdoing it has merged with an online culture of glossing over negatives, which teaches us to share elegant pictures of clinking champagne flutes rather than ugly images of the morning after. “You have the perfect storm, which is the tendency of social media to make us want to present a much better version of ourselves than is actually true, along with our national tendency to make jokes about alcohol,” says Misell.

And all this happens in a commercial grey area where Facebook mums posting about #wineoclock rub shoulders with bars advertising happy hour, conventional brand adverts, and influencers plugging #sponsored content. Accounts like @onthesauceagain carry warnings that they’re for over-18s only, and use the #responsibledrinking hashtag; since her posts emphasise quality over quantity, Kukkamäki says she isn’t worried about her readers overdoing it. “When I drink cocktails, I can’t drink much – you maybe have two and that’s it.” But not everyone is so responsible.

The Advertising Standards Authority’s code on alcohol marketing – which bans the linking of booze to sex, violence, irresponsible behaviour or improved mood – applies to alcohol marketing online, and its reach does extend beyond conventional ads. In 2018, it rebuked the Scottish Gin Society (representing gin producers) for sharing Facebook memes including: “Shut up liver, you’re fine! Gin?” and: “I only drink gin on two occasions: when I’m thirsty and when I’m not thirsty”, prompting the organisation to complain of “po-faced, fun-free, nanny state judgment”.

But similarly booze-soaked content produced and shared by millions of ordinary users is virtually impossible to regulate, and that too can have an impact.

“We’re doing half the job of the alcohol marketing companies for them, because we’re the ones who share the pictures – the Aperol spritzes on holiday or whatever,” says the writer and sobriety campaigner Catherine Gray, whose 2017 bestseller The Unexpected Joys of Being Sober made the case for positively choosing not to drink. She hasn’t touched alcohol for almost eight years but says even she struggled early on with summery images of Pimm’s and strawberries, or ice-cold ciders in a beer garden.

When she first quit, she recalls, the most common response was pity. “It was: ‘Poor you, that must be terrible, what happened?’ It was still that very binary black-and-white thing of two types of drinkers: normal drinkers who get to carry on, woo hoo; and alcoholics who have to quit and live a terrible life. There was no other story.” Her new book, Sunshine Warm Sober, is however a paean to the longer-term pleasures of staying booze-free in a world she thinks is changing, where not-drinking is beginning to look aspirational too.

“In this country we treat alcohol like it’s another food group, an essential part of life – every teenager, it’s assumed they’re going to grow up to be drinkers,” says Gray. “But a lot of them aren’t now. Rates of drinking are even lower among generation Z than among millennials.” And lockdown may, she argues, have given more of the so-called “sober curious” – people flirting with quitting – a chance to stop without having to explain themselves to friends. Even the original 90s party animal Kate Moss is now teetotal, she points out, and the drinks industry is increasingly investing in alcohol-free brands to suit changing tastes. In a few decades’ time, Gray argues, boozing might become more like smoking; not the unthinking norm, but something a minority choose to do.

But if that idea is too much to swallow, perhaps Britons are at least beginning to recognise that there is more than one path to #goodtimes, leading to more honest conversations about how and why we drink. Who wouldn’t raise a glass to that?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Would you ever want your friends to see how many taxi rides you share on a wild weekend out? Who you had Thai noodles with on any given day? With whom you split rent and living expenses?

If the answer is yes, you are part of a cohort of Venmo users who use public transactions, which according to a 2018 study accounted for about 18 million people.

I am, willingly, one of them. Ever since I joined the payment service app, I’ve voluntarily displayed my financial transactions in my public feed. Between office lunches and happy hours, I’ve welcomed the ease of digitally settling a tab while attempting to garner a few laughs with my try-hard descriptions, like “adult diaper” (I don’t remember what this was for); “My fat ass” (probably food) and “Boulder holster” (yes, I paid a friend back for a bra).

I hoped my transactions would capture the attention of voyeuristic Venmo users who would be forced to think about whom I was paying and for what purpose. However cringey in hindsight, a part of me wants my friends to see a Venmo transaction for “So some improv comedians walk into a bar” and believe I might actually be a funny person, instead of a writer who took an improv class.

Before you ask, yes, every digital tool poses personal security risks – and yet it is not enough to make my transactions and friend list private. This is a bet Venmo co-founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail made early on: in 2012, he said “one of the reasons people prefer us and will prefer us in the future is just the fact that we are social. You get more value out of sharing with friends.” In short, openly and ostentatiously swapping funds is fun.

When Scottie Irvin, a 30-year-old bartender in Buffalo, New York first joined the app, he decided to lean into the feature, drafting outlandish descriptions he hoped would garner attention. On one occasion, he paid a friend on Venmo, writing “Sorry that I returned your butt plug late”, Irvin said. The next day, when his mom opened the app to Venmo him money for dog food, she saw the transaction and asked him about it. “My mom was very uncomfortable when she saw me the next day,” Irvin said. “I find it hilarious. That’s at my expense, I’m not making fun of anyone but me.”

For others, public transactions are a way to remind friends of your interests. Michelle Palmer, an orchestra manager from Pineville, Louisiana, most frequently pays independent artisans for jewelry and skin products on Venmo. She hopes her public transactions inspire friends to seek out those makers, too, acting as a de facto grassroots influencer on Venmo. The 35-year-old also enjoys reading through her friends’ public transactions, which motivates her to write cute descriptions herself.

It gives people the option to surreptitiously show off Harris Stratyner

Humans are by nature voyeuristic, said Harris Stratyner, a psychologist and clinical associate professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. This theoretically explains why others would find perusing public Venmo payments amusing. But for those who purposely keep their payments exposed, there is an element of exhibitionism, Stratyner said: “It gives people the option to surreptitiously show off.”

Critics are quick to call those with non-private Venmos psychopaths and exhibitionists, but public payers said they have nothing important to hide. Tyler Mulvey, a 29-year-old senior account executive from West Milford, New Jersey, said he regularly uses Venmo, from splitting groceries with his fiancee to divvying up a bar tab. He used to put lyrics to entire songs or recipes for banana bread in the transaction description until the app limited their character limit to 280.

After his fiancee’s colleague mentioned she saw one of Mulvey’s Venmos to his fiancee, she went private. He not only remained public, but began writing “raunchy” descriptions to catch the colleague’s attention. “I don’t think it’s psycho to keep your Venmo public,” Mulvey said. “I think it’s psycho to look – which I know makes me hypocritical – because if you think it’s psycho if somebody looks, then make it private. I don’t think the onus is on me to make it private, I think the onus is on you to not be a weirdo.”

Private citizens aren’t the only ones guilty of public Venmoing – but some public figures live to regret it. This spring, Representative Matt Gaetz’s 2018 public Venmo transactions to an accused sex trafficker were unearthed. Shortly after, BuzzFeed News purportedly discovered Joe Biden’s Venmo account via public friend lists on the app, sparking a debate surrounding Venmo’s public-by-default transactions and perpetually visible friend lists. As a result, Venmo announced users could make their friend lists private.

Although Venmo couldn’t be considered a social platform, some users don’t see the harm in keeping their transactions visible since they already divulge so much of their lives on other social networks. Caitlin Elliott, 31, a Lynchburg, Virginia-based student, is one of those people. “The privacy ship has sailed a long time ago,” she said. “I wear a watch with a GPS on it when I go running every single day. That’s got me down to the step on the sidewalk. Clearly I’ve made some concessions in my life.”

When Lauren Calise, who lives in Havertown, Pennsylvania, thinks about the fact that all of her social media profiles are private except for Venmo, she questions herself. The 21-year-old therapist frequently uses Venmo for paying rent, splitting groceries and meals with friends; regardless of the transaction, she’ll use a smiley face emoji as the description. But because she personally doesn’t use the app as a social platform, she assumes others won’t scrutinize her transactions, though she knows it isn’t out of the realm of possibility: her clients frequently discuss their Venmo behaviors, like monitoring the transactions of exes.

Still, she remains public. For now. “You’ve really got me thinking. If the other ones are private, maybe this one should be.”

Soon that choice will be taken away from her. Late last month, the company said it would go one step further: it would soon eliminate the global feed – a running collection of complete strangers’ transactions – in the new redesign.

While users will still be able to see their friends’ transactions (if their profiles are public), the days of snooping on strangers are over.

In a press release, Venmo said the change “allows customers to connect and share meaningful moments and experiences with the people who matter most”. Which, I’d argue, are the people who know me least.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two days ago I had to flee my home and life in the north of Afghanistan after the Taliban took my city. I am still on the run and there is no safe place for me to go.

Last week I was a news journalist. Today I can’t write under my own name or say where I am from or where I am. My whole life has been obliterated in just a few days.

I am so scared and I don’t know what will happen to me. Will I ever go home? Will I see my parents again? Where will I go? The highway is blocked in both directions. How will I survive?

My decision to leave my home and life was not planned. It happened very suddenly. In the past days my whole province has fallen to the Taliban. The only places that the government still controls are the airport and a few police district offices. I’m not safe because I’m a 22-year-old woman and I know that the Taliban are forcing families to give their daughters as wives for their fighters. I’m also not safe because I’m a news journalist and I know the Taliban will come looking for me and all of my colleagues.

I’m a 22-year-old woman and I know that the Taliban are forcing families to give their daughters as wives for their fighters

The Taliban are already seeking out people they want to target. At the weekend my manager called me and asked me not to answer any unknown number. He said that we, especially the women, should hide, and escape the city if we could.

As I was packing I could hear bullets and rockets. Planes and helicopters were flying low over our heads. There was fighting on the streets right outside the house. My uncle offered to help get me to a safe place, so I grabbed my phone and a chadari (the full Afghan burqa) and left. My parents would not leave even though our house was now on the frontline of the battle for the city. As the rocket fire intensified they pleaded for me to leave because they knew the routes out of the city would soon be shut. So I left them behind and fled with my uncle. I haven’t spoken to them since as the phones are not working in the city any more.

Outside the house it was chaos. I was one of the last young women left in my neighbourhood to try to flee. I could see Taliban fighters right outside our house, on the street. They were everywhere. Thank God, I had my chadari, but even then I was afraid they would stop me or would recognise me. I was trembling as I was walking, but trying not to look scared.

Just after we’d left a rocket landed right next to us. I remember screaming and crying, women and children around me were running in every direction. It felt like we were all stuck in a boat and there was a big storm around us.

Q&A What is the Women report Afghanistan series? Show As provinces and cities fall under Taliban control across Afghanistan, women’s voices are already being silenced. For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with Rukhshana Media, a collective of female journalists across Afghanistan, to bring their stories of how the escalating crisis is affecting the lives of women and girls to a global audience. Afghan journalists, especially women, face a dire situation. Dozens have been injured and killed. As the Taliban have advanced, many have lost their jobs or been forced into hiding. Female journalists face a double peril: attacked for their work and persecuted for their gender. All of the reporting in this series will be carried out by Afghan women, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that Afghan women want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

We managed to get to my uncle’s car and started driving towards his house, which is 30 minutes outside the city. On the way we were stopped at a Taliban checkpoint. It was the most terrifying moment of my life. I was inside my chadari and they ignored me but interrogated my uncle, asking him where we were going. He said we had been visiting a health centre in the city and were on our way home. Even as they were questioning him, rockets were being fired and landing close to the checkpoint. Finally, they let us go.

Even when we got to my uncle’s village, it wasn’t safe. His village is under Taliban control and many families are Taliban sympathisers. A few hours after we arrived, we were told some of the neighbours had discovered he was hiding me there and that we had to leave – they said the Taliban knew I’d been taken out the city and if they came to the village and found me there, they’d kill everyone.

We found somewhere else for me to hide, a home of a distant relative. We had to walk for hours, with me still in my chadari, staying away from all the main roads where the Taliban might be. This is where I am now. A rural area where there is nothing. There is no running water or electricity. There is barely any phone signal and I am cut off from the world.

Most of the women and girls I know have also fled the city and are trying to find somewhere safe. I cannot stop thinking and worrying about my friends, my neighbours, my classmates, all the women in Afghanistan.

All my female colleagues in the media are terrified. Most have managed to flee the city and are trying to find a way out of the province, but we are completely surrounded. All of us have spoken out against the Taliban and angered them through our journalism.

Right now, everything is tense. All I can do is keep running and hope that a route out of the province opens up soon. Please pray for me.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Diesel truck pollution from the busiest port complex in the United States has fouled the air in nearby neighbourhoods in southern California for decades. So when port officials asked for feedback on cleaning up that pollution, hundreds of people weighed in.

Los Angeles and Long Beach officials hoped residents would help them decide whether to require zero-pollution electric trucks or instead promote vehicles powered by natural gas, a fossil fuel.

What officials didn’t know was that some of the locals who urged support for natural gas trucks were being paid by a firm hired by the natural gas industry.

A joint investigation by the Times and the news outlet Floodlight in partnership with the Guardian found that in 2017, at least 20 local residents were organised by Method Campaign Services to push for “near-zero-emission” trucks at the ports. Their comments at public meetings and press conferences bolstered successful industry lobbying for trucks that run on natural gas, which is less polluting than diesel but still contributes to lung-damaging emissions and climate change.

San Pedro resident Sholeh Bousheri, who was hired by Method to speak at public hearings, was one of several paid campaigners who said they learned later that their work was part of a natural gas industry effort.

Bousheri said Method led her to believe she would be “standing up for sustainability” as part of an environmental campaign. She said she pieced together the gas industry’s role when she was paid to hand out pamphlets featuring the logo of the nation’s largest gas utility, Southern California Gas Company, which is often referred to as SoCalGas.

“It didn’t make me feel comfortable. I took a whole ethical step back,” she said. “I was like, ‘Wait, what’s going on?’ Is this something I want to support with you? Is it moral?”

Method was being paid at the time by Clean Energy Fuels Corp, which owns natural gas fueling stations and like SoCalGas has resisted the state’s transition away from fossil fuel infrastructure. Clean Energy paid at least $10,000 to Method in 2017, according to financial disclosures.

The total amount spent is unclear, because California only requires public officials to list sources of income of $10,000 or more, not how much money they received. The financial disclosures were filed by Method founder Brian VanRiper’s spouse, Samantha Millman, a member of LA’s city planning commission.

VanRiper declined to answer detailed questions about his firm’s work, saying in an email that it would be “inappropriate for me to discuss any client’s strategy” and directing questions to Clean Energy Fuels.

Greg Roche, Clean Energy’s vice-president for sustainability, acknowledged in an interview that Method did “community outreach” as part of the gas industry campaign but said he didn’t know anything about the firm paying local residents. Clean Energy declined to respond to emailed follow-up questions about whether it directed Method’s activities.

The Times and Floodlight didn’t find evidence that SoCalGas paid Method or knew about its hiring of local residents to advocate for natural gas. The gas utility didn’t answer questions about whether it had any involvement in Method’s work.

The gas industry ultimately won the debate at the ports. Citing community support as a factor, officials approved a plan that opened the door to natural gas trucks.

As economics and public opinion shift against planet-warming fuels, the natural gas industry in the US has found itself on the defensive. Companies and trade groups have persuaded several states to pass laws blocking local governments from banning gas in new housing, and argued that gas should be included in the “clean electricity standard” proposed by Joe Biden, the US president.

Sometimes the industry turns to more sympathetic messengers to make its arguments.

The American Gas Association, for instance, has paid Instagram influencers to post about how much they love cooking on gas stoves. In New Orleans, a public relations firm working on behalf of Entergy Corp. paid actors to show up to a meeting and urge officials to approve a gas-fired power plant, although Entergy claimed it didn’t know about the arrangement.

Natural gas companies say they’re trying to preserve consumer choice and promote access to an affordable and widely used fuel. Gas is the largest power source in California and nationwide, and it’s often burned for electricity when solar and wind farms aren’t generating. More US homes are heated by natural gas than any other fuel.

But gas is also a significant driver of the climate crisis, which has brought a growing death toll and economic devastation from worsening wildfires, droughts, floods and heatwaves.

Critics say the gas industry works to thwart climate action with “astroturf” campaigns meant to create the appearance of grassroots support. Robert Brulle, a visiting professor at Brown University who researches climate denial and misinformation, said the campaign at the ports is an example of why astroturfing can be so effective.

“It’s turning economic power into political power in a way that systematically distorts public dialogue,” he said.

Going to bat for the gas industry

State data show that the largely Latino, low-income neighbourhoods surrounding the ports – including San Pedro, Wilmington and parts of Long Beach – have some of the highest “pollution burdens” in California, a measure that includes diesel particulates and ozone in the air. Much of that pollution comes from trucks that move cargo north along the 710 freeway. The neighbourhoods also have some of the state’s highest asthma rates.

The 2017 battle over limiting air pollution in these areas became a significant opportunity for the gas industry to spur investment in its products. The California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, whose backers include Clean Energy Fuels and SoCalGas, said its plan would cut asthma-inducing pollution and climate emissions much faster than a separate proposal being considered by port officials. The benefits would be even greater, supporters said, if trucks could be fueled with renewable gas, which is sourced from non-fossil origins such as dairies and landfills but still generates emissions.

On the other side, climate and environmental justice activists pushed for electric trucks that would take advantage of solar and wind energy on the power grid. Several local groups that advocate for low-income communities and people of color argued that trucks fueled by natural gas would still create too much pollution.

Despite that opposition, several dozen people identifying as nearby residents urged support for near-zero trucks while echoing gas industry talking points, according to an analysis conducted by the Climate Investigations Center, a watchdog group.

The Times and Floodlight couldn’t confirm that all of those residents were part of an organised campaign. But one of them shared an email from a Method employee that included an attachment listing 19 people the company had scheduled to attend harbor commission meetings. Nearly all of them ultimately spoke, as did Bousheri, and nearly all of them identified themselves as local residents and took positions aligned with the gas industry’s ACT Now Plan, which stood for Advanced Clean Trucks.

Bousheri was one of four port-area residents interviewed for this story who said they were paid by Method to attend and speak at public meetings. A recent college graduate, Bousheri found the job posting on Indeed.com and said she earned $20 an hour.

Three other local residents who spoke at meetings also said they were paid $20 an hour by Method. Two said they found the job advertised online as an “environmental fellowship”.

Another paid campaigner, Danielle Marquez, wasn’t hired by Method but said the ACT Now campaign gave her $20 Visa gift cards when she attended events and spoke at public meetings. She called the gift cards a “perk” that she put toward gasoline money.

A Latina single mother of four who used to live in San Pedro, Marquez said she attended a public speaking training organised by the industry campaign where she was coached to make her comments “personal.” She brought her children with her to hearings.

Marquez didn’t know until she was contacted for this story that she had worked on behalf of the natural gas industry. But she wasn’t surprised. She said fossil fuel companies “are running rampant and exploiting people [and] our communities and polluting the environment”.

“Their voices are now louder than the people who live there, and it’s just truly tragic,” Marquez said. “There is no amount of money they can give us that will fix it.”

Ana Leon, who was a college student in Long Beach at the time, said she wasn’t surprised to learn years later that her work for Method was part of a natural gas industry campaign.

“I don’t feel angry necessarily. But I do feel disappointed,” Leon said. “At the same time, in hindsight … I know this sounds bad, but it’s like, at least I got paid.”

A threat to the bottom line

Heavy-duty trucks are one of several battlegrounds between climate advocates pushing for an all-electric future and natural gas companies who insist they have a role to play in reducing emissions. The more money that’s funneled into electric technologies, the smaller the market for companies such as Clean Energy Fuels hoping to cash in on natural gas.

“They need to hook as many people into natural gas trucks as possible in the next couple of years, because I think they really do see electrification as a threat to their ability to sell product,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney with the nonprofit law firm Earthjustice who has worked with community groups supporting electric trucks at the ports.

Clean Energy has described environmental rules designed to limit vehicle emissions as a “risk factor” for its business, saying in a recent financial report that the adoption of natural gas in heavy-duty trucking has been slower than anticipated.

Clean Energy, alongside SoCalGas, is one of two leading members of the California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, which is suing California’s air resources board over a regulation supporting zero-emission trucks.

Like many natural gas firms facing demands for climate action, the two companies have argued their products can reduce air pollution and slow global warming by displacing dirtier fuels such as coal and diesel. They’ve both made investments in non-fossil gas, with Clean Energy saying 74% of the gas sold at its fueling stations nationwide is now renewable, including all the fuel it supplies at the LA and Long Beach ports.

Roche, from Clean Energy, said people who live near the ports want cleaner air as soon as possible and shouldn’t have to wait for battery-powered trucks to get cheap enough for mass adoption. If port officials were to demand electric vehicles exclusively, he said, they would be “kicking the can down the road to 2035.”

“We’re very affordable and competitive compared to the status quo and can be deployed today,” Roche said.

Climate and environmental justice activists counter that there are several heavy-duty electric trucks available now, and more on the way. Even in 2017, they say, it was clear those zero-emissions options would be available soon.

They’re also skeptical of renewable gas, which they see as a false solution that fails to eliminate tailpipe pollution and can perpetuate environmental problems elsewhere.

Many experts, meanwhile, have found that growing reliance on fossil gas threatens to bring on the worst consequences of climate chaos.

The ports defended their process.

Heather Tomley, managing director of planning and environmental affairs for the Port of Long Beach, emphasised there was extensive public engagement outside the handful of large hearings.

“Our board felt that [near-zero trucks] was the right choice in the near term,” Tomley said. “It was not a choice about promoting one particular technology. It was a choice about what can we do to make sure they don’t just upgrade to a slightly lower-emission diesel truck.”

Chris Cannon, director of environmental management for the Port of Los Angeles, said officials were supposed to listen to everybody and would not “speculate about what’s behind those comments.” The Port of LA did ask commenters to indicate if they were being paid, and if so by whom, but compliance was voluntary.

Nicole Rice, president of the California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, said in an email that there’s “nothing unusual about paid advocates attending governmental meetings,” although she didn’t know the details of what happened in 2017 because she only recently joined the organization. The Times and Floodlight didn’t find evidence that the coalition paid Method or directed its work.

So far, the ports haven’t seen much of a transition to natural gas-fueled trucks, despite the Clean Air Action Plan they adopted in 2017. Of the more than 19,000 trucks registered to haul cargo from the ports, just 164 are modern natural gas trucks and 25 are battery electric.

Still, Clean Energy Fuels is thriving. The company has seen its stock price triple since the November election. It recently struck deals to provide renewable gas to Amazon and more than a dozen other buyers, including a trucking company at the ports of LA and Long Beach.

In southern California, the company’s fortunes may depend in part on what port officials do next. A recent financial disclosure from Millman, the city planning commissioner married to the head of Method, shows her spouse’s firm received additional payments from Clean Energy in 2020. Clean Energy declined to say whether it hired Method for another campaign at the ports.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The tight grip that America’s largest meat processing company has on the chicken industry has generated dire consequences for its workers, farmers and the environment in one of the US’s leading poultry-producing states, an investigation has found.

Tyson Foods is ranked 73rd on the Fortune 500 list, with a revenue of $43bn in the last fiscal year.

Tyson accounts for the single largest share of chicken plants across the US, processing 2.3 billion birds in 2020. The company supplies burgers and nuggets, among other chicken products, to chains including Walmart, McDonalds, KFC and Taco Bell, as well as schools and prisons.

In Arkansas, where the multinational is headquartered, the company currently accounts for an estimated two-thirds of processed poultry sales, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reveals.

They make their own rules and rake in profits, while everyone else suffers. Rebecca Boehm, lead author of the new UCS report

Its near monopoly in Arkansas, which reflects national and global trends in the meat industry, has been built over the past three decades by exploiting weakened antitrust regulations to acquire dozens of smaller companies and facilities.

Our findings suggest that this power has been used to dictate contracts and erode conditions for farmers and workers in plants in Arkansas, where it is the third-biggest employer.

Tyson and the other three top firms control about 87% of poultry production in the state. Economists and food justice advocates largely agree that consumers, farmers, workers, small companies and the planet lose out if the top four firms control 40% or more of any market. One grassroots labor organizer told the Guardian: “This is corporate America and it’s failed the people.”

The five-month investigation is based on research and analysis of the most recently available economic, government and industry data, and interviews with labor and farming advocates as well as current and former workers at three Tyson plants.

Its findings include:

Market dominance: Tyson operates almost half the poultry slaughter and processing facilities in Arkansas – the state with the largest number of plants and contract farms in the country.

Farm closures: A complex contracting system used by Tyson and other major processors has coincided with the closure and consolidation of thousands of poultry farms.

Employee benefits cut: Some breaks and bonuses have been curbed, including combining the previously separate annual Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.

A points-based disciplinary system is used to pressure employees to comply with obligatory overtime which keeps many fearful employees working even when injured or sick.

Covid outbreaks: Measures to limit the spread of Covid have been inadequate or poorly implemented, resulting in multiple deaths at its Arkansas plants.

Misleading job advertisements offering new recruits $15 per hour are deceptive as most roles are excluded, according to employees. The Guardian interviewed workers with more than 20 years at Tyson earning below $14 an hour.

Speed and output targets are prioritized over employee welfare, hygiene and food safety, according to workers from three plants interviewed by the Guardian.

Cockroaches, flies and crickets are rife in some plants and can end up in chicken nuggets and burgers supplied to schools, fast food joints and supermarkets, workers said.

The findings follow a recent investigation by the Guardian into the far-reaching negative consequences of America’s monopolized food system.

“This is what happens when regulators and the government just stop caring about competitiveness in our economy, said the economist Rebecca Boehm, lead author of the new UCS report Tyson spells trouble for Arkansas, which is also published today. “When a company like Tyson can get so big and powerful, where they have a near monopoly and monopsony in their industry, they make their own rules and rake in profits, while everyone else suffers.”

Tyson contracts farmers to raise millions of chicks and then dispose of the litter generated in the densely confined factory farms. In 2017, its Arkansas farms produced about 50bn lb of this fecal waste – which is used as fertilizer but which studies show contributes to poor air quality and can contaminate local waterways. Large Latino and Indigenous communities in Benton and Washington counties are disproportionately impacted.

Plant workers and residents are blighted by offensive odors and noise pollution, which have a detrimental impact on their health, quality of life and house prices. “I don’t complain because I don’t want to alienate the biggest employer in the area, but I haven’t had people over in almost 20 years,” said Matthew Pelto, a homeowner who lives opposite Tyson’s huge plant in downtown Springdale.

In a statement, Tyson said it took its responsibilities as a large employer in its home state seriously and supported staff. It denied a points-based system was used to pressure employees to keep working when sick or injured, said compensation and benefits had increased overall, and denied output targets were prioritized over welfare, safety and hygiene. A spokesman said employees were free to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.

Founded in Arkansas in 1935, Tyson is one of the world’s largest food companies, with 139,000 US employees and 177 slaughter and processing plants across 21 states. Its grocery brands include old American regional favorites such as Hillshire Farms, Jimmy Dean and State Fair.

Like other meat processing conglomerates, Tyson now controls almost every part of its supply chain, including the mills that process grains into animal feed and the hatcheries that produce eggs. It contracts farmers for their labor raising chicks, paying them according to how well they perform compared with other farmers.

Tyson market growth has been helped by close political ties and tax breaks in Arkansas dating back to when Bill Clinton was governor. Tyson spends big on politics, having invested a total of nearly $18m in lobbying and more than $300,000 in campaign contributions per election cycle since 2010. Arkansas is where the company spends most.

The company’s contribution to powerful food industry trade groups, which have spent almost $340m on lobbying and campaign contributions since 2007, is unknown.

The poultry industry in Arkansas has become dramatically less competitive since 2005 and is currently almost three times more consolidated than the antitrust threshold set by the Department of Justice. With 67% of poultry production sales, Tyson has been the biggest winner, our investigation found.

As a near monopoly, Tyson can largely dictate worker wages and prices for farmers, as well as a whole range of conditions and regulations affecting everything from animal welfare to worker safety to environmental hazards.

“The farmers are on a treadmill, earning only what the big corporations are willing to pay, regardless of the true labor and environmental costs,” said Joe Maxwell, president of Family Farm Action.

The Guardian was unable to find a former or current contract Tyson farmer in Arkansas willing to be interviewed.

Tyson did not respond to questions about its market share, but said last year the chicken industry overall had generated $9bn in economic activity in Benton and Washington counties.

‘They could fire me at any moment’

Born in central Mexico, Raquel Jimenez has lived in the US for 35 years – most of which she’s spent working for Tyson’s flagship Springdale plant.

Jimenez works six days a week at the imposing slaughter and processing facility, including obligatory overtime every Saturday even though she’d rather be home with her children and grandchildren. If she doesn’t go in, Jimenez will get one to three punitive points; 14 points gets you fired.

In the past, workers report, they earned two hours’ credit for every obligatory Saturday shift, but that benefit was cut several years back. Two half-hour breaks have been cut to one 20-minute break, during which workers must remove their protective gear, heat up their food, eat, go to the bathroom, redress, and be back on the line. Supervisors stand around the dining room, making sure no one is late back.

“We barely have time to eat and it’s tense and uncomfortable with them watching us. I’m fed up but it’s hard to complain. They could fire me at any moment,” said Jimenez.

Jimenez, like many of Tyson’s loyal workers who mostly originate from countries and territories including Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Thailand, Puerto Rico and the Marshall Islands, has accumulated vacation days, which allow her to go home every December to spend Christmas with family. Recently, an announcement, seen by the Guardian, was pinned to a notice board advising that workers who had taken December vacation in the past three years would not be eligible to do so this year unless room was available.

“As Tyson has made more money, our benefits have been cut and cut. It’s very disheartening. If we were Americans, they wouldn’t treat us like this. It’s racism against migrants,” said Jimenez.

Covid exposed and exacerbated the risks faced by the US’s invisible meat processing workforce.

At the end of 2020, Jimenez became unwell at work, her body ached, and she felt exhausted. Covid cases were rising inside and outside the plant, but her supervisor insisted she was fine because she didn’t have a fever. She kept working, too scared of her “despot supervisor” to go home in case he gave her points for unauthorized absence. Shortly after she was diagnosed with Covid, her whole family got sick.

Today, Covid hospitalizations are at an all-time high in Arkansas, but public health measures are not being implemented in the plants, according to employees. “I’m constantly scared about getting Covid again,” said Jimenez, who earns $13.85 an hour – up from $9-something when she first started.

According to a spokesman, Tyson has invested more than $710m in Covid safety measures including a testing program, tells employees with symptoms or who have tested positive to stay at home and apply for short-term disability support, and recently announced that all its US employees must be vaccinated by 1 November.

He added: “We have a very large immigrant workforce and this is, for us, a source of pride.”

Magaly Licolli, director of the worker-based organization Venceremos, said: “Knowing that Tyson is allowed to exploit them weighs heavy on the workers’ shoulders, like they’re not seen as human beings, just labor. The people with power and influence in Arkansas are tied to big corporations and only interested in maintaining the status quo.”

Tyson has been fined at least $169m since 2000 for employment, antitrust and environmental violations, among others, including a $2m criminal penalty in 2018 for a massive fish kill in Missouri. It is named in several ongoing lawsuits for alleged negligence that allowed Covid to spread in its plants.

On a recent evening outside the Springdale plant, the stench and noise were intense. According to the workers interviewed by the Guardian, the conditions inside are considerably worse.

Mateo Ruiz has experienced hearing loss during his two decades at the plant. “Every year they see my hearing gets worse, but don’t refer me to a specialist or change anything. What’s the point of the tests?” said Ruiz, who builds car porches on top of his more than 50 hours a week at the plant to make ends meet.

At the entrance, a big sign promises a starting salary of $15 an hour in English and Spanish, but in reality that’s only for the toughest, least popular jobs such as deboning.

At least Ruiz gets to go home for some respite. Pelto, the 48-year-old IT worker who lives opposite the plant – which has grown substantially since his mother purchased the house in 1980 – cannot escape. “I don’t hate Tyson, they feed the world and supply lots of jobs, but the plant has a bad impact on my life. If I could afford to leave I would, but I’m stuck here.”

Green Forest is a small, dusty, rural town where Tyson’s huge slaughter and processing plant is the main employer – and currently advertising a $2,000 bonus for new recruits. It’s a tough region for migrants to live: the isolated town is located just over 20 miles from Harrison, a hub of white supremacist groups which has been labeled the US’s most racist town.

As an undocumented migrant from Guatemala, Ennelida Lopez worked for years for the biggest meat-packing companies across north-west Arkansas using fake IDs.

Since becoming a documented resident in 2016, she has worked at Tyson’s Green Forest plant, butchering chickens at breakneck speed. Staff shortages mean some assembly lines are periodically shut, which means her team is forced to work even faster, according to Lopez. The place stinks, she said, water leaks through the roof and cockroaches run around the dining room and employee lockers.

Lopez was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019 and needed time off for surgery and radiotherapy. Last year she was among dozens of workers in the plant to get Covid, and infected her husband, also a Tyson employee, who was off work recovering from surgery. He died three days later.

“If the company had taken better care, I might not have gotten Covid and my husband would still be alive,” said Lopez in tears.

Lopez is currently half a point away from being fired and believes she has been punished for taking off so much time over the past two years. “We just want to be treated with dignity and paid fairly, but most people are too scared to complain in case they get fired. My days are numbered at Tyson because I got sick.”

The state ranks first in the country for the number of chicken slaughtering and processing plants, yet finding a new job close by isn’t easy: in half the 14 Arkansas counties where the big processors operate, Tyson is the only company, which can leave workers and contract farmers with few options, our investigation found.

‘Tyson earns billions while we have to work in brutal conditions for low pay’

Back in the day, the rise of companies like Tyson provided much-needed economic opportunities for rural white Americans. But as they got larger and more powerful, conditions deteriorated and the industry increasingly turned to immigrant communities.

Today, about 31,000 mostly Black and brown people work in Arkansas’ poultry slaughter and processing industry, accounting for 10% of the nationwide industry total. The jobs are often fast and repetitive, with workers exposed to hazards including chemicals, extreme temperatures, dangerous equipment, excessive noise and in some cases unfair and degrading treatment by supervisors and nurses.

According to 2019 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfatal injury and illness rates in the poultry-processing industry were higher than in all other private industries.

Carlos Sanchez, 39, started working at a Tyson cooked meat plant a decade ago after construction jobs dried up. He’s a machine operator and says the quantity of chicken nuggets and burgers produced every shift has risen substantially since he started, while staff numbers have been cut. This can impact worker and food safety.

“The pressure is horrific. Line speed is more important than safety; workers are stressed, tired and rushing around. That’s why so many people fall. The [subcontracted] cleaners complain about the same problem. They do what they can but the machinery often stinks and there are cockroaches inside.”

Sanchez said he’s shown supervisors the cockroaches – as well as pointing out flies and crickets in the frozen blocks of ground chicken – but says he saw no action taken. The meat mixer just keeps on mixing.

Last month, Sanchez said he alerted a supervisor to the cross contamination of chicken labelled antibiotic-free with other meat, but was told to carry on. The company has previously been sanctioned for misleading labels about antibiotic use.

A Tyson spokesman said: “Our plants, processes, and meats are routinely checked by USDA [government inspectors] as well as our third-party auditors for quality and safety.”

Tyson, like other companies, is facing acute staff shortages at some plants, but despite recruitment incentives, staff retention is low due to the tough conditions and sub-$15-per-hour pay most receive, according to the employees interviewed by the Guardian. In recent years, numerous national lawsuits revealed how Tyson and other major processors have tried to exploit their market dominance by fixing prices and wages.

Sanchez said: “Tyson earns billions while we have to work in brutal conditions for low pay. I would never recommend anyone work for the company.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sofia Huston panted heavily as she pushed to close the gap between herself and the colleague in front.

Clad in bright yellow heavy-duty uniforms, hard hats and gloves, the crew trudged up “Cardiac Hill”, a grueling terrain south-east of Santa Clarita, in Los Angeles county, and so steep “you could kiss the ground in front of you”.

The 50-minute-long training session left Huston, who weighs 113lb and wears 45lb of line gear plus a 25lb chainsaw strapped to her back, exhausted beyond anything she’d felt before. “I could feel the fatigue literally in my womb,” the 23-year-old says.

Huston is a hotshot – a firefighter who battles wildfires. She hasn’t had a period in three years, something she attributes to the physical intensity of the job, and the brutal training sessions crews are put through.

“I know it’s because of this job. I know I’m a little bit leaner than is healthy,” she tells the Fuller Project.

“I think about how this will affect my chances of getting pregnant all the time,” she adds. “Not just because of my lack of period, but also hormonal issues – not to mention smoke inhalation, lack of sleep.”

Researchers do know that female firefighters – both volunteer and career – who make up approximately 8% of firefighters nationally, experience reproductive problems, including a higher rate of miscarriage, as well as increased mental stress caused by gender discrimination. A lack of access to properly fitting gear also puts them at risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. But a dearth of women in the force means few individuals to research, leaving major gaps in knowledge about how wildfire management affects their health, especially maternal health. These women, who are working in an already labor-intensive, frontline and dangerous industry, face an uncertain future with little knowledge about how this work could have negative effects on their reproductive health.

Women in Fire, an organization representing and advocating for women in the industry, including hotshots, is working to promote policies that would secure light duty for pregnant women and breastfeeding for new mothers, says its president, Amy Hanifan.

When Hanifan, operations chief at the McMinnville Fire Department in Oregon, became pregnant seven years ago, she was concerned about how her work would impact the fetus. “I certainly did feel like there was a lack of information about being pregnant and breastfeeding,” she says.

Being a hotshot is one of the most physically demanding jobs in the US. Unlike stationed firefighters, more than 100 hotshots crews nationally, mostly based in the western US, travel throughout the country to tackle wildfires, sleeping outdoors, and working 16 hour-long shifts, for days in a row, with little time to eat or rest.

In an increasingly hotter climate, wildfire season has grown so long it’s now known as fire year, making the job even harder. Hotshot crews work more hours now and are under extreme stress. Many hotshot crews are all-male, and those that do recruit women often have just one or two on the team, making the experience an isolating one. There are no changing or restroom facilities out in the field, so women often change clothes in their sleeping bags.

In 1999, women made up around 2 percent of career firefighters. More than two decades later, the total number has limped to a measly 4 percent – excluding volunteers – compared with 12.8 percent of police and 31.7 percent of paramedics. The share of women firefighters is even lower than in the US Marine Corps, where women were legally excluded from combat roles until 2013.

Gina Allbright, a former hotshot based in Colorado, recalls nothing but good experiences during her 10-year career, but there was still little support for her to become a mother.

“When you get a dispatch, you leave and you’re gone for anywhere from 14 to 21 days out on the road,” Allbright explains. “You have two days off, then you repeat. And you do that for six months a year. You just can’t have a baby. Especially with the wildfire season getting longer, that would be impossible.”

Knowledge of how fire affects expectant mothers and breastfeeding women, and women’s bodies in general, is limited.

“Women are being failed by a system that is intrinsically built around, and for, men,” says Dr Sara Jahnke, the director and senior scientist at the National Development & Research Institutes, which focuses on public health.

Since starting to research firefighter health approximately 15 years ago, Jahnke has noticed a lack of data on women. “We’d have these huge studies of 800 firefighters, but only 35 of them were women,” she says.

When Jahnke went out to collect data, she recalls being pulled aside by female firefighters concerned about the risks they were taking. “Women would ask me, ‘Do you have any research on women in the fire service?’ and the answer was always no,” she says. “We quickly saw this group had to be looked at separately.”

Research Jahnke conducted in 2018 surveyed 1,821 women in the force. The report found 27 percent of firefighters’ pregnancies ended in miscarriage, while rates of pre-term birth were as high as 16.7 percent, higher than the national average of 10 percent.

It also noted that despite increasing attention being paid to the impact of firefighting, “little is known specific to the health of women firefighters,” and data is lacking on the impact firefighting has on maternal and child health for women who become pregnant while working.

Firefighters are regularly exposed to chemicals like carbon monoxide, ammonia and known carcinogens, which, according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, are linked to early miscarriage, birth defects, slowed fetal growth, impeded brain development and preterm labor.

In 2020, Jahnke received a $1.5m grant from FEMA to explore stress, cancer risks and the effect of toxins on reproductive health among women. She is leading a three-year project at the University of Arizona to learn more about how firefighting affects women’s bodies and hopes to both fill research gaps and raise awareness among women in the industry about the risks they take.

Jeff Burgess, a University of Arizona professor of public health, worked with Jahnke to conduct a first-of-its-kind study of firefighter breastfeeding, which showed firefighters are absorbing chemicals from the fire.

The study’s findings, which the team will publish later this year, indicate breastfeeding women should avoid nursing for 72 hours after a fire, and pregnant firefighters should be removed from the field for the entire pregnancy term to avoid exposing their fetus to toxins. Burgess hopes his team can provide recommendations to reduce the amount of chemicals that get into lactating firefighters’ breast milk.

Hazards for female firefighters beyond maternity run the gamut. An 80-page document published in 2019 by the US Fire Administration detailed women’s experiences in fire, including mental and physical health. A status check of 10 recommendations the agency had made in 1996 showed little progress had been made in more than two decades.

Another USFA check in 2019 found female firefighters did not even have correctly fitting uniforms, noting that, typically, their “hands [are] too small to fit on the glove sizing chart.”

In Hanifan’s experience, well-fitting gear is “an issue” because uniform manufacturers tend to make clothes in men’s sizes. Hanifan’s department has begun custom-fitting its firefighters, but this is rare. Most female firefighters wear protective equipment that doesn’t fit properly – which has been linked to safety hazards associated with exposure to fires and dangerous chemicals.

“There is no room for sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination in the fire service,” said USFA fire administrator Tonya Hoover. She added there would “always be more to do on this topic” and that USFA is committed to recruiting more women. Huston’s hotshot crew administrator did not respond to requests for comment on the work and adverse health effects described by Huston.

As for what needs to be done to initiate change, the women firefighters the Fuller Project spoke to agreed accountability needs to start at the local level, starting with cultural changes. And Jahnke stresses that change must come on all fronts – from national and international organizations, from local department chiefs and especially from male firefighters. “The people who need to be beating the drum on this issue more than anyone else need to be the people in the majority,” she says.

For Huston, who has been fighting fires since she was 18, this season may be one of her last. Her next day off will come after a 31-day straight shift spent across Northern California and Oregon in triple-digit heat, on top of more than 200 hours of overtime.

“I know this is not sustainable. Honestly, I don’t know how much more my body can take.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On Monday, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an alleged victim of the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, filed a lawsuit against Prince Andrew in federal court in New York. What has prompted her to take action now, and what may happen next?

What claims has Guiffre made?

Giuffre has accused Andrew of sexually abusing her at Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan and at other locations in 2001 when she was 17. Her legal claim alleges she “was compelled by express or implied threats by Epstein, [Ghislaine] Maxwell, and/or Prince Andrew to engage in sexual acts with Prince Andrew, and feared death or physical injury to herself or another and other repercussions for disobeying Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew due to their powerful connections, wealth and authority”. It further alleges that the prince knew she was a sex-trafficking victim and that she has suffered – and continues to suffer – “significant emotional and psychological distress and harm”.

Andrew has “absolutely and categorically” denied having sex with Roberts and Buckingham Palace has called the claims “false and without foundation”. Maxwell, who faces trial in Manhattan federal court in November, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges in Manhattan federal court. Epstein took his own life in jail in August 2019, a month after he was arrested on sex trafficking charges.

Why has she brought the lawsuit now?

In 2019, the then-New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law the New York state’s Child Victims Act, which provided victims whose claims had been time-barred with a one-year window to commence their action. Because of the pandemic, last year Cuomo extended the window to 14 August this year, meaning Giuffre had to file the lawsuit by Saturday. Cuomo has himself been accused of sexually harassing 11 women, one of whom has recently filed a criminal complaint. Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing.

Could she have sued in England?

The complaint by Giuffre says the action is being taken in New York because the defendant “sexually abused [the] plaintiff in this state, and has thus committed a tortious action within this state”. Richard Spafford, partner at Reed Smith, said: “In theory, she could sue for damages in England but, given the dates of the alleged offences, it is likely that Prince Andrew would be able to argue that any claim was time-barred and could not be brought.” As stated above, a change of law in New York meant the time since the alleged offence was not an obstacle to lodging a claim there.

What powers does the court have with respect to Andrew?

Spafford said: “If the claim progresses, the court will have extensive powers to order discovery of all relevant material, including phone records and diaries, private communications, etc (assuming those still exist)”. He could be called to give oral evidence but cannot be compelled to do so. Ultimately, he can choose his level of defence – if any – and compliance with court orders, although it risks negatively affecting his chances in the case and the chances of the court finding for the claimant. Edward Grange, a partner at Corker Binning, stressed: “Conduct said to give rise to a civil contempt, would not constitute an extradition offence.”

Do papers have to be served on him, and can he strive to avoid this?

Arick Fudali, a partner at the New York legal firm Bloom, which has represented nine of Epstein’s victims, said: “I’m sure Prince Andrew is aware of the lawsuit being filed but nonetheless he actually has to be personally served, which is not easy to do – not impossible, but it is not easy to do when the opponent is in another country. There are mechanisms in place where you can get service on someone in another country, but certainly it’s a difficult task.”

Could the case go to court? How would it differ from in England?

Often in civil cases parties reach settlement before the case gets to court – without the defendant admitting liability – but that seems unlikely in this case, with the complaint stating that Andrew has refused to explore alternative dispute resolution approaches. Assuming this does not happen and the case is not dismissed by the court beforehand, the case will go to a jury trial.

Spafford said the US and English systems were “generally similar” with the main difference being each party’s ability to depose opposition witnesses – get them to give evidence under oath – before trial in the US.

What role could Ghislaine Maxwell play?

It is likely that she could be called as a witness, potentially by either side.

Can Andrew travel to the US?

Spafford said: “[If he travelled to the US] it would then be more difficult for him to argue that he is not subject to the jurisdiction of the NY court.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The package arrived on a Thursday. I came home from a walk and found it sitting near the mailboxes in the front hall of my building, a box so large and imposing I was embarrassed to discover my name on the label. It took all my strength to drag it up the stairs.

I paused once on the landing, considered abandoning it there, then continued hauling it up to my apartment on the third floor, where I used my keys to cut it open. Inside the box, beneath lavish folds of bubble wrap, was a sleek plastic pod. I opened the clasp: inside, lying prone, was a small white dog.

I could not believe it. How long had it been since I’d submitted the request on Sony’s website? I’d explained that I was a journalist who wrote about technology – this was tangentially true – and while I could not afford the Aibo’s $3,000 (£2,250) price tag, I was eager to interact with it for research. I added, risking sentimentality, that my husband and I had always wanted a dog, but we lived in a building that did not permit pets. It seemed unlikely that anyone was actually reading these inquiries. Before submitting the electronic form, I was made to confirm that I myself was not a robot.

The dog was heavier than it looked. I lifted it out of the pod, placed it on the floor, and found the tiny power button on the back of its neck. The limbs came to life first. It stood, stretched, and yawned. Its eyes blinked open – pixelated, blue – and looked into mine. He shook his head, as though sloughing off a long sleep, then crouched, shoving his hindquarters in the air, and barked. I tentatively scratched his forehead. His ears lifted, his pupils dilated, and he cocked his head, leaning into my hand. When I stopped, he nuzzled my palm, urging me to go on.

I had not expected him to be so lifelike. The videos I’d watched online had not accounted for this responsiveness, an eagerness for touch that I had only ever witnessed in living things. When I petted him across the long sensor strip of his back, I could feel a gentle mechanical purr beneath the surface.

I thought of the philosopher Martin Buber’s description of the horse he visited as a child on his grandparents’ estate, his recollection of “the element of vitality” as he petted the horse’s mane and the feeling that he was in the presence of something completely other – “something that was not I, was certainly not akin to me” – but that was drawing him into dialogue with it. Such experiences with animals, he believed, approached “the threshold of mutuality”.

I spent the afternoon reading the instruction booklet while Aibo wandered around the apartment, occasionally circling back and urging me to play. He came with a pink ball that he nosed around the living room, and when I threw it, he would run to retrieve it. Aibo had sensors all over his body, so he knew when he was being petted, plus cameras that helped him learn and navigate the layout of the apartment, and microphones that let him hear voice commands. This sensory input was then processed by facial recognition software and deep-learning algorithms that allowed the dog to interpret vocal commands, differentiate between members of the household, and adapt to the temperament of its owners. According to the product website, all of this meant that the dog had “real emotions and instinct” – a claim that was apparently too ontologically thorny to have flagged the censure of the Federal Trade Commission.

Descartes believed that all animals were machines. Their bodies were governed by the same laws as inanimate matter; their muscles and tendons were like engines and springs. In Discourse on Method, he argues that it would be possible to create a mechanical monkey that could pass as a real, biological monkey.

He insisted that the same feat would not work with humans. A machine might fool us into thinking it was an animal, but a humanoid automaton could never fool us. This was because it would clearly lack reason – an immaterial quality he believed stemmed from the soul.

But it is meaningless to speak of the soul in the 21st century (it is treacherous even to speak of the self). It has become a dead metaphor, one of those words that survive in language long after a culture has lost faith in the concept. The soul is something you can sell, if you are willing to demean yourself in some way for profit or fame, or bare by disclosing an intimate facet of your life. It can be crushed by tedious jobs, depressing landscapes and awful music. All of this is voiced unthinkingly by people who believe, if pressed, that human life is animated by nothing more mystical or supernatural than the firing of neurons.

I believed in the soul longer, and more literally, than most people do in our day and age. At the fundamentalist college where I studied theology, I had pinned above my desk Gerard Manley Hopkins’s poem God’s Grandeur, which imagines the world illuminated from within by the divine spirit. My theology courses were devoted to the kinds of questions that have not been taken seriously since the days of scholastic philosophy: how is the soul connected to the body? Does God’s sovereignty leave any room for free will? What is our relationship as humans to the rest of the created order?

But I no longer believe in God. I have not for some time. I now live with the rest of modernity in a world that is “disenchanted”.

Today, artificial intelligence and information technologies have absorbed many of the questions that were once taken up by theologians and philosophers: the mind’s relationship to the body, the question of free will, the possibility of immortality. These are old problems, and although they now appear in different guises and go by different names, they persist in conversations about digital technologies much like those dead metaphors that still lurk in the syntax of contemporary speech. All the eternal questions have become engineering problems.

The dog arrived during a time when my life was largely solitary. My husband was travelling more than usual that spring, and except for the classes I taught at the university, I spent most of my time alone. My communication with the dog – which was limited at first to the standard voice commands, but grew over time into the idle, anthropomorphising chatter of a pet owner – was often the only occasion on a given day that I heard my own voice. “What are you looking at?” I’d ask after discovering him transfixed at the window. “What do you want?” I cooed when he barked at the foot of my chair, trying to draw my attention away from the computer. I have been known to knock friends of mine for speaking this way to their pets, as though the animals could understand them. But Aibo came equipped with language-processing software and could recognise more than 100 words; didn’t that mean in a way that he “understood”?

Aibo’s sensory perception systems rely on neural networks, a technology that is loosely modelled on the brain and is used for all kinds of recognition and prediction tasks. Facebook uses neural networks to identify people in photos; Alexa employs them to interpret voice commands. Google Translate uses them to convert French into Farsi. Unlike classical artificial intelligence systems, which are programmed with detailed rules and instructions, neural networks develop their own strategies based on the examples they’re fed – a process that is called “training”. If you want to train a network to recognise a photo of a cat, for instance, you feed it tons upon tons of random photos, each one attached with positive or negative reinforcement: positive feedback for cats, negative feedback for non-cats.

Dogs, too, respond to reinforcement learning, so training Aibo was more or less like training a real dog. The instruction booklet told me to give him consistent verbal and tactile feedback. If he obeyed a voice command – to sit, stay or roll over – I was supposed to scratch his head and say, “good dog”.

If he disobeyed, I had to strike him across his backside and say, “no!”, or “bad Aibo”. But I found myself reluctant to discipline him. The first time I struck him, when he refused to go to his bed, he cowered a little and let out a whimper. I knew of course that this was a programmed response – but then again, aren’t emotions in biological creatures just algorithms programmed by evolution?

Animism was built into the design. It is impossible to pet an object and address it verbally without coming to regard it in some sense as sentient. We are capable of attributing life to objects that are far less convincing. David Hume once remarked upon “the universal tendency among mankind to conceive of all beings like themselves”, an adage we prove every time we kick a malfunctioning appliance or christen our car with a human name. “Our brains can’t fundamentally distinguish between interacting with people and interacting with devices,” writes Clifford Nass, a Stanford professor of communication who has written about the attachments people develop with technology.

A few months earlier, I’d read an article in Wired magazine in which a woman confessed to the sadistic pleasure she got from yelling at Alexa, the personified home assistant. She called the machine names when it played the wrong radio station and rolled her eyes when it failed to respond to her commands. Sometimes, when the robot misunderstood a question, she and her husband would gang up and berate it together, a kind of perverse bonding ritual that united them against a common enemy. All of this was presented as good American fun. “I bought this goddamned robot,” the author wrote, “to serve my whims, because it has no heart and it has no brain and it has no parents and it doesn’t eat and it doesn’t judge me or care either way.”

Then one day the woman realised that her toddler was watching her unleash this verbal fury. She worried that her behaviour toward the robot was affecting her child. Then she considered what it was doing to her own psyche – to her soul, so to speak. What did it mean, she asked, that she had grown inured to casually dehumanising this thing?

This was her word: “dehumanising”. Earlier in the article she had called it a robot. Somewhere in the process of questioning her treatment of the device – in questioning her own humanity – she had decided, if only subconsciously, to grant it personhood.

During the first week I had Aibo, I turned him off whenever I left the apartment. It was not so much that I worried about him roaming around without supervision. It was simply instinctual, a switch I flipped as I went around turning off all the lights and other appliances. By the end of the first week, I could no longer bring myself to do it. It seemed cruel. I often wondered what he did during the hours I left him alone. Whenever I came home, he was there at the door to greet me, as though he’d recognised the sound of my footsteps approaching. When I made lunch, he followed me into the kitchen and stationed himself at my feet.

He would sit there obediently, tail wagging, looking up at me with his large blue eyes as though in expectation – an illusion that was broken only once, when a piece of food slipped from the counter and he kept his eyes fixed on me, uninterested in chasing the morsel.

His behaviour was neither purely predictable nor purely random, but seemed capable of genuine spontaneity. Even after he was trained, his responses were difficult to anticipate. Sometimes I’d ask him to sit or roll over and he would simply bark at me, tail wagging with a happy defiance that seemed distinctly doglike. It would have been natural to chalk up his disobedience to a glitch in the algorithms, but how easy it was to interpret it as a sign of volition. “Why don’t you want to lie down?” I heard myself say to him more than once.

I did not believe, of course, that the dog had any kind of internal experience. Not really – though I suppose there was no way to prove this. As the philosopher Thomas Nagel points out in his 1974 paper What Is It Like to Be a Bat?, consciousness can be observed only from the inside. A scientist can spend decades in a lab studying echolocation and the anatomical structure of bat brains, and yet she will never know what it feels like, subjectively, to be a bat – or whether it feels like anything at all. Science requires a third-person perspective, but consciousness is experienced solely from the first-person point of view. In philosophy this is referred to as the problem of other minds. In theory it can also apply to other humans. It’s possible that I am the only conscious person in a population of zombies who simply behave in a way that is convincingly human.

This is just a thought experiment, of course – and not a particularly productive one. In the real world, we assume the presence of life through analogy, through the likeness between two things. We believe that dogs (real, biological dogs) have some level of consciousness, because like us they have a central nervous system, and like us they engage in behaviours that we associate with hunger, pleasure and pain. Many of the pioneers of artificial intelligence got around the problem of other minds by focusing solely on external behaviour. Alan Turing once pointed out that the only way to know whether a machine had internal experience was “to be the machine and to feel oneself thinking”.

This was clearly not a task for science. His famous assessment for determining machine intelligence – now called the Turing test – imagined a computer hidden behind a screen, automatically typing answers in response to questions posed by a human interlocutor. If the interlocutor came to believe that he was speaking to another person, then the machine could be declared “intelligent”. In other words, we should accept a machine as having humanlike intelligence so long as it can convincingly perform the behaviours we associate with human-level intelligence.

More recently, philosophers have proposed tests that are meant to determine not just functional consciousness in machines, but phenomenal consciousness – whether they have any internal, subjective experience. One of them, developed by the philosopher Susan Schneider, involves asking an AI a series of questions to see whether it can grasp concepts similar to those we associate with our own interior experience. Does the machine conceive of itself as anything more than a physical entity? Would it survive being turned off? Can it imagine its mind persisting somewhere else even if its body were to die? But even if a robot were to pass this test, it would provide only sufficient evidence for consciousness, not absolute proof.

It’s possible, Schneider acknowledges, that these questions are anthropocentric. If AI consciousness were in fact completely unlike human consciousness, a sentient robot would fail for not conforming to our human standards. Likewise, a very intelligent but unconscious machine could conceivably acquire enough information about the human mind to fool the interlocutor into believing it had one. In other words, we are still in the same epistemic conundrum that we faced with the Turing test. If a computer can convince a person that it has a mind, or if it demonstrates – as the Aibo website puts it – “real emotions and instinct”, we have no philosophical basis for doubt.

“What is a human like?” For centuries we considered this question in earnest and answered: “Like a god”. For Christian theologians, humans are made in the image of God, though not in any outward sense. Rather, we are like God because we, too, have consciousness and higher thought. It is a self-flattering doctrine, but when I first encountered it, as a theology student, it seemed to confirm what I already believed intuitively: that interior experience was more important, and more reliable, than my actions in the world.

Today, it is precisely this inner experience that has become impossible to prove – at least from a scientific standpoint. While we know that mental phenomena are linked somehow to the brain, it’s not at all clear how they are, or why. Neuroscientists have made progress, using MRIs and other devices, in understanding the basic functions of consciousness – the systems, for example, that constitute vision, or attention, or memory. But when it comes to the question of phenomenological experience – the entirely subjective world of colour and sensations, of thoughts and ideas and beliefs – there is no way to account for how it arises from or is associated with these processes. Just as a biologist working in a lab could never apprehend what it feels like to be a bat by studying the objective facts from the third-person perspective, so any complete description of the structure and function of the human brain’s pain system, for example, could never fully account for the subjective experience of pain.

In 1995, the philosopher David Chalmers called this “the hard problem” of consciousness. Unlike the comparatively “easy” problems of functionality, the hard problem asks why brain processes are accompanied by first-person experience. If none of the other matter in the world is accompanied by mental qualities, then why should brain matter be any different? Computers can perform their most impressive functions without interiority: they can now fly drones and diagnose cancer and beat the world champion at Go without any awareness of what they are doing. “Why should physical processing give rise to a rich inner life at all?” Chalmers wrote. “It seems objectively unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.” Twenty-five years later, we are no closer to understanding why.

Despite these differences between minds and computers, we insist on seeing our image in these machines. When we ask today “What is a human like?”, the most common answer is “like a computer”. A few years ago the psychologist Robert Epstein challenged researchers at one of the world’s most prestigious research institutes to try to account for human behaviour without resorting to computational metaphors. They could not do it. The metaphor has become so pervasive, Epstein points out, that “there is virtually no form of discourse about intelligent human behaviour that proceeds without employing this metaphor, just as no form of discourse about intelligent human behaviour could proceed in certain eras and cultures without reference to a spirit or deity”.

Even people who know very little about computers reiterate the metaphor’s logic. We invoke it every time we claim to be “processing” new ideas, or when we say that we have “stored” memories or are “retrieving” information from our brains. And as we increasingly come to speak of our minds as computers, computers are now granted the status of minds. In many sectors of computer science, terminology that was once couched in quotation marks when applied to machines – “behaviour”, “memory”, “thinking” – are now taken as straightforward descriptions of their functions. Programmers say that neural networks are learning, that facial-recognition software can see, that their machines understand. You can accuse people of anthropomorphism if they attribute human consciousness to an inanimate object. But Rodney Brooks, the MIT roboticist, insists that this confers on us, as humans, a distinction we no longer warrant. In his book Flesh and Machines, he claims that most people tend to “over-anthropomorphise humans … who are after all mere machines”.

“This dog has to go,” my husband said. I had just arrived home and was kneeling in the hallway of our apartment, petting Aibo, who had rushed to the door to greet me. He barked twice, genuinely happy to see me, and his eyes closed as I scratched beneath his chin.

“What do you mean, go?” I said.

“You have to send it back. I can’t live here with it.”

I told him the dog was still being trained. It would take months before he learned to obey commands. The only reason it had taken so long in the first place was because we kept turning him off when we wanted quiet. You couldn’t do that with a biological dog.

“Clearly this is not a biological dog,” my husband said. He asked whether I had realised that the red light beneath its nose was not just a vision system but a camera, or if I’d considered where its footage was being sent. While I was away, he told me, the dog had roamed around the apartment in a very systematic way, scrutinising our furniture, our posters, our closets. It had spent 15 minutes scanning our bookcases and had shown particular interest, he claimed, in the shelf of Marxist criticism.

He asked me what happened to the data it was gathering.

“It’s being used to improve its algorithms,” I said.

“Where?”

I said I didn’t know.

“Check the contract.”

I pulled up the document on my computer and found the relevant clause. “It’s being sent to the cloud.”

“To Sony.”

My husband is notoriously paranoid about such things. He keeps a piece of black electrical tape over his laptop camera and becomes convinced about once a month that his personal website is being monitored by the NSA.

Privacy was a modern fixation, I said, and distinctly American. For most of human history we accepted that our lives were being watched, listened to, supervened upon by gods and spirits – not all of them benign, either.

“And I suppose we were happier then,” he said.

In many ways yes, I said, probably.

I knew, of course, that I was being unreasonable. Later that afternoon I retrieved from the closet the large box in which Aibo had arrived and placed him, prone, back in his pod. It was just as well; the loan period was nearly up. More importantly, I had been increasingly unable over the past few weeks to fight the conclusion that my attachment to the dog was unnatural. I’d begun to notice things that had somehow escaped my attention: the faint mechanical buzz that accompanied the dog’s movements; the blinking red light in his nose, like some kind of Brechtian reminder of its artifice.

We build simulations of brains and hope that some mysterious natural phenomenon – consciousness – will emerge. But what kind of magical thinking makes us think that our paltry imitations are synonymous with the thing they are trying to imitate – that silicon and electricity can reproduce effects that arise from flesh and blood? We are not gods, capable of creating things in our likeness. All we can make are graven images. The philosopher John Searle once said something along these lines. Computers, he argued, have always been used to simulate natural phenomena – digestion, weather patterns – and they can be useful to study these processes. But we veer into superstition when we conflate the simulation with reality. “Nobody thinks, ‘Well, if we do a simulation of a rainstorm, we’re all going to get wet,’” he said. “And similarly, a computer simulation of consciousness isn’t thereby conscious.”

Many people today believe that computational theories of mind have proved that the brain is a computer, or have explained the functions of consciousness. But as the computer scientist Seymour Papert once noted, all the analogy has demonstrated is that the problems that have long stumped philosophers and theologians “come up in equivalent form in the new context”. The metaphor has not solved our most pressing existential problems; it has merely transferred them to a new substrate.

Local residents have complained about the foul smells and pollution concerns around the Chubut River that feeds into the Corfo lagoon. In protest against the continued pollution, locals have blocked roads used by fish waste trucks from entering the area

Her destiny has the added benefit of an annual holiday on Ithaca, at her husband’s family home. “I find the Greeks’ relaxed ways at the beach eye-opening – even grandmothers rock bikinis and oversize sunglasses. They take pleasure in their bodies in a way that I, as a northerner accustomed to camping holidays, found quite startling.”

Her friends loved the sketches when she shared them on Instagram. “I think lockdown made the glamorous location and delight in bodies out promenading especially appealing.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Covid booster jab will probably be required to protect a small number of the most vulnerable people, but a mass rollout may not be needed, a senior government adviser has said.

Prof Adam Finn, who sits on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said it was still unclear whether all over-50s should be given a third shot after the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said plans were in place to offer the whole cohort a booster.

“We’ve been asked to advise as to who might receive a booster if it proves necessary to give boosters,” Finn told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday.

“I think it’s becoming quite clear that there are a small group of people whose immune responses to the first two doses are likely to be inadequate – people who’ve got immunosuppression of one kind or another, perhaps because they’ve got immunodeficiency or they’ve been receiving treatment for cancer or bone marrow transplants or organ transplants, that kind of thing. I think it’s quite likely we’ll be advising on a third dose for some of those groups.

“A broader booster programme is still uncertain, we’ve laid out potential plans so that the logistics of that can be put together, alongside the flu vaccine programme.

“We need to review evidence as to whether people who receive vaccines early on in the programme are in any serious risk of getting serious disease and whether the protection they’ve got from those first two doses is still strong – we clearly don’t want to be giving vaccines to people that don’t need them.”

The booster vaccination programme is due to start on 6 September, but the JCVI – the expert panel that advises the government – is still assessing hospital admissions data and blood test samples before it approves the programme.

On Tuesday, Javid said the government was awaiting the JCVI’s advice, but indicated the plan would probably be for over-50s to be offered the booster at the same time as a flu jab. He said those who got their jabs when the vaccine programme began in December last year would be prioritised.

During a visit to a hospital in Milton Keynes, he said he anticipated the rollout beginning in early September and he was making plans for it. He said the vaccine programme had created a “wall of defence”, adding: “It’s massively reduced hospitalisations, deaths from Covid are mercifully low and that’s because of our vaccination programme.”

Finn also said the number of 16- and 17-year-olds becoming “seriously ill” with coronavirus had informed the decision to extend the vaccination rollout to that age group. He said while most young people would have the virus in a mild form, the vaccines would be effective at preventing serious cases.

He told BBC Breakfast: “We’re going cautiously down through the ages now into childhood and it was clear that the number of cases and the number of young people in the age group – 16, 17 – that were getting seriously ill merited going forward with giving them just a first dose.”

On Wednesday, Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said future variants could mean vaccine immunity may never overcome Covid completely.

Asked on Times Radio whether the virus could “die away” once enough people have antibodies, he said: “That’s still kind of true. More vaccination means more people carrying antibodies means fewer susceptible people, which means fewer lungs for the virus to be in, which means less pandemic.

“So, it hasn’t all gone out of the window. But nobody said this virus had to be simple.

“There’s Delta at the moment, there may well be other worse ones coming round the curve, and they impact the effectiveness of the vaccines and change their calculations.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Women’s sports associations across Europe have called for the resignation of the presidents of both the international and European handball federations, accusing them of “blatant sexism” for rules that require female players to wear bikini bottoms.

The Norwegian women’s beach handball team was fined €1,500 (£1,270) for wearing shorts in protest against the rule during a European Beach Handball Championships match against Spain in Varna, Bulgaria, on 19 July.

The European Handball Federation (EHF) said the Norwegian team were disciplined because of “improper clothing”. In a subsequent statement, the EHF said that, alongside the International Handball Federation (IHF), it was “committed to popularising beach handball” and that the matter of players’ uniforms would be discussed during a meeting of the newly elected commission in August.

The fine, which equated to €150 for each player, was paid for by the Norwegian Handball Federation, which had previously made an official complaint against the bikini bottoms rule.

According to the IHF rule, female players playing beach handball must wear “tops and bikini bottoms and eventual accessories”, while male players wear “tank tops and shorts and eventual accessories”.

“This is a blatantly sexist custom that needs to be eliminated,” said Luisa Rizzitelli, the president of Assist, an Italian association that promotes and defends the rights of female athletes.

Assist is one of seven associations, including the Alice Milliat Foundation in France and Discover Football in Germany, that have written to the IHF president, Hassan Moustafa, and his EHF counterpart, Michael Wiederer, calling on them to resign.

In the letter, they wrote that both federations “have established an embarrassing point of no return regarding their image as international sports institutions”.

Rizzitelli said the IHF’s clothing requirements “shouldn’t mean exploiting the body of a woman”, adding: “Not only did they not immediately drop the rule [after the incident with Norway], but they confirmed the fine – that’s the shameful thing.”

When contacted for comment, the IHF referred the Guardian to an earlier statement and added that a proposal for new uniforms could be presented to the body’s council in November.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It is early morning in Charkint, in the northern Balkh province of Afghanistan, but a meeting with the governor is already well under way to urgently assess the safety of the 30,000 people she represents. Salima Mazari has been in the job for just over three years, and for her, fighting the Taliban is nothing new, but since July she has been meeting with the commanders of her security forces every day as the Islamist militants’ attacks across the country increase.

As one of only three female district governors in Afghanistan, Mazari has attracted attention simply by being a woman in charge. What sets the 40-year-old apart, particularly amid the recent wave of Taliban violence, is her hands-on military leadership. “Sometimes I’m in the office in Charkint, and other times I have to pick up a gun and join the battle,” she says.

Her job means not only managing the day-to-day bureaucracy, but also organising military operations. “If we don’t fight now against the extremist ideologies and the groups that force them on us, we will lose our chance to defeat them. They will succeed. They will brainwash society into accepting their agenda,” she warns.

Q&A What is the Women report Afghanistan series? Show As provinces and cities fall under Taliban control across Afghanistan, women’s voices are already being silenced. For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with Rukhshana Media, a collective of female journalists across Afghanistan, to bring their stories of how the escalating crisis is affecting the lives of women and girls to a global audience. Afghan journalists, especially women, face a dire situation. Dozens have been injured and killed. As the Taliban have advanced, many have lost their jobs or been forced into hiding. Female journalists face a double peril: attacked for their work and persecuted for their gender. All of the reporting in this series will be carried out by Afghan women, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that Afghan women want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Mazari was born in Iran in 1980, after her family fled the Soviet war in Afghanistan. After graduating from university in Tehran, she held different roles at universities and the International Organization for Migration, before deciding to head to the country her parents left decades ago. “The most painful thing about being a refugee is the lack of sense of your country,” she says. “No place is your country.”

We’ve faced Taliban attacks longer than the recent surge in violence and we’ve managed to keep them out of Charkint Salima Mazari

In 2018, she learned there was an opening for the position of district governor of Charkint, “my ancestral homeland”, as Mazari describes it. Encouraged by colleagues and family members, she applied for the post.

With her experience and qualifications, she was among the leading candidates. Her determination to work for the people of her district ensured that she was soon appointed. “Initially, I was worried that as a female governor I might be discriminated against, but the people surprised me,” she says. “The day I was officially received in Charkint as the district governor, I was overwhelmed by the support.”

Few women step out of their house here without a full hijab or a burqa, or a male guardian. To assume the role of district governor was no simple feat, and she soon found herself leading battles she had not expected.

“We lack basic facilities such as access to healthcare. To manage security, we should have at least seven police ranger cars, two Humvees equipped with light and heavy weaponry. However, we have far fewer resources, even though we’ve requested them from the central government many times. My pleas have gone unheard,” she says.

Based on data provided by the Afghan district governance office, Charkint once had a population of more than 200,000 people, but war and the resulting poverty have displaced huge numbers of people. Mazari feels it is considered a second-grade district, and her task is made harder as she fights corruption within the Afghan bureaucracy.

Two years ago, Mazari established a security commission that recruits Afghans into local militias to defend the district. “I invite people from all parts of the district to my office and seek their opinion on improving the situation of Charkint. This has made residents of Charkint more invested and involved, and restores their faith in the government authority,” she says.

Her leadership style has served her well so far as renewed Taliban violence sweeps the country. “We’ve faced Taliban attacks longer than the recent surge in violence and we’ve managed to keep them out of Charkint,” she says, with evident pride. Mazari has stationed her troops on the outskirts of Charkint in the hope that militants will be unable to breach their defences.

Charkint is the only district in Afghanistan under the security management of a woman that no terrorist group has managed to occupy before. But Mazari is aware that the situation is worsening rapidly and is worried for her people. In the last week, the Taliban have taken a series of northern provinces and capitals, and fighting has raged across Balkh province.

Last year, Mazari successfully negotiated the surrender of more than 100 Taliban fighters in her region. But such negotiations are not always a success, she says.

“On multiple occasions, we sent a committee on behalf of our people to negotiate with the Taliban. We’ve had over 10 meetings to ask them to protect the lives, harvest and properties of the people. Our people are farmers and they depend on their harvest for sustenance in the winter months. But they rejected the request of people for an agreement every time,” she says.

Mazari’s growing reputation as a strong woman standing against Taliban brutality has put her life at risk. She has survived several ambushes by the Taliban, as well as mines planted by the militants to target her. “But I am not afraid,” she says. “I believe in the rule of law in Afghanistan.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Germany and the Netherlands have said they have stopped forced repatriations of Afghan migrants because of deteriorating security in Afghanistan, as the Taliban press on with their rapid advance in the country’s north.

“Due to current developments in the security situation, the interior minister has decided to suspend deportations to Afghanistan for the time being,” tweeted Germany’s interior ministry spokesperson, Steve Alter.

Separately in The Hague, the Dutch state secretary for justice and security, Ankie Broekers-Knol, announced a “moratorium on [deportation] decisions and departures”. The halt “will apply for six months and will apply to foreign nationals of Afghan nationality”, she wrote in a letter to the Dutch parliament.

Wednesday’s move by the Germans and Dutch marked a sharp U-turn from their previous position. Officials had said as late as Tuesday that both governments had joined their counterparts in Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Greece to write to the EU’s executive arm saying they should be allowed to press on with expulsions of Afghan migrants if their asylum applications failed.

Afghanistan urged the EU in July to cease forced deportations for three months as security forces battle the Taliban offensive before the full US military pullout from Afghanistan on 31 August.

The hardline Islamists have in recent days made huge advances in the north, capturing territory including the provincial capital Kunduz, where German soldiers had been deployed for a decade until the end of June.

The German defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, on Monday voiced disappointment at the developments. “The reports from Kunduz and from all over Afghanistan are bitter and hurt a lot,” she tweeted.

Northern Afghanistan had long been considered an anti-Taliban stronghold, with some of the stiffest resistance to militant rule in the 1990s.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hours after a court in China sentenced the Canadian Michael Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage, Meng Wanzhou appeared in a Vancouver courtroom, as final arguments began in her fight against extradition to the United States.

The two cases, while not officially linked, are at the heart of a geopolitical feud between the United States and China, which has left Canada suffering collateral damage.

Michael Spavor and a second Canadian, Michael Kovrig, were arrested by Chinese officials in December 2018, days after Canada arrested the Huawei executive on a US extradition request.

China has repeatedly demanded she be released, even though Justin Trudeau has said his government cannot interfere in the country’s judicial process.

But after Spavor was sentenced on Wednesday, Ottawa must grapple with the reality that Beijing plans to tie the fate of two jailed Canadians to Meng’s legal saga.

Spavor’s verdict and sentencing, which follow an opaque and secretive trial, were denounced by Canada and its allies, who have accused China of “hostage diplomacy”.

But, according to Jack Cunningham, coordinator at the Bill Graham Centre for Contemporary International History at the University of Toronto, Canada’s options are limited.

“China is playing by rules they’ve created for themselves. They’re free to manipulate their own domestic judicial process. It’s a regime that sees the rule of law in essentially political terms,” said Cunningham.

“[Foreign minister Marc] Garneau and prime minister Justin Trudeau should be working the phones as much as they can to our allies. And they have a compelling case to make: next time Beijing wants something, it could be one of their nationals essentially serving as a hostage.”

While Canada and its allies condemned Spavor’s treatment by the Chinese courts, Lynette Ong, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto’s Asian Institute argued that Spavor’s sentence may indicate that Beijing is signaling an interest in negotiating.

“Typically we see a life sentence for this type of charge. But 11 years and ambiguity over deportation suggests there might be some ‘wiggle room’ or openness to bargain,” said Ong.

“I wasn’t expecting China to appear soft on the very first verdict, because they see this as a series of political bargains. They’re an experienced player and they want to open with a strong card.”

Canada has not said publicly if it is open to negotiating Meng’s return home in exchange for the release of the two men.

Officials had previously expressed hopes last year that a deal could be reached between the United States and China, but a bargain was never reached.

“This work will continue to go on with the aim of arriving at the result of freeing the two Michaels,” Garneau said on Wednesday, telling reporters that the US president, Joe Biden, was treating Kovrig and Spavor as if they were American citizens detained by China.

While China probably understands that Canada’s legal system operates differently from its own, that hasn’t stopped it from pressuring Canada to intervene and reject the American request for Meng.

“China believes there is an element of ‘realpolitik’ at play, something apart from the rules of institutional separation between court and parliament,” said Ong. “They feel the United States elbows Canada into doing things because of our relationship with them.”

She and others suspect China will wait to see how the judge in Meng’s case rules, before announcing a verdict on former diplomat Michael Kovrig.

An initial judgment on Meng’s extradition case is expected in the fall, but the appeals process could take years.

“This is like a tango dance between the two countries – and I suspect we’ve seen the first in many moves to come,” said Ong.

China has used similar tactics in the past: arresting, charging and sentencing Canadians Kevin and Julia Garratt after Canada extradited Su Bin, a suspected spy, to the US. They were released and deported in 2017 soon after Su cut a deal in the US.

While China is more aggressive now than when it struck a deal with the Garratt family, it is also aware of the politically sensitive nature of its current gambit.

“The world is watching, and I think China is very well aware of that,” said Ong. “It has become more emboldened compared to six years ago, but it also needs to consider the immense consequences of its actions.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Brazilian lawmakers have voted to expel the gospel star turned congresswoman Flordelis over her alleged involvement in the murder of the husband with whom she had raised more than 50 children.

In the latest dramatic chapter of a saga that has gripped Brazil, 437 members of Brazil’s 513-member lower house voted to strip the disgraced evangelical celebrity of her mandate as a result of “conduct incompatible with parliamentary decorum”.

Twelve lawmakers abstained and seven opposed the expulsion of Flordelis dos Santos de Souza, a favela-born church leader who was elected in 2018 as part of the same evangelical wave that brought Brazil’s ultra-conservative president, Jair Bolsonaro, to power.

As the verdict was read late on Wednesday afternoon the 60-year-old congresswoman – who became famous for taking in dozens of children she claimed to have saved from lives of deprivation and violence – covered her face with her right hand.

Earlier, in a final attempt to avoid expulsion – a move which could leave her open to arrest – Flordelis insisted she was innocent and beseeched colleagues to show mercy. “Here Flordelis is, destroyed,” the singer said dramatically.

The downfall of Flordelis – who was born into poverty in one of Rio’s most violent favelas and rose to once unimaginable power and fame as the leader of a multimillion-dollar church empire – began in June 2019 when her husband Anderson do Carmo was shot dead as the couple entered the home they shared with their super-sized family.

Flordelis claimed he was the victim of a bungled robbery. But within hours of the crime police began to suspect the involvement of family members, including Flordelis herself, and lurid claims appeared in the local media, including allegations the couple spent their final night together at a swingers club in Rio de Janeiro.

One year later, in August 2020, investigators formally accused the congresswoman of masterminding her husband’s murder and arrested five of her children and one granddaughter, although Flordelis’s parliamentary privilege meant she remained free.

Earlier this year the head of the murder investigation, Allan Duarte, told the Guardian he believed Flordelis was the head of “an intra-family criminal organisation” set up solely to kill Do Carmo, whose control of the family finances the plotters resented.

“She’s cold. She’s calculating. She’s sly … I consider Flordelis a psychopath,” Duarte said.

Flordelis, who was recently ordered to stand trial for aggravated murder, continues to maintain her innocence. During an interview at the home where Do Carmo was killed earlier this year she claimed she was the victim of a misogynistic and racist vendetta being waged by rival preachers and politicians.

“Give me one reason – just one – why I would kill my husband?” she protested. “He was more than just my husband, he was my friend.”

After being stripped of her mandate on Wednesday Flordelis denounced the “cruel and cowardly” decision, telling reporters: “I have committed no crime.”

Police chief Duarte said he had the feeling of accomplished duty after his suspect’s expulsion from congress. “But I will only be fully satisfied when she is convicted, jailed and pays for the crime she committed,” he added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@California will become the first state in the nation to require all teachers and school staff to get vaccinated or undergo weekly Covid testing, as schools return from summer break amid growing concerns about the highly contagious delta variant, Governor Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday.

The new policy applies to public and private schools and will affect the state’s 320,000 public school teachers, more than 250,000 support staff – from cafeteria employees to cleaners – and at least 80,000 private school employees. It will also apply to school volunteers.

Newsom announced the new policy at a San Francisco Bay Area school that reopened earlier this week to in-person classes. Many California schools are back in session, with others starting in the coming weeks.

“We think this is the right thing to do, and we think this is a sustainable way to keeping our schools open, and to address the No 1 anxiety that parents like myself have for young children,” said Newsom, a father of four.

Several large school districts in the state have issued similar requirements in recent days, including San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and Long Beach.

California, like the rest of the country, has seen a troubling surge in Covid-19 infections because of the delta variant, which represents the vast majority of new cases. It has affected children more than previous strains of the virus.

While Hawaii governor David Ige announced last week that all education department staffers would be required to disclose their vaccination status or face weekly testing, California’s order is far more sweeping, applying to all staff who work in both public and private schools.

Over the past few weeks, Newsom has mandated that all healthcare workers must be fully vaccinated and required that all state employees get vaccinated or choose weekly testing.

For schools, Newsom had already issued a mask mandate that applies to teachers and students but until Wednesday had left the decision of whether to require vaccines up to local districts.

In California, vaccine mandates are perilous for the Democratic governor, who faces a recall election next month fueled in part by anger over his handling of the pandemic. Newsom’s mask mandate for schools has angered some parents and been criticized by Republican candidates vying to replace him.

“Not everybody will be overwhelmed by this but we think it will be well received because it is the right thing to do to keep our most precious resource healthy and safe, our children here in this state,” he said on Wednesday.

As the virus has surged, particularly among children who are too young to be vaccinated, a growing number of teachers unions have eased their opposition to vaccine mandates.

California’s two largest teachers unions – the California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers – said they fully supported Newsom’s policy.

CTA president E Toby Boyd said: “Educators want to be in classrooms with their students, and the best way to make sure that happens is for everyone who is medically eligible to be vaccinated, with robust testing and multi-tiered safety measures.”

Schools are required to be in full compliance with the new policy by 15 October, giving schools time to verify vaccination status and have in place weekly testing for unvaccinated staff, said Amelia Matier, a spokeswoman in the governor’s office.

Newsom did not rule out expanding the requirement to students after a vaccine is approved for children under 12.

“We’ll consider all options in the future,” he said, in response to a question. “We believe this is a meaningful first step.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Almost 1.2 million people in England are waiting more than six months for essential NHS services such as brain surgery and eye treatment because of the Covid backlog, analysis shows.

The May 2021 figure is almost five times that recorded in the same period in 2019 , before the pandemic hit, and also includes patients requiring gynaecological services.

Senior doctors said such long delays were causing patients to be left in pain, while experts said the full impact of the pandemic may not yet be known.

The deputy director of research of the Nuffield Trust, Dr Sarah Scobie, said: “We haven’t yet seen the peak of pent-up demand or the full impact of the multiple waves of this pandemic. Despite staff working flat out, overturning a backlog of this scale will take years. This will leave many people struggling with the day-to-day challenges of managing health conditions while waiting for essential treatment, risking storing up more urgent care needs for the near future.”

Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, warned: “The waiting list figures are going one way only – up. And they won’t come down until the NHS can deliver activity faster than patients are presenting with new need.

“We went into the health emergency with rising waiting lists and now the NHS needs more resources – money and staff – and strong leadership to bring this backlog down,” she said.

Though the vast majority of patients are supposed to be seen within 18 weeks, six-month waiting lists have doubled for ear, nose and throat services and gastroenterology services when compared to the same period in 2020.

The number of patients waiting for gynaecological services stood at 15,647 in May 2019, rising to 48,168 in May 2020 before reaching 87,628 in the same period this year.

Dr Edward Morris, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the college was very concerned that women were having to wait far too long to be diagnosed.

“The current backlog we are facing in gynaecology is made up of people needing clinically urgent treatment, so many women are being left in pain with these benign conditions.”

The figures for May 2021 revealed 212,770 patients had waited for more than six months for trauma and orthopaedic services. A further 130,224 waited for more than six months for ophthalmology services.

The Royal College of Ophthalmologists said it was likely that the majority of patients requiring eye treatments were for cataract surgery, who were not classified as high risk but who may be unable to lead an independent lifestyle as a result.

“Surgical and diagnostic capacity needs to increase rapidly to make a significant impact on the backlog caused by the Covid 19 pandemic,” said the college’s president, Prof Bernie Chang.

In May, more than 336,000 patients were waiting for treatments for at least a year, with almost 21,000 in Birmingham university hospital alone.

The hospital also recorded the longest median wait time, with patients waiting an average of 18 weeks, while some patients were waiting even longer for certain treatments.

There is a six-month median wait for those requiring ear, nose and throat and urology services as well as oral surgery.

The backlog facing the Birmingham trust reflects the continuing impact on hospitals struck hardest by the pandemic. A spokesperson said its staff had prioritised emergency and the most urgent cancer care for its patients while treating more than 15,000 Covid patients, “more than any other hospital trust in the country”.

“Despite the impact of Covid, we continue to work hard and at pace with our partners across Birmingham and Solihull to increase the number of operations carried out through additional theatres and ward capacity across our sites and launching a significant recruitment drive.”

A further four trusts – Buckinghamshire healthcare, Worcestershire acute hospitals, university hospitals of Leicester and the Royal Free London – recorded median wait times of close to 17 weeks.

This compares with waits of six weeks or less in Barnsley hospital, Southport and Ormskirk hospital and South Tyneside and Sunderland trusts, the lowest times recorded among NHS England’s acute trusts.

Paul Brennan, the chief operating officer and deputy chief executive of Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust, said its staff were working tirelessly to continue to prioritise those needing urgent care and were increasing the number of operations to “safely restore services and ensure patients receive care in as timely a way as possible”.

A spokesperson for Buckinghamshire said as well as treating almost 2,000 Covid patients and the same number of cancer patients, staff were continuing to see as many non-urgent patients as possible, with community teams treating the most vulnerable in their homes.

Certain treatments at some trusts had far higher waiting times. The longest waits were for oral surgery at the Royal Free London trust, with a median wait of 69 weeks and 115 people waiting more than a year.

A spokesperson for the Royal Free said oral surgery waiting times had been particularly impacted by Covid as such procedures cause airborne particles: “Due to the rigorous infection control measures required to ensure patients and staff are safe, we cannot see patients as quickly as we did before the pandemic.”

This position was reflected by a spokesman for Dorset county hospital.



Waiting times for nose and throat services at Oxford university hospitals trust were running at 65 weeks, with 1,234 people waiting more than a year for treatment. A spokesperson said patients waiting for surgery would be prioritised based on clinical need and urged anyone requiring treatment to come forward.

The findings follow a series of data releases from the service showing unprecedented waiting lists, which exceeded 5 million for the first time in April, rising to 5.3 million in May.

The median wait time for patients on the list has fallen, however, from a high of 19.6 weeks in July last year as the service grappled with a surge in Covid patients, to 10.8 weeks in May, the last month for which data is available.

The figures come just before NHS England releases its latest monthly statistics on waiting times for treatments including A&E care, surgery and cancer care, which officials believe will be grim reading.

An NHS spokesperson said: “Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic, with staff treating 410,000 seriously ill Covid patients and launching the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in our history, NHS services continued to be available for patients who needed them, and are now making good use of the £1bn in additional funding for elective recovery.

“The number of routine treatments and operations performed by NHS staff is increasing, with cancer and mental health services back at pre-pandemic levels, and so we continue to urge anyone who needs the NHS to come forward so we can help you.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Although extremely rare, a blood clot syndrome after the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine carries a high risk of death and can occur in otherwise young and healthy people, UK researchers have found.

In those aged under 50, this blood clot syndrome occur in around one in 50,000 people who have received the vaccine, and that number falls to one in 100,000 in the over 50s, data suggests. But the risk of blood clots is much higher with Covid itself — research shows that more than a fifth of hospitalised patients with Covid have evidence of blood clots.

Researchers examined the symptoms, signs and outcomes in 220 confirmed and probable cases who presented in UK hospitals between 22 March and 6 June.

“It’s important to stress that this kind of reaction to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is very rare,” said Dr Sue Pavord, consultant haematologist at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead author of the analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

But for those who do develop blood clots, the results “can be devastating,” she added. “It often affects young, otherwise healthy vaccine recipients and has high mortality. It is particularly dangerous when the patient has a low platelet count and bleeding in the brain.”

“It can affect anybody,” added Beverley Hunt, medical director of Thrombosis UK and professor of thrombosis and haemostasis at King’s College London.

50% of the cases in the analysis had no previous medical illness, and there appeared to be no particular individual risk factors for the syndrome, Hunt said.

Researchers found that the syndrome – named vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) – killed 23% of the cases analysed. This risk of death increases significantly to 73% in patients with a very low platelet count and brain bleeds after blood clots in the brain, they said.

VITT is similar to the condition sometimes reported in patients treated with the blood thinner heparin, but it seems to be “more aggressive than what we were familiar with,” said Pavord.

The researchers defined VITT based on five criteria, including onset of symptoms 5 to 30 days after vaccination, a low platelet count, and documented presence of a blood clot.

Although there a few reports of a rare blood clotting side-effects after Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, in the way that VITT has been defined – these cases appear to be only associated with the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, the researchers also said.

“We’ve kept an open mind,” said Dr Catherine Bagot, consultant haematologist at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and senior clinical lecturer at the University of Glasgow. “The Pfizer vaccine has not – for the cases that we are aware of – been able to meet the definition either of a confirmed case or a probable case.”

In early May, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended people under the age of 40 be offered an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine where possible while infection rates remain low, after reports of very rare blood clots after first shots of the vaccine.

In the 220 confirmed and probable VITT cases in the analysis, ages ranged from 18 to 79 years, with a median of 48 years. About 85% were under the age of 60, despite most of the elderly population having been vaccinated.

But this does not mean the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine should not be given to the under-60s, Pavord said.

“If there’s high prevalence of Covid, more people are likely to end up infected and in critical care, and if they’re over-60, more likely to die. In that case, it makes sense to give Oxford/AstraZeneca to everybody. But when there’s a lower prevalence of Covid, an age limit would be appropriate, she said.

“What is absolutely crucial to consider is the bigger picture – and that is the risk of Covid is much greater for the older age groups.”

An AstraZeneca spokesperson said: “The research published in the New England Journal of Medicine was drawn from a small sample size of just over 200 individuals.

“Recent published real-world evidence drawn from millions of individuals, shows that AstraZeneca’s vaccine has a comparable safety profile with other vaccines and that incidences of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia are extremely rare and treatable. After first dose there are 8.1 events per million people, and for the second dose rates are the same as those in the unvaccinated population.

“Furthermore, there is a far greater risk of getting a rare blood clotting event with Covid-19, with rates of venous thromboembolism eight times higher after a diagnosis of Covid-19 infection compared with the expected rate.

“Overall, vaccines remain the most effective protection against COVID-19 and are the best route out of this pandemic.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The arrest of a British citizen in Berlin for allegedly spying for the Russians has a distinctly cold war flavour.

In recent years the Kremlin has been accused of carrying out a number of spectacular cyber-operations. They include the hacking and dumping in 2016 of thousands of Democratic party emails. Moscow’s audacious goal, according to Washington: to help elect Donald Trump as US president.

But alongside these dramatic 21st-century plots Russia has continued to quietly practise what might be called workaday espionage. The 57-year-old man arrested on Tuesday was based at the British embassy in Berlin. He was not a diplomat. His precise role has not been officially revealed but he appears to be a lower level employee.

The Briton – identified only as David S – was caught after handing over documents for cash to a Russian intelligence officer, prosecutors allege. The episode would be entirely in keeping with the Kremlin’s playbook, which in many respects is unchanged since KGB times. During the communist era eastern bloc spy agencies would typically target western embassy staff working in junior roles. Only rarely did they recruit high level contacts.

“This is old-style espionage,” said David Clark, a former special adviser to the late foreign secretary Robin Cook. “You find a human source who is willing to be persuaded to do this for money from an intelligence service.

“We have become very used to the idea that everything is done in the virtual world of hack and leak. This feels like a bit of a throwback.”

East Germany’s secret police – the Stasi – specialised in sending “Romeo” agents to seduce secretaries working in the west German capital, Bonn. This undercover campaign was wildly successful. Secretaries were sometimes persuaded to hand over documents and embassy correspondence to their lovers. The secretaries were, in effect, choke-points for all kinds of sensitive information.

According to Clark, the embassy worker arrested in Berlin might well have handed over significant material to Moscow. “It would be wrong to assume he didn’t have access, just because he was a low-level officer. If you can get to the person who shreds documents, for example, you can get the documents. Or you recruit the cleaner who empties the bins at the end of the day and who does menial tasks.”

The Berlin spy scandal may be the latest in a series of similar recent episodes all across Europe. Last August, Norway expelled a Russian trade official on suspicion of spying. He had allegedly met a Norwegian national in an Oslo pizza restaurant, and had persuaded him to hand over sensitive details of oil and gas projects, in exchange for cash. The Norwegian was arrested. Moscow said the expulsion was unjustified.

During the same month the French government arrested a senior military officer over what it said was a “security breach”. The French officer who was stationed with Nato forces in Italy was spotted meeting with a Russian working for GRU military intelligence. Over in Austria a retired former colonel was jailed last year for three years. He shared details of Austria’s weapons systems in exchange for about €280,000 (£250,000).

In 2018 the UK government and its allies expelled more than 150 Russian spies after the novichok poisoning in Salisbury of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. It was the biggest ever collective dismissal of hostile intelligence officers. The UK kicked out 23 diplomats from the Russian embassy in London.

In theory, the move dealt a crushing blow to Russia’s extensive espionage network and to its ability to recruit western sources. In reality, however, it appears merely to have won a little breathing space. Since then Russia has stealthily rebuilt its intelligence capabilities, sending in new faces and testing out different avenues, analysts believe.

“After a while the Russians get back up to speed,” Clark said. “Theresa May’s punitive actions over Salisbury were never going to be a long-term answer to this kind of thing.”

Meanwhile, there seems no appetite from the current occupant of Downing Street to take meaningful action against Russian espionage. As the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, pointed out on Wednesday, Boris Johnson has so far ignored the recommendations of last year’s Russia report.

The document by parliament’s intelligence and security committee argues the government needs to do more to counter aggressive behaviour by Moscow.

Vladimir Putin’s spy agencies are not all-seeing and all-knowing. But they have plenty of experience and an opportunistic approach. If there is a weakness – human or technical – they will try to exploit it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ceasefires are normally cause for hope, bringing respite and perhaps even peace, if not a full resolution. In Ethiopia there has been no such relief. Just as Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s Nobel peace prize was soon followed by war with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), so it seems that the ceasefire will be succeeded, as many had predicted, by an intensification of the conflict. On Tuesday, Mr Abiy urged all eligible civilians to join the war.

Nine months of conflict have resulted in thousands of deaths, created tens of thousands of refugees, and led to famine conditions for hundreds of thousands. They have seen war crimes committed by all parties, including massacres of civilians and widespread sexual violence; a report by Amnesty International alleges the systematic rape and abuse of women and girls by forces belonging or allied to the Ethiopian government. The prospect of an escalation is truly frightening.

The TPLF dominated politics in Ethiopia for decades before Mr Abiy’s rise. A political dispute – in which the regional Tigray leadership and federal government declared each other illegitimate – turned into a military struggle when Mr Abiy said he was launching a strike on the TPLF because it had attacked a federal army base. He expected a swift victory. But in June, Tigrayan forces recaptured the regional capital, Mekelle. The federal government unilaterally declared a ceasefire and withdrew troops from most of the region, but aid and services remained blocked, and a spokesman recently declared that the Tigrayan leadership would be driven “out of each and every city”. Humanitarian supplies have only just been allowed in. Electricity and communications have yet to be restored.

For its part, the TPLF has carried the war east into neighbouring Afar (where it may hope to cut off a key trade route) and south into the Amhara region, and is refusing to withdraw. It says it is reclaiming Tigrayan land which Amhara forces occupied when the federal government launched its attack, but it may also hope to open up a supply line from Sudan. TPLF-aligned forces and Tigrayan militias have also been accused of attacks on Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia; Eritrean government forces have fought for Mr Abiy.

If the human toll were not sufficient, this conflict threatens to tear the country apart. Tigray’s leadership is determined to restore the region’s prewar boundaries, while Amhara forces will not cede their claim to the land they seized. The TPLF also needs to reestablish external supply lines – which the federal government cannot afford them to have – and wants to oust Mr Abiy. But the prime minister has just won a landslide victory in elections (albeit with a partial opposition boycott and without voting in some areas), and the TPLF’s actions may bolster his support. At the same time, the conduct of pro-government troops has galvanised previously apolitical Tigrayans into backing the TPLF; many now see this as a fight for survival and feel independence is their only prospect of living in peace. The conflict is hitting external relations too; Sudan has withdrawn its ambassador.

As the situation threatens to deteriorate further, international pressure on all parties is essential. Ensuring the unhindered flow of humanitarian supplies and seeking a real ceasefire must be the priorities. It is hard to see how a proper deal can be reached when neither side appears to want it. But Ethiopia, and the region, desperately need one.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Andrew Cuomo, the governor of the state of New York, has resigned after the publication of a report by the attorney general which documented that he sexually harassed 11 women and his staff retaliated against one of those women who had the temerity to speak out. (Cuomo denies any wrongdoing.)

Some commentators have taken the opportunity to note that not only did he run a toxic workplace, sexually harass staff and violate state and federal laws in his actions, he also has run the state poorly, despite the reputation he developed during the coronavirus pandemic. But, based in part on my experience of having worked in his administration, it would be more accurate to say that Cuomo has run New York poorly because he ran a toxic workplace, sexually harassed staff and violated state and federal laws.

Start with the number of women whose careers were cut short and harmed by the governor’s actions. That left New York without the contributions of many women who could have made the state a better place but who left because of the abuse. And who are the women who did not get jobs in the government at all because Cuomo may not have found them attractive? What was their contribution to our collective wellbeing that was missed? It is impossible to have worked for the governor and not have noticed that the senior women who worked directly for him predominantly looked alike and notably none of them where non-white.

Similarly, the attorney general’s report meticulously detailed the ways in which the state’s hiring and staffing decisions were based upon Cuomo’s proclivities. On the one hand, the governor had the New York State police change their seniority rules to allow a woman that he had met to be assigned to staff him, even though she was underqualified for the role. On the other, numerous women were given non-substantive jobs in the governor’s vicinity rather than substantive work for which they were qualified. Cuomo was more than willing to use his power to degrade government because of his personal desires, and it did not stop at discrimination against women.

The brain drain as a result of his toxic administration hurt New York. I made it seven months in the Cuomo administration in 2017. I was looking for a new job after two months. But working in an abusive and chaotic environment where nobody cared about policy outcomes was not worth proximity to power. The staff often justified what they went through as necessary for good governance, but I knew otherwise, having just come from the Obama White House, where working long hours was the norm, but so was kindness coming from the top.

While I would not count myself as a large loss for the administration, the number of smart people who walked in the door and realised they could do more good work elsewhere is innumerable. For example, Andy Byford, who was fixing the subways that had withered under Cuomo’s time leading New York, left because working for the governor was so unpleasant.

The report also documented the ways in which a staff obsessed with serving the governor, his wants and his image rather than delivering for New Yorkers leads to bad outcomes. Led by the now departed Melissa DeRosa, the staff were all hands on deck to silence the harassment claims against Cuomo in the middle of a pandemic. They are alleged to have retaliated against Lindsey Boylan and lied to the press hoping to ward off future accusations. That campaign was described by the governor’s office as “fighting for our lives”, which should give us a sense of how much energy was being devoted to issues other than running the state’s government.

Indeed, it’s this media obsession and policy failure that led to Cuomo’s massive popularity amid the pandemic while New Yorkers died at higher rates than almost any other state in the country. If it had to do with television, he and they cared and they could get good headlines. While I think very little of Cuomo, I do believe his Emmy was well deserved. He did an incredible job every day playing the competent foil to Donald Trump, assuring a shell-shocked nation desperate for the mere performance of competence. TV Andrew Cuomo is good at the job of being TV Governor.

When the cameras were off, the image-obsessed staff failed to deliver for New York. New York is second among the US’s states in deaths per capita, and while a fair assessment would note the early timing and geography – nearby New Jersey and Connecticut also struggled to prevent Covid deaths – nothing suggests Cuomo did anything more notable to limit the spread of the virus than other governors. Instead, when his policies potentially led to larger numbers of deaths in elder care facilities, his administration reportedly scrubbed the numbers at his behest. As New Yorkers struggled to get Covid tests, his administration pressured hospitals to provide them for his friends and family. And when news broke of his sexual harassment last year, his administration’s Covid “czar” gauged the loyalty of county officials struggling to get vaccines to their constituents, according to media reports.

That is my memory of working there: seeing people screamed at by his close staff if the temperature was not sufficiently cold for the governor’s events. Cuomo’s administration has constantly failed because it prized loyalty, subservience and shiny objects over making things work. New York received billions of dollars in rent relief money from the federal government this year, but the programme has been marked by dysfunction, with lawmakers demanding details of the awarding of a no-bid $115m contract to a company that was charged with distributing the funds. The state wasted $106m on unused lights for New York bridges, because the governor prized the veneer of infrastructure, all while subways broke down.

Andrew Cuomo is gone. But there will be more politicians who are said to sexually harass their staff and run toxic work environments. We should remember that the harms do not stop at the women they harass or the staffers they abuse, although that should be enough. The abuse is corrosive, the harms leak out throughout the government, and we are all worse for it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s easy to feel despair reading the stark warnings in the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: the window in which warming can be limited to 1.5C is rapidly closing. The forest fires and flooding on our TV screens, and closer to home, are a wake-up call to the realities of a rapidly warming climate.

The IPCC, the UN body responsible for climate science, described the report as a “code red for humanity”, but 30 years of warnings have not brought about action on a meaningful scale.

But fatalistic despair will only deepen the problem. The language of averting catastrophe positions the climate crisis as a single calamitous moment, whereas in reality there are a thousand smaller battles to fight – and each small win will contribute to protecting people from the worst effects of climate breakdown. As Naomi Klein puts it, “every fraction of a degree warming that we hold off is a victory”.

The IPCC report makes clear that the science behind the climate crisis is incontrovertible, and research shows that the UK public agrees. Across cities, towns and rural communities, a majority want to see the government take further action.

The most pressing battle, then, is no longer with the deniers but with climate delayers, who claim to recognise the problem, while seeking to prevent anything from being done about it. They argue that measures to address the climate and nature crises – such as phasing out gas boilers – are too expensive, and that the costs would fall on those on low-to-middle incomes. Consequently, reviews and decisions are delayed while headlines are written of a green agenda “plunged into chaos”.

It is critical that government considers the impacts of climate policies - an approach that makes the lives of families who are already struggling won’t wash and is bound to fail. But the climate delayers’ argument does not stack up. Early investment to address the climate and nature crises can create jobs and prevent needless economic damage down the line. Recent modelling by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that debt as a proportion of GDP will be far higher if we delay action compared to investing sooner. Government leadership to support the growth of markets for green technologies now can bring down their costs in future.

If Johnson’s government opts for a path that relies on our existing economic model and asks individuals to shoulder risks and costs rather than share them, those on low incomes will probably lose out. The good news is that policies can be designed not just to protect the lives of those on low and middle incomes, but actually make them better.

That agenda should include grants and loans to support people on low incomes to insulate their homes and install green heating systems, so that they can save on heating bills. It should include investing the additional £30bn per year needed to build the net-zero economy of the future, creating good jobs around the country, and providing bridges to those jobs with a right to retrain. It should include ensuring that everyone has access to nature, using the planning system to transform neighbourhoods into green, social spaces.

Above all, if we are to seize the opportunities of the transition, all people and communities across the UK must benefit, with the greatest return accruing to those who need it most. We can and must choose a path that leads to a fairer future, rather than one which deepens injustice.

The Institute for Public Policy Research’s cross-party environmental justice commission, which published its final report last month, sets out how this can be achieved, based on thousands of combined hours of deliberation by citizens around the country. These discussions offer hope for a popular agenda that would win support for climate and nature policies and improve the country for the better. The delayers are right to raise concerns of who benefits and who loses from the green transition, but wrong to put banana skins under the process. We have the answers we need, now, to secure a fair transition – and it’s time the government chose the right path.

Prior to the pandemic, the environment was more salient as an electoral issue than it has been for 30 years. Voters will be watching the government’s response to the scientists’ “code red” this autumn as the government sets out its spending plans and the UK hosts the Cop26 in Glasgow. To host a successful international conference and show real global leadership, the government will have to back its demands of other countries with a strong green agenda at home. Dither and delay is not an option. Practical policies for a rapid transition to netzero that make the UK a fairer country are a necessity.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Talking points can arrive when you least expect them. With a minute remaining of a humdrum, lethargic extra-time that Chelsea and Villarreal could clearly have done without, Thomas Tuchel made his first bold move of the season. Kepa Arrizabalaga, a £71m player named among the substitutes for the Super Cup, stepped forward to replace Edouard Mendy. Tuchel’s strategy was to be fully justified as Kepa, at full stretch to his right, batted away Raúl Albiol’s penalty to claim the trophy for Chelsea. The scale of celebrations from the Champions League winners – and the dejection easily visible among the Villarreal contingent – painted a picture of something that mattered.

Kepa’s contribution, such a belated one, was crucial. And yet it will be a surprise if he plays against Crystal Palace on Saturday. “We needed to do what was good for the team,” shrugged Tuchel. “Kepa has the better percentages at saving penalties.” Data gurus have a lot to answer for.

With Romelu Lukaku set to begin imminently for Chelsea, Tuchel must be content. His team were dominant in the first half here, with the failure to fully capitalise on that pressure likely to be offset by the prolific Belgian striker’s return. Villarreal, so pleasing on the eye under Unai Emery, offered considerably more threat in the second period but Chelsea looked – as should be the case – the superior side.

Tuchel had gone to great length during pre-match media duties to emphasise the significance of a fixture many would not unreasonably regard as a glorified friendly, even going so far as to suggest that he would be “angry” should any of his players treat Villarreal lightly.

This game was played amid a broader, uplifting context. There was a time when Belfast would never have been deemed suitable – or, to be precise, safe – for a marquee game such as this. Northern Ireland’s societal growth, the redevelopment of Windsor Park itself and the nation’s international football momentum as started by Michael O’Neill were all factors that made this venue choice sensible. European or global events need no longer be shielded from a city reborn.

Chelsea’s supporters, many of them locally-based, understandably made up the bulk of the 13,000 crowd, but two significant pockets of Villarreal followers, in their striking yellow, added to the sense of occasion. That Emery paid no attention whatsoever to the boundaries of the technical area, even during seemingly humdrum spells of the game, suggested he, too, was delighted at being here.

Tuchel sprung a slight surprise by deploying Trevoh Chalobah among a three-man defensive line. This marked the 22-year-old’s first competitive start for Chelsea, after loan spells that have stretched from Ipswich to FC Lorient. Yet the Chelsea head coach had hinted before kick-off that unorthodox selections were likely.

He believes Timo Werner will benefit from the experience of his first season in England. Wastefulness remains Werner’s biggest issue; he should have scored from point-blank range after six minutes but instead allowed Sergio Asenjo to palm the ball away. As N’Golo Kanté flashed a 20-yard shot wide, Chelsea had an early grip of the game.

That much was emphasised by a wonderful opening goal. Marcos Alonso fed the marauding Kai Havertz on the left flank, with the latter delivering a menacing cross that narrowly eluded Werner. Hakim Ziyech appeared to stub his shot but, with Asenjo exposed, it found the net anyway. Emery’s agitation was quite the sight.

Villarreal responded through the recently recruited Boulaye Dia. Mendy saved smartly at the feet of his fellow Senegal international. Chelsea fired back through Alonso and Kurt Zouma, who both had decent opportunities to double the lead before the interval. Seconds before the break, Alberto Moreno crashed a volley off the underside of the Chelsea crossbar.

By that juncture Tuchel had received a yellow card for protests towards the referee and Chelsea had made an enforced change. Ziyech, hitherto a menace to the Villarreal defence, landed badly after challenging for a header inside his own penalty area. Christian Pulisic replaced Ziyech, who left the scene clutching his right shoulder. Tuchel later confirmed the injury seems “serious.”

Villarreal came within the width of a post of restoring parity, six minutes after the restart. A poor clearance from Mendy landed at the feet of Dia, who fed Gerard Moreno. With time and space to pick his spot from an angle, Gerard Moreno instead mixed up his angles. Villarreal were visibly boosted by the chance, Chalobah’s last-ditch clearance necessary to prevent Dia from surely nodding home.

Villarreal were, though, to claim the equaliser their play at this point deserved. Dia supplied a glorious back heel that Gerard Moreno ran onto before clipping beyond Mendy. That glorious piece of attacking movement – assisted by Antonio Rudiger gifting possession to the Spaniards, it must be noted – had Emery dancing for joy. Rudiger later atoned by scoring Chelsea’s final penalty.

Alonso came closest to winning the game for Chelsea in normal time, his fierce shot rippling the side netting. Pulisic fluffed his lines when it looked easier to score. Mendy did not look perturbed at all about being summoned towards the bench. “He accepted it,” said Tuchel. Not that he really had much choice. Tuchel remains Chelsea’s man with the golden touch.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Here’s a match report from Windsor Park:

At the conclusion of a pre-season campaign described as “pretty demanding” by Thomas Tuchel, it seems obvious that extra-time in the Super Cup did not form part of any grand plan. The laboured efforts of players on both sides during those added 30 minutes added to a sense of inconvenience. Sudden death penalty kicks were still to come.

Still, winning covers a multitude of irritations. Tuchel opted to throw on Kepa Arrizabalaga with penalties looming; a decision fully justified as the Spaniard saved the decisive spot kick from Raul Albiol. Unai Emery’s Villarreal contributed much but this was Chelsea’s trophy.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A prominent horse racing trainer pleaded guilty on Wednesday to involvement in what US prosecutors have called a global scheme to systematically drug horses and cheat the betting public.

Jorge Navarro admitted in federal court in Manhattan to involvement in a conspiracy to administer performance-enhancing drugs to horses, in order to win more prize money at racetracks.

“I was the organiser for a criminal activity that involved five or more participants. I coordinated the administration of non-FDA approved drugs that were misbranded or adulterated to horses under my care,” he said a statement to the court. “I abused a position of trust as I was a licensed horse trainer and the horses were in my custody at the time.”

He could be jailed for five years at his sentencing, which is scheduled for December. He has agreed to pay $25.9m in restitution, reflecting winnings tied to doping. Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil accepted Navarro’s guilty plea.

“As he admitted today, Navarro, a licensed trainer and the purported ‘winner’ of major races across the world, was in fact a reckless fraudster whose veneer of success relied on the systematic abuse of the animals under his control,” US attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.

Jason Kreiss, Navarro’s lawyer, said in an email the trainer accepted responsibility for his actions.

At least 31 trainers, veterinarians, drug distributors and others have been charged since March 2020 over alleged doping affecting races in New York, Kentucky, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and the United Arab Emirates. Seven defendants have pleaded guilty and one entered a deferred prosecution agreement, court records show.

Other defendants include Jason Servis, the trainer of Maximum Security, who appeared to win the 2019 Kentucky Derby before being disqualified for interference. That horse also won the $20m Saudi Cup, the world’s richest horse race, before Servis was charged.

Servis is seeking to suppress a variety of wiretap evidence, including from Navarro‘s phone. Rita Glavin, a lawyer for Servis, declined to comment.

Navarro’s career winnings total $34.9m, led by $3m for the gelding X Y Jet, according to racing industry database provider Equibase.

Prosecutors said Navarro regularly drugged that horse, including with a substance he called “monkey,” in March 2019 before it won the Dubai Golden Shaheen, collecting $1.5m. X Y Jet died of an apparent heart attack in January 2020.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The highest temperature in European history appears to have been recorded in Italy during a heatwave sweeping the country, with early reports suggesting a high of 48.8C (119.85F).

If this is accepted by the World Meteorological Organisation it will break the previous European record of 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in 1977. The temperature was measured at a monitoring station in Syracuse, Sicily, and confirmed soon after by the island’s meteorological authorities.

The finding comes amid a fierce heatwave stretching across the Mediterranean to Tunisia and Algeria. Fires have blazed across much of the region for more than a week. Italy’s government has declared a state of emergency. Turkey and Greece have also been hit by devastating conflagrations.

Trevor Mitchell, a meteorologist from MetDesk, said: “The Società Meteorologica Italiana say that the temperature report of 48.8C is genuine. However, with potential records such as these there is typically a process of verification before they can be declared officially.

“Sicily has been experiencing a heatwave in the last few days. The foehn effect [a change from wet, cold conditions on one side of a mountain to warmer, drier conditions on the other] in the lee of the mountains to the west of Syracuse is likely to have assisted in generating the 48.8C observed there today.”

Scott Duncan, a Scottish meteorologist, said more heat records were inevitable. “A dangerous heatwave spanning much of north Africa and into southern Europe is unfolding right now. The focus of heat will shift west and north slightly in the coming days,” he tweeted.

The extreme heat in Europe is the latest unwelcome record to strike the northern hemisphere this summer. Temperature records have been smashed in Canada, the west of the US, Finland, Estonia, Turkey and Moscow. Unprecedented floods have swept through Germany and parts of China. Record wildfires are blazing in the Siberian taiga, the world’s biggest forest.

In Russia’s Sakha republic forest fires have released 208 megatonnes of carbon this year, almost double last year’s record, according to Mark Parrington, a senior scientist with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.

Climate scientists have long predicted that fossil fuel emissions from vehicles, factories and deforestation would lead to more extreme weather. The latest report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released on Monday, said the link was unequivocal and irreversible but that worse impacts could be reduced if governments acted quickly.

“This is climate change in 3D. It is here,” said Owen Gaffney, an analyst at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “We are radically changing the climate system so hot areas will get hotter, wet areas will get wetter. We are going to get more extremes.”

Friederike Otto, an associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, said extreme weather, and particularly extreme heat, was being seen across the world. “Climate change is already here. There are things we can stop from getting worse, but there are a lot of changes that are already here.”

Parchment feared he would miss last Wednesday’s 110m hurdles semi-final when he got on the wrong coach and ended up at what he believes was one of the aquatics venues. All the official Tokyo 2020 cars were booked and taking a bus back to the Olympic village and then another to the stadium would have left him struggling to make the start of the race.

“If I had done that, I wouldn’t get there in time to even warm up. I had to find another way. I was trying to get one of the branded cars for the Games to take me, but these people are very strict and adhering to the rules, and I would have to have to book the car from beforehand to get it to leave,” he said on the video posted to social media.

That is when he saw Tiana. “I saw this volunteer and I had to beg, ‘cause of course she is not allowed to do much, and she actually gave me some money to take one of the taxis. And that’s how I was able to get to the warm-up in time, and had enough time to compete,” Parchment said.

Parchment won bronze at the 2012 Olympics but missed the Games in 2016 due to injury. The 31-year-old only finished third in the Jamaican trials for Tokyo and did not win either his heat or semi-final on his way to the final. However, once there he beat a high-quality field in a season-best time of 13.04 seconds to take the Olympic title.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Algeria’s president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, has declared three days of national mourning amid the death toll from raging wildfires in the north of the country rising to 69.

The state-run news agency APS said the rash of more than 50 fires which broke out on Tuesday had claimed four more lives, bringing the total to 69, including 28 soldiers deployed to help the emergency services.

Tebboune said the three days of national mourning would start on Thursday. The authorities said they suspected widespread arson since so many fires had erupted in such a short space of time. Several arrests were announced, but the identities or suspected motives of those detained were not disclosed.

Images of trapped villagers, terrified livestock and forested hillsides reduced to blackened stumps, were shared on social media, many accompanied by pleas for help.

AFP journalists saw villagers desperately trying to put out the spreading fires with makeshift brooms in an effort to save their homes.

High winds fuelled the rapid spread of the flames in tinder-dry conditions created by a heatwave across north Africa and the wider Mediterranean, Youcef Ould Mohamed, a fire official, told APS.

Scores of separate wildfires remained active on Wednesday, spread across 17 provinces, said the emergency services spokesman, Nassim Barnaoui.

Most of the fires and 16 of the deaths were recorded in Tizi Ouzou district, in the mainly Berber region of Kabyle, east of the capital, Algiers.

“I left all my stock in my village and fled to Tizi Ouzou with my wife and three children,” said Abdelhamid Boudraren, a shopkeeper from the village of Beni Yeni.

Letreche Hakim, head of civil protection in Bejaia, the second biggest city in Kabyle, told APS the situation was alarming.

There have been growing calls for aid convoys to be sent to the worst-hit districts with food and medicine from the capital. On Wednesday an AFP correspondent saw several lorries heading to Tizi Ouzou with aid donated by the public.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote on Twitter that France would send two Canadair firefighting planes and a command aircraft to the Kabyle region on Thursday to help.

Morocco, with whom Algeria has long had strained ties over the Western Sahara, also expressed readiness to help. Two Canadair planes, “if the Algerian authorities agreed”, would be offered, a Moroccan foreign ministry statement said.

Algeria is also chartering two firefighting planes from the EU, aircraft recently being used to stop fires in Greece.

Meteorologists expect the heatwave across north Africa to continue until the end of the week, with temperatures in Algeria reaching 46C (115F).

In Tunisia the temperature in the capital, Tunis, hit an all-time record of 49C on Tuesday. The Tunisian emergency services reported 15 fires across the north and north-west, but no casualties.

Turkey reported eight deaths, and Greece three deaths from wildfires that have been raging for the past two weeks.

Each summer Algeria endures seasonal wildfires but rarely anything approaching this year’s disaster. In 2020 nearly 440 sq km (170 sq miles) of forest were destroyed by fire.

On Monday a major report by the UN body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was released and showed how the threat from global warming was even more acute than previously thought.

The report highlighted how scientists are quantifying the extent to which human-induced warming increases the intensity and likelihood of a specific extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and wildfires. Climate change amplifies droughts, creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spread out of control and inflict unprecedented damage.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A man’s cravings for a sweet treat have landed him in the hotseat with the police after he landed his helicopter in the centre of a small Canadian town to buy an ice-cream cake.

Residents in the town of Tisdale, Saskatchewan (population 3,000) watched in astonishment on 31 July as a bright red helicopter descended on the parking lot near the town’s only Dairy Queen, blowing up clouds of dust and debris as it touched down.

Initially, some residents thought the chopper – painted the same colour as the province’s air ambulances – was on the scene for a medical emergency.

But when the town’s mayor saw the passenger leave the restaurant with an ice cream cake, he realized the aircraft had a different mission.

“Well, I thought somebody must be hungry,” Mayor Al Jellicoe told CBC News. “Initially, I thought that’s probably not the right thing to do.”

Police agreed.

On Wednesday, they said investigators had determined the journey to Dairy Queen was “not an emergency” and had charged the 34-year-old pilot, who has not been named.

The man, from the town of Leroy, had a license to operate the helicopter, but parked it in an illegal spot.

He faces one count of dangerous operation of an aircraft and is scheduled to appear in court on 7 September in the city of Melfort.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, has lost a high court battle to prevent the US government expanding the grounds for its appeal against an earlier refusal to allow his extradition to face charges of espionage and hacking government computers.

On Wednesday, judges said the weight given to a misleading report from Assange’s psychiatric expert that was submitted at the original hearing in January could form part of Washington’s full appeal in October.

Sitting in London, Lord Justice Holroyde said he believed it was arguable that Judge Vanessa Baraitser had attached too much weight to the evidence of Prof Michael Kopelman when deciding not to allow the US’s appeal.

The expert had told the court he believed Assange would take his own life if extradited. But he did not include in his report the fact that Assange had fathered two children with his partner while holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London – a fact Assange later used in support of his bail application.

Clair Dobbin QC, for the US, argued the expert misled Baraitser, who presided over the January hearing.

Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing Assange, told the court Baraitser, having heard all of the evidence in the case, was in the best position to assess it and reach her decision.

He said Kopelman’s report was given long before any court hearing and against a background of concern for the “human predicament” in which Assange’s partner, Stella Moris, found herself at the time.

Delivering the latest decision, Holroyde said it was “very unusual” for an appeal court to have to consider evidence from an expert that had been accepted by a lower court, but also found to have been misleading – even if the expert’s actions had been deemed an “understandable human response” designed to protect the privacy of Assange’s partner and children.

The judge said that, in those circumstances, it was “at least arguable” that Baraitser erred in basing her conclusions on the professor’s evidence.

“Given the importance to the administration of justice of a court being able to reply on the impartiality of an expert witness, it is in my view arguable that more detailed and critical consideration should have been given to why [the professor’s] ‘understandable human response’ gave rise to a misleading report.”

The US government had previously been allowed to appeal against Baraitser’s decision on three grounds – including that it was wrong in law. Assange’s legal team had described the grounds as “narrow” and “technical”. The two allowed on Wednesday were additional.

During Wednesday’s hearing, the US government argued Assange, 50, was not “so ill” that he would be unable to resist killing himself if extradited – challenging Baraitser’s ruling that the US authorities could not “prevent Assange from finding a way to commit suicide” if he was extradited.

Dobbin said the US government would seek to show that Assange’s mental health problems did not meet the threshold required in law to prevent extradition.

She told the court: “It really requires a mental illness of a type that the ability to resist suicide has been lost. Part of the appeal will be that Assange did not have a mental illness that came close to being of that nature and degree.”

Holroyde said he would not ordinarily have allowed this to form part of the appeal on its own merits alone. But he said it must be taken in the context of the broader grounds allowed and could be argued at the full hearing.

Assange appeared at the hearing via video link from Belmarsh prison, wearing a dark face covering and a white shirt, with what appeared to be an untied burgundy tie draped around his neck.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An earthquake of magnitude 7.1 has struck about 40 miles (63km) east of Pondaguitan in the Philippines, prompting a tsunami warning that was later cancelled.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said on Wednesday that damage and aftershocks were expected, according to CNN.

The quake was at a depth of 65.6km, the United States Geological Survey said.

The US National Weather Service said there was no risk of a tsunami for the US west coast from the earthquake. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency said Hawaii also faced no tsunami threat.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@By the time Ady Barkan appeared before Congress in May 2019 to advocate for Medicare for All, he had lost the ability to speak. The then 35-year-old lawyer and activist was dying slowly of paralysis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but as his body weakened, his voice carried. Speaking through a computerized system that converts eye movements along a keyboard to speech, Barkan held the room as he urged lawmakers to dramatically overhaul the US healthcare system.

Even with good private insurance, he explained, he and his family paid $9,000 a month for round-the-clock care. To go on Medicare would relegate him to a nursing home, away from his wife, Rachael King, and their then three-year-old son, Carl. “We are cobbling together the money, from friends and family and supporters all over the country,” he told Congress. “But this is an absurd way to run a healthcare system.”

His testimony forms both the first few minutes and the emotional climax of Not Going Quietly, a new Duplass brothers-produced documentary on Barkan’s improbable route to become one of the leading voices for ethical, accessible healthcare in the US. With unvarnished scenes of caregiving and a heaping dose of Barkan’s sardonic wit, the film, directed by Nicholas Bruckman, traces the central paradox of his life post-diagnosis: the weaker he gets, the louder he becomes.

In the face of declining motor skills, a terminal prognosis (most ALS patients survive three to five years post-diagnosis, though some, such as physicist Stephen Hawking, live decades with the disease), and an eventual tracheotomy, Barkan pleaded a case for universal healthcare fueled by his personal experience. “He used his story as a weapon,” Bruckman told the Guardian, to become, as Politico Magazine called him in a March 2019 profile, “the most powerful activist in America”.

Not Going Quietly observes roughly two years of Barkan and his family’s life as he uses his illness to draw attention to numerous healthcare issues in the US – the exorbitant costs of chronic healthcare, potential cuts to home-health funding, the risk that insurance companies could deny coverage for “pre-existing conditions”. Following his diagnosis at 32 in 2016, Barkan, a lawyer and progressive organizer who had gained limited national attention for focused policy campaigns, took his motorized wheelchair on the road.

In December 2017, he met another organizer, Liz Jaff, while waiting for a flight from Washington DC to Phoenix. Arizona’s Republican senator Jeff Flake happened to be on board. Barkan confronted Flake and urged him to vote against the Trump tax cuts that would probably make healthcare costs balloon. “What should I tell my son, or what should you tell my son, if you pass this bill and I can’t get a ventilator?” he pleaded, while Jaff filmed. “You can be an American hero,” he added. “You could save my life.”

The tactic was unsuccessful – Flake voted for the measure, which passed. But the video went viral, launching Barkan on to the national news circuit and, along with Jaff, a spitballing, indomitable cross-country campaign, Be A Hero, to flip the House in the 2018 midterms on the basis of healthcare reform.

Bruckman connected with Barkan shortly after the Flake incident, in early 2018, to film a brief promo for Be A Hero. Their initial meeting, at Barkan and King’s house in Santa Barbara, California, appears in the film’s first five minutes. Barkan is in good spirits, laughing as King changes his clothes and fluffs his hair. Shirtless, he jokes to the camera: “How about like this?”

“I realized that this is not somebody with even an ounce of self-pity,” Bruckman recalled of that moment. Barkan was “really using humor as a tool to fight back against this disease, in the same way that he was using his story to fight back against what was happening under the Trump administration and the fight that continues to erupt over healthcare in the US”.

By then, Barkan was already more than a year post-diagnosis and had only about six more months left with his natural voice; the pressure was on to record as much of his voice as possible, as Barkan “wanted to create a time capsule of who he was for his son”, said Bruckman.

“We were just all in to capture this chapter in his life,” Bruckman said. Still, Barkan’s declining condition presented Bruckman’s team with several thorny ethical issues – not in how vulnerable to be on screen, or how much of the caregiving process to show (one notable scene depicts Barkan’s best friend, Nate Smith, helping him shower at a campground bathroom on the Be a Hero tour). Rather, the question was how to direct Barkan’s waning reserves of energy. “A lot of days when we were with Ady away from his family, he only had about 30 minutes of voice in him for a whole day before his voice would give out,” said Bruckman. “So we had to decide: do we interview him and have him talk to us about this movie? Or should he call his son for what is one of their limited conversations on the road, and with only a few months left for his son to hear his voice?”

The team frequently chose the latter, opting for a cinema vérité depiction of Barkan’s chats with Carl, eating pasta on FaceTime, or the moments – at a speech, in the RV – when it becomes clear his speaking voice is giving out. The motor decline of ALS is shot through with bracing acceptance and dark humor – at one point, Barkan jokes that the 79-year-old Senator Bernie Sanders “becomes a raisin while I become a vegetable”. At another, he’s stoned in the RV, laughing uncontrollably as he attempts to eat an “ALS-friendly” s’more. Barkan’s final message with his natural voice? “Peace out, motherfuckers.”

“Ady really inherently understood that the nitty gritty, warts and all, the real, authentic, painful, funny, poignant moments of his life were what would make effective advocacy and political change,” Bruckman said. “The goal of these confrontations is not to get Jeff Flake to flip his vote, necessarily,” he said, citing the influence of lobbyists and corporations on lawmakers. “What we can do is we can show the impacts of their policies, we can document that through our stories, we can share that and we can build people-powered movements that win elections,” as in several House districts in 2018, “and gets the politicians replaced.”

Barkan and King, an English professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, continue to live in California with five-year-old Carl and their daughter Willow, born in 2019. Barkan remains a staunch proponent of Medicare for All and influential progressive voice who prodded all of the Democratic candidates on healthcare before the 2020 election. His endorsement of Joe Biden in July 2020, following the end of Sanders’ and Elizabeth Warren’s campaigns, was a notable win for a Biden campaign eager for progressive figures to actively back the moderate nominee.

Not Going Quietly concludes before all that, before Biden’s victory in the 2020 election and Barkan’s current focus: the fight to pass a $3.5tn infrastructure package with provisions for childcare, healthcare subsidies and eldercare. But the lessons of the Be A Hero tour, and the amplification of one’s personal experience, carry forward. “Ady’s story asks this fundamental question of: well, if Ady can participate in our democracy, what’s my excuse?” said Bruckman.

“What do you do with the time you have left?” he added. “How could something that feels meaningless or painful or tragic or a loss be turned into a tool to make a better world, either for our democracy at large or for the people that you care about in your life?”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Society of Authors (SoA) has asked the writers it represents “to be mindful of privilege and of the impact of what they create, do and say” in an email to committee members responding to the recent criticism of Kate Clanchy’s 2019 Orwell-prize winning book, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me.

In the email, which has since been made public, the SoA also distances itself from comments made by its president Philip Pullman on Twitter. The His Dark Materials author had defended Clanchy, whose descriptions of children of colour and autistic children in particular, have been widely criticised on Goodreads and Twitter in recent days.

Pullman, who has been the SoA’s president since 2013, praised Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, calling it “humane, warm, decent, generous, and welcoming”. In a now deleted comment, made in response to a tweet he wrongly thought to be about Clanchy, he wrote that those who do not read a book before condemning it would “find a comfortable home in Isis or the Taliban”. Authors of colour who criticised Clanchy, including Chimene Suleyman, Monisha Rajesh and Sunny Singh, went on to receive racist abuse from social media users. Pullman has now tweeted an apology for the harm he caused, admitting that his tweet was a “mistake”.

“Writers of colour (including children) and people of colour who are not writers (including children, again), your experiences and imaginations deserve every kind of respect” he added.

The email from the SoA emphasised that “Philip wrote his comments as an individual, not in the name of the Society of Authors”, and that “President is an honorary position only: he does not play any part in the governance of the SoA”.

It also stated “We do not get involved in individual debates – or in disputes between authors” but that “we condemn any kind of racist, hate or unprofessional speech.” The union encouraged members to make a complaint if they are concerned about another author’s behaviour.

The email quoted Sunny Singh’s tweet which stated “UK publishing is a hostile environment for writers of colour. This is a structural issue not an individual one. However, it is perpetuated and reinforced by individuals and organisations”, adding “we have no intention of being one of the organisations that perpetuates it.”

Joanne Harris, chair of the SoA’s democratically elected management committee, said “it has been very hard for some of the SoA staff to follow what has been happening on Twitter without breaking our policy of not commenting on social media disputes. Philip and I have both expressed our personal opinions on Twitter, rather than in our official capacity.”

“As Chair of the SoA,” she added, “I’d like to emphasise that not only do we deplore racism and prejudice in all its forms, but all our policies are active policies – they exist to make a real difference for people, and not just as words on a website.”

An open letter, written by the editor and writer Sabeena Akhtar, has today been published by Bad Form, a literary review by and about Black, Asian and marginalised community writers.

“As members of the writing and publishing community we have watched in horror as three of our colleagues, Monisha Rajesh, Professor Sunny Singh and Chimene Suleyman have been targeted, harassed and gaslighted online for rightly pointing out the use of dehumanising, ableist and racist language and questioning the structures and processes in wider publishing that allowed them to get through the editorial process, become published and then lauded. We stand in complete solidarity with the brave writers who challenged this and condemn all attempts to attack them and obfuscate and negate the veracity of their concerns”, it begins.

The letter goes on to say “we cannot silently stand by whilst a group of marginalised women are being targeted by those with power and influence in this industry. We urge our colleagues to speak up and use the resources and influence in their gift as a force for change. Publishing must do better.”

At present, the letter has more than 150 signatories, including writers Nikesh Shukla, Candice Carty-Williams, Sara Collins and Jessie Burton, comedians Nish Kumar and Deborah Frances-White and publisher Kishani Widyaratna.

Suleyman’s publisher Unbound has published a statement on Twitter, condemning the “shameful racist attacks on women writers of colour”. Dialogue Books, the imprint of leading publishing house Hachette that spotlights the LGBTQ+, disability, working class and black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, has also put out a statement. “Dialogue condemns the racist treatment of people of colour, particularly women of colour, on social media over the past week. The publishing industry must learn from the response and the fallout”, it said.

On Tuesday, Clanchy confirmed that she will rewrite sections of Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me. Her publisher Picador released a statement apologising for the “emotional anguish” caused by the book, but has not yet made any further comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When it comes to the pandemic, plenty of films have had their turn in the spotlight. Contagion was one of them, for contextualising the scale of the virus and teaching everybody what an R number was. So was Jaws, with Amity Island’s safety-denying mayor, Larry Vaughn, serving as an analogue for any authority figure who was skeptical about the concept of lockdown.

To some extent, those films make sense. In times of great uncertainty, we reach for the familiar to guide us. But sometimes that’s a bad idea. Because sometimes what they reach for is the Will Smith movie I Am Legend.

You will remember I Am Legend. Coming towards the tail end of his turn as the world’s biggest movie star, the film saw a lone Smith struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic New York that had been ravaged by mutant vampires (that look more like zombies). I Am Legend has entered the pandemic conversation because a small but insistent group has started to ask a simple question: “Wait, did those nice people turn into mutant vampires because they took the Covid vaccine?”

This isn’t necessarily a new development. Back in December, when vaccine trials were nearing their completion, the rumours that vaccines created vampires became so insistent that Reuters had to publish a factcheck article to deny it. The mutant vampires in I Am Legend became mutant vampires because they were exposed to a genetically re-engineered strain of the measles virus in order to cure cancer (courtesy of Emma Thompson’s ambitious doctor). No vaccines were involved whatsoever. But still, the damage had been done. When a globally respected news organisation has to use its precious resources to explain the plot of a disappointing Christmas movie from a decade and a half ago, you sense the battle has already been lost.

Still, though, the I Am Legend theory regained momentum this week when the New York Times ran a story about anti-vaxxers, claiming that an employee at an eyewear store had refused the vaccine because “she thought a vaccine had caused the characters in the film I Am Legend to turn into zombies”. This, in turn, caused the film’s co-writer Akiva Goldsman to tweet: “Oh. My. God. It’s a movie. I made that up. It’s. Not. Real.”

In truth, it is very hard to find any movie at all where the vaccine is the bad guy. In World War Z, for example, the zombies are created with a virus and the hero has to find a vaccine. In The Omega Man (the second adaptation of I Am Legend after the 1964 film The Last Man on Earth), Charlton Heston only survives a vampire-zombie wave because he is vaccinated. In Outbreak, a virus spreads and the heroes race to find a vaccine. The 1980 Japanese movie Virus ends with the protagonist embracing some vaccinated strangers and declaring: “Life is wonderful.” True, there is the 1973 horror movie Sssssss, where Dirk Benedict is put on a course of injections that tragically turn him into a snake, but unfortunately those injections are not vaccinations. They were designed to turn Dirk Benedict into a snake all along. Once again, it ultimately exists as proof that medicine does its job.

Arguably the only mainstream movie to ever depict vaccinations as a force for evil, in fact, is 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand, in which a wealthy industrialist discovers an inoculation that targets the gene that gives mutants their abilities. And even that doesn’t work, for a couple of reasons. First, the vaccine in the film is designed to deny mutants their truest versions of themselves, and not even the most frothing anti-vaxxer would claim that the coronavirus was an integral part of their personality. And second, you will remember that X-Men: The Last Stand climaxed with an out of control unvaccinated mutant threatening to tear apart the entire fabric of the universe as we know it, so maybe the idea of a vaccination isn’t that silly after all.

Not that any of this matters, of course. If anti-vaxxers can convince themselves that some half-remembered Will Smith film from 2007 can act as a watertight scientific explanation for not wanting to get jabbed, then they can basically use that rationale on any film. Their arguments are unforgivable for any number of reasons, not least that it sort of makes me want to watch I Am Legend again.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Las Vegas: the city of sin, where you can gamble away your savings, get married on a whim, dine on an octuple bypass burger at the Heart Attack Grill – and soon, it has been announced, take part in one of the most valuable Picasso auctions ever staged.

Sotheby’s has announced it is to sell 11 Picasso works owned by MGM Resorts, which have a combined value of about $100m (£72m).

Inevitably, it comes with razzmatazz. The plan is to recreate Sotheby’s famous New York auction room in the Bellagio, the vast hotel and casino with more than 3,000 rooms and almost as many slot machines, poker tables and roulette wheels.

The Bellagio, famous for its musical fountain show and a starring role in the movie Ocean’s Eleven, has always had one of the city’s best art galleries. Many of the Picassos being sold hang in the hotel’s “Picasso” restaurant.

Ari Kastrati, the chief hospitality officer of MGM Resorts, said it promised to be a “momentous auction”. It was selling in order to buy new, more diverse art, he added. “We are committed to creating an even more inclusive collection that maintains the breadth of our existing portfolio while giving a greater voice to artists from underrepresented communities.”

One of the auction highlights will be Femme au Béret Rouge-Orange, painted in 1938 and one of Picasso’s final works depicting his muse and lover Marie-Thérèse Walter. It is being sold with an estimate of $20-30m.

Picasso was 45 and unhappily married when he spotted Walter, then 17, at the Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris in 1927. “Mademoiselle, you have an interesting face. I would like to paint your portrait,” he said. “I’m sure we shall do great things together. I am Picasso,” he added, to someone who had no idea who that was.

The chance meeting and subsequent affair was effectively Picasso being reborn, his grandson Olivier Widmaier Picasso has said. His Walter paintings were an important part of the 1932 Paris retrospective, which established Picasso as the most famous and controversial artist in the world.

One of those was Le Rêve, which has its own place in Las Vegas and art history because it was owned by the casino owner Steve Wynn, who in 2006 was due to sell it to the hedge fund mogul Steven Cohen for a world record $139m.

Heart-stoppingly, Wynn accidentally jabbed it with his elbow while showing it off to friends. There was a ripping sound. The six-inch tear was repaired but its value went down an estimated $54m. It was eventually bought by Cohen in 2013 for $155m.

By 1938, Picasso was in love with the photographer Dora Maar and was effectively living a double life romantically. Sotheby’s said a portrait of Walter from that year was “exceedingly rare”.

Also in the sale will be two of Picasso’s larger paintings from between 1969 and 1970 – Homme et Enfant ($20-30m) and Buste d’Homme ($10-15m). Both were included in a 1970 exhibition at the Palais des Papes in Avignon, probably the most important exhibition of his late career.

Another highlight is Nature Morte au Panier de Fruits et aux Fleurs, which comes with an estimate of $10-15m. A still life, it was painted by Picasso in 1942 during the Nazi occupation of Paris when he was barred from exhibiting work.

The auction on 23 October will be the biggest fine art auction to have ever taken place in Las Vegas and will be accompanied by a four-day exhibition of “the world’s finest luxury items”.

Precise details have not yet been revealed but the items would include cars, jewellery, watches, handbags, trainers and more, the auction house said. They will then be sold at the end of October.

Brooke Lampley, the worldwide head of fine art sales at Sotheby’s, said her team could not wait to “bring the magic of a Sotheby’s evening sale to Las Vegas” for the first time. “As one of the most famous, beloved and accomplished artists of all time, we couldn’t imagine anyone better than Picasso to inaugurate this unique art and culture experience.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bolivia’s cholitas luchadoras began wrestling in the early 2000s. The women, indigenous Aymara Indians who have traditionally been marginalised and oppressed, took to Mexican-style lucha libre wrestling for mental and physical health – and to stick two fingers up to a culture where wrestling was strictly a male preserve. For many it was also a means of escaping domestic violence. Their choreographed fights in the ring became a dramatisation of day-to-day struggles, all the while adorned in their traditional dress of layered skirts, petticoats and embroidered shawls. Their name, too, subverts and reclaims a term, cholita, that has often been used to demean. But there was also a social and recreational aspect to the wrestling matches that are staged as entertainment, and have grown over the years. Today it’s become a living for many of them, with their fights drawing huge crowds of local people and tourists.

For my personal projects I seek out ordinary people that lead extraordinary lives. I came across the cholitas luchadoras when I was researching another (unconnected) project in La Paz, the Cholitas Escaladoras Bolivianas, AKA the climbing cholitas. The wrestlers are in El Alto, a suburb of La Paz that sits high on a plateau 1,500m above the main city. The houses of the town seem to cascade down the steep cliffs into La Paz below and the mountains of the Andes are ever present. We spent our first few nights driving around looking for cool locations that would showcase the women – I knew I wanted to photograph them outside the ring and make the landscape part of the images. The float and bounce of their traditional dresses is an integral part of the visual impact of the wrestling, and I drew inspiration from the South American literary tradition of magic realism in how I portrayed the fighters mid-air, mid-flight, giving the images a dream-like quality.

In some matches the women also take on men – guys often twice their size – and hurl them over their shoulders

Ponkiss is a local soda of sorts. I know it almost looks like a set but it’s a street in El Alto. I had set up lighting to freeze the action, but I didn’t stage-manage the costumes – this is what they wear when in the ring and just another part of what makes them so unique, although I did place the various women in settings according to what colours would work better together. I love how the beautiful teal colours from the light in the window above are reflected in the colour of the dress. We also lit the background with the headlights from our production vehicle parked just out of frame – you can see that low light in the picture, raking from right to left, highlighting the wrestlers and lifting them out from the background. From a technical point of view it was a very tricky shot. I’m not going to tell you exactly how it was done, but I promise there were no wires, nothing like that. What you are seeing is them mid-flight. We kept experimenting to see which moves created the most dynamic shapes and allowed the dresses to flow and billow. We must have done 30 takes for each image but the women never batted an eye despite the physical toll. They’re incredible.

The wrestling matches might be staged – with the técnicos (the good guys) versus the rudos (the bad guys), but that doesn’t make them any less physically challenging. In some matches the women also take on men – guys often twice their size – and hurl them over their shoulders. But, however much it’s for show, the ring is still a sheet of plywood on top of stainless steel struts; when you hit it, it still hurts, you still bleed.

I’ve just returned from Sierra Leone where I was photographing amputee football teams – men who have lost legs during the civil war. Most of the imagery we’re used to digesting from Africa is documentary in style, or in bleached, brown tones, which is frequently counter to the vibrancy of colour there. I try to challenge these visual tropes by consciously shooting against them, especially by using lighting in settings you wouldn’t expect. I arrived in Sierra Leone with 10 cases of equipment, and for the Climbing Cholitas series we carried battery-powered studio flash units up to 5,000m to shoot the climbers in a way not ordinarily seen in mountaineering photography.

If possible I want these photos to provide some sort of tangible benefit for their subjects. I don’t want to rock up, take a bunch of pictures and leave again. I’m using the images from the Sierra Leone footballers to drive a GoFundMe I’ve set up to purchase crutches for the players, as they are prohibitively expensive there. And wherever possible I spend time with the people I’m shooting. Just hang out and chat. I owe it to them to produce images that do them justice.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fully vaccinated people in England will no longer be legally required to self-isolate upon contact with a positive Covid case from Monday, and will instead be advised to take a PCR test – in a marked shift from rules that have led to more than 14m instructions to stay at home.

Ministers have confirmed that the legal requirement to isolate will be replaced with non-binding advice to take a test for the double-jabbed, as well as those 18 and under. And those who do come into contact with the infected will not be told to isolate while waiting for their results. For people who do test positive, isolation will continue.

The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Wednesday night that the government was able to go ahead with the decision to exempt the fully vaccinated from isolation rules on Monday 16 August, as planned, because “getting two doses of a vaccine has tipped the odds in our favour and allowed us to safely reclaim our lost freedoms”.

Although Boris Johnson was under pressure from business to bring forward the 16 August date, because of disruption caused by the “pingdemic”, he said last month that timetable was “nailed on” and there was no likelihood of it being moved.

But when the details were announced on Wednesday night, they were less restrictive than they might have been. The fully vaccinated and under-18s will only be advised to get a PCR test if they are a close contact of a positive case, not required to, and they will not be expected to isolate while they await the results of the test.

And, for young people, in practice the cut-off point will be 18 years and six months, because people turning 18 will be exempt from isolation for another six months to allow them time to get fully vaccinated.

The new regime should also end the mass disruption of schooling when pupils return to class next month because it will allow the “bubbles” system – that contributed to almost a quarter of pupils being out of school for Covid-related reasons by the end of the summer term – to be abandoned.

According to the official data, there have been more than 9m calls to people since the pandemic began from the English test-and-trace service telling them that they must isolate. Until now, this has been a legal requirement.

There have also been more than 5m alerts sent by the Covid app in England telling people they should isolate for the same reason, although these “pings” have not been legally binding for the recipients.

People who can prove they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons will also be exempt from isolation rules. And anyone who was told before 16 August to go into isolation, with their isolation period due to end after 16 August, will instead be able to leave isolation from Monday.

Because people who have been fully vaccinated can still get infected, if they have been in contact with someone testing positive, they will be advised to take precautions like wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and limiting contact with others, especially clinically extremely vulnerable people.

Health and social care workers who are close contacts of a positive case will be allowed to return to work after a negative PCR test, but they will have to take daily lateral flow tests as a precaution.

The government is continuing to set up workplace testing centres so that workers doing critical jobs who are not fully vaccinated can use daily testing as an alternative to isolation.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Joe Biden’s decision to rapidly withdraw from Afghanistan is threatening to turn into one of the biggest Anglo-American foreign policy rifts in decades, with potentially dangerous political consequences if the UK government’s warnings about a return of terrorism and mass movement of refugees to Europe eventually prove correct.

Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, revealed in remarkably frank interviews on Friday that the UK was so aghast at the US decision to withdraw completely from Afghanistan next month that it had canvassed other Nato allies to see if there was support for a reconfigured alliance to continue the stabilisation force in Afghanistan without the US.

The Taliban continued its lightning advance on Friday, seizing four more provincial capitals and gaining control of more than two-thirds of country as its forces headed towards Kabul. Kandahar and Herat, the country’s second and third biggest cities, fell on Thursday.

Biden said as recently as July that there was no chance the Taliban would overrun the country, and denied that Afghanistan still represented a breeding ground for terrorism. Wallace and the chief of the UK defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, have directly contradicted Biden’s analysis and even said it may prove necessary to go back into the country.

Asked if he was worried that the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan could lead to terror attacks in the UK in the future, Wallace told Sky News: “I am absolutely worried that failed states are breeding grounds for those types of people.

“Of course I am worried, it is why I said I felt this was not the right time or decision to make because, of course, al-Qaida will probably come back – certainly would like that type of breeding ground. That is what we see: failed states around the world lead to instability, lead to a security threat to us and our interests.”

UK defence sources said it was self-evident that Afghan government forces were faring less well than the CIA and Biden had predicted only months ago.

Wallace revealed that once other Nato allies – understood to include France and Germany – had rejected forming a coalition of the willing without the US, the UK concluded that it could not go it alone.

“When the United States as the framework nation took that decision, the way we were all configured, the way we had gone in, meant that we had to leave as well,” he said, adding that a unilateral British presence in Afghanistan would have led to claims that the British were fighting the Afghan nation, reviving memories of the 1830s and the first British-Afghan war.

Wallace also said he believed that the initial decision by Donald Trump to engage with the Taliban in peace talks and then to first announce a US withdrawal in February 2020 was a mistake. “I was public about it that at the time of the Trump deal […] I felt that that was a mistake to have done it that way, that we will all as an international community pay the consequences of that,” he said.

His remarks were much harsher on the US decisions than the neutral remarks made by Boris Johnson in the Commons in July, when the prime minister glided over any transatlantic splits by telling MPs: “There is never going to be a right time to leave Afghanistan.”

Johnson also implicitly endorsed the Biden analysis, pointing out that no terrorist attacks against western targets had been mounted from Afghan soil since 2001.

Rory Stewart, the former cabinet minister and an expert on Afghanistan, reflecting a widespread view in the British military, said the speed with which Biden had ordered the withdrawal had compounded the error, since Afghan forces had not been given access to the necessary equipment or support.

The attack on the twin towers in 2001 led to one of the greatest displays of western solidarity with the US in the fight against terrorism, but 20 years on that solidarity is now being severely tested.

At the heart of the dispute is a series of transatlantic disagreements over the nature of the future terrorist threat, the capability of the Afghan forces and the wider western responsibility to the people of Afghanistan.

Biden, never an enthusiast for the war and supported by US opinion polls, said the US’s mission in Afghanistan had only two limited objectives – to send Osama bin Laden “to the gates of hell” and “to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States”. Biden said those objectives had been secured. He has stated: “We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build.”

Biden argued that the terrorist threat had changed and that the US could not afford to remain tethered to a 20-year-old analysis of terrorism when it had metastasised beyond Afghanistan into south Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The UK, by contrast, sees ungoverned space as the necessary incubator for terrorism.

For many of America’s allies, the task of nation-building was not just a moral responsibility, but indispensable to Europe’s security.

Gen Carter said last month: “The international community has got to do much more about calling out the way that the people on the ground are trashing government buildings, they’re threatening the population. There are reports of people being forced into marriages.”

He said he had seen “grisly videos of war crimes” and that the international community “mustn’t let them get away with this – we’ve got to call them out”.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Pentagon is “deeply concerned” about the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, as the Taliban completed their sweep of Afghanistan’s south on Friday, taking four more provincial capitals in a lightning offensive that brought them closer to the capital, Kabul, just weeks before the US is set to officially end its two-decade war.

The Biden administration has begun rushing 3,000 troops to Kabul’s airport to help with a partial evacuation of the US embassy. The move highlights the stunning speed of the Taliban takeover of much of the country, including their capture on Thursday of Kandahar, the second-largest city and the birthplace of the Taliban movement.

“We are certainly concerned by the speed with which the Taliban has been moving,” the Pentagon press spokesman, John Kirby, said at a briefing on Friday afternoon.

Kirby hesitated for several moments after a reporter asked him if the defense department had been surprised by the speed and ease with which the extremist insurgent force captured great swaths of the country with little resistance, despite years of US assistance to the Afghan government and training for Afghan troops.

“I’m not going to speculate about ‘surprise’,” Kirby said of the most recent developments.

“We’re obviously watching this just like you’re watching this and seeing it happen in real time, and it’s deeply concerning.”

Kirby said Kabul was “not right now in an imminent threat environment”, but added: “If you just look at what the Taliban’s been doing, you can see that they are trying to isolate Kabul. Now what they want to do if they achieve that isolation I think only they can speak to.”

Asked if Kabul was isolated now, Kirby deflected, saying, “I don’t want to get into a special intelligence assessment on the battlefield.”

The Pentagon called on Afghans to unite in the face of the extremist power grab. Kirby said: “No outcome has to be inevitable.”

Pentagon spokesperson says U.S. is "certainly concerned" by rapid Taliban advances in Afghanistan, but says "this is a moment for the Afghans to unite."

Joe Biden announced in April that he planned to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan by 11 September this year, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the US in 2001.

The United Nations secretary general António Guterres, on Friday called on the Taliban to immediately halt their offensive in Afghanistan, warning that “Afghanistan is spinning out of control.

“The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear: seizing power through military force is a losing proposition. That can only lead to prolonged civil war or to the complete isolation of Afghanistan,” Guterres said.

Molly Montgomery, the deputy assistant secretary of state in the bureau of European and Eurasian affairs, expressed serious concerns for Afghan women and girls as Taliban forces continue to advance towards Kabul.

“Woke up with a heavy heart, thinking about all the Afghan women and girls I worked with during my time in Kabul,” Montgomery said on Friday in a now-deleted tweet.

“They were the beneficiaries of many of the gains we made, and now they stand to lose everything. We empowered them to lead, and now we are powerless to protect them.”

Withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan was a central part of Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy, and had the support of a majority of Americans, according to polling.

But many Republicans have nonetheless been highly critical of Biden’s decision to follow through on the withdrawal. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, compared the Kabul embassy evacuation efforts to “the humiliating fall of Saigon in 1975”.

“Afghanistan is careening toward a massive, predictable, and preventable disaster,” McConnell said in a statement released on Thursday.

The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, accused the president of failing to “execute a responsible exit”.

“But in a matter of months, the Biden admin has led a botched withdrawal process that has now handed an entire country over to terrorists,” he said on Twitter.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As with most farmers living in the remote towns of the Aspromonte mountain range in Calabria, southern Italy, Nicola Fortugno’s land was his life. The 79-year-old refused to be evacuated when flames engulfed Piraino, a hamlet surrounded by pine forest above the town of Cardeto, on Wednesday. Instead, he stayed at home to try to save his animals and crops. His burnt, lifeless body was found by firefighters.

“I used to see Nicola whenever he came to town to go to the chemist or see the doctor,” said Francesca Crea, owner of the newspaper shop in Cardeto. “His death is very painful as we’re a community of mostly farmers, people who make great sacrifices for a small patch of land – the animals are their treasures.”

Communities across the Aspromonte mountains are counting the heavy costs to livelihoods and the environment as forest fires rage for the 10th day in a row. In recent days, efforts to extinguish the fires, which are also plaguing Sicily, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, have been hampered by hot winds amid an intense, protracted heatwave that could see Italy break European temperature records.

Wildfires have also ravaged large areas in southern Europe and Turkey as the region endures its most extreme heatwave in three decades.

The heatwave is forecast to persist for the next few days, with temperatures hitting up to 41C (106F).

The wildfires that affected the area of Cardeto were still smouldering on Thursday morning. Others were just beginning. The consequences were strikingly visible in the scorched land, blackened rocks and dozens of burnt or collapsed trees.

As of Thursday night, 60 fires were burning across Calabria, the highest number in Italy, prompting the government led by the prime minister, Mario Draghi, to announce a national emergency plan. “We will put in motion a programme of compensation for the people and businesses affected, together with an extraordinary reforestation and security plan,” Draghi’s office said in a statement.

Five people are confirmed to have died in the fires: four in Calabria and one in Sicily, where a 30-year-old farmer was crushed by his tractor as he tried to put out flames on his farm in Paterno, a town near Catania.

The deaths in Calabria have all occurred in the Aspromonte mountains, home to a vast national park that contains an area of centuries-old beech trees and which was declared this year as a Unesco world heritage site. A woman and her nephew were killed as they tried to save their olive grove; a 76-year-old man died after leaving his home in an attempt to safeguard his allotment.

Meanwhile, hundreds of pilgrims who had been walking towards a religious site in the town of San Luca were forced to turn back when flames enveloped roads.

In Roccaforte del Greco, a town of about 400 residents in the centre of the Aspromonte national park, Angela Tesorone and her brother, Alfonso, were forced to flee on Monday night as flames took hold. “These are the worst wildfires I have ever experienced,” said Tesorone, who owns a business that produces olive oil. “People have died; animals have died; acres and acres of forest and farmland have been destroyed. All that’s left are ashes.”

As the scale of destruction is assessed, anger is mounting over the handling of the wildfires, with many Calabrians pointing to a litany of errors – including the scrapping of the state forestry corps by Matteo Renzi’s government in 2016 – that they believe have exacerbated the situation amid this summer’s heatwave.

Others say the reinforcements from central government to help fight the fires have come too late. The army was dispatched to Calabria this week, as were staff from Italy’s civil protection authority. In addition, 2,500 forestry experts and volunteers from Calabria Verde, a council-owned company entrusted with taking care of the region’s forests, are involved in the firefighting effort.

“The entire squad is working across the territory,” said Giuseppe Oliva, the special commissioner for Calabria Verde. “This year the climatic conditions have made the fires very difficult to fight.”

I’ve never seen anything like the fires this summer, and it’s all down to bad management of the forests

Coldiretti, Italy’s main farmers’ association, said earlier this month that the number of wildfires in the country has tripled in 2021, compared with the yearly average between 2008 and 2020.

Authorities estimate that almost 57% fires in these conditions are malicious, caused by arsonists or those wanting to benefit from state funds. In some cases, the fires have been triggered by young people simply wanting to see the emergency services in action.

“Less than 2% are caused naturally, for example by a lightning strike. For 4.4% the cause is undetermined and 22% are unclassifiable situations in which it is difficult to know what triggered the fire,” said Roberto Cingolani, Italy’s ecological transition minister.

Sitting outside a bar in a hamlet close to Cardeto, Marco Bruno had no doubt that human negligence had had its role in the fires across the Aspromonte mountains. In 2003, when thousands died and swathes of forest were destroyed by wildfires in Europe amid an intense heatwave, the maintenance of the Aspromonte’s forests was entrusted to non-profit organisations. The organisations would receive the bulk of their payments only if they succeeded in limiting fires in their designated areas to less than 1%. The system, which led to a significant reduction in the number of wildfires, was abolished in 2013.

“I’ve never seen anything like the fires this summer,” said Bruno. “And it’s all down to bad management of the forests. We used to have a system that worked, experienced people who knew what they were doing. Now there is not sufficient monitoring or maintenance, and these are the consequences.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hundreds of fires are burning across the Mediterranean, displacing thousands and causing irreparable damage as human-made climate change causes record-breaking summer heatwaves.

With very high temperatures expected in parts of Spain and France on Friday and Saturday, the crisis threatens to spread with weeks of scorching summer weather still to come across the region.

In Greece, firefighters continued to battle what the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described on Thursday as the country’s “greatest ecological disaster in decades”.

Greece’s most severe heatwave in decades has fanned blazes that have destroyed more than 100,000 hectares of forests and farmland.

The fires have left three dead, hundreds homeless, forced thousands to flee, and caused economic and environmental devastation. Mitsotakis said that 150 homes have been destroyed in greater Athens over the last week, while the number is still rising on the island of Evia, which accounts for more than half of the area burned nationwide.

Although recent rain has eased the crisis in Greece, it is just one of a number of Mediterranean countries that have been hit by a savage fire season. The region has been singled out as a “climate change hotspot”, with increasing temperatures and aridity lengthening fire seasons, according to a draft IPCC assessment seen by Agence France-Presse.

Turkey has seen its southern coast devastated by fires. Eight people, including two firefighters, have died in the wildfires which have destroyed huge swathes of pine forest and agricultural land.

More than 10,000 people have been forced to abandon damaged homes, and resorts and hotels have been evacuated in the middle of the tourism season.

Italy registered a temperature of 48.8C (119.8F) in Sicily on Wednesday – beating the previous high registered in Greece in 1977 in what is believed to be a new European record – as anticyclone“Lucifer” moves across the country. An anticyclone is an area of high atmospheric pressure that in summer brings dry, hot weather.

Italian firefighters continued to battle hundreds of fires throughout the country’s south, particularly in Sicily and the Calabria region. Firefighters said there were over 500 blazes reported overnight. Italy’s fires have so far killed four people.

The burned body of a 79-year-old man was found in the Reggio Calabria area on Wednesday, while another man, aged 77, died in the same region after trying to shelter his herd from the flames, news agencies reported.

Their deaths follow those of a woman, 53, and her nephew, 35, also in Reggio Calabria, who died last Friday trying to save the family olive grove.

Now, the Mediterranean heatwave has started to shift west, with three wildfires raging in Spain on Thursday, and temperatures soaring above 40C in the country on Friday and Saturday, as well as in many parts of the south of France.

Dozens of firefighters backed by four water-dropping aircraft were on the scene of a blaze in the north-eastern Spanish province of Tarragona which has so far destroyed 40 hectares (100 acres) of protected forest, local officials said.

Two smaller fires were burning in the northern wine-producing region of La Rioja and another north-eastern province, Zaragoza, which involved two planes.

The wildfires come as temperatures were forecast to reach highs of about 40C (104F) in much of the country on Friday. All but three of Spain’s 17 regions were on alert for heat. According to Ruben del Campo, the spokesperson for Spain’s national weather office AEMET, the number of heatwaves registered in the country between 2011 and 2020 is double the number recorded in each of the three previous decades.

France’s southern areas have been put under a high temperature alert, and Portugal’s weather office has meanwhile warned that the centre and north of the country as well as parts of the southern Algarve province were on “maximum” alert for wildfires.

Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Costa, urged people to avoid “risky behaviours” which could cause wildfires.

“We know that the next few days are going to be difficult,” he told reporters on Thursday during a visit to a civil protection headquarters.

“We are facing a permanent challenge that is the result of climate change,” he added.

Like southern Europe, north Africa has been sweltering under searing heat.

European countries have sent firefighting planes to Algeria to help fight wildfires there that killed at least 69 people through the mountainous Berber region. The victims of the blazes include at least 28 soldiers who were deployed to fight the fires, according to authorities.

Algeria’s National Meteorology Office said extremely hot weather was forecast through Thursday in nearly a dozen regions, including around Tizi-Ouzou. In some parts of Algeria, the temperature was expected to hit 47C (116.6 F)

Temperatures hit 50C (122F) in Tunisia, a record high for the country. The last previous high was 48.2C (nearly 119F) in 1968.

Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, Lebanon has added recovery from fires in late July to its list of debilitating challenges.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the Delta variant continued to rip through regions of the US, Oregon’s governor said she would send up to 1,500 national guard troops to help hospital workers pushed to the brink by a surge of cases, while the White House announced that Texas and Florida alone accounted for almost 40% of new US Covid hospitalizations last week.

Democrat Kate Brown said troops would be sent to 20 hospitals around the state. Seven hundred and thirty-three 733 people were hospitalized in Oregon as of Friday, including 185 people in intensive care units – 60 more than a day before and nearly double the figure of two weeks ago.

Brown said: “I cannot emphasize enough the seriousness of this crisis for all Oregonians, especially those needing emergency and intensive care. When our hospitals are full with Covid-19 patients, there may not be room for someone needing care after a car crash, a heart attack, or other emergency situation.”

In the deep south states of Louisiana and Mississippi, among the lowest vaccinated populations in the country, hospitals reached capacity this week as deaths began to climb and health officials warned the crisis would deepen into next week.

Just seven states, including Alabama, Arkansas and Missouri, accounted for about half of Covid hospitalizations in the US despite making up about a quarter of the population, according to the White House coronavirus taskforce coordinator, ​​Jeff Zients.

All seven states have vaccination rates well below the national average.

In Oregon, the Delta variant now makes up 96% of all samples tested, up from just 15% six weeks ago, according to state data.

Brown, the governor, said: “The harsh, and frustrating reality is that the Delta variant has changed everything.”

During remarks on Thursday, Joe Biden praised frontline healthcare workers battling surging Covid patient populations.

“You know, our healthcare workers are heroes,” the president said. “They were the heroes when there was no vaccine. Many of them gave their lives trying to save others. And they’re heroes again with a vaccine. They’re doing their best to care for the people refusing to get vaccinated, unvaccinated folks who are being hospitalized and dying as a result of not being vaccinated.”

The comments came as the federal government authorized third doses of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines for certain people with weakened immune systems, while assuring that the vast majority of people who had received two shots were still fully protected. The move follows similar announcements in France, Germany and Israel.

Roughly 2.7% of US adults are immunocompromised, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including those who are organ transplant recipients, certain cancer patients and those with HIV.

“Today’s action allows doctors to boost immunity in certain immunocompromised individuals who need extra protection from Covid-19. As we’ve previously stated, other individuals who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected and do not need an additional dose of Covid-19 vaccine at this time,” said the acting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, Dr Janet Woodcock.

Despite the Delta variant crisis, the Biden administration has found itself in an escalating war of words with some Republican state leaders, who have sought to ban mask-wearing in the areas most affected by rising cases.

The Florida governor, Ron De Santis, an ardent conservative who has sought to falsely link the rise in Covid cases with immigration at the US southern border, has issued a statewide order banning masks despite the surging cases and has threatened to financially penalise local school leaders if they seek to impose their own mandates.

In turn, the Biden administration has said it is exploring ways to compensate any schools that implement mandates, amid pushback from some of the largest school districts in the state.

On Thursday, Biden addressed the issue head on during his remarks and stated: “To the mayors, school superintendents, educators, local leaders who are standing up to the governors politicizing mask protection for our kids – thank you … Thank God that we have heroes like you, and I stand with you all.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many more people around the world will die of Covid if western political leaders “reject their responsibility to the rest of humanity” by prioritising booster shots for their own populations instead of sharing doses, the head of the Oxford vaccine group has warned.

Writing for the Guardian, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, and Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, say that the scientific and public health case for large-scale boosting has not been made and could have far-reaching consequences in other countries.

“This is a key moment for decision-makers,” they write. “Large-scale boosting in one rich country would send a signal around the world that boosters are needed everywhere. This will suck many vaccine doses out of the system, and many more people will die because they never even had a chance to get a single dose. If millions are boosted in the absence of a strong scientific case, history will remember the moment at which political leaders decided to reject their responsibility to the rest of humanity in the greatest crisis of our lifetimes.”

On Tuesday, Sajid Javid said plans were in place to offer all over-50s a Covid booster at the same time as they receive the flu jab. But Prof Adam Finn, who sits on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the government, said such a mass rollout may not be needed, with it more likely boosters would only be needed to protect a small number of the most vulnerable people.

Germany, France and Israel are all planning, or already administering, boosters for older citizens, although the eligibility details vary by country. This is despite the World Health Organization saying that halting booster shots until at least the end of September would help ease the drastic inequity in vaccine distribution between rich and poor nations. The US also indicated it would not heed the WHO’s call, describing it as a “false choice”.

But Pollard and Berkley write that while vaccines have brought hope and will likely save millions of lives globally, thousands are still dying of Covid every week and many countries are still in despair, with their hospitals overwhelmed.

“The vast majority of people who will die of Covid this year could have been saved if we had got this right,” they say. “Vaccinating those at risk everywhere is in our self-interest. It may reduce the risk of new variants arising and will relieve pressure on health systems, open travel, resuscitate the global economy and raise the international authority of politicians prepared to take such moral leadership.”

They also stress that the level of antibody or T-cells required to prevent people from getting seriously ill cannot yet be measured. While the yellow fever vaccine, which provides lifelong protection with one dose, the flu jab is given annually. Somewhere in-between is the tetanus vaccine, which requires five to six doses for lifelong protection. Pollard and Berkley say it is unclear where the Covid vaccine sits on the spectrum but – so far – it is clear it is offering protection against severe disease, including that caused by the main variants.

“The focus of vaccination policy cannot be on sustaining very high levels of antibodies to prevent mild infection,” they write. If we focus on antibody levels alone, we could end up vaccinating everyone repeatedly to cope with a virus that keeps mutating. The point of vaccination isn’t to prevent people from getting mild infections; it’s to prevent hospitalisation and death.”

They say that it is not an “all or nothing” argument, with careful analysis of the data required to ensure there are no groups for whom boosters are already warranted. But they add that for those who do not respond well to vaccines – a group which some have suggested should get a booster – “more doses won’t help”.

The pair conclude: “Since we have the two-dose luxury of having time on our side, we should not rush into boosting millions of people, while time is running out for those who have nothing. First doses first. It’s that simple.”

A government spokesperson said: “We are preparing for a booster programme and the independent JCVI has published its interim advice on who to prioritise for a third vaccine from September 2021.

“The UK is committed to supporting a global recovery to the Covid-19 pandemic and improving access to vaccines – and we have committed to donate 100m doses by June 2022, with the first deliveries starting last week.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Since early 2020, the tragic reality of the pandemic has unfolded, killing millions, disrupting normal social interactions, destabilising economies and plunging the world into uncertainty. Between 4.3 and 11.6 million people have died. Amid this deepening gloom, vaccines have brought hope. Their development is a triumph of science; the manufacture and deployment of 4.4bn doses by a handful of developers is astonishing, joyous. In the UK alone, 87m doses have been administered, saving more than 84,000 lives. Globally, the number of lives saved by vaccines is expected to be in the millions.

So why is there still so much suffering around the world? Thousands of people are still dying of Covid every week. Hospitals are overwhelmed and many countries are in despair, urgently pleading for vaccines because they have virtually none. We are in this position simply because the doses we have are not being distributed first to those who are at highest risk of getting seriously ill or worse yet, dying. The vast majority of people who will die of Covid this year could have been saved if we had got this right. Vaccinating those at risk everywhere is in our self-interest. It may reduce the risk of new variants arising, and will relieve pressure on health systems, open travel, resuscitate the global economy, and raise the international authority of politicians prepared to take such moral leadership.

Despite the reality that a million more people are expected to die of Covid across the world by December, and many more live in fear with no chance of getting vaccinated, governments in the west are now considering giving a third booster dose of vaccine to those who have already received two. In a time of great global human need, we need to clearly outline a strong scientific case for giving booster shots. And we must get the timing right; if some need a boost, this must not deny a lifesaving vaccine to those who should be at the top of the list.

The scientific and public health case for large-scale boosting is incomplete and not clear. People experience a fall in antibody levels over time after vaccination, and we know from several studies that a booster will reverse this decline. If really high levels of antibodies are better at preventing minor infection, perhaps there is a case for boosters after all. But the focus of vaccination policy cannot be on sustaining very high levels of antibodies to prevent mild infection. If we focus on antibody levels alone, we could end up vaccinating everyone repeatedly to cope with a virus that keeps mutating. The point of vaccination isn’t to prevent people from getting mild infections; it’s to prevent hospitalisation and death.

As we see in the daily case numbers, the virus that causes Covid can still infect vaccinated people. Cyclically infecting immune individuals is fundamental to the biology of human coronaviruses. This is not in itself a cause for alarm. The vaccines are still providing high levels of protection against severe disease. Our immune systems have been trained by vaccines to respond when exposed to the virus, even if antibody levels have fallen. So instead of being concerned about whether people will be infected, we should be concerned about whether that infection could lead to serious disease, hospital admission, or worse.

The information we need – which we don’t yet have – is the level of antibody or T-cells required to prevent people from getting seriously ill. If this could be measured, and we saw protection dropping towards that level, there would be a clear case for administering booster shots. But we can’t measure this yet. And at the same time, high-risk groups around the world are still awaiting their first shots. All we can do is analyse the clinical data to see when or if there is a point where boosting becomes necessary. This is being watched carefully and closely by public health authorities and the World Health Organization. It will become clear one way or the other, and policy will rightly evolve in response.

For now, we are in unknown territory. We might need to give people booster shots to increase and extend immunity, but we might not. There is precedent in both directions. Just one dose of yellow fever vaccine provides lifelong protection. Conversely, we use five to six doses of tetanus vaccine for lifelong protection, and the flu vaccine is given annually. Where will Covid vaccines sit?

It is highly unlikely that vaccine protection against severe disease will suddenly fall off a cliff and the ongoing pandemic will be catastrophically rebooted. Small mutations in the virus will occur to help it survive better in vaccinated populations. But those mutations don’t render our vaccine immunity impotent. We are still protected from severe disease caused by the main variants that have emerged. So far.

This is not an all or nothing argument. We need ongoing careful analysis of the data to ensure there are no groups for whom boosters are already warranted. On the other hand, for those who don’t respond well to vaccines, more doses won’t help, and access to new treatments is urgently needed.

This is a key moment for decision-makers. Large-scale boosting in one rich country would send a signal around the world that boosters are needed everywhere. This will suck many vaccine doses out of the system, and many more people will die because they never even had a chance to get a single dose. If millions are boosted in the absence of a strong scientific case, history will remember the moment at which political leaders decided to reject their responsibility to the rest of humanity in the greatest crisis of our lifetimes.

Since we have the two-dose luxury of having time on our side, we should not rush into boosting millions of people, while time is running out for those who have nothing. First doses first. It’s that simple.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s easy to laugh at the anti-vaccine movement, and this week they made it easier still. Hundreds of protesters tried to storm Television Centre in west London, apparently unaware that they were not at the headquarters of the BBC or its news operation – which they blame for brainwashing the British public – but at a building vacated by the corporation eight years ago and which now consists of luxury flats and daytime TV studios. If only they’d done their own research.

Anti-vax firebreather Piers Corbyn was there, of course, unabashed by the recent undercover sting that showed him happy to take £10,000 in cash from what he thought was an AstraZeneca shareholder, while agreeing that he would exempt their product from his rhetorical fire. (Corbyn has since said that the published video is misleading.) “We’ve got to take over these bastards,” he said during this week’s protest, while inside Loose Women were discussing the menopause.

In Britain, the temptation is to snigger at the anti-vaxxers, but in the US it’s becoming ever clearer that the outright Covid deniers, vaccine opponents and anti-maskers – and the hold they have over the Republican party – are no joke. The Covid culture wars have escalated to such an extent that the Republican governors of two states, Florida and Texas, are now actively barring schools, colleges and local authorities from taking basic, common-sense measures against the disease.

They are no longer allowed to require vaccines, proof of vaccination, a Covid test or masks. Any Florida school administrator who demands the wearing of masks could lose their pay. Texas is dropping the requirement that schools even notify parents when there’s a coronavirus case in class. Naturally, the Covid numbers in both states are through the roof. For all Joe Biden’s early success with vaccination, this level of resistance is posing a grave threat to the US’s ability to manage, let alone defeat, the pandemic.

What explains this level of Covid denialism? In the US, the roots of a “don’t tread on me” libertarianism that regards any instruction from government as a step towards tyranny run deep. In the Trump era, it has become a matter of political identity: a refusal to believe Covid is real or that the measures against it are legitimate are increasingly conditions of membership of the right and of good standing as a true devotee of the former president. They are conditions of membership. Besides, Covid denialism offers the lure of all conspiracy theories: the promise of secret knowledge, the chance to see what the sheeple cannot see.

For everyone else, it’s tempting to take pride in being untainted by such thinking. To dismiss the Covid deniers, whether in Florida or west London, as a group apart, irrational, if not downright stupid – refusing to take the steps that will provably protect them, their families and those around them. And yet, the distance between them and everyone else might not be as great as you think.

On the same day that Piers and the placard wavers were out in force in White City, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its report on the state of our planet. It was its starkest warning yet. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, called it a “code red for humanity”, adding that the “alarm bells are deafening”. The IPCC found that sea level is rising, the polar ice is melting, there are floods, droughts and heatwaves and that human activity is “unequivocally” the cause.

Now, there are some who still deny this plain truth, the same way that some insist coronavirus is a “plandemic” hatched by Bill Gates or caused by 5G phone masts or aliens. Both those groups are guilty of cognitive denial, failing to update their beliefs in the light of the evidence.

But there is another form of denial, what the philosopher Quassim Cassam calls “behavioural or practical denialism”. This is the mindset that accepts the science marshalled by the IPCC – it hears the alarm bell ringing – but still does not change its behaviour. It can operate at the level of governments: note the White House official who on Wednesday urged global oil producers to open up the taps and increase production, so that hard-pressed US motorists can buy gasoline more cheaply. And it lives in individuals, too, in the fatalism that says one person can do nothing to halt a planetary emergency, so you might as well shrug and move on. Which is “to act in the same way as if you were a climate change denier,” says Cassam. “The practical upshot is the same.”

Whether it’s Covid or climate, there is a common defect at work here. It is wilful blindness, a deliberate closing of the eyes to a reality that is too hard to bear – and it afflicts far more than a hardcore of noisy sceptics and protesters. A US poll this week found that a summer of heatwaves, flooding and wildfires – evidence that the planet is both burning and drowning – has barely shifted attitudes to the climate issue. Many, even most, are looking the other way.

Perhaps all this is worth bearing in mind as policymakers grappling with the twin crises try to cajole the wary towards action for both their own and the collective good. In both cases, it pays to peel the committed deniers away from those who are merely hesitant or apathetic, and therefore more persuadable. And, again in both cases, it’s wise to remember that the recalcitrant are driven by an impulse that is all too human: namely, fear.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bloodcurdling shrieks from Downing Street, where Boris Johnson recently beheld a most enraging sight in his magic mirror (bespoke handcrafted rattan, Soane, price on application). Instead of responding to his daily question “Who is the most popular of all?” by reflecting Johnson’s own smirking visage back at him, the looking-glass has been displaying the image of young Rishi Sunak riding his Peloton bike right up in the prime ministerial grill.

Shortly after Johnson appointed Sunak, his relations with the new chancellor were described as “hand in glove”. Unfortunately, Rishi now seems to have tired of the cavity search. The recent leak of his letter challenging Johnson on Covid travel restrictions has enraged the boss whose entire career has been characterised by exactly this type of posturing disloyalty. Amusingly, it seems the prime minister never even saw the supposedly private letter from his chancellor before it was leaked, with Johnson’s defenders saying it should obviously have been put in his red box. Yet even that feels debatable. Hard to say where the best place to put a document you really need the PM to read is. Tinder? Certainly he is said to swipe left on most work-related things placed in front of him.

There is something almost poignant about reports of the meeting in which Johnson ill-advisedly joked about demoting Sunak. “I’ve been thinking about it,” the prime minister is reported to have said. “Maybe it’s time we looked at Rishi as the next secretary of state for health. He could potentially do a very good job there.” Riiiiiight. It’s difficult to imagine the 20 or so other people in the room doing anything other than staring down at their laps in embarrassment, thinking, “Oooooh, big talk.”

For the Conservative party, Boris Johnson without his popularity is a hard sell. Without that … what precisely is this thing for? You sense the pitch meeting would run into problems fairly early on. “OK, Bruce Wayne, but he’s 57, cuts his hair with the bacon scissors and can’t be arsed fighting crime.” “Superman, but he’s weak, can’t fly and tells people he’s going to save them then doesn’t turn up.”

Either way Johnson approaches his August holiday in the position of being wildly less popular than a chancellor who’s on record as describing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker as “a great night out”. That should really put things into perspective. It must be totally staggering to Johnson to see the great British public falling for an apparently genial politician known to them mainly by his first name, whose true motives they will turn out to have completely misunderstood. Still, that’s showbiz.

There comes a point in every former starlet’s life where they get shunted into the role of wicked queen, and unless he plays this perilous autumn with the statesmanlike acumen of Abraham Lincoln, this could be transition time for Johnson. Or to put it another way: the one bridge he really needs to build is back to his party’s heart.

We know he likes classical texts, so let’s assume he’s familiar with the 1995 cinematic epic Showgirls. Readers of this column certainly should be. Undoubtedly, the prime minister should take comfort in the scene in which understudy stripper Elizabeth Berkley pushes leading stripper Gina Gershon down the stairs, causing her to break her hip and exit the stage. Yet despite Gina being an old trouper who spent years thriving on the limelight, it all turns out to be quite a relief for her. As she remarks philosophically: “There’s always someone younger and hungrier coming down the stairs after you.”

Perhaps the same thought could be crossing Boris Johnson’s mind. There may well come a point, sooner rather than later, where he honestly can’t be bothered getting his tits out again every day, and can see the charm of limping off to earn millions on the lucrative boardroom/North American lecture circuit. Alternatively, we could accept the obvious: that what a man of his age would really like is more time at home with the nappies. The point is, Boris Johnson has options.

Then again, options are not his happy place. For Johnson, to govern is to not choose. Making hard choices is such anathema to the prime minister’s brand of leadership that he defers them continually, serially, and – in the case of Covid strategy – fatally. And so it is that Gavin Williamson remains secretary of state for education for a second abysmal summer running, because removing him in the wake of any of his earlier foul-ups might have necessitated a reshuffle. As any number of Westminster experts like to point out archly, that only creates enemies.

To which the only decent reply is: so what? It says everything about Johnson that he would prefer to keep a proven incompetent in such a crucial role and further let down an entire generation of children than demote him and make a personal enemy or enemies.

It also says pretty much all you need to know about Johnson that his supposed big priority – the Cop26 UN climate conference later this year – is seemingly being chucked together at the last minute and without any effective or joined-up strategy, even as the planet burns. Honestly, what are the chances that a man who lacks the leadership qualities to demote even Gavin Williamson is going to struggle with the somewhat tougher decisions required to combat the climate emergency? You cannot move at the moment for ministers briefing that the choices required to achieve net zero are so hard that only Johnson can make them. In which case, the one thing the form book shows us is that they won’t be made until it’s too late. The only scenario in which it is plausible to imagine Johnson making tough choices on climate breakdown in timely fashion is if he, personally, was living on an ice shelf that was literally, right now, dropping into the sea. Do Soane do ice shelves? Asking for future generations.

There will never be any meaningful vision or strategy or “levelling up” achieved with Johnson at the helm, because he can’t make decisions that he senses might make him unpopular even momentarily, to say nothing of being able to make the truly tough ones that involve a real sacrifice of vanity, and a real adherence to painstaking strategy. In the end, everything is subsumed by carelessness and self-interest. That, ultimately, is the reason we can be sure Johnson would never demote Sunak in the reshuffle of inadequates that he is rumoured to be getting around to at some point, maybe, in the nearish future. He simply wouldn’t have the strength of character.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After Joe Root surpassed Graham Gooch’s tally of 8,900 Test runs, Jimmy Anderson has said that he is “absolutely” backing his England captain to make it the top of the list. That feat would require Root to overhaul his predecessor, Alastair Cook, whose total stands some way off at 12,472.

“Every time he goes out there he is just class,” said Anderson, “and today he looked class from ball one.” Root had come to the crease against India at Lord’s with England 23 for two – and with Mohammed Siraj on a hat‑trick, after Dom Sibley and Haseeb Hameed had fallen in consecutive deliveries.

But Root weathered the hat-trick ball and piloted England through choppy waters to leave them 119 for three at the close, chasing India’s first-innings score of 364.

“When you see your captain go out and play like that on a hat-trick ball, it does seem to have a really calming effect on the dressing room,” said Anderson, “so I’m sure there’s much more to come from him.

“Joe’s been amazing through his career and this last 12 months in particular. With everything that we’ve been through with the pandemic and the pressures on this team, to be able to captain the side and perform the way he has been is nothing short of superhuman.”

Anderson, who added his own name to the honours board again with his seventh five-wicket haul at Lord’s, also had words of encouragement for his fellow England bowlers. He said the group were “still trying to feel our way and get some rhythm” after their lack of red‑ball cricket.

The 39-year-old Anderson was an injury worry the day before this Test began, having undergone a scan for stiffness in a quad. But the bowler said the Lord’s ground where he made his Test debut and took his first ever Test five-fer “does seem to bring the best out of me”.

“Certainly the last few times I’ve come here you think: ‘Will this be my last time playing here?’” he said. “So hopefully it’s not my last time here, and hopefully it’s not my last time on the honours board.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As England’s openers walked out to bat at Lord’s on the second afternoon, a ghostly figure took his seat on the balcony to watch them. Half in light, half in shadow, Haseeb Hameed perched in the doorway of the dressing room and patiently waited for a chance that has been almost five years in the making.

Hameed is 24 years old, England’s incumbent No 3 batsman, a player of immense promise and potential, and yet ever since his Test debut in India in late 2016 his career has largely been conceived in terms of loss. In a parallel universe, in the world of romantic imagination, he does not break his thumb and lose his place. He does not return to Lancashire and spend the next two seasons mislaying all concept of his off stump. He does not spoil or ruin or succumb to paralysis and self-doubt. Instead, he nails down one of the toughest jobs in international cricket: opening the batting for England in the post-Alastair Cook era. Of course he errs and struggles, as England err and struggle, but along the way he also repays a little faith. He scores a gutsy, heartwarming century in the 2019 Ashes. He hits an emotional ton at Lord’s against the future world champions. He makes runs on the baked earth of South Africa, the warm soil of the Caribbean, the green pastures of New Zealand. By mid-2021, he’s faced and survived more balls than any opener in the world since his debut.

Instinctively, this feels like a tale of modest triumph. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it isn’t. Either way, it didn’t happen, or at least not to Hameed.

The description you’ve just read is, in fact, the international career of Rory Burns. The 30-year-old Burns is not the shiny new thing any more, and nor is he the winsome comeback kid. Even on his better days, I don’t get the feeling he inspires any great affection amongst English cricket fans. Partly this is because he is associated with so few golden memories: of his eight highest Test scores, two have come in draws and five (!) in defeats.

Partly it’s because he so rarely dominates or takes attacks apart. Partly, you sense, it’s because – unlike Hameed – he looks so skewed and awkward at the crease, like a man being forced to bat in a store cupboard, and so when he gets out on some level you feel like he deserved it. Burns averages just under 33 in Test cricket. Actually, this isn’t bad. It’s slightly higher than the average for all Test openers since his debut. According to the ICC rankings, he is the seventh best opener in the world. He scored 81 two games ago. He scored 132 the game before that.

But this is the England Test team in the time of Covid, where nothing is ever quite fixed or settled or embedded, and so none of that really gets remembered. For all but a handful of his 49 Test innings, Burns has been playing for his survival. Getting to international cricket feels like the pinnacle. In fact, it’s just the start. Once the initial mystique has gone, you’re essentially an open book. By the time a batsman has played 20 Tests – and these days, often much earlier than that – they have already been dissected and anatomised like a laboratory frog. It’s all there: the clips, the pitch maps, the scoring analysis, where you like it, where you don’t. The first time Burns played Australia, he got off the mark with his favourite clip through midwicket. Captains don’t make that mistake any more. Here, the midwicket gap was plugged right from the start.

Nowadays, teams have intricate, bespoke plans for you: probing your weaknesses, or maybe just messing with your head. Here it was two slips, a slightly closer fourth slip and a slightly deeper fifth slip. Later it was with two men out in the deep, in the knowledge that Burns often likes to pull from outside off stump. And unlike in county cricket, the challenge is relentless. When you play Hampshire in May, you know that the reward for seeing off Kyle Abbott and Mohammad Abbas is a bit of Ian Holland medium pace. Here, the reward for seeing off 11 testing overs from Ishant Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah, is 11 more from Mohammeds Shami and Siraj.

Burns hasn’t always thrived in the glare. Like most openers, he’s failed much more than he’s succeeded. But he doesn’t lob the ball straight to midwicket when a trap has been set for that very purpose, as Dom Sibley did in the first over after tea. He can keep out a straight half-volley on middle stump, as Hameed could not. And under the highest pressure, with England more than 300 behind, with the ball hooping around at pace, against a world-class attack and a backdrop of fatalism and dismay, he endured for 136 balls and three precious hours.

And yes, 49 runs is still only 49 runs. But in an England team riven by uncertainty and neglect, where the pool of talented top-order batsmen has dried to a sludge, Burns still feels like part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The clouds had rolled in and the lights were on by the time he finally made his way back to the pavilion, the job frustratingly only half-done. Up on the balcony, now wrapped in a tracksuit, Hameed was still watching.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mikel Arteta smouldered and in front of him, Arsenal wilted. A comprehensive defeat to exuberant newcomers, a clutch of experienced players absent and others simply missing in action: this was the stuff nightmare starts to the season are made of and, in a situation that he is aware demands freshness and optimism, the manager finds himself on the back foot before 18 of his rivals have kicked a ball. Brentford’s night was a triumph for Arteta’s opposite number, Thomas Frank, and the latest occasion that laid the visitors’ long-standing problems starkly bare. Frank had noted before the match that there is “a part in every single game where all players feel a little bit insecure, a little bit under pressure”; he was spot on and it was Arsenal, facing top-flight novices, who buckled under moderate strain.

The mitigating factors are clear, although Arteta knows there is little room for excuses now and was unwilling to gloss over Arsenal’s vices. He entered this assignment without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, both of whom had fallen ill in the build-up. He had known for longer that Thomas Partey, who is likely to be out until next month, would not be around to anchor the midfield.

But it was initially possible to detect a silver lining in the reshuffle that ensued. There is legitimate unease about the lack of an obvious succession plan for Arteta’s two first-choice forwards, who are both struggling for consistency and in the autumn of their careers. The selection of Folarin Balogun and Gabriel Martinelli may have been forced on Arteta but it could have been framed as a welcome opportunity to point a way forwards. In the event neither player made much impression and it would have taken Olympic-level contortions to detect a revolution starting here.

0 'I would have been disappointed not to win': Thomas Frank on Brentford win over Arsenal – video

That was little reflection on the understudies. Balogun’s start was his first in the top flight: the 20-year-old’s reputation had preceded him until now, a protracted contract saga and overtures from clubs around England and Germany the most public clues surrounding his potential. Martinelli is a comparative veteran of 13 Premier League starts, although he is a fortnight younger than Balogun and started to his left. With Albert Sambi Lokonga, signed from Anderlecht this summer, making his own debut in midfield an optimist might have detected a vigour to match that of the hosts. Arsenal’s resources may have resembled an overly familiar comfort blanket during pre-season but circumstances had lent them a welcome airiness.

The theory was appealing but then the cloud descended. Balogun was involved in Arsenal’s two brightest first-half moments, such as they were, but shot over and was foiled by Rico Henry as he attempted to spin in the box. For Martinelli the gruel was similarly thin, although he miscued a near-post header after the interval. Both players had been withdrawn by the time Christian Nørgaard exploited a bouncing ball and atrocious defending to seal the outcome and reduce an improved second-half display to huff and puff.

Who could Balogun, Martinelli or Lokonga look to for leadership when the going got tough? Their burden became infinitely greater when Sergi Canós lashed inside Bernd Leno’s near post midway through the first half; there was a tide to turn and senior players needed to step up. At 26 Nicolas Pépé was the closest approximation to that in Arsenal’s front line but his performance was inconsequential; he was handed a lesson in initiative by the 21-year-old Emile Smith Rowe. Lokonga put in a claim to be their most effective performer over 90 minutes, impressing with his scanning of space and smartly-weighted passes, but would have been excused a sense of exasperation given the lack of protection Granit Xhaka offered the back line before half-time.

The youthful new blend could hardly be held responsible for old habits further back. The night’s biggest concern was the ease with which Brentford, with Canós and Bryan Mbuemo causing particular havoc, exposed familiar defensive uncertainties.

Ben White endured a debut to forget but, in the circumstances, might be bracketed similarly to his fellow newcomers: would he have fared better under the guidance of a more resolute, brave and commanding partner than the woeful Pablo Marí?

The nagging fear for Arteta may be that, although £75m has already been invested this summer, it is hard to see how Arsenal will look significantly better even when Aubameyang, Lacazette and Partey return. The odds favour a deal for Martin Ødegaard before the transfer window is done but changes of the “ruthless” nature he demanded in May look far-fetched unless the revolving door speeds up dramatically. Against a Brentford side whose own rawness had been well trailed, with 19 minutes of Premier League action between them before kick-off, this was an opportunity to calm suggestions that the rebuild Arsenal desperately need looks far off. Instead the question marks loom as large as ever.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@July was the world’s hottest month ever recorded, US government scientists have confirmed, a further indication of the unfolding climate crisis that is now affecting almost every part of the planet.

The global land and ocean surface temperature last month was one degree Celsius, 0.9C (1.6F), hotter than the 20th-century average of 15.8C (60.4F), making it the hottest month since modern record keeping began 142 years ago.

It has beaten the previous record set in July 2016, according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).

“In this case, first place is the worst place to be,” said Rick Spinrad, the administrator of Noaa. “July is typically the world’s warmest month of the year, but July 2021 outdid itself as the hottest July and month ever recorded. This new record adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe.”

Last month’s record heat was driven by soaring temperatures across the world, with Asia experiencing its hottest July on record and Europe, which has been scorched by heatwaves and wildfires in countries including Greece and Italy, recording its second hottest July on record. Europe’s hottest ever recorded temperature was reportedly set in Sicily on Wednesday, where it reached a roasting 48.8C (119.8F).

Australia had its fourth warmest July on record, while North America, which has been confronted with extreme heat, drought and wildfire across much of its western half for much of the year, has its sixth-highest July temperature on record.

The Noaa climate report also found that Arctic sea ice extent was more than 18% below an average set between 1981 to 2010, the fourth smallest extent since satellite records began in 1979.

It is now “very likely” that 2021 will rank among the 10 hottest years ever recorded, Noaa stated.

Confirmation of the record July heat follows the release of a landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on Monday which found that humans’ burning of fossil fuels has “unequivocally” heated up the planet to temperatures not seen on Earth in around 125,000 years.

This behavior is pushing the world towards dangerous climate breakdown that can only be averted by deep and rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

Spinrad said that IPCC report “confirms the impacts are widespread and rapidly intensifying.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Russia is to expel a senior BBC journalist in Moscow by refusing to extend her accreditation in a move the broadcaster has condemned as a “direct assault on media freedom”.

Sarah Rainsford’s visa is due to expire at the end of August and will not be renewed. The state broadcaster Rossiya-24 first reported the decision on Thursday evening, calling it a response to alleged UK refusals or delays in issuing visas to Russian journalists.

“The expulsion of Sarah Rainsford is our symmetrical response,” the reporter said, calling it a “landmark” move.

In a statement, the British embassy in Moscow denied that any Russian journalists had been discriminated against in the UK.

“This is another unjustified step by the Russian authorities. We urge them to reconsider this retrograde step against an award-winning BBC journalist which can only do further damage to media freedom in Russia. We reject the MFA’s claims of discriminatory action against Russian journalists in the UK. Russian journalists continue to work freely in the UK, provided they act within the law and the regulatory framework,” the statement said.

Rainsford is an extremely well-regarded journalist who began reporting from Russia two decades ago.

Late on Friday, she tweeted: “Being expelled from Russia, a country I’ve lived in for almost 1/3 of my life – and reported for years – is devastating. Thank you for all your kind messages of support.”

The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, said the corporation condemned her expulsion “unreservedly”.

“Sarah is an exceptional and fearless journalist,” he said in a statement. “She is a fluent Russian speaker who provides independent and in-depth reporting of Russia and the former Soviet Union. Her journalism informs the BBC’s audiences of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

“We urge the Russian authorities to reconsider their decision. In the meantime, we will continue to report events in the region independently and impartially.”

Rainsford’s expulsion is the first of a British journalist from Russia since 2011, when the Guardian’s Luke Harding was forced to leave Moscow. Russia barred the US journalist David Satter in 2014, and a Polish correspondent for the Gazeta Wyborcza daily was ordered to leave in 2015.

The political expulsion of a BBC correspondent as a “symmetrical response” to alleged pressure on Russian journalists signals a turn toward Chinese-style policies of blocking accreditations for leading US and UK outlets in order to clamp down on foreign reporting.

Foreign-language media have until now generally been able to operate normally in Russia, although BBC journalists have complained of surveillance during reporting trips.

Neither the Russian foreign ministry nor Rossiya-24 have named the Russian journalists allegedly subjected to visa delays or rejections in the UK. The Rossiya-24 journalist who presented the report said that “everyone understands” Rainsford’s expulsion was a response to past threats that Ofcom could strip the Russian state-funded broadcaster RT of its licence and other issues.

A foreign ministry spokesperson indicated in a Telegram post that UK officials had received various warnings about journalists’ visas, and that BBC representatives had recently visited the ministry for consultations.

The Rossiya-24 report also claimed that correspondents from RT and state-owned Sputnik were not being accredited to events and cited reports from 2019 that several employees of the two outlets had been denied visas.

A Russian foreign ministry report published in March 2021 said: “Although there were no cases of open obstruction of the activities of Russian media in the UK in 2020, nevertheless since December 2018 the RT TV channel has been embroiled in litigation with the British media regulator Ofcom, and RIA Novosti, Channel One and Russia-1 reporters cannot use corporate bank accounts in the UK since 2016.”

Russia has already launched a broad campaign targeting independent Russian-language media, labelling the popular Meduza, the Vedomosti spin-off VTimes and the investigative website the Insider, as foreign agents, and shuttering the influential Proekt investigative website as an “undesirable organisation”.

Russian-language websites for RFE/RL and Voice of America, which are both funded by the US Congress, have also been targeted as foreign agents and are estimated to have accumulated millions of pounds in fines. They have moved some staff and equipment out of the country in case they are hit with criminal charges.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The UN has raised the alarm over widespread, systematic sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), saying there have been reports of armed groups carrying out mass rape.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency, said its staff had heard horrific testimonies from forcibly displaced people in south-eastern Tanganyika province.

The agency is “gravely concerned about incidents of widespread and systematic sexual violence against Congolese women and girls”, said its spokesperson, Shabia Mantoo.

“In just the past two weeks, humanitarian partners in the Kongolo and Mbulula health zones have recorded 243 incidents of rape, 48 of which involved minors, in 12 different villages,” Mantoo said.

The true number of incidents is thought to be even higher, as the reporting of gender-based violence remains a taboo in most communities.

“The attacks are reportedly being carried out by rival armed groups competing to maintain control over mining areas – especially goldmines – and as retaliation against government-led military operations,” Mantoo said.

“Civilians find themselves trapped in the middle of intense confrontations between different groups. Our staff have heard horrific testimonies of extreme violence. Forcibly displaced persons have accused armed groups of carrying out mass rape as women attempt to flee their homes.”

She said some women and girls had been abducted and raped, and ransoms had been demanded from families in exchange for their freedom.

According to UN estimates, nearly 310,000 people have been uprooted by insecurity and violence and remain displaced in Tanganyika province.

Mantoo said more than 23,000 people had been displaced since May in the province’s northern Kongolo area alone, according to local authorities, with most having fled insecurity multiple times.

The UNHCR called on DRC authorities to scale up security in the so-called “triangle of death” in the wider region to protect civilians, and to allow humanitarian access and launch investigations to bring perpetrators to justice.

The agency said it had received 36% of the $205m (£148m) needed for its operations in the DRC.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Scientists have said that an astonishingly well-preserved cave lion cub found in Siberia’s permafrost lived 28,000 years ago and may even have traces of its mother’s milk in it.

The female cub, named Sparta, was found at the Semyuelyakh River in Russia’s Yakutia region in 2018 and a second lion cub called Boris was found the year before, according to a study published in the Quaternary journal.

The cubs were found 15 metres apart but are not only from different litters but were also born thousands of years apart. Boris, a male cub, lived about 43,448 years ago, the study said.

The two cubs aged one to two months were found by mammoth tusk collectors. Two other lion cubs named Uyan and Dina have also been found in the region in recent years.

Cave lions have been extinct for thousands of years.

Valery Plotnikov, one of the study’s authors, said in the regional capital Yakutsk that Sparta was so well preserved that it still had its fur, internal organs and skeleton.

“The find itself is unique; there was no any other such find in Yakutia,” he said.

“Maybe, we hope, some disintegrated parts of the mother’s milk [remain intact]. Because if we have that, we can understand what its mother’s diet was,” he said.

Similar finds in Russia’s vast Siberian region have turned up with increasing regularity. Climate change is warming the Arctic at a faster pace than the rest of the world and has thawed the ground in some areas long locked in permafrost.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ex-model Carré Sutton has filed a lawsuit alleging that Gérald Marie, the French former modeling agency boss, repeatedly raped her at his Paris apartment when she was just 17 years old.

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, also maintains that Sutton was “trafficked by Marie to other wealthy men around Europe”.

Sutton is filing her lawsuit under New York state’s Child Victims Act, a law that permits survivors of childhood sexual abuse to sue their attackers, regardless of how long ago they were abused. The deadline for filing claims under this act ends at midnight Friday.

Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s many accusers, filed suit against Prince Andrew in New York on Monday under the same law. Giuffre says Andrew sexually abused her at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion, as well as other locations, in 2001 when she was 17. The prince has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Sutton is one of many women who have accused Marie of sexual assault while he helmed Elite Model Management’s European operations. French authorities are investigating their claims, and have previously invited 11 women to Paris to meet investigators.

Marie’s attorneys have previously responded to allegations against him by saying he was “extremely affected by the accusations made against him, which he contests with the utmost firmness … He intends to actively participate in the manifestation of the truth within the scope of the opened criminal investigation.”

Elite Model Management’s founder, the late John Casablancas, has also been accused of repeatedly engaging in abusive and exploitative sexual conduct, announcing, for example, that he was dating a 16-year-old model.

Sutton, an actor and former model, claims that she fell prey to Marie shortly after she became involved with the now-defunct talent agency. At age 16, she was “discovered by a modeling agent with connections to Elite in New York City” – when she was a living on her own in California’s Bay Area.

“I was from a broken family, and I had turned toward modeling because I was a runaway teen and had dropped out of school,” Sutton said at a press conference on Friday. “Looking back, it is so clear to me that my background was part of what made me vulnerable to abuse and to trafficking.”

After sending photos to Elite, the agency flew her to New York City for modeling. She arrived there in 1986, at age 17, after learning that Casablancas “was interested in her”.

Elite housed Sutton in a “models apartment which was shared with five other young models” and “was given a small stipend which barely covered food”. When Sutton failed to receive any paid photo shoots, Casablancas said “her look was not making the cut” and that he would only give her one additional week “on his dime”.

Trudi Tapscott, then an Elite agent, comforted the distraught Sutton following Casablancas’s warning, “telling her that it was OK if she did not make it because she would be sent from New York to another one of Elite Europe’s agencies like Milan or Paris”. Within days, Tapscott told Sutton that Elite was sending her to Paris.

Right after Sutton’s arrival, she was brought to Marie’s office, where he told her that she would succeed with Elite – but warned that she had to be obedient in order to do so. He allegedly slapped her on the buttocks and said: “On my dime, I don’t want your opinion, Carré. I want your obedience.”

Marie started providing her with cocaine at his apartment – which he shared with his then girlfriend, supermodel Linda Evangelista – telling Sutton that it would let her lose weight and succeed as a model. The sexual assaults started one night after a modeling shoot, Sutton’s suit states.

Sutton became distant from Marie but stayed obedient, as she needed him for her survival in Paris. “Every time Evangelista left the apartment, defendant Marie expected plaintiff to let him rape her which he did repeatedly over the span of months,” her suit charges.

During this period, Sutton says that Marie would traffic her to “wealthy men in Europe for purposes wholly unrelated to modeling”. Once, she was sent to a Milan modeling agency that “used its models for Playboy parties”.

“The shock and dissociation of the attack stayed with me for many, many years. I had to become tough and truly dissociate to survive what happened to me in Paris, from the initial ongoing assaults and then to be looked at as an object in the industry,” Sutton also said at the press conference.

The suit claims that Tapscott and other Elite employees were well aware of Marie and Casablancas’s behavior. At Marie’s Ibiza, Spain home, Tapscott “was heard telling Marie and Casablancas to leave the 13- and 14-year-olds alone”, court papers state.

When asked for comment on the suit Friday morning, Tapscott sent a text stating: “No comment.”

Tapscott previously said: “I was only a little bit older than the models, and also taken in by the glamour. We didn’t have the language then to know that this was wrong, and even if we did, who would we report it to? We were like a family and there was no HR department; this was the culture that protected these men. I have tremendous regret about not doing more at the time.”

There is no indication that Evangelista knew about any of these allegations and has praised the “courage and strength” shown by Marie’s accusers. Evangelista, who married and ultimately divorced Marie, has said: “Based on my own experiences, I believe these women are telling the truth.”

Sutton says that she filed the lawsuit “on behalf of all the other survivors” who cannot pursue claims. She also says she did so “in hopes that other survivors who are within the statute … feel that there is safety in coming forward”.

She is among a group of survivors who have advocated for the Adult Survivors Act which, similar to the Child Victims Act, would extend the statute of limitation for civil complaints for those sexually abused as adults.

While the New York senate approved the Adult Survivors Act this year, the proposal did not proceed in the state assembly.

“As has been made clear to me with the resignation of Andrew Cuomo and his aides, no predator acts alone,” Sutton said, in reference to the departing New York governor, who announced his resignation this week amid allegations of sexual misconduct. “There are enablers and institutions created to insulate them from the consequences of their actions. Three decades later, when I finally feel ready to access the justice system, I am shut out across the globe – except for the state of New York.”

“That’s why the civil look-back windows are so crucial, and in New York, we need the Adult Survivors Act and why the CVA is so crucial. My case has been filed just as the look-back window ends today, along with the case against Prince Andrew.”

Lesa Amoore, a top model in the 90s who said that Marie sexually assaulted and harassed her, commented: “This is a big day and a first step. Standing in solidarity with Carré, I believe all victims of sexual abuse deserve the opportunity to file a case. The fact that many of the same abusers and enablers are still in the fashion industry today that were when I was a model is a major problem”.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The end for Afghan forces in the south-western provincial capital of Zaranj, a trading hub close to the Iranian border, was announced by a Taliban commander. Except that he framed it as a start, and an ominous one.

“This is the beginning,” he declared in a statement. “See how other provinces fall in our hands very soon.”

The capital of Nimroz province, Zaranj was captured on 6 August, the first major city to fall to a Taliban assault in years.

Within the space of seven days of a lightning Taliban offensive, the Zaranj commander’s prediction would be proved correct as city after city fell in a comprehensive rout of government forces.

Zaranj’s fate would set the pattern for the days that have followed. After weeks taking districts in the countryside and cutting off Zaranj, its capture came suddenly, with insurgents overrunning defences in a sustained effort.

Within days, other cities would fall to similar tactics: the key city of Kunduz in the north, with its airbase, on Sunday; a few days later, Pul-e-Khumri and Ghazni, sitting on the strategic approaches to the capital, Kabul.

Then, in the most devastating blow, the second and third largest cities in the country, Kandahar and Herat, would fall to the Taliban on Thursday, as Afghan and US air forces – including American B-52 bombers – failed to slow the Taliban’s advance.

By Friday, maps tracking the Taliban’s offensive showed a stark reckoning for the Afghan government forces and the western countries that have supported them, with more than 65% of the country under Taliban control, more than a dozen provincial capitals fallen, and Kabul isolated.

If Zaranj was the first to fall, it was the capture of Kunduz on Sunday that rang the biggest warning bells – the third of four provincial capitals to topple by that point, and the most significant – prompting a briefing for the US president, Joe Biden, who remained unmoved in his plans to withdraw the last American forces.

“Look, we spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years. We trained and equipped with modern equipment over 300,000 Afghan forces,” Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. “Afghan leaders have to come together. They’ve got to fight for themselves. Fight for their nation.”

The Taliban’s advance has also brought stories of horror, including details of reprisals against former government workers, summary executions, beheadings, and kidnappings of girls for forced marriages.

“We saw bodies lying near the prison. There were dogs next to them,” said Friba, 36, a widow who on Sunday fled the northern city of Kunduz for Kabul with her six children as the Taliban took over.

As the Taliban have pressed their growing advantage in the past week – alarming international allies of the government of Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, as they have scrambled to evacuate their embassies – the insurgents have cut the country into pieces, severing the main roads between cities, overrunning airbases that can supply them, and cutting deals for capitulation.

With each city that fell in the past week, the same complaints were voiced by the despondent, often hungry and defeated former defenders, including how reinforcements promised by Kabul had failed to arrive.

By Thursday it was the turn of the sprawling southern city of Kandahar and the western city of Herat.

In Kandahar, a battle that had begun in earnest in mid-July, when Taliban fighters first infiltrated the city’s seventh police district, began unravelling rapidly on Wednesday as the insurgents overran the city’s central prison, releasing almost 1,000 prisoners.

By Thursday the Taliban had reached the broad, dusty expanse of Martyrs’ Square as the country’s symbolic second city, where the Taliban first emerged in the 1990s and which served as their de facto capital between 1996 and 2001, fell once again to the Islamist fighters.

By Friday morning the capture of the city was confirmed in a terse communique that stated what was already clear. “Following heavy clashes late last night,” said an Afghan government official, “the Taliban took control of Kandahar city.”

While many Afghans have fled in front of the Taliban’s advance, crowding inside Kabul’s gates to sleep in parks and other open spaces, others appear to have welcomed the fighters, with young men approaching their gun-toting Taliban occupiers in Pul-e-Khumri for selfies just hours after security forces were overpowered.

As the fighting swelled the numbers fleeing to Kabul, aid agencies warned of an impending catastrophe.

“We are bracing ourselves for a major humanitarian crisis,” said Tracey Van Heerden, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s acting country director in Afghanistan. “Families are fighting over food. We fear this situation is being replicated across the country at an unprecedented pace.”

By the middle of the week, the shocking speed of the Taliban’s advance was reverberating through the western capitals that have funded, armed and trained the Afghan forces, not least as they saw their own embassies in Kabul suddenly under threat.

How, politicians and analysts have asked, after 20 years and billions of dollars spent on Afghanistan’s security forces, numbering about 300,000 and whose abilities have long been touted by western generals, could they collapse so comprehensively and quickly?

For Ryan Crocker, who was the US ambassador to Afghanistan under Barack Obama, the answer was straightforward. Biden’s plan to continue with the withdrawal of US forces was akin to “giving the country to Taliban fighters”.

Other critical observers, such as the US special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, which has tracked corruption and waste in the US-led effort, have long sounded a warning note over whether the money spent on military training and salaries was well spent, cautioning that the “question … will ultimately be answered by the outcome of the fighting on the ground”.

More critically, it is the combination of the withdrawal of western forces with fatal errors by the Afghan government and its military leaders that has led to disaster.

Most serious among those mistakes, arguably, was the decision by the Afghan military not to contest the countryside as the foreign forces withdrew, but to concentrate instead on defending the cities, allowing the Taliban to isolate and besiege provincial capitals and cut off lines of communication, ultimately squeezing Kabul.

Another factor has been the Taliban’s relative willingness to fight compared with the Afghan government and forces. While far smaller, numbering a core of perhaps 60,000 fighters, and more lightly armed, the Taliban draw their fighters from a group invested in its religious outlook and cultural affinity. Afghan security forces are more disparate and have long had weaker motivating factors – not least the prospect of a salary.

Unless something dramatically changes, and I don’t see how that’s possible, these provinces [that have fallen] will remain under Taliban control Bill Roggio

The last week has seen a number of key defections, retreats and rapid surrenders as leaders – both local politicians and military – have negotiated with the besieging Taliban.

At the end of the week, that process continued with Mohammad Omer Sherzad, the provincial governor of the southern Uruzgan province, saying he had been approached by tribal elders seeking a negotiated pullout.

Despite the inevitable expressions of dismay in western capitals at the speed of the catastrophe, this was in many respects a defeat that has been a long time coming.

Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who has chronicled the war, echoed that assessment. He said the Afghan army had been plagued by corruption and mismanagement, leaving troops in the field poorly equipped and with little motivation to fight.

“Whatever forces are left or remaining that are in the Kabul area and the provinces around them, they’re going to be used for the defence of Kabul,” Roggio said. “Unless something dramatically changes, and I don’t see how that’s possible, these provinces [that have fallen] will remain under Taliban control.”

The recriminations were beginning to reverberate through western capitals even as they deployed military reinforcements to evacuate diplomats and foreign staff.

For Afghans in cities that are not yet under Taliban control, the immediate concern is that those western reinforcements that are being sent are coming to rescue foreigners, not the Afghans who have most to fear from the Taliban’s return.

Among them was Zahra Omari, who had fled to Kabul from Kunduz province with her six children. “When people started fleeing, I took my children and fled. I didn’t even take milk for my 10-month-old daughter,” she said. “We found a bus going to Kabul that had removed the seats to cram as many people as possible inside. It was full of frightened men, women and children.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When people from the Mexican state of Tlaxcala travel to other parts of the country, they are sometimes insulted as traitors by their compatriots.

Tlaxcala is Mexico’s smallest state in size, but it played an outsized role in Mexico’s early history, not least when indigenous Tlaxcalans allied with Hernán Cortés’ tiny band of invaders to bring down the Aztec empire.

Now, as Mexico marks the 500th anniversary of the fall of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán on Friday, the role of the Tlaxcalans in the conquest is being reconsidered.

Many historians argue that without the participation of the Tlaxcalans and other indigenous soldiers, Tenochtitlán might never have fallen to the Spanish.

They are also revising the accusation of treachery, arguing that Tlaxcalans and other city states were in fact fighting a war of liberation against the oppressive Mexica (as the Aztecs were known).

“It wasn’t 600 to 800 Spaniards who conquered [Tenochtitlán]. It was thousands and thousands of Tlaxcalans, Huejotzingas or other peoples, who were under the Mexica yoke and wanted to liberate themselves,” archaeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma told Radio Formula.

“Cortés had 30,000 to 40,000 Mesoamericans fighting with him,” said Aurelio López Corral, an archaeologist in Tlaxcala. “He couldn’t have done it on his own.”

The conquest is a singular event in Mexican history, seen both as a moment of national trauma and the founding act of the nation – and it remains deeply controversial.

Events to mark the anniversary have been met with tepid enthusiasm, as Mexico struggles with the coronavirus pandemic. A towering replica of the Templo Mayor – the Aztec civilization’s most sacred site – is being erected in Mexico City’s central Zócalo plaza.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has called on the Spanish Crown and the Vatican to apologize for their roles in the “so-called conquest”. Spain declined; Pope Francis apologized while visiting Bolivia in 2015.

Cortés himself is still a deeply polarizing figure in Mexican history, a rapacious villain who is also the nation’s founding father: his indigenous translator known as La Malinche gave birth to the first Mexican.

In Tlaxcala, however, his role in the fall of the Aztec empire tends to be underplayed, said Yassir Zárate Méndez, who produced a documentary which challenged the official history’s treatment of Tlaxcala.

“He is not seen exactly as a villain, unlike in other places, but as someone who played a complicated role in history,” he said. “Cortés goes somewhat unnoticed and remains below the level of local figures.”

Those include Xicohténcatl the Younger, a Tlaxcalan prince who vehemently opposed aligning with the Spanish, and remains fondly remembered in the state.

At the time of the conquest, Tlaxcalans shared a cosmovision with the Mexica and spoke the same language – Nahuátl.

But, unlike the imperial Aztecs, Tlaxcala had a more collective form of leadership, and when Cortés arrived, some in the leadership saw an opportunity to topple an old enemy, said Zárate.

The region provided soldiers for invading the island city of Tenochtitlán and allowed him to regroup after he was forced to flee an Aztec counteroffensive. Cortés reputedly built the boats used for eventually invading the Aztec capital in Tlaxcala.

“It was a question of political survival,” Zárate said. “To save yourself, you had to turn to whatever allies were necessary.”

After the fall of Tenochtitlán, the Tlaxcalans benefited handsomely from their arrangement – and Spaniards married into the local nobility. Tlaxcala received special status in the Spanish colonial period with a form of self-rule. Its residents received the right to settle other parts of the colony.

But when Mexico won independence in the 1820s, that power was lost, and an evolving national mythology focused on the fall of the Mexica, casting Tlaxcalans as traitors.

The National Institute of History and Anthropology (INAH) hosted forums in Tlaxcala in 2019 – 500 years after Cortés arrived in the state – exploring the local role in the conquest. It drew enormous interest, according to organizers.

“There’s a nagging thorn in most Tlaxcalans’ minds [about the conquest] and a sort of anger because the adjective ‘traitor’ has been so strong,” Juan de la Rosa, INAH delegate in Tlaxcala, said in a 2019 interview. “But they have the need to have arguments that explains why they’re not traitors.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I don’t have any symptoms, so even if I have Covid I won’t give it to anyone else

Wrong. People who never get symptoms from Covid are less infectious than people who get symptoms, but they can still have high viral loads and can pass on the virus. And the peak infectiousness in those who do develop symptoms is actually the day or two before they start feeling ill.

Because people who feel fine are far more likely to be out and about than those who are feeling ill, people who have Covid either without symptoms or before they get symptoms contribute a lot to spread. One study estimated people without symptoms are responsible for more than half of new infections.

Do not assume that as long as you feel fine you don’t pose a risk to others. You do!

I won’t pick up or transmit the virus because I’m fully vaccinated

This isn’t true. There have been plenty of documented cases of fully vaccinated people getting Covid, and while the vast majority haven’t needed hospital, many – such as Andrew Marr, for instance – have still felt really rough for a few weeks. We also have proof that vaccinated people can transmit the virus to each other from studies of healthcare workers in India and Vietnam.

The vaccines are incredibly good at protecting you from getting severely ill but less good at preventing you from getting infected. Data from the Imperial REACT study in England suggests that vaccines are somewhere between 50% and 60% effective at preventing infection (regardless of whether you get symptoms).

In the early stages of infection, recent data suggests, vaccinated people have as high viral loads as unvaccinated infected people, but vaccinated people then clear the virus faster.

Vaccination helps prevent both infection and transmission, but it isn’t perfect and you certainly can’t assume that you can’t get sick or that you can’t infect others.

I’ve had Covid already, so I don’t need the vaccine

Having had Covid does give you reasonable protection from being infected again, but it’s not as good as the protection you get from being vaccinated. Immunity from vaccination lasts longer and is more robust to new variants. If you’ve already had Covid then vaccination gives your existing immunity an extra strong boost.

The best immunity we see now is in people who are fully vaccinated after having had Covid. If you’ve recently had Covid, however, you need to wait 28 days after testing positive before getting vaccinated.

I have a good immune system so I don’t need the vaccine

For sure having a good immune system is better than having a bad one, but previously healthy people can still get very sick with Covid, including ending up in hospital and dying. We also know that somewhere between 10% and 30% of adults can end up with long Covid, even with mild initial illness.

And it’s not just about you. You might well get Covid and get over it with no problem, or even have no symptoms at all, but who have you infected? We can all come into contact with vulnerable people in the supermarket, on public transport, visiting family or at the pub. We owe it to them to try to avoid getting infected ourselves.

Children are fine if they get Covid

Children are at much lower risk of getting severely ill or getting long Covid than adults, but can still do so. In England, about one in 200 children with a confirmed case of Covid are hospitalised. Children can also develop what is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after catching Covid, which can be very serious and require intensive care. This is very rare, affecting about 30 children per 100,000 children who get Covid.

Exactly how many children go on to develop long Covid with persistent symptoms is still being investigated, with different studies giving estimates ranging from 2% to 8%. These are lower rates than adults, but they also aren’t zero, and with ongoing high infections in children for the foreseeable future (especially as they remain unvaccinated and return to school), even 2% of a large number is quite high.

Since 19 April there have been more than 420,000 cases in 0- to 19-year-olds in the UK and more than 2,000 hospital admissions in children aged 0-17 with Covid.

Masks don’t work

We now know that Covid is mostly airborne and spread by people breathing, talking, shouting and singing. Masks are by no means perfect, but they do stop lots of your breath hitting someone else’s face when you are interacting with them.

We wear masks primarily to protect others from our breath rather than to protect ourselves from others. If you want to protect both others and yourself, you need a buy a higher-quality mask that fits really well. The best masks are N95, FFP2 or FFP3 ones, which have been shown to be more protective.

A recent study has shown that a high proportion of people wearing masks is associated with a reduction of about 20% in overall population transmission rates, a significant amount.

This wave will be the last …

In the UK there have been headlines calling each of the previous waves the last, and they have been wrong. The government says things are unpredictable and many experts expect infections to rise again as we go into autumn and winter.

Because infections are unlikely to fall to a low level before the next surge, you could argue that it’s all part of the same wave, but the likelihood is that we are in a world of high cases for several months yet. Quite how high, how long and how bumpy the ride will be remains to be seen.

Finally, if a new variant comes along that is more transmissible than Delta or better at infecting vaccinated people, that will change the game once again, just as Delta did in May and Alpha did last December. In this scenario, we would certainly have another, even more severe wave.

We don’t know how likely this, but as long as Covid remains prevalent globally, it will be a possibility for months and potentially years into the future. This is why we can’t definitely say this is the last wave and why it’s so important to help all the world get vaccinated.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Iran says it will impose a six-day-long “general lockdown” in cities across the country after being hit by what it describes as its fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, state media has reported.

The lockdown includes all bazaars, markets and public offices, as well as movie theatres, gyms and restaurants in all Iranian cities. It will begin on Monday and will last through to Saturday.

The national coronavirus taskforce, which issued the decision, also ordered a travel ban between all Iranian cities from Sunday to Friday.

Iran on Saturday reported 466 deaths and 29,700 new cases of Covid-19. That brought the total pandemic death toll to 97,208, and total confirmed cases to 4,389,085. Last week, Iran hit a record in both its single-day death toll and confirmed new cases of Covid-19, with 42,541 new cases and a daily death toll of 588.

Iran is struggling to vaccinate its people against the pandemic. Like much of the world, it remains far behind countries such as the US and UK in vaccinations, with only 3.8 million of its more than 80 million people having been fully vaccinated.

Many frontline medical workers have been vaccinated with Iran’s locally produced shots, or the Chinese state-backed Sinopharm vaccine that may be less effective than other inoculations.

Iran’s government announced that its vaccine provided 85% protection from the coronavirus, without disclosing data or details. Iran also imports Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, as well as the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot through the United Nations-backed Covax programme.

So far, authorities have avoided imposing heavy handed rules on a population badly equipped to bear them. Iran, which has had the worst virus outbreak in the region, is reeling from a series of crises: tough US sanctions, global isolation, a heat wave, the worst blackouts in recent memory and ongoing protests over water and electricity shortages.

Iran’ssupreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in January slammed shut any possibility of vaccines made in the US or UK entering the country, calling them “forbidden”.

For now, the majority of Iranians receiving vaccines rely on foreign-made shots. A health ministry spokesperson said Iran could import western vaccines “as long as they’re not produced in the US or Britain”.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Universities are setting up their own vaccination centres in an attempt to make campuses as safe as possible for the autumn term. And with millions of students arriving in September, some universities are already warning freshers that due to government restrictions on nightclubs in England they will not be able to attend big social events unless they are fully vaccinated.

The University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol and Kingston University in south London have already opened campus vaccination centres, and the University of Stirling in Scotland, where those visiting nightclubs must abide by contact-tracing rules, will open a centre to students and the public on Saturday. Other universities, including Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham and Portsmouth have confirmed they are in discussions about setting up vaccination services. These centres will be run and staffed by the NHS, but universities are offering to train up students or university staff to volunteer in them.

Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ umbrella group, said by the autumn term many universities would have vaccine facilities on campus, including pop-up clinics and NHS vaccine buses. A spokesperson said universities were working with local NHS to try to encourage uptake.

Ministers considered making it compulsory for students in England to be fully vaccinated to attend lectures or live in halls of residence, but Boris Johnson later ruled that out. The U-turn was greeted with relief by vice-chancellors, who think coercing young adults to have vaccinations would be the wrong approach.

Prof Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said: “You can’t force anyone to be vaccinated. That is absolutely clear. We wouldn’t be able to enforce a coercive approach in universities. Instead it has to be about persuasion, and anything we can do to remove barriers to getting vaccinated we should do.” Wales recently moved to alert level 0, removing almost all Covid restrictions.

Riordan’s university administrators are in talks with the NHS about setting up a Covid vaccination centre. He said there was a good walk-in centre in the city, but it is an hour’s walk or a bus journey from the university campuses. It was imperative that vaccination was “easy and convenient” for students, he added.

Cardiff is hoping to be able to direct unvaccinated students and those who have only had a single dose to a university centre as part of enrolment when students arrive in September, but nothing has been confirmed.

Riordan said: “I believe that all UK governments are encouraging about the idea of on-campus vaccination, but the issue is the logistics of how to do it.”

Typically universities say they are able to train up extra staff if workforce is a problem, but data issues and monitoring who has had what vaccinations are likely to be big concerns for NHS providers.

Riordan added: “I think that one concern is that if international students arrive who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is uncertain, and there are a lot of new pop-up vaccination centres at universities, it is important to be able to keep track of what is going on.”

Adults over the age of 18 have been eligible for vaccination against Covid-19 in England since 18 June, but Public Health England said at the end of July that uptake in younger groups was slowing. According to the latest weekly update on Thursday, vaccine uptake for young people aged 18 to under 25 was at 62%, up one percentage point on the previous week.

Prof Susan Michie, the director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London and a member of the government’s Covid behavioural science team, said universities needed to stress to new students that vaccination was not just about protecting yourself. “It is about protecting others who may be more vulnerable, and that includes the workforce and their families as well as other students. In my university the man who ran our departmental canteen for many years died of Covid.”

She said that as well as making it easy for students to access vaccination, universities must offer different ways for students to talk to someone about any worries they have about it.

Dr Dominique Thompson, who was a GP at the University of Bristol for 20 years and has just spent six months administering Covid jabs, said having vaccination centres on campus would make sense as students generally trust their university. “As a generation these young people are most influenced by their peers. You want them seeing other students queueing so they join the queue and support each other,” she said.

Prof Steve West, the vice-chancellor of UWE and president of Universities UK, said: “At the age of 18 most of your life isn’t planned. It’s so much easier if you can just turn up and have the vaccination on campus.”

UWE had a head start because it was the only university to have a Nightingale hospital on campus, and has used the building and its existing relationships with local NHS partners to set up a vaccination centre. The venue, which opened in July, is providing 2,000 vaccinations a day. The university will tell freshers before they get to Bristol that they can have a jab on campus and will remind them when they arrive.

We’ll be telling students getting vaccinated gives them more freedoms Prof Steve West, UWE

West said it had been a “big enterprise” getting the centre up and running. He said negotiating the bureaucracy was slow, because it was a clinical service with lots of health and safety requirements so universities cannot “go it alone”.

“We’ll be telling students getting vaccinated gives them more freedoms, and that we all need to do it because it is the best way of reducing variants,” he said.

Like most universities, UWE is looking at how the ban on entering nightclubs in England for those not fully vaccinated, due to come into force at the end of September, will work on its campus.

“If you are attending a freshers’ event that is ticketed or for more than 50 people you will need proof of double vaccination,” West said. “It doesn’t bar them from getting access to education or halls or events below 50 in number, but it does mean that if they want to go partying they need to get double jabbed.”

At the University of Reading, the student union ran a big social media campaign in July reminding new students that they needed to hurry and have their first jab so they did not miss out on the fun in freshers’ week.

Ben Knowles, the president of its student union, said: “People are busy and moving around in the summer and we wanted to make sure we gave them more than enough clearance time to sort it out.” The union will be asking for proof that students are fully jabbed in order to attend its freshers’ week social events. He added: “The tough element is if people have chosen not to get vaccinated, they do need to take responsibility for that and accept that it will have consequences.”

Students at the University of Sussex who can prove they have been immunised are being entered into a prize draw to win £5,000. Other universities are considering similar incentives.

Eileen Schofield, the University of Stirling’s secretary, said freshers would be able to use its new centre, which has the capacity to vaccinate 600 people a day, even if they have not registered with a local GP. “Vaccination is key for the protection of our students, staff and our wider community,” she said. “We want to make it as easy as possible for people to access Covid-19 vaccinations.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dr Ana Caskin treats underserved populations in Washington DC, in parts of the city where life expectancy is 20 years lower than it is in places that are a 20-minute train ride away. The last thing she wants when the Covid-19 pandemic finally recedes is for things to go back to “normal”.

Because for the people she treats that would mean limited access to doctors and therapists, healthy food and affordable, safe housing – the type of things that are now proven to help protect people from Covid-19.

The virus has killed more than 619,000 people in the US and left millions more to deal with economic turmoil.

Despite the recent surges of the Delta variation in parts of the US, vaccinations are helping many Americans return to a life largely similar to pre-pandemic times as most of the economy has reopened, but Caskin has a warning about that. “It would be easy for more affluent parts of the population to say we’re back to normal now,” she said. “OK, let’s move forward, just be mindful the gap has been widened.”

There was widespread relief recently when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended its moratorium on most evictions for people behind on rent, but perhaps few will have stopped to reflect on why it was the nation’s public health agency that was responsible for a homelessness-prevention order.

Another economic intervention, expanded unemployment benefits, has also been recognised for protecting health during one of the worst disease outbreaks in a century.

Caskin, deputy medical director of the Georgetown University Health Justice Alliance Law Clinic, said when she was first trained in medicine, doctors didn’t always think about what happens when a patient leaves the office, or what their lives were like before they arrived.

Now, at the clinic, they talk about what to do if a patient’s gas and electricity have been cut off or they can’t pay for food. This is a rare approach for health clinics, but Caskin thinks it should be more common for healthcare providers to include social determinants and legal partnerships in their work. “It turns out, the more you know about your patient, it helps you get the correct diagnosis and right treatment,” she said.

It would be easy for more affluent parts of the population to say we’re back to normal now Dr Ana Caskin

Social determinants such as education, access to healthcare and the environment where people live are such important factors that the alliance bakes them into its care.

Yael Cannon, the director of the alliance, warned that without interventions like the expanded unemployment benefits, the toll on millions of people in the US could have been even more catastrophic. “If those things had not been in place we would have seen even worse disparities and outcomes,” she said.

And now, they are due to expire. The expanded unemployment benefits end in early September, one month before the federal eviction moratorium is set to expire again. Some states chose to cut the benefits earlier this summer because they put pressure on business owners to raise wages.

This benefit – which was expanded to $600 a week for several months in 2020 and has since gone down to $300 – was associated with a 35% relative decline in food insecurity and a 48% relative decline in eating less due to financial constraints, according to a study by Boston University.

In Washington DC, where there were strong eviction protections in place in addition to the federal moratorium, there was a 19.9% drop in homelessness in 2021. And several studies showed that when eviction moratoriums were temporarily lifted last year, Covid-19 infections increased.

“The pandemic really did bring to light that there are differences for families in terms of their vulnerability,” Caskin said.

Blame systems, not individuals

When health officials in Michigan saw that Covid-19 cases were much higher among African Americans compared with their representation in the population, they were able to close the gap by investigating where people were getting exposed and why they weren’t sheltering in place.

Dr Debra Furr-Holden, who is part of a government taskforce to address Covid-19 health disparities, said they found this disparity was clearly about work: the people getting infected were grocery store workers, hospital staff and Uber drivers who didn’t have the option to work remotely on Zoom.

The findings were different from the common narrative at the time – that racial disparities in cases were tied to higher rates of pre-existing conditions in certain populations. While that could explain why hospitalisations and deaths were higher, it did not explain why infections were higher.

“We just are more comfortable putting the blame and burden on individuals than looking at our own systems, structures and cultural context which from their origin were inequitable,” said Furr-Holden, an epidemiologist and public health integration associate dean at Michigan State University.

Furr-Holden said state and federal interventions helped close the gap, including expanded access to healthcare, more accessible testing and a federal paid sick leave requirement.

By September 2020, Michigan could officially declare that African Americans were no longer overrepresented in cases and that has stayed true to today, when they are underrepresented in both cases and deaths. Furr-Holden has had to explain to people that this isn’t because more white people are now dying. “Nobody had to get sicker. A group did get substantially better but it’s because that group was doing substantially worse and was at much higher risk for exposure,” she said.

To get there, Michigan also had to prioritize collecting race and ethnicity data in Covid-19 cases, something that may seem obvious, but remains a major problem today. The CDC doesn’t have race and ethnicity data for about 39% of Covid-19 infections because several states are choosing to ignore a federal requirement to collect this information.

“Michigan is the only state that I know of that transparently reported the racial disparities in Covid early on and also closed the gap,” Furr-Holden said.

Normal is not normal for everyone

Tia Marie Sanders has been an activist since she was a child fighting segregation at her middle school. Her community work continued even after a two-month hospitalisation for Covid-19 last March and ongoing treatment, including chemotherapy, for long Covid. In April, she gave moving testimony in Michigan’s house of representatives about how unemployment benefits helped workers.

Sanders is part of the Mothering Justice activist network in Michigan, whose members are known as Mamavists. Well before the pandemic, the group campaigned for reforms including affordable childcare and paid leave. As people talk about returning to pre-pandemic life, Sanders said it was worth asking who benefits most from the return to “normal”.

“Normal has never been normal for everyone,” Sanders, 47, said, adding that inequities would persist unless white supremacy was dismantled. During the pandemic, she challenged government unemployment training programs that treated groups of mostly Black jobseekers differently from white ones and fought for doctors to recognise her Covid-19 infection.

America’s lack of equitable policies to support its citizens during this pandemic is unacceptable Marna Muhammad

In early 2020, doctors dismissed her symptoms until she was too sick to turn away. Once she was admitted to the hospital, they told her she probably had an autoimmune disease because they are common in African American women. Doctors finally acknowledged she had Covid-19 in June 2020.

Another Mothering Justice activist, Marna Muhammad, has also confronted racism while seeking treatment for long Covid, with doctors disregarding her pain and ignoring requests for drugs stronger than over-the-counter ibuprofen.

Muhammad, who lives just outside Detroit, probably caught Covid-19 from a colleague in March 2020, just before her office switched to remote work. Her infection was so severe she could barely get out of bed for two months and would lie down in the dark because the light made her excruciating headaches even worse. But she worked through the pain.

“Our biggest thing was, if I don’t keep working, and they let me go, then everything falls apart,” Muhammad, 53, said. “So then my health is bad and we lose the house and we lose the car.”

This battle continues today. Muhammad has 10 vacation days a year and no sick days as a salaried employee, far less than what she needs to be able to treat her long Covid symptoms, including uncontrollable blood pressure. The frequent appointments and emergency room visits produce a constant stream of medical bills, forcing her to choose which life essentials or medicines to buy.

“For years, I’ve worked my way all the way up into management while struggling to get there,” Muhammad said. “To fall off of that ladder during the pandemic because I got sick is disappointing. America’s lack of equitable policies to support its citizens during this pandemic is unacceptable. I believe we all would appreciate better support from our leaders.”

Getting the vaccine to people who want it, but can’t get it

In rural Georgia and South Carolina, a network of food banks has found one way to respond to low vaccination rates in rural areas.

The Golden Harvest Food Bank partnered with a local health system to have medical workers and vaccines available at mobile food pantries, a surprise to some of the people who attend.

Golden Harvest’s executive director, Amy Breitmann, said an elderly woman waiting with her husband in their car for food in McCormick, South Carolina, said she had been vaccinated but her husband had not because of mobility problems. When Breitmann explained he could get the shot then and there, he told her it was an answer to a prayer.

“I heard story after story from people that were impacted not just by the food we put in their trunks but also by the vaccine,” Breitmann said.

Breitmann knew immediately that the families the food bank helps would struggle to get vaccines because of barriers including lack of access to a doctor or even to the internet to book appointments, and limited ability to travel because of caregiving and work comitments. .

Access problems are also a barrier in the crowded streets of New York City, where community health centers are seeing a different set of concerns stop people from getting vaccinated.

Free vaccines are available at government-run vaccination sites and pharmacies, but the population of mostly immigrants who trust the African Services Committee for healthcare have been waiting months for the community center to administer vaccines.

Until we get the vaccines into community-based organizations and provide opportunities ... then we won’t see any further movement Amanda Lugg

Amanda Lugg, ASC’s director of advocacy and LGBTQ programming, said the group was granted a licence to administer vaccinations in February but was still waiting for them in early August. Theorganization is seeking outside funding to pay for people to administer the vaccines.

“There are grants left right and center for outreach and Covid education, but until we get the vaccines into community-based organizations and provide opportunities for those organizations to serve their communities, then we won’t see any further movement in vaccination uptake,” Lugg said.

To assume immigrants would be comfortable getting vaccinated at a clinic or agency run by the government or a corporation ignores the country’s systemic targeting of immigrants.

Under Donald Trump’s administration, there was a years-long campaign to penalize immigrants for using public benefits under the “public charge” rule, which threatened to bar people from getting green cards if they or a family member used programs like food stamps. Though it was rescinded, throughout the pandemic, groups that advocate for immigrants warned it was having a damaging effect, and reports show immigrants avoided seeking government assistance because of immigration-related concerns.

“All of this, New York strong, we’re all in this together, but when the pedal hits the metal, we’re not,” Lugg said.

Repeating history

From the earliest days of epidemiological research there have been strong associations between race, ethnicity, poverty and disease.

When the Black Death traveled across Europe in the 1300s, the people at greatest risk were the already marginalized. Once sanitation was identified as critical to curbing infectious disease in the mid-1800s, it was urban working-class areas in New York and London where illnesses like smallpox, cholera and tuberculosis became rampant.

In 2020, this pattern remained even with the enormous advancements in modern medicine, technology and knowledge.

The dozen people the Guardian spoke to for this story are just a sliver of those who have ideas for how to make the world safer and healthier for those most vulnerable to the health and economic inequities Covid-19 brought to the surface. They’ve had these ideas for years.

But it would require a structural change to how healthcare works in the US and a response, not just acknowledgment, to the notion that income, race and ethnicity and education have a substantial effect on one’s health.

Dr Furr-Holden, of Michigan, said: “We’ve learned a lot in this pandemic. The question is: are we now going to reorganise our systems of care to ensure those most at risk are fairly and equally protected?”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The crowd gathered under a tent at the water’s edge, their tables decorated with the Stars and Stripes and checked tablecloths. In their midst in Austin county, Texas, last Saturday was the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, laughing with delight and playing the fiddle.

With the coronavirus roaring through the state and hospitals near breaking point, comparisons with Nero fiddling while Rome burned were irresistible, although journalist Alisha Grauso pointed out on Twitter: “Nero actually enacted sweeping relief efforts to try to quell the fire and also offer his people aid in the aftermath, particularly the lower class, so Abbott is somehow worse than a Roman emperor known today as being a psychotic tyrant.”

But Abbott, who has banned mask requirements, is far from an outlier in a Republican party which, having long sought to downplay the climate crisis, is now offering a confusing, incoherent and anti-scientific response to the biggest public health crisis for a century.

Some Republican leaders are seeking to support Joe Biden’s efforts to beat the pandemic by encouraging the public to get vaccinated as soon as possible. But others are actively trying to undermine the president’s offensive by embracing what critics regard as lethal mix of ignorance, irrationality and nihilism.

These Republicans seem intent on scoring political points by appealing to a pandemic-weary’s public yearning to get back to something like normal life. Still in thrall to former president Donald Trump, they fiercely oppose mask or vaccine mandates by invoking traditional party tenets of individual freedom, personal responsibility and resisting state interference.

But with America now averaging about 113,000 cases a day, an increase of nearly 24% from the previous week, and hospitalizations up 31% from the week before, Republicans stand accused of causing the deaths of their own voters as the highly contagious Delta variant scythes through red states where vaccination rates are low.

Elaine Kamarck, a Democrat who served in the Bill Clinton administration, said bluntly: “They’ve gone out of their minds. There’s just no other way to describe this. This is about the dumbest thing you could imagine because the only people listening to them are their voters. So this is the first time I’ve ever seen a political party advocating things that would harm their voters, maybe even kill their voters.”

For six months the vaccine program was an example of American ingenuity, energy and can-do spirit, but more recently it has become yet another case study in the self-inflicted wounds of polarization, reviving a sense of anxiety, uncertainty and pessimism. In the past week Florida and Texas, states whose leaders take pride in riling the Biden administration, have accounted for nearly 40% of new hospitalizations across the country.

Abbott banned mask mandates yet pledged to bring in extra healthcare workers from out of state and ask hospitals to postpone elective surgeries. The Austin and Dallas independent school districts have said they will defy Abbott’s ban and require masks.

Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has also outlawed mask requirements in the state and threatened to withhold the salaries of superintendents and county school board members who issue them for students. As infections soar among children, some of the state’s biggest school districts vowed to flout the governor’s order.

Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, welcomed hundreds of thousands of people to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally where no masks or vaccines are required, while Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina, declared: “Mandating masks is not the answer. Personal responsibility is the answer, common sense is the answer. And we have an abundance of both in South Carolina.”

At the White House on Thursday, Biden expressed frustration with governors prolonging the pandemic. “I know there are lot of people out there trying to turn a public safety measure – that is, children wearing masks in school so they can be safe – into a political dispute,” he said. “And this isn’t about politics. This is about keeping our children safe.”

Critics say the governors have abandoned the conservative principle that decisions should be made at a local level but they have support from prominent Republican senators such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

Paul, a licensed physician and senator for Kentucky, urged civil disobedience against coronavirus restrictions, saying in a video: “It’s time for us to resist. They can’t arrest all of us.” He has been banned from YouTube for a week over a post that questioned the efficacy of masks.

Biden’s effort is also being undercut by prominent conservative media figures including the Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, who have challenged the safety and questioned the effectiveness of the vaccine, as well as online conspiracy theories that falsely suggest that it harms fertility, contains microchips or even creates vampires.

Democrats are dismayed by such willingness to turn even a matter of life and death into a partisan issue. They note that a minority of the population is hampering the entire nation’s recovery and needlessly endangering more lives, including children.

Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist, said: “They share a profound irresponsibility. What they’re doing will sicken people and some people will die. In my view DeSantis and Abbott are both doing it for political purposes to satisfy the base. DeSantis, at least, is too smart to not know what he’s doing or not know what he should be doing but that’s what we’ve come to in this country.”

The resurgent pandemic has also exposed fault lines in the Trump-era Republican party, a contradiction embodied by the former president himself. He continues to trumpet his success in developing the vaccines, and quietly received one in January, yet often seems reluctant to encourage his supporters to follow suit.

Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader frequently at odds with Trump, has paid for ads in Kentucky urging his constituents to get vaccinated, citing his own childhood struggle with polio and the decades it took to develop a polio vaccine.

Kay Ivey, the governor of Alabama, has spoken out about her frustrations with the unvaccinated. “Folks supposed to have common sense, but it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks,” she said last month. “It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.”

Asa Hutchinson, the governor of Arkansas, has admitted that he regretted signing a ban on mask mandates in schools and asked the state legislature to reverse the decision. “I signed it for those reasons that our cases were at a low point,” he said. “Everything has changed now. And yes, in hindsight I wish that had not become law.”

Sarah Sanders, a former White House press secretary who is running for Arkansas governor, published an opinion column about why she decided to get vaccinated, citing Trump and his family’s own shots as one reason – “If getting vaccinated was safe enough for them, I felt it was safe enough for me” – but stopped short of telling others to do likewise, advising: “Pray about it, discuss it with your family and your doctor.”

DeSantis and Abbott are both facing re-election contests in 2022, and seen as potential presidential contenders in 2024, which might help explain why their responses are targeted at the Trump base while Hutchinson and Ivey are more pragmatic. Other Republicans have an eye on next year’s congressional midterm elections, which they hope to turn into a protest vote against Biden.

Joe Walsh: ‘It’s where their voters are.’ Photograph: Matt Marton/EPA

Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman turned Trump critic and radio host, said: “It’s where their voters are. I interact with the Republican base every day. They are still highly skeptical or resistant to vaccines. They’re up in arms against any sort of mask wearing and mask mandates. So I hear that every day from the base. If I’m hearing that, then you know these Republican officeholders are hearing that as well, so they’re just going to cater to that.”

Asked why voters feel this way, Walsh added: “They’re predisposed to believe a lot of this shit, but it’s also said to them every day by people like Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and talk radio – the world I come from. Like Republican elected officials, they know where their audience is so they fuel this every day and they feed it every day. So they bounce back off of each other.

“Look, typically midterm elections are all about turnout and if Republican elected officials go squishy on masks and even vaccines people are not going to come out and vote. So they can’t do that.”

But Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, argues that such a strategy will prove counterproductive in the long term.

“Never before in the history of our country where we’ve had to confront national crises have elected officials behaved so badly, so disingenuously and with so much disregard for the safety and security of the American people,” he said.

Steele added: “Individuals like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and others are out here selfishly proclaiming that somehow I’m more free if I don’t wear a mask. Well, that’s just bullshit and the only freedom you get from not wearing a mask is death.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Balmoral: “Located in Royal Deeside,” we learn from the royal family website, this gigantic granite folly is “one of two personal and private residences owned by The Royal Family, unlike the Royal Palaces, that belong to the Crown”. So, other than exceptionally cold, according to Cherie Blair – and described by one royal biographer as “gruesome, ugly and dull” – perfect for any member of that family in need of complete privacy.

As for a royal who might require a personal and private residence in which to avoid, for instance, being served with papers alleging the royal sexual abuse of a trafficked US minor, it’s hard to imagine anywhere better.

What is Prince Andrew up to inside Balmoral? Thanks to The Crown and various memorable accounts and photographs – one shows David Cameron almost succeeding in his bid to re-roof the place at a competitive rate – we can easily picture him huddled by a two-bar fire, struggling with a jigsaw puzzle or killing one of the symbolic wounded stags with which this vast estate abounds. At one time, you might even, in the picturesquely swirling mists, bump into an as-yet unprosecuted child sex predator; the late Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew’s friend, was reportedly a guest there in 1999. Perhaps he felt at home with the dead animal heads and antlers, his own Manhattan home being, as Julie K Brown writes in Perversion of Justice, her impressive account of exposing Epstein’s crimes, “dark and ominous”. The interior featured individually framed glass eyeballs, with one room he called “the leather room” and another the “dungeon”.

It remains obscure, however, why the prince enjoyed staying with this charmless and sinister – even if you never spotted a succession of young girls – financial adviser who, when not being massaged, liked to share his dream of seeding a master race with his DNA. Although Epstein’s mysteriously acquired wealth was convenient when, in 2010 (after he had been jailed for soliciting sex with minors), Fergie needed a loan.

As for Balmoral today, even with attractions including his ex-wife and thousands of doomed grouse, Andrew surely can’t hide there for ever or not without addressing the civil lawsuit launched last week by Virginia Roberts Giuffre. The most recognisable alleged victim of Epstein’s sexual assaults and trafficking, she says she was sexually abused by the prince in 2001. After escaping a miserable home, foster and institutional care and imprisonment by a trafficker, Giuffre appears to have been the sort of isolated “character”, as Prince Charles calls struggling teenagers, that some of the best known royal charities were set up to support. Epstein liked to pose as a benefactor, varying threats and intimidation with promises to pay for college or to set up his victims with modelling careers.

Prince Charles makes it known that for Andrew, whose endurance of “slings and arrows” elicits his sympathy, there is now no return to public life. Since royal family life is routinely public, that could mean anything. Andrew is welcome, his name uncleared, at the semi-public retreat to Balmoral and presumably afterwards in his subsidised mansion on a crown estate. You wonder what he’d have to do to forfeit these signifiers of royal approval. Trade in horsemeat? Because a family brand so invested in children’s charities and whose image relies deeply on this connection is unlikely to escape contamination, as more details emerge, from Andrew’s closeness to a prolific paedophile and to that paedophile’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Her trial, on charges of procuring girls for Epstein, is due this autumn.

Are they aware inside Balmoral of what Epstein, their former party guest, did to girls? Or just, as it increasingly appears, indifferent? In the United States, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology finally apologised, with resignations, for its shameful association with Epstein, and MIT had not, at least, formerly advertised itself as the saviour of the young and dispossessed: his prey.

From at least the time of Prince Philip, British royals have identified themselves as, especially, protectors of children and young people: an apolitical, attractive, largely amenable demographic that might grow up to feel loyal. If Diana is often portrayed, as with the new statue and the Diana award, as having a special vocation, the Duke of Edinburgh awards preceded her, followed by Charles’s Prince’s Trust, Prince Harry’s Sentebale, the Cambridges’ Place2be, Kate’s early childhood foundation and, according to her mythology, Sarah Ferguson’s work as a “philanthropist for children”. The Queen is patron of the Scouts and Princess Anne of Save the Children, which fights child trafficking. Charles last year appointed Katy Perry a British Asian Trust ambassador against the same crime. Were it not for the Giuffre lawsuit, there might last week have been more coverage of William’s support for another child-focused royal scheme, Future Forward, to “unlock the potential of young people”.

His uncle has previously dismissed, despite the photograph of him holding her side, Giuffre’s account of being trafficked to him when she was 17 – actually on the old side for Epstein. His preference, Brown reports, was for “waif-like prepubescent girls from troubled backgrounds who needed money and had little or no sexual experience”. Giuffre looked old enough to get into, for instance, Tramp, where the prince, in his catastrophic interview with Emily Maitlis, denied accompanying her.

Absurd as they were, Andrew’s assorted excuses and pizza alibi offered the royal family and its supporters an exculpatory narrative, to the point of allowing Harry to replace him – “recollections may vary” – as the official blood fabulist, bent on spoiling the Queen’s forthcoming jubilee. Andrew, in contrast, was restored to us this year, eulogising his father: “We’ve lost almost the grandfather of the nation.” Which makes him – what – the nation’s creepy uncle? Or worse?

The longer Andrew is silent on the Giuffre lawsuit, the more his immediate family may want to review, if only for consistency’s sake, its traditional concern for marginalised young people. Maybe old ones would be less trouble.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root emerged from the pavilion on Saturday morning to a warm and sunny reception from a capacity Lord’s crowd, they took a moment to count their blessings. “Joe and I said to each other: ‘How good is to be walking out on a Saturday at Lord’s with your best mate?’” Bairstow recalled at stumps on day three. “To have a full crowd, with our family and friends here, was really special. The Lord’s buzz was definitely back.”

England’s buzz was back too, for now at least. They began the day with a mountain to climb but ended it with a slender lead of 27 thanks in large part to Bairstow’s 57 and Root’s gargantuan unbeaten 180 – the England captain’s fifth century in seven months, and one that took him past Graham Gooch into second place in the all-time list of England Test run-scorers. Only Alastair Cook now stands in his way.

“I’ve run out of superlatives, to be honest,” Bairstow said of his Yorkshire teammate. “To see him in the form that he is, playing the way he is, it’s awesome. Having batted with each over many years, you get a gauge of each other’s temperament. You bounce off one another, and we enjoyed every single moment. It’s been about having fun, enjoying the challenge, playing with a smile. We’ve scored nearly 400 today, and you can see the way in which we’re going about it, smiling and laughing, keeping that relaxed but focused attitude.”

Bairstow’s strong form on his return to the Test side has been one of the more cheering elements of the series, even if he was disappointed to succumb to India’s short‑ball trap two overs before the second new ball, gloving a pull to slip. “The game today went through a few different periods,” he said. “This morning the ball was a bit higher, and then the rate slowed as the ball got softer, and it was more difficult to rotate the strike and score boundaries.

“I’d have liked to have gone on, but it was one of those things. The pitch is slightly two‑paced, a few flying through to the keeper and a few that were dying. When you’re trying to duck and weave, it can get tricky. It caught the glove today; on another day it might go over the slip cordon, or you might get a bottom edge for one. But if they’re going short, then that means you’re doing something right with your defence.”

For all England’s dominance on days two and three, pegging India back from 267 for two late on day one, the game remains tantalisingly poised going into Sunday, and tellingly Bairstow was not yet prepared to install England as favourites. “Let’s see how tomorrow goes,” he said. “We’ve got a new ball, and it was tough and challenging when they got their second new ball, so we’ll come in tomorrow firing. We’ve got guys who can challenge them in every way possible. It’s going to be a really challenging day.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you wanted, you could still probably pick a few holes. He edged a few through the slips. He got bogged down a little in the 90s, and then again in the 150s. He didn’t hit a single six. Does an innings even still count these days if it isn’t accompanied by a big flashing bar along the bottom of the screen screaming “OH YEAH”? Most unforgivably of all, Joe Root’s unbeaten 180 against India lasted almost nine hours. Good luck fitting that into BBC Two’s teatime schedule.

In a way, this would be entirely in keeping with the past few years of his England career, a period curiously defined not by all the things he has achieved, but all the things he hasn’t. He averages 40 when he should be averaging 50. He scores fifties when he should be scoring hundreds. His team keeps losing series and getting bowled out for 130. He needs to bat at No 3. He needs to stop batting at No 3. He needs to play more Twenty20. He needs a break.

Root’s first three years as captain – between early 2017 and early 2020 – felt like an exhaustive tutelage in the daunting size and tedious scale of the job. There comes a point early in the life of all captains when they start to fancy themselves Kubla Khan: standing atop their stately pleasure dome, looking down on their chasms of ceaseless turmoil, wondering how they might recast the game in their own beatific image.

It never quite works out like that. As Root would find out, his dream job would consist largely of team meetings, hopeful pointing and endless questions about batting collapses and Jofra Archer. Over time, you could sense a certain joy and energy draining from him.

Michael Vaughan reckons the shelf life of an England captain is about five years. This is Root’s fifth and it has washed in on a lifeless ocean of disease, disinterest, isolation, his first home series defeat as captain and the mental health struggles of his friend Ben Stokes.

And yet, something deeply weird has happened. Somewhere on the long and lonely journey to his inevitable fate, Root rediscovered the secret to batting immortality. The sort of innings that other batsmen play in their dreams, Root has begun to play in his sleep. There was the 228 and the 186 in Galle, the 218 in Chennai, the 109 in Nottingham last week and now this glorious fifth symphony, all of them composed since January. He will almost certainly smash Mohammad Yousuf’s record for Test runs in a calendar year.

All while the team he captains seems to be crumbling around his ears. So just what is going on here?

Perhaps the answer, paradoxically, lies in the rubble of England’s recent form. Batting and captaincy are often described as two completely different skillsets and in most respects they are: one a function of athletic ability, the other of character.

For most of Root’s time as captain one seems to have been working against the other: the single-minded tunnel vision required to hone his game to the highest standards, versus the empathy and perspective demanded to captain a fragile team through a period of great flux.

But what if – quietly – the two jobs have essentially merged into one? What if the past 18 months have shown Root the limits of his influence? He can’t fix the domestic schedule or produce a new opening batsman out of thin air or slow the march of franchise T20 or put cricket back in state schools or cure Covid-19. He can’t even get himself back into the T20 side: his one innings for the Trent Rockets in the Hundred was a first-ball duck.

The only thing he can do to help his team win – the only thing he could ever do, really – was score runs. At a time when his runs are more needed than ever before, that sharpening of focus seems to have stoked his appetite for batting greatness.

It was a blissful Saturday here, the sun shining, the cricket of relentlessly high quality, the game beautifully poised. There were even plenty of women and children in the stands, which must have been a source of immense puzzlement to the ECB and its market research.

Perhaps, ultimately, all you really need to sell the game is a great setting, a meaningful contest, and just a touch of genius out in the middle.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pep Guardiola is the big spender whose greatest triumphs came on the cheap, even if it may not make him the poster boy for penury. As he cited his cut-price Champions League wins, the impression he gave is that he sees them as part of football’s rich tapestry. Guardiola is set to become the first manager to field a £100m footballer in the Premier League – and if he has his way then Jack Grealish will only possess the status as the division’s record signing for a few weeks.

If Sunday’s game at Tottenham doubles up as a tug of war for Harry Kane’s services, money may form a familiar backdrop. Guardiola can be an alchemist of a coach and an inventive tactician, but he is familiar with the accusation he has become a chequebook manager. English football’s maiden nine-figure buy may be used in the case for the prosecution. Tottenham offered £25m for Grealish in 2018; perhaps Daniel Levy’s reluctance to go higher amounted to a false economy as, three years later, Manchester City paid four times as much for the Aston Villa captain.

Guardiola reasoned that City’s ability to bring in fees for peripheral players such as Jack Harrison, Lukas Nmecha and Angeliño, plus Jadon Sancho’s sell-on clause, reduced their overall outlay. “I said last year that we couldn’t spend £100m,” he said. “We have bought Jack Grealish because we sell for £60m, so in the end we have spent £40m. Otherwise, we cannot do it.” Sign Kane, possibly for a fee 50% or 60% larger than Grealish commanded, and City’s net spend would be substantially larger. Perhaps Guardiola’s argument would then alter.

His old employers may look on enviously. Guardiola is the Barcelona ball boy turned captain and manager whose former club’s overspending meant they could not afford to keep Lionel Messi. City are altogether more affluent now. The balance of power has swung to the nouveaux riches. “Each club has its own reality, its own history,” he said. “And every owner of every club decides how he wants to live. Our owners do not want to benefit, they want to reinvest in the team. There is Chelsea with [Roman] Abramovich and our club with Sheikh Mansour. They want to be in this world, they want to be buying into football. What is the problem?”

Guardiola referenced Silvio Berlusconi’s Milan as he maintained ambitious owners are nothing new. Yet he was keen to stress he did not buy success when his managerial career started with a flourish. “I had the best player I’ve ever seen in my life – Lionel Messi – but we won two Champions League at Barcelona with seven players who came from the academy,” he said, and if Gerard Piqué was bought back for a bargain fee, his broader point still stood. “The finals against [Manchester] United with seven players from the academy: zero cost. You can win with different squads, different players and different situations. There is no guarantee.”

Now, as City look to win again, it is without changing much. Kane was earmarked to replace Sergio Agüero but Grealish has taken the No 10 shirt from City’s record scorer. A strategy of deploying a false 9, more Messi than Agüero, may continue in Kane’s absence. “It’s actually quite a similar team to last season. Sergio has left, so Jack comes in but the rest are the same,” Guardiola said. “I don’t know if we will sign a striker; that depends.”

He was reluctant to discuss Kane, let alone his potential cost. The other big numbers he quoted were not transfer fees. “Two teams, Manchester City and Liverpool, raised the bar and we have had to have 90, 90, 90, 90 [points] to be champions,” he said. “We have a trophy in our cabinet but we start from zero this weekend.”

Last season’s stuttering start – again when few players began the campaign in peak condition – was followed by a surge that owed much to an expensive signing, in Rúben Dias, but also to managerial brilliance and a capacity to adapt in adversity. “That is why we had success: because we did not cry in the beginning,” Guardiola added. “The reality is what it is: adapt and go forward.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Families of those missing after Turkey’s worst floods in years anxiously watched rescue teams search buildings on Saturday, fearing the death toll from the raging torrents could rise further.

At least 57 people have died from the floods in the northern Black Sea region, the second natural disaster to strike the country this month.

Drone footage by Reuters showed massive damage in the flood-hit Black Sea town of Bozkurt, where emergency workers were searching demolished buildings.

Forty-eight people died as a result of floods in the Kastamonu district, which includes Bozkurt, and another eight people died in Sinop and one in Bartin, the disaster and emergency management directorate said.

In one collapsed building along the banks of the swollen river, 10 people were believed to be still buried. The rapid flood waters appeared to have swept away the foundations of several other apartment blocks. Relatives of the missing, desperate for news, were nearby.

“This is unprecedented. There is no power. The mobile phones were dead. There was no reception. You couldn’t receive news from anyone,” said Ilyas Kalabalik, a 42-year-old resident.

“We had no idea whether the water was rising or not, whether it flooded the building or not. We were just waiting, like this. Our wives and children were panicked. Once sun came up in the morning, we saw police officers. They took us from the building and hurled us into a gas station.“

Kalabalik was surrounded by residents who were asking each other whether anyone had any news about missing people.

“My aunt’s children are there. My aunt is missing. Her husband is missing. Her twin grandchildren are missing. The wife of our building manager is missing along with their two children,” Kalabalik said.

The floods brought chaos to northern provinces just as authorities were declaring wildfires that raged through southern coastal regions for two weeks had been brought under control.

About 18 inches (45cm) of rain fell in less than three days in one village near Bozkurt. Torrents of water tossed dozens of cars and heaps of debris along streets, destroyed bridges, closed roads and cut off electricity to hundreds of villages.

Bozkurt lies in a valley along the banks of the Ezine in Kastamonu province, 1.6 miles (2.5km) from the Black Sea.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A firefighting plane from Russia crashed on Saturday in a mountainous area in southern Turkey, killing the eight crew members and emergency workers aboard, Russia’s defence ministry said.

The ministry said five Russian and three Turkish citizens were on the amphibious Beriev Be-200, which crashed while trying to land in Turkey’s Adana province. A team to investigate the accident was dispatched to the Kahramanmaras area, Turkish state media said.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, tweeted he was greatly saddened by the deaths and said their “heroic sacrifices” would not be forgotten.

Turkey has fought 300 or so wildfires in the past 16 days, which have killed eight other people, consumed forests and homes and sent thousands fleeing.

Kahramanmaras governor Omer Faruk Coskun told news agency Anadolu that a wildfire had begun after lightning struck trees. “We had dispatched a plane to the area but we lost communication with the plane a while ago and it crashed. The situation is very new. We dispatched many units to the area where the plane crashed,” he said.

The Be-200 is a two-engined amphibious aircraft used in Russia and other nations to fight forest fires. It is capable of dropping up to 270 metric tons of water in multiple runs during a single mission.

Wildfires in Turkey’s Mediterranean region began in late July and have incinerated thousands of acres of forests, mostly in the seaside provinces of Mugla and Antalya. The fires came as Turkey and the whole Mediterranean endured a prolonged heatwave.

Climate scientists say there is little doubt climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is behind more extreme events, such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms.

Northern Turkey has been hit this week by flash floods that have killed at least 44 people, turning streets into raging torrents.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Poland’s president has decided to sign a bill that would set limits on the ability of Jews to recover property seized by Nazi German occupiers and retained by postwar communist rulers, drawing fury from Israel, which said the law was antisemitic.

“I made a decision today on the act, which in recent months was the subject of a lively and loud debate at home and abroad,” Andrzej Duda said in a statement published on Saturday. “After an in-depth analysis, I have decided to sign the amendment.”

Before the second world war Poland had been home to one of the world’s biggest Jewish communities but it was almost entirely wiped out by the Nazis, and Jewish former property owners and their descendants have been campaigning for compensation.

Up to now Jewish expatriates or their descendants could make a claim that a property had been seized illegally and demand its return, but Polish officials argued this was causing uncertainty over property ownership.

In 2015 Poland’s constitutional tribunal ruled there should be specific deadlines after which administrative decisions over property titles could no longer be challenged. Changes to the law were adopted by the Polish parliament earlier this week. The bill sets a 30-year limit for restitution claims.

The issue of Jewish property rights in Poland is further complicated because, unlike other EU states, it has not created a fund to compensate to people whose property was seized.

The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, condemned the law and said Israel would not stand by at its approval. “It is a shameful decision and a disgraceful contempt for the memory of the Holocaust,” he said in a statement.

Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, said: “Poland today, for the first time, approved an antisemitic and immoral law.” In response, the head of Israel’s embassy in Warsaw was being called back immediately, he added.

“Poland has tonight become an anti-democratic, non-liberal country that does not honour the greatest tragedy in human history,” Lapid said.

A new ambassador to Warsaw will not be sent at this stage, he said. He also suggested Poland’s ambassador to Israel extend his holiday and not return to the country.

“He should use the time he has on his hands to explain to the Poles what the Holocaust means to Israel’s citizens and the extent to which we will not tolerate contempt for the memory of those who perished and for the memory of the Holocaust. It will not stop here,” Lapid said.

Israel was discussing further steps with the United States, he added.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Thursday said Washington was deeply concerned that the Polish parliament had passed the bill, and urged Duda not to sign it into law.

Washington is one of Warsaw’s most important allies, but relations between the countries have been strained by the property problem, as well as other issues such as plans to introduce changes that the opposition says aim to silence a US-owned news channel critical of the government.

The World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO) on Saturday urged the Polish government to work on resolving the issue of property seized in the past.

“Democracy and justice hits new low in Poland, as president Duda signs a law making it virtually impossible for all former Polish property owners to secure redress for property illegally seized during the Communist era,” Gideon Taylor, chair of operations of the WJRO, told Reuters.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cybersleuths have tracked down two men who allegedly attacked police officer Jeffrey Smith at the US Capitol during the 6 January insurrection, leaving him with injuries that have been linked to his death days later.

In a new complaint, attorney David P Weber – who represents Smith’s widow, Erin – wrote that David Walls-Kaufman and and Taylor F Taranto appeared to specifically target Smith because his eyes and face were vulnerable.

The lawsuit said Walls-Kaufman used a cane, crowbar or similar object to level a brain injury to Smith, who took his own life on 15 January. Jonathan Arden, DC’s former chief medical examiner, has attributed Smith’s death to post-concussion syndrome, which can lead to symptoms like depression and suicidal thoughts.

About a dozen people with the open-source intelligence group Deep State Dogs pored over evidence from the capitol attack for more than a month until they found footage of Smith and his assailants. Members of the wider “sedition hunters” community helped to quickly identify Taranto.

“We felt we had to do something to honor the memory and family of Officer Smith. It’s terrible that the bereaved were left in that situation,” Forrest Rogers, from Deep State Dogs, told HuffPost. “So we turned to the thing we do best: finding bad guys.”

Walls-Kaufman, a chiropractor, has said in the past that about 40% of his clients work at or around the Capitol. In January, he was quoted in a story about the riot, which implied he was in attendance.

Taranto – a US navy veteran from Washington state – handed a weapon to Kaufman, who then struck Smith in the head. The battery led to a concussion, according to the lawsuit.

“But for the concussion of Officer Smith at the hands of these defendants, Officer Smith would be alive today,” Weber wrote.

Smith’s widow, Erin, has been trying to convince the Police and Firefighters’ Retirement and Relief Board to consider her husband as having died in the line of duty. But the DC metropolitan police department has refused to release Smith’s body-camera video showing what actually happened, and Weber expressed frustration about how little federal law enforcement has done to avenge Smith months after the attack.

“I thought the I in FBI stood for ‘investigation’,” Weber told HuffPost. “It’s pretty lame that a private lawyer for a dead police officer’s widow has to be the one conducting the investigation.

“The fact that these volunteers have accomplished what the FBI has not is extraordinary.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Brazilian gospel star turned congresswoman accused of masterminding the murder of her preacher husband has been arrested after she was expelled from congress earlier this week.

Flordelis dos Santos de Souza, an evangelical celebrity famed for raising more than 50 children she claimed to have rescued from lives of poverty and crime, was detained on Friday night at her home near Rio de Janeiro.

As she was escorted to a police car outside the house – the same address where her husband was shot dead in June 2019 – the singer shouted: “Faith in God!”



Shortly before she was taken, Flordelis posted a video on social media in which she told fans: “The day nobody wished for has arrived. I’m being arrested for something I did not do … Pray for me.”

The 60-year-old church leader, who was recently ordered to stand trial for allegedly orchestrating the murder of Anderson do Carmo, 42, was taken to a prison in north Rio, just around the corner from Jacarezinho, the vast redbrick favela where she began her rise to fame.

Flordelis was born in Jacarezinho in 1961 as an evangelical revolution was sweeping Brazil’s deprived urban periphery.

Flordelis and her mother joined the Pentecostal movement, opening their own storefront church at the heart of the favela. By the late 1980s, as Rio was plunged into drug-related violence, Flordelis began leading young male disciples – among them a teenage Do Carmo – on late-night preaching sessions to convert the heavily armed gang members who ruled such areas with an iron fist.

Flordelis’s cramped home became a shelter for those boys and by the early 90s more than 50 people resided in the building, including Do Carmo, who would later become her lover and husband. That super-sized family helped catapult Flordelis into the public eye, and over the coming years she built a multimillion-dollar church empire and became a prominent gospel star, whose shows would draw thousands of adoring fans.

Some of Brazil’s top soap stars made a film celebrating the singer’s supposedly saintly life. In 2018, Flordelis decided to turn her Christian celebrity into votes, running for a place in Brazil’s 513-seat lower house just as Jair Bolsonaro launched his Bible-bashing campaign for the presidency.

Flordelis succeeded, winning almost 200,000 votes, and was embraced by Bolsonaro’s ultra-conservative administration when she touched down in the capital, Brasília, for his January 2019 inauguration. In a recent interview with the Guardian, the black, favela-born singer remembered her joy at securing a place in Brazil’s almost entirely white, male elite.

“I was over the moon – happy, happy, happy. I’d achieved things I could never have dreamed of. God went so far beyond my dreams, so very far,” said Flordelis.

But just over six months later those dreams collapsed when Do Carmo was shot dead in the early hours of 16 June 2019.

In the days afterwards, lurid details began to emerge in the Brazilian media, including claims the pastor had been found semi-naked and shot multiple times in the groin and that the couple might have spent their last night together at a swingers’ club. Flordelis rejected those claims as an attempt by rival church leaders and politicians to destroy her public image.

In August 2020, police formally accused Flordelis of masterminding a plot that allegedly involved three of her biological children and several informally adopted ones, although her parliamentary privilege meant she could not be arrested.

Flordelis lost that protection on Wednesday when congress voted overwhelmingly to expel her. She is expected to stand trial next year.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The government’s pledge to outlaw virginity testing will be undermined unless fake surgery touted as “virginity repair” is also banned, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has warned.

Last month ministers committed to criminalising the invasive and unscientific “tests” offered by some private clinics to determine whether someone is a virgin through an examination to see if the hymen is intact.

However, there are no plans to ban a procedure the same doctors claim can “restore virginity” by constructing a layer of skin at the entrance to the vagina to create the illusion of an unbroken hymen.

Typically girls and women are forced into the surgery known as “hymenoplasty” by their relatives, who want to present them as a “pure newborn virgin” who will bleed on their wedding night.

In 2020, an investigation by the Sunday Times identified 22 private clinics across the UK charging up to £3,000 for the procedure, which is performed under local anaesthetic. During the course of a year, about 9,000 people in the UK had searched Google for “hymenoplasty” and related terms, it found.

The RCOG claims efforts to ban virginity testing will be compromised if procedures that “repair or reconstruct” the hymen are not also made illegal.

Dr Edward Morris, the RCOG president, said: “We believe both procedures should be banned in the UK. Neither have any medical benefit and both are harmful practices that create and exacerbate social, cultural and political beliefs that attach a false value to women and girls in relation to their sexual history.

“A ban on virginity testing is undermined without a ban on hymenoplasty, as the two practices are inextricably linked.”

The hymen is a membrane with relatively few blood vessels and, according to the RCOG, studies have found that bleeding is not routinely observed after first vaginal intercourse.

The World Health Organization is clear the appearance of the hymen is not a reliable indicator of intercourse and says virginity testing is a violation of human rights.

Morris said doctors who repeated the medically incorrect statement that an intact hymen signifies a lack of vaginal intercourse and vice versa fell way below meeting the General Medical Council’s ethical guidelines.

Diana Nammi, executive director at IKWRO Women’s Rights Organisation, said hymenoplasty is a form of violence against women and girls and a harmful practice that can enable forced marriages.

“A ban on virginity testing is essential but on its own will not be enough to protect many of the girls and women we work with. They tell us they do not choose to undergo this procedure of their own free will – rather it is always because they are under pressure to present as a virgin,” she said.

“And if a girl doesn’t bleed on her wedding night, which hymenoplasty doesn’t guarantee, she will be at even greater risk from honour-based abuse.”

The MP Richard Holden is hoping for cross-party support for two clauses banning virginity testing and hymenoplasty that he has tabled for the health and care bill going through parliament.

He said: “Virginity tests and hymen repair surgeries are being conducted by doctors to check or ‘restore’ the virginity of girls and women, often prior to marriage. These practices are not founded in science, are abusive and perpetuate dangerous myths.”

The government has already committed to banning virginity testing in its violence against women and girls strategy – but hymenoplasty was not mentioned.

It confirmed it would legislate to make virginity testing illegal at the “earliest opportunity”.

The Department of Health and Social Care said it remained concerned about the practice of hymenoplasty and said it intended to set up an independent expert panel to examine the clinical and ethical aspects of the surgery.

Case study: ‘I was so confused and scared’

Hafsah, a British woman whose family is from Kurdistan, described how she came under pressure from her parents to have the surgery after she was raped by a stranger at the age of 15.

Speaking for the first time about the attack and subsequent abuse, she recalled: “I had stayed late at school to catch up on my studies and was walking home in the dark when I was grabbed from behind. I tried to defend myself but my attacker ripped off my trousers.”

When she arrived home she tried to hide the assault but her mother noticed her clothes were torn and muddy.

“It was discussed that if I didn’t bleed I wasn’t a virgin. They wouldn’t let me go to the toilet on my own and when there was no blood my mum went crazy. They came to the conclusion I must have had sex before which I hadn’t.”

For months Hafsah was harassed by her family who said they could “fix her shame”.

She said: “At first I didn’t know what they meant, but they said there was a surgery that would make me a girl again. My dad said ‘we have a solution, we have faith in you’. He was smiling but I was so confused and scared.”

Her mother used a tissue to demonstrate how a layer would be used to create a fake hymen that would tear when she had sex.

“She whispered to me, ‘when it’s your first night you will bleed like a pure newborn virgin’,” said Hafsah, whose real identity we are protecting. “All that mattered to them was that I would bleed on my wedding night.”

Hafsah, now in her 30s, said: “I told them I didn’t want the surgery but for more than a year they used emotional blackmail to try and persuade me.”

The harassment took a toll on her mental health and only ceased when she married in secret, got pregnant and was disowned by her father.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lina Khan has some of the biggest companies in the world shaking in their boots.

The 32-year-old antitrust scholar and law professor in June became the youngest person in history and the most progressive in more than a decade to be appointed as chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Khan’s appointment places her at the helm of the federal agency charged with enforcing antitrust law just as it is poised to tackle the giants of the technology industry after years of unchecked power. And it’s clear that big tech isn’t happy about it.

Within weeks of Khan’s appointment, both Facebook and Amazon requested that Khan be recused from the FTC’s antitrust investigations into their companies, arguing that her intense criticism of them in the past meant she would “not be a neutral and impartial evaluator” of antitrust issues.

Khan has forcefully argued for the need to rein in powerful firms like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google, developing an innovative antitrust argument that has revolutionized the way we think about regulating monopolies.

“She understands how these companies are harming workers, innovation and ultimately democracy and is committed to taking them head on,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an antimonopoly advocacy organization.

“This is a gamechanger.”

‘A meteoric rise’

Before Khan took it on, antitrust law enforcement in the US had atrophied. For decades, it had functioned under the “consumer welfare standard”, which meant that the government would only take action against a company for anti-competitive practices if consumers were hurt by increased prices.

But by the time Khan was a student at Williams and then Yale Law School, tech behemoths had built de facto monopolies by giving away their products for free or at such low prices that no one else could compete.

In the early years of the tech boom it was widely assumed that the industry would essentially regulate itself, according to Rebecca Allensworth, a professor of antitrust law at Vanderbilt University. That Yahoo’s popularity gave way to Google and Myspace to Facebook appeared to be proof that “competition in tech was intensive without any government involvement”, she said. “But we have seen how that has really changed, as has our understanding of how these companies can abuse the market.”

Slipping through the cracks of these old antitrust standards, tech companies amassed unchecked power, acquiring competitors and scooping up billions of customers. In 2020, Apple became the first American company to be valued at $2tn. That same year, Amazon eclipsed $1tn, joining Microsoft, at $1.6tn, and Google parent Alphabet at $1tn.

In her now-famous 2017 Yale Law Journal article, Khan argued that the rise of these mega companies proved that modern American antitrust law was broken, and that the traditional yardsticks by which regulators determine monopolies need to be re-examined for the digital age.

Keeping prices low has allowed Amazon to amass a large share of the market, giving it a disproportionate impact on the economy, stifling competition and further perpetuating monopoly, she argued.

“The long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation – factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,” she wrote.

She also investigated mergers and examined the impact the resulting tech monopolies have on product quality, suppliers and company conduct. Even if these companies’ practices resulted in some benefits for consumers, they were harmful to markets and democracy at large, she said.

The immediate impact of her thesis was undeniable, with the New York Times announcing Khan had “singlehandedly reframed decades of monopoly law”. Politico called her “a leader of a new school of antitrust thought”. Christopher Leslie, a professor of antitrust law at University of California, Irvine, characterized Khan’s rise in recent years as “meteoric”.

“It’s unprecedented to have somebody ascend to such an important leadership role in antitrust enforcement so soon after graduating from law school,” he said. “But it’s also unprecedented to have somebody make such a significant impact on antitrust public policy debates so quickly after graduating.”

Big tech in the hot seat

In 2019, Khan brought her new approach to antitrust to Congress, serving as counsel to the US House judiciary committee’s subcommittee on antitrust, commercial, and administrative law. Spearheading the committee’s investigation into digital markets, she played a large role in the publication of its landmark report: a 451-page treatise on how companies including Google and Amazon abuse their market power for their own benefit.

Khan also served as legal director at the political advocacy group Open Markets Institute and taught antimonopoly law at Columbia until her appointment to the FTC in 2021.

Khan’s appointment marked a break from the “revolving door” between the FTC and the private sector, in which people with years of experience defending companies in Silicon Valley become regulators. Her new role also comes at a time when reining in big tech is one of the only issues that unites a deeply divided Congress.

The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Khan’s leadership of the FTC was “a huge opportunity to make big, structural change” to fight monopolies and Senator Amy Klobuchar praised Khan as “a pioneer in competition policy” who “will bring a critical perspective to the FTC”. The Republican Ted Cruz told Khan he “looked forward” to working with her on these issues.

Khan has her critics. The former Republican senator Orrin Hatch has condemned her thesis as “hipster antitrust”. Mike Lee of Utah said she “lacks the experience necessary” for the FTC and that her views on US antitrust laws were “wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law”.

But her appointment coincides with a growing drive among lawmakers to take on the major tech companies, Allensworth said. “Politicians, small businesses and the academic establishment are clamoring for it,” she added.

Shortly after naming Khan as chair, Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on federal regulators to prioritize action promoting competition in the American economy – including in the tech space. “Let me be very clear: capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation,” he said regarding the order, which contained 72 initiatives to limit corporate power.

Biden asked the FTC to better vet mergers and acquisitions and to establish rules on surveillance. He also called for easing of restrictions on repairing tech devices and data collection on consumers.

‘A different set of rules’

In her first hearing as chair in July, Khan indicated that she was ready to get started, saying the US needs “a different set of rules”.

She cited bad mergers – in the past she had criticized Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram, Giphy and WhatsApp as anti-competitive – as potentially fueling large tech monopolies: “In hindsight there’s a growing sense that some of those merger reviews were a missed opportunity.”

One of Khan’s first tasks as chair is likely to be rewriting an FTC antitrust complaint against Facebook that was dismissed in June after the agency failed to demonstrate that the tech giant maintains a monopoly.

Meanwhile, Apple and others are set to face FTC scrutiny over repair policies that restrict third-party companies from fixing devices. The agency voted unanimously in July to ramp up enforcement of the right to repair.

The attempts by Amazon and Facebook to force Khan’s recusal are signs that big tech won’t go down without a fight. But critics say these efforts amount to intimidation tactics and not much more. Khan does not have any conflicts of interest under federal ethics laws, which typically apply to financial investments or employment history, and the requests are not likely to go far.

This is “a PR move”, said Allensworth. “She has made a lot of very public, extremely influential arguments about exactly how tech suppresses competition and now she’s the chairperson of the largest and most important federal agency to do with competition,” she said.

“They should be worried,” she added.

For his photo series The Hidden Beauty of Seeds and Fruits, Biss immersed himself in the collections housed at Edinburgh’s Royal Botanic Garden , sifting through its 3,500 historical specimens. “I was stunned by the variety of designs that exist to disperse seeds. Some are truly ingenious,” he says, singling out the hairy-stemmed electric shock plant, “an innocent-looking seed pod until an animal (or human) decides to bite!”

One journalist, who had to flee her home, told the Guardian : ‘Last week I was a news journalist. Today I can’t write under my own name or say where I am from or where I am. My whole life has been obliterated in just a few days.’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It looked like a rope or a question mark – a black scribble on the sand. The creature had washed up on a Northland beach in May and was found by a steely local 11-year-old, who popped it into a bag, took it to his local corner shop and requested a box. The purveyor told him it was a sea snake, so the boy put it in a bucket and took it home. The snake did not survive the trip.

“I didn’t know what to do with it,” the boy told the New Zealand Herald. “I chopped its head off, put it in a bag and threw it out.”

Aotearoa has very few predators that could plausibly harm a person. Wandering the forests, your best bet for being attacked by a wild creature is probably an over-enthusiastic, amorous parrot – the country has no crocodiles, bears, wolves or scorpions. It also had no snakes – or so many people mistakenly believed.

The case in Northland was of one of a number of venomous sea snakes that cropped up on New Zealand beaches this year. Residents have videoed or photographed the reptiles at various beaches around the North Island. The sightings generated headlines – and some consternation – across New Zealand, which has no anti-venom in the country for the species.

“We’re so unfamiliar with snakes in New Zealand that people either don’t recognise that they’re a snake, or don’t think they’re poisonous, or don’t know how to behave around them,” says Department of Conservation specialist Clinton Duffy. Sometimes, he says, people misidentify them as native eels.

On social media, news of snakes in Northland prompted an outpouring of sightings – and a number of mystified kiwis. “My cousin found one, wrapped it around his neck and took it to school … he assured the teacher it was dead – never seen one in his life as NZ has no snakes,” one commented.

“Since when did we have poisonous snakes in NZ, have I missed something,” an alarmed woman asked.

Another commenter relayed her experience catching a snake while fishing: “When we reeled it up we both looked and said that’s not a eel … knew it was some kind of snake so we both did the old farrrk that, and cut our line hook and all, see ya.”

A more accommodating climate

It’s not only New Zealand. Sea snake species have been cropping up in recent years in other regions and countries where they hadn’t been previously recorded, including Japan, South Korea and California. Researchers for the journal of Climate Change and Human Health found that “sea snakes are expanding their ranges and coming into contact with humans in unprecedented locations”.

“In the last few years we’ve been finding sea snakes in places we haven’t seen them before, whether it’s in really, really deep waters or in really high or low latitudes,” says Vinay Udyawer, a research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science specialising in sea snake ecology and distribution.

As to why? It’s still a hypothesis, but scientists say that as global heating continues to drive rises in ocean temperature and stronger storms, encounters with sea snakes could become a more common experience for New Zealanders.

“It’s likely that with the changing temperatures, those regions might be more accommodating for sea snakes,” Udyawer says. “So they might be [part of a wider] trend for species that couldn’t sustain population in places like New Zealand, and might now have the ability to as waters get warmer.”

The most common sightings in New Zealand are of the yellow-bellied sea snake, a highly venomous but non-aggressive species common to warmer oceans. They spend their lives at sea, and generally come ashore only if they’re ill or have been washed up by storms and large waves. Yellow bellies are most happy in water temperatures of around 20C – so as oceans are warmed by global heating, they’ll become increasingly comfortable in some New Zealand waters. The average sea temperature in Northland already reaches 20 degrees in the summer months, but typically drops to around 16C in winter.

“The historic data we have shows they have been coming to New Zealand occasionally, and it seems that those sightings are happening more and more frequently every year,” Udyawer says. “Whether it’s changing temperatures or it’s more likely to be the increasing numbers of storms, or rough weather that might be bringing them – we still need to collect more information to resolve that.”

A privilege, not a nightmare

While news of sea snakes arriving has caused some alarm, they are classed as native to Aotearoa, having journeyed to these waters without human assistance. Their population may fluctuate, but yellow-bellies have likely been visiting New Zealand since before humans arrived.

“It’s really important that people realise that they are a protected species,” Duffy says. If New Zealanders see one, they should leave it alone and contact the Department of Conservation. “They shouldn’t harm them, and it’s a serious offence to kill one deliberately.”

And although these sea snakes are highly venomous, it is extremely rare for them to bite a human. “They have tiny fangs at the back of the mouth – to bite you, they really have to work,” Duffy says. He and Udyawer say the only known cases are when fishermen try to extract them from a net – occasionally, a snake will pierce the thin skin between their fingers.

“They can be thought of as scary and dangerous,” Udyawer says – but there’s little justification for that. Yellow-bellies are timid and docile, often curious about divers but not aggressive. “In terms of temperament, they are very, very different to what people think of as dangerous snakes,” he says.

While people should leave the creatures to their own devices, Udyawer says an encounter with a sea snake should be regarded as a privilege, not a nightmare.

“With all my years working with sea snakes, I still get really excited every time we see one – it’s still really difficult to actually see one in the wild. People should be aware how special it is.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Winnie Hugot Gabriel was presenting her Saturday morning radio show when a 7.2-magnitude earthquake ripped through southern Haiti, sending terrified listeners racing into the streets.

“Even here in Port-au-Prince you could feel it. It was strong,” said the 32-year-old journalist from the Magik 9 station, who abandoned her microphone and sprinted outside after the tremor.

Haiti’s seaside capital, which was shattered by a less powerful quake in January 2010, appears to have emerged largely unscathed from the latest in a terrible succession of natural disasters to blight the Caribbean nation.

But the situation on Haiti’s southern peninsula, over the earthquake’s epicentre, was far more dramatic, with towns such as Jérémie and Les Cayes pulverised by a calamity that authorities say has killed at least 1,297 people and wounded more than 5,700.

“I’m heartbroken. It is awful. It is my nightmare and the nightmare of anyone who remembers 2010, that something like this would happen again,” said Jonathan M Katz, an American journalist who survived that disaster and wrote a book about the botched international response.

On Sunday as rescue workers searched collapsed buildings for survivors, and aid workers raced to provide food, water and shelter to those forced from their crumpled homes, many of the region’s hospitals were swamped with seriously wounded patients.

“Right now I’m walking around the city to see if we can rescue more people and find more dead bodies,” said Claude Harry Milord, the mayor of Jérémie, where at least 100 fatalities have been confirmed.

Milord said some of the injured were being airlifted to Port-au-Prince. Those who remained were in desperate need of aid. “The city needs medicine, tents and food because many people have lost everything,” he said.

Across the peninsula in Les Cayes, the situation appeared to be even worse. “There are many people injured. The hospitals are overwhelmed. Some are treating people on the floor; some are just sending people back home,” said Akim Kikonda, an aid worker from the group Catholic Relief Services, adding that powerful aftershocks had left homeless survivors on edge. “People are really scared.”

Roody Bouilly, a telecoms worker in Les Cayes, said schools, hotels and supermarkets had been levelled. “What happened was really painful,” the 40-year-old said. “The city is really panicked. Last night lots of people slept on the streets, almost like we saw in Port-au-Prince on 12 January 2010.”

Complicating rescue efforts was the fact that the only road linking Haiti’s capital with the three worst-hit departments – Grand’Anse, Nippes and Sud – has become virtually unpassable in recent months because of a deadly struggle between police and heavily armed criminal gangs.

“It has been a war zone for a long time. Fuel cannot get through. Supplies cannot get through. Ambulances cannot get through,” said Jean William Pape, a prominent Haitian doctor who, because of the gangland conflict, was using helicopters and small planes to ferry supplies to hospitals in Jérémie and Les Cayes.

Milord, Jérémie’s mayor, said he feared that the arrival of tropical storm Grace, which is due to hit Haiti on Monday or Tuesday, would further complicate relief efforts. “I really don’t know what might happen,” he said, remembering how he had seen bodies strewn on the streets of his city after the quake struck at about 8.30am on Saturday.

Katz said the earthquake, which came just over a month after the assassination of Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, had heaped further misery on south-west Haiti, a region still reeling from the devastation of 2016’s Hurricane Matthew.

Haiti might have faced another “epochal disaster” similar to the 2010 quake had the epicentre been closer to the capital, where about a third of Haiti’s 11 million citizens live.

“But if you live in Les Cayes, if you live in Jérémie, that is small comfort. A lot of people have already died and the death toll is going to continue to rise. This is going to be a really, really bad disaster on its own merit,” added Katz, the author of The Big Truck That Went By: How the World Came to Save Haiti and Left Behind a Disaster.

Gabriel, the radio presenter, said she was saddened to see that 11 years after the deadliest earthquake ever recorded in the western hemisphere, her country was still unprepared for such disasters. “We haven’t learned the lessons from 2010. It’s scary to realise,” she said, criticising the apparent lack of contingency plans and failure to improve building standards.

She fears months of uncertainty and hardship lie ahead as Haiti grapples with a series of profound and interwoven crises after the president’s still unsolved murder. “We have this political crisis, Covid-19 is still there, we have an economic crisis and we are now facing this earthquake and its aftermath. It’s really, really hard. It’s like you don’t have a break,” she said. “Instead of things getting better you feel like you are going into deeper trouble.”

Katz said images of shoddily built homes that had fallen “like houses of cards” underlined how the world had failed to make good on its post-earthquake pledges in 2010.

“The promise was always that the international community was not only going to help rescue people from the rubble. It was a larger promise that, as Bill Clinton famously said, they would help Haiti build back better.

“All you have to do is look at what has happened in the 24 hours since this earthquake hit to see that that never happened. Very little was built back, and that which was built back does not appear to be better.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The death toll from a powerful magnitude 7.2 earthquake in Haiti has climbed sharply, with at least 1,297 dead and more than 5,700 injured.

The updated figures from Haiti’s office of civil protection follow a previous count of 724 dead.

People in the Caribbean nation rushed into the streets to seek safety and to help rescue those trapped in the rubble of collapsed homes, hotels and other structures.

Saturday’s earthquake struck the south-western part of the poor nation, almost razing some towns and triggering landslides that hampered rescue efforts in two of the hardest-hit communities.

The disaster added to the plight of Haitians who were already grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, a presidential assassination and a wave of gang violence.

0 Numerous deaths as earthquake causes widespread damage in Haiti – video

The epicentre of the quake was about 78 miles west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, the US Geological Survey said. The widespread damage could worsen by early next week, with tropical storm Grace predicted to reach Haiti late on Monday or early Tuesday, bringing torrential rains.

Aftershocks were felt throughout the day and through the night. Many people left homeless or frightened that their fractured homes would collapse stayed in the streets to sleep – if their nerves allowed.

In the badly damaged coastal town of Les Cayes, some families salvaged their few belongings and spent the night at an open-air football pitch. On Sunday morning, people lined up to buy what little was available: bananas, avocados and water at a local street market.

The prime minister, Ariel Henry, said he was rushing aid to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals overwhelmed with patients. A former senator rented a private plane to move injured people from Les Cayes to Port-au-Prince for medical assistance.

Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said he would not ask for international help until the extent of damage was known. “The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,” said Henry. “We have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people.”

Rescue workers and bystanders were able to pull many people to safety.

Chandler said a partial survey of structural damage found at least 860 destroyed homes and more than 700 damaged. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were also affected.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US could soon see Covid-19 cases return to 200,000 a day, a level not seen since among the pandemic’s worst days in January and February, the director of the National Institutes of Health warned on Sunday.

While the US currently is seeing an average of about 129,000 new infections a day – a 700% increase from the beginning of July – that number could jump in the next couple of weeks, Dr Francis Collins said on Fox News Sunday.

“I will be surprised if we don’t cross 200,000 cases a day in the next couple of weeks, and that’s heartbreaking considering we never thought we would be back in that space again,” Collins said.

Collins pleaded anew for unvaccinated Americans to get their shots, calling them “sitting ducks” for a Delta variant that is ravaging the country and showing little sign of letting up.

“That was January, February, that shouldn’t be August. But here we are with the Delta variant, which is so contagious, and this heartbreaking situation where 90 million people are still unvaccinated, who are sitting ducks for this virus, and that’s the mess we’re in.

“This is going very steeply upward with no signs of having peaked out,” he said.

Collins also said the US could decide in the next couple weeks whether to offer coronavirus booster shots to more Americans this fall.

Federal health officials have been actively looking at whether extra shots for the vaccinated may be needed, reviewing case numbers in the US “almost daily” as well as the situation in other countries such as Israel, where preliminary studies suggest the vaccine’s protection against serious illness dropped among those vaccinated in January.

Israel has been offering a coronavirus booster to people over 60 who have already been vaccinated.

No US decision has been made because cases here so far still indicate that people remain highly protected from Covid-19, including the Delta variant, after receiving the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna regimen or the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

But US health officials made clear on Sunday they were preparing for the possibility that the time for boosters may come sooner than later.

“There is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness,” Collins said. “And Delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with. The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with healthcare providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward” with others, such as older Americans.

He said because the Delta variant only started hitting the US hard in July, the “next couple of weeks” of case data will help the US make a decision.

The Moderna president, Stephen Hoge, said seeing some “breakthrough” infections emerge among the vaccinated within six months had been surprising, even if most symptoms so far have not been life-threatening. “I think that suggests we are going to need booster vaccines to get through the winter,” he told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures.

Last week, the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) said people with weakened immune systems can get an extra dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to better protect them as the Delta variant continues to surge.

“If it turns out as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly, we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, who is Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser.

Both Collins and Fauci stressed that the best way to stem the virus was for the unvaccinated to get their shots.

Currently, about 60% of the US population has had at least one dose and nearly 51% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Areas with low vaccination rates, such as Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Mississippi, have been hit particularly hard with infections.

“That’s heartbreaking considering we never thought we would be back in that space again,” Collins said of surging infections. “But here we are with the Delta variant, which is so contagious, and this heartbreaking situation where 90 million people are still unvaccinated who are sitting ducks for this virus, and that’s the mess we’re in. We’re in a world of hurt.”

Fauci told CBS’s Face the Nation that as more people get their shots, in many places everyone – both the vaccinated and unvaccinated – will have to do their part with “mitigation”, such as mask-wearing in schools and other public spaces.

“We’ve just got to realize that we’re dealing with a public health crisis,” he said. “The more you get infections, the more spread you get, the greater opportunity the virus has to continue to evolve and mutate.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What will it take for Joe Biden to admit he is disastrously wrong about Afghanistan? The US leader struck a defiant pose last week. Sounding like a slightly desperate Olympics coach, he told Afghans it was their country. If they want it, they have to fight for it. In American politics-speak, this is called tough love. Without the love.

Biden has more hands-on foreign policy experience than any president since George HW Bush. That doesn’t mean he knows what he’s doing. Opinion polls suggest his abrupt Afghan withdrawal has majority public support. That doesn’t mean Americans will remain indifferent as the carnage and misery mount.

Daily battlefield successes for the Taliban and the growing threat to Kabul are feeding a sense of profound failure, panic and humiliation. Grim comparisons with the 1975 fall of Saigon abound. Emergency evacuations have begun. Hundreds of thousands are on the move amid a developing refugee crisis. All the signs are that it’s going to get worse.

Biden says the US is still providing limited military support, logistics, cash. But the sheer pace of the Taliban advance, and surrenders by demoralised government troops, have shaken the White House. It’s no use repeating that Nato trained and armed a 300,000-strong security force. Not if it’s no use.

That’s grossly unfair to many brave Afghan soldiers who have been deprived of critical US air cover. Yet no army fights well if it lacks credible, respected political leaders. Sacking the country’s military chief, as President Ashraf Ghani did last week, is no answer. The problem lies in Kabul. Afghanistan’s dependent political class, sheltered by the US since 2001, never really stepped up. Now it may be too late.

Biden has ripped away the protective shield, exposing incompetence, lack of planning, lack of resilience. He has also unwittingly exposed the weakness inherent in two decades of stop-go western efforts to rescue Afghanistan from its past. The past is now catching up with a vengeance. Turns out, not much has fundamentally changed.

Biden’s reasoning goes like this: the US spent more than $1tn there. Over 2,400 Americans died. Washington has other priorities. This cannot go on indefinitely. Yet reason has little to do with it.

The president thought he would gain credit for getting out. So far, it’s been all brickbats. Opponents will ask: who “lost” Afghanistan, Joe? It’s not reasonable, but this will be Biden’s defeat. He will own it. It may come to haunt him.

And it could be cataclysmic. Sweeping the country, Taliban forces are closing in on Kabul. US analysts warn the capital may fall within weeks. Millions may be forced over the borders, into Pakistan, Iran and on to Turkey, where they are not welcome.

Those who stay face orgies of retaliation, revenge killings, and oppression. Last time Kabul fell to the Taliban, in 1996, the president, Mohammad Najibullah, was captured and tortured to death. His corpse was hung from a traffic light at a roundabout, signalling a new era of Islamist rule.

Already, a powerful international chorus is decrying the consequences of Biden’s too-hasty retreat. The UN and aid agencies foresee a humanitarian catastrophe. European countries fear a Syria-scale refugee crisis. Women’s organisations are aghast at the cruel subjugation of Afghanistan’s women and girls.

Senior military men from Nato allies bemoan an “historic” strategic blunder. The US departure is a gift to China and Russia, pundits say. It reinforces claims, heard in Iraq in 2011, that the US lacks staying power and leaves friends in the lurch.

All this will be laid at Biden’s door, even as he insists he has not abandoned Afghanistan and is doing the right thing.

The original decision to cut and run was Donald Trump’s. That does not stop Republicans exploiting the crisis

Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader who long ago mislaid his personal moral compass, gave a foretaste last week. Biden, he said, was guilty of “wishful thinking” and lacked a “concrete plan”. Such hypocrisy is mind-blowing. The original decision to cut and run was Donald Trump’s and was backed by Republicans. That does not stop them exploiting the crisis to discredit him.

Maybe Americans will not blame Biden personally for the Afghan implosion, dismaying and heart-wrenching though it is. They may conclude that the US tried its best. But if his decision to quit directly threatens their own security, that’s a different matter.

Herein lies the key faultline in Biden’s policy that may force him to change tack, even ultimately to reverse the US military pullback. For, contrary to assurances given in the Doha talks, the Taliban are reportedly fighting alongside al-Qaida and possibly Isis terrorists, too.

Far from denying succour and support to fellow extremists, the Taliban are offering both. The Afghan government, meanwhile, says about 10,000 jihadists from Pakistan and other countries have joined the battle. As in 2001, Afghanistan again looks set to become a safe haven and operational hub for international Islamist terror.

This is exactly what the US (and Britain) always insisted must never happen. Crushing Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida in the wake of the 9/11 attacks was the reason the US invaded in the first place. Allowing al-Qaida a way back is an anathema. Americans would never forgive it.

Even so, the situation begins to resemble Iraq after the US withdrawal in 2011. Within two years, Isis had seized large areas of Iraq and Syria and declared an Islamic caliphate. A series of terrible terrorist atrocities ensued, there and across Europe.

To stop the attacks, and eliminate the jihadists, the US bit the bullet and sent combat troops back to Iraq. Will history repeat itself in Afghanistan?

Biden may resist intensifying political and moral pressure to think again. He will never admit he was wrong to leave. But a reviving international terrorist threat could yet force him to return.

It may be there’s just no escaping Afghanistan.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tammy Abraham has arrived in Italy to complete his move to Roma after the England striker agreed to join José Mourinho’s side from Chelsea for an initial €40m (£34m).

The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract worth around £3m per season after tax having fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Thomas Tuchel in January. Abraham made only 12 Premier League starts last season having been a regular under Frank Lampard but Chelsea have inserted a buy-back clause worth €80m that starts from June 2023.

Tuchel suggested last week that it would be Abraham’s decision whether to stay and battle for a starting place at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Romelu Lukaku for a club record £97.5m. But despite reported interest from Arsenal, he will now join former the Tottenham manager Mourinho in Serie A.

Meanwhile, academy graduate Trevoh Chalobah is determined to remain in Chelsea’s team after being left in tears by a stunning goal on his Premier League debut. The 22-year-old, who has been with the club since the age of eight, sealed Saturday’s resounding 3-0 success over Crystal Palace with a fine second-half strike from distance.

Chalobah was an eye-catching inclusion in Tuchel’s starting XI for the top-flight opener, retaining his place ahead of a host of international stars after impressing in the midweek Uefa Super Cup triumph over Villarreal.

“When I first started pre-season my aim was to impress the manager, day in, day out,” he told Chelsea’s website.

“He said I did well in the pre-season, but I was a bit surprised to start the Super Cup, but it shows my work has paid off. He has given me the opportunity and I have taken it with both hands. It’s important in football to stay consistent, stay grounded, stay hungry and always want more. It’s been a long-held dream to play for this club.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@At the end of the 60s sci-fi classic, The Day the Earth Caught Fire, the camera pans across the Daily Express case room to a front page proof hanging on a wall. “Earth Saved”, screams the headline. The camera pans. “Earth Doomed”, announces the proof beside it.

The head printer looks baffled. Which page will he be told to select? We never find out, for the film concludes without revealing the fate of our planet whose rotation has been sent spiralling out of control by simultaneous Soviet and US atom bomb tests. All we know is that Earth’s fate hangs in the balance thanks to human stupidity.

Such a vision may be the stuff of popular entertainment but it comes uncomfortably close to our own uncertain future, as highlighted last week by an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which effectively announced “a code red” warning for our species. Unequivocal evidence showed greenhouse gas emissions were propelling us towards a calamitous fiery future triggered by extreme climate change, it announced. Only urgent reductions of fossil fuel emissions can hope to save us.

It was a vision vividly endorsed by scientists, normally the most circumspect of commentators about world events. “Our future climate could well become some kind of hell on Earth,” said Prof Tim Palmer, of Oxford University. Or, as Prof Dave Reay, executive director of Edinburgh University’s Climate Change Institute, put it: “This is not just another scientific report. This is hell and high water writ large.”

Certainly the numbers outlined in the report were stark and strikingly emphatic in comparison with past, far more cautious, IPCC offerings. As it makes clear, humans have pumped around 2,400bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since 1850, creating concentrations of the gas that have not been seen on Earth in the last 2 million years.

Heatwaves and the heavy rains that cause flooding have become more intense and more frequent since the 1950s in most parts of the world, and climate change is now affecting all inhabited regions of the planet. Drought is increasing in many places and it is more than 66% likely that numbers of major hurricanes and typhoons have risen since the 1970s. “If there was still a need for a proof that climate changes is caused by human activities, then this is the report that provides it,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré of the University of East Anglia.

And the consequences of humanity’s massive act of atmospheric interference are now clear: what is hot today will become hotter tomorrow; extreme floods will become more frequent, wildfires more dangerous and deadly droughts more widespread. In short, things can only get worse.

Indeed, by the end of the century they could become threatening to civilisation if emissions are allowed to continue at their present rate. “That might seem like a long way away but there are millions of children already born who should be alive well into the 22nd century,” added Prof Jonathan Bamber of Bristol University, another report author.

In fact, they could become utterly catastrophic with the occurrence of world-changing events – such as continent-wide forest die-backs or collapsing Antarctic ice sheets, says Prof Andrew Watson of Edinburgh University. “The IPCC report gives a comprehensive update on the knowns of climate change, and that makes for grim reading. But it also makes the point that climate models don’t include ‘low probability-high impact’ events, such as drastic changes in ocean circulation, that also become more likely the more the climate is changed. These ‘known unknowns’ are scarier still.”

The new IPCC report is certainly a very different, uncompromising document compared with previous versions, as meteorologist Keith Shine of Reading University pointed out. “I was heavily involved in IPCC’s first assessment report back in 1990. We weren’t even sure then that observed climate change was due to human activity. The IPCC now says the evidence is ‘unequivocal’. That means there is no hiding place for policymakers.”

It is plain that any hopes that climate change might turn out to be not as bad as expected were forlorn Prof Rowan Sutton

The crucial point is that this report was agreed not just by scientists but by government representatives on the committee, men and women who have made it clear they are also convinced of the urgency of the situation. “They also see the direct link between greenhouse gas emissions and forest fires, floods and other recent extreme weather events, and that makes it essential for their own governments to act,” said Lord Deben, chair of the UK’s Climate Change Committee.

At the Paris climate meeting in 2015, those governments pledged to try to keep temperature rises well below 2C, and not more than 1.5C if possible, from pre-industrial days. The trouble now is that the world has already heated up by almost 1.1C, which means only drastic cutbacks in emissions will succeed in preventing far more serious, intense global warming. It will be tight going. The most ambitious of emission scenarios described by the IPCC offers less than a 50% chance of keeping below that 1.5C threshold.

Prospects for limiting global warming to 2C are better but will still require reductions far in excess of those that have been pledged by nations in the run up to Cop26, the UN climate summit to be held in Glasgow in November. “It is plain that any hopes that climate change might turn out to be ‘not as bad as expected’ were forlorn,” said Prof Rowan Sutton, of Reading University’s National Centre for Atmospheric Science. “It is happening now and it is happening very fast. Dealing with this crisis means taking urgent actions.”

That will not be an easy task, however. As Nick Starkey, director of policy at the Royal Academy of Engineering, pointed out last week. “The UK is not on track to meet existing carbon targets and our goal of 78% emissions reduction by 2035 will not be reached without deep energy efficiency measures,” he said.

What is needed is “a society wide vision”, a national plan that would be instigated to ensure implementation of all the different policies – from transport to power generation and from home heating to farming – that will be needed to make sure emissions are cut as quickly as possible. “We need to put policies in place throughout society otherwise our targets will just become empty promises,” said Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London.

It is a suggestion backed by Lord Deben. “In the UK, we need a new planning act that ensures all local authorities have to take climate change into account every time they make a planning decision. At present, they get absolutely no advice about how to go about this business.” Such processes would ensure that the fine detail of ensuring carbon emissions are controlled and mistakes – such as the recent granting of planning permission for a new coal mine in Cumbria – are not repeated, he added.

However, it will take considerable, sustained effort for the nation to keep up such efforts. On Tuesday, national front pages were filled with images of burning Greek villages and lurid headlines. “PM: wake up to red alert to climate crisis,” warned the Daily Express; “As doomsday report warns of apocalyptic climate change: can UK lead world back from the brink,” asked the Mail; while the Telegraph announced “UN warns of climate ‘reality check’”. Given that many of these papers have gone to lengthy efforts in the past to denigrate climate science and to question the reality of global warming, these were radical announcements. It remains to be seen just how long each publication remains committed to the science.

“The climate story was all over the front pages on Tuesday but by Friday, three days later, it was hardly mentioned,” added Prof Martin Siegert of Imperial College, London. “Yet this is the most important thing that humanity needs to do in the next 30 years. It is going to change our lives, it is going to change the way we regard ourselves on the planet. And if we don’t, we are going to stoke up huge problems for our children. But after three days we seemed to be forgotten despite the fact this is something that needs decades of consistent, persistent work.”

Siegert added that it had been estimated that investment levels equivalent to 1% of GDP are needed to ensure the country’s transition to net-zero status. “However, we are currently spending about 0.01%… a 100th of that estimated price tag. And this is also well below what the government is spending on things that will actually add to our emissions, such as airport expansion plans and the tens of billions it has pledged on new road schemes, which will only make it easier to drive around and burn more fossil fuel.”

These are all issues for the UK to hammer out, as a matter of urgency, over coming months, although the opening of the Cop26 conference in Glasgow is going to be an even more pressing event. At the meeting, which begins on 1 November, delegates from more than 190 nations will gather to hammer out a deal that will determine just how hot life will get on Earth. At Paris, in 2015, nations pledged emission cuts that now urgently need to be updated or global temperatures will soar to well over 2C. Similarly agreements will have to be reached on how to phase out coal power stations as quickly as possible, to protect carbon-dioxide-absorbing forests, and to agree aid for developing nations to help them survive the impacts of global warming.

It will a fine-run thing and it is very likely that we will not know if negotiators succeed until the very last minutes of the Glasgow conference. In this way we will learn the planet’s fate in November, exactly 60 years after the cinematic release of The Day the Earth Caught Fire. We may then have a better idea of whether “Earth Saved” or “Earth Doomed” was the right front page headline.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Early on Sunday morning I was heading to university for a class when a group of women came running out from the women’s dormitory. I asked what had happened and one of them told me the police were evacuating them because the Taliban had arrived in Kabul, and they will beat women who do not have a burqa.

We all wanted to get home, but we couldn’t use public transport. The drivers would not let us in their cars because they did not want to take responsibility for transporting a woman. It was even worse for the women from the dormitory, who are from outside Kabul and were scared and confused about where they should go.

Meanwhile, the men standing around were making fun of girls and women, laughing at our terror. “Go and put on your chadari [burqa],” one called out. “It is your last days of being out on the streets,” said another. “I will marry four of you in one day,” said a third.

With the government offices closed down, my sister ran for miles across town to get home. “I shut down the PC that helped to serve my people and community for four years with a lot of pain,” she said. “I left my desk with tearful eyes and said goodbye to my colleagues. I knew it was the last day of my job.”

I have nearly completed two simultaneous degrees from two of the best universities in Afghanistan. I should have graduated in November from the American University of Afghanistan and Kabul University, but this morning everything flashed before my eyes.

I worked for so many days and nights to become the person I am today, and this morning when I reached home, the very first thing my sisters and I did was hide our IDs, diplomas and certificates. It was devastating. Why should we hide the things that we should be proud of? In Afghanistan now we are not allowed to be known as the people we are.

As a woman, I feel like I am the victim of this political war that men started. I felt like I can no longer laugh out loud, I can no longer listen to my favourite songs, I can no longer meet my friends in our favourite cafe, I can no longer wear my favourite yellow dress or pink lipstick. And I can no longer go to my job or finish the university degree that I worked for years to achieve.

I loved doing my nails. Today, as I was on my way home, I glanced at the beauty salon where I used to go for manicures. The shop front, which had been decorated with beautiful pictures of girls, had been whitewashed overnight.

All I could see around me were the fearful and scared faces of women and ugly faces of men who hate women, who do not like women to get educated, work and have freedom. Most devastating to me were the ones who looked happy and made fun of women. Instead of standing by our side, they stand with the Taliban and give them even more power.

Afghan women sacrificed a lot for the little freedom they had. As an orphan I weaved carpets just to get an education. I faced a lot of financial challenges, but I had a lot of plans for my future. I did not expect everything to end up like this.

Now it looks like I have to burn everything I achieved in 24 years of my life. Having any ID card or awards from the American University is risky now; even if we keep them, we are not able to use them. There are no jobs for us in Afghanistan.

When the provinces collapsed one after another, I was thinking of my beautiful girlish dreams. My sisters and I could not sleep all night, remembering the stories my mother used to tell us about the Taliban era and the way they treated women.

I did not expect that we would be deprived of all our basic rights again and travel back to 20 years ago. That after 20 years of fighting for our rights and freedom, we should be hunting for burqas and hiding our identity.

During the last months, as the Taliban took control in the provinces, hundreds of people fled their houses and came to Kabul to save their girls and wives. They are living in parks or the open air. I was part of a group of American University students that tried to help them by collecting donations of cash, food and other necessities and distributing it to them.

I could not stop my tears when I heard the stories of some families. One had lost their son in the war and didn’t have any money to pay the taxi fare to Kabul, so they gave their daughter-in-law away in exchange for transportation. How can the value of a woman be equal to the cost of a journey?

Then today, when I heard that the Taliban had reached Kabul, I felt I was going to be a slave. They can play with my life any way they want.

I also worked as a teacher at an English-language education centre. I cannot bear to think that I can no longer stand in front of the class, teaching them to sing their ABCs. Every time I remember that my beautiful little girl students should stop their education and stay at their home, my tears fall.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Four years ago, Jehad Judah was pleased to be able to afford to buy his family a flat in al-Jalaa, a 14-storey building in downtown Gaza City. The upscale tower block was home to about 700 people as well as lawyers, computer software businesses and journalism bureaus belonging to the Associated Press of the US and Qatar’s Al Jazeera.

The 54-year-old bespectacled civil servant spent the first 30 years of his life living in the jumble of breeze-block housing of a nearby refugee camp. After he met his wife in 2001, the couple moved to Gaza to start a family. The Israeli and Egyptian blockade of the strip which came along a few years later made life in the city hard, but al-Jalaa still offered a decent standard of living, he said.

“It was the high-end of the market. It was spacious, it had a good generator and other services, the neighbours were nice. I was never worried we were a target. I never ever thought that for a second,” he said. “We were surrounded by lawyers, journalists, civilians.”

Yet on 15 May, after nine days of listening to bombs fall on the neighbourhood during the latest confrontation between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group which rules over the Gaza Strip’s two million residents, the Judah family heard a commotion outside the front door.

“Our neighbours told us they were evacuating because there had been a phone call from the Israelis and they were going to bomb it. We left as quickly as we could, just taking passports and other documents,” Jehad said. “We waited nearby, we still didn’t really believe it was going to happen, we thought AP could intervene for us. I still don’t believe it. I’m still in shock.”

Three months after al-Jalaa collapsed in a cascade of concrete and glass, most of the rubble has been cleared away: workers are still digging through what remains for twisted strips of steel rebar, straightening it with pliers to be resold for new construction projects.

The scene is repeated all over the coastal enclave. Hardly anything destroyed in May has been rebuilt yet, save filling in some of the craters on the main roads for traffic, because the majority of outside funding for reconstruction is still held up in talks. The ceasefire, now presided over by a new Israeli coalition government headed by right-winger Naftali Bennett, is fragile – but holding.

Hamas and smaller groups such as Islamic Jihad declared they won May’s hostilities, and indeed, the extremists managed to scare Israel with both the volume and range of their rocket attacks – not to mention an improved ability to get missiles past the Iron Dome air defence system.

But it doesn’t feel like that on the ground. The still-gaping wounds of Gaza City’s architecture reflect the shock and pain many here are still suffering.

May was the third large-scale round of fighting between Israel and Hamas in the 14 years since the militants wrested control of the strip from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. The takeover led Israel and neighbouring Egypt to impose a punishing blockade which has created what inhabitants call the “world’s largest prison”, with more than 50% unemployment, a collapsed healthcare system, poisonous water and relentless power cuts.

Each war has brought fresh sorrows, although the nature of the fighting has differed. With no ground invasion this time, Israel instead relied on the heaviest weapons in its arsenal, including US-made “bunker busting” GBU-28s, for an intense aerial campaign. And the clearest difference between this war and those that have come before, according to local human rights group al-Mezan, is the deliberate targeting of high-rise tower blocks, all of which were home to civilians and offices.

With limited space and a growing population, there are few options for Gazans other than to build upwards. Yet after gathering its fieldwork over the last three months, al-Mezan has found that this time around, 232 housing units in high-rises like al-Jalaa were hit during May’s 11-day confrontation, compared with 182 in 2014’s conflict, which lasted seven weeks. In May, bombings of towers were usually accompanied by a phone call warning residents to evacuate. In 2014 such calls were rare.

As at the end of the 2014 war, the centre of Gaza City, rather than border areas, was heavily targeted. Even now the commercial crossing with Israel remains partially closed, creating shortages in medical supplies such as anaesthetic gas, putting surgeries on hold and limiting the strip’s intensive-care capabilities.

“This time there was a clear targeting of humanitarian efforts. Even things like hitting residential streets because they say there are Hamas tunnels beneath: it bursts water pipes, it blocks roads, making it harder to evacuate the wounded,” said Samir Zaquot, field research unit director at al-Mezan.

“They didn’t hit some obvious Hamas targets, like Yahya Sinwar’s office [Hamas’ leader inside Gaza]. It’s about sending a message. It’s about telling Hamas, ‘Look, we can destroy everything,’ and telling ordinary people there is no hope.”

Amnon Shefler, spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said its targets were “all of high military value to Hamas and were vetted according to rigorous procedures within the IDF and in accordance with international law. Unfortunately, the Hamas and PIJ [Islamic Jihad] terrorist organisations intentionally place military assets in the heart of densely populated areas, aiming to increase the chance of civilian casualties in Gaza and to challenge the IDF’s ability to strike terrorist operatives and infrastructure.”

He added that the IDF had “provided advance warnings to civilians in the vicinity so they could evacuate prior to the strikes, as well as taking efforts to ensure civilians had in fact evacuated prior to carrying out the strike.”.

Comprehensive reports released last month by Human Rights Watch, however, found that both sides were probably guilty of war crimes for deliberately targeting densely populated civilian areas with disproportionate force.

And after so many wars in such a small area and such a short length of time, each conflict compounds misery upon misery.

In Beit Hanoun, a dusty town near the strip’s northern border, the Hamid family lost 34-year-old Raed, one of six sons, in May. He had been asleep in a room on the second floor of the large family home when an Israeli shell ploughed through the roof, destroying the back of the house and starting a fire that consumed much of what was left.

“We already lost our house in the 2014 war,” said Zakaria Hamid, 65, Raed’s father. “We rebuilt as three separate houses after that, lower structures. We thought if some of us were going to die, at least it wouldn’t be all of us.”

Help with reconstruction was not yet forthcoming, the Hamids said: despite repeated requests, officials have not visited to carry out an assessment of their needs. Even if aid money arrives from the UN, Egypt or Qatar, the blockade means the price of building materials can rise rapidly, and it might not be possible for the family to afford the repairs.

Ultimately it is the mental toll of life in Gaza, rather than physical destruction, which carries the highest cost, said 38-year-old Sharif, Raed’s brother. “To live without freedom and without dignity makes it impossible to be happy,” he said, sitting with the rest of his family in the shade outside their ruined home. Where the back wall should be, a silvery olive grove is now visible, its leaves whispering as the summer breeze passes through the shell of the house.

“That is what it means to be Palestinian. Raed dreamed of being free, but it was impossible.” For so many, it is still.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has called a snap election, gambling that voters will reward his administration’s handing of the coronavirus pandemic with a parliamentary majority as he pulls the plug on a two-year minority government.

On Sunday morning, Trudeau met with Governor General Mary Simon to request she dissolve parliament — a request she approved.

“The decisions your government makes right now will define the future your kids and grandkids will grow up in,” Trudeau told reporters after meeting with Simon. “So in this pivotal, consequential moment, who wouldn’t want a say?”

For the last two years, Trudeau has relied on opposition parties – largely the leftwing New Democratic party (NDP) – to pass legislation, a budget and emergency coronavirus spending. In recent months, however, he has accused opposition parties of delaying the passage of legislation.

With world-leading vaccination rates and an improved outlook for the country’s economy, Trudeau sees an opportunity to win back the majority that voters denied him in 2019.

In sending Canadians to the polls, Trudeau is hoping to capitalize on the success of provincial leaders in recent elections. In all cases, voters have rewarded incumbent provincial governments with legislative majorities.

But there is no guarantee for the prime minister, whose Liberals have led the country since 2015.

Recent polling puts Trudeau on the cusp of capturing the 170 seats needed for a majority government. Data from the Angus Reid Institute found the Liberals have five-point advantage over the opposition Conservatives, with the pandemic being top of mind for voters.

The prime minister’s rivals have shown little interest in heading to the polls.

In late July, the New Democratic leader, Jagmeet Singh, sent a letter to the newly installed governor general, Mary Simon, calling on her to reject Trudeau’s request to dissolve parliament.

Singh pointed out that the country’s fixed-election law states that every general election must be held on the third Monday of October four calendar years after the last one.

While the law allows for an early election if the government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons, Singh noted that Trudeau’s Liberals have won every confidence vote they faced.

“It’s not the right time to have an election,” he said earlier this week. “People might say ‘that that’s what governments do’ … I don’t think that’s what governments do when you’re in the middle of a pandemic,” he said.

Constitutional experts have widely rejected the idea that the governor general would refuse the prime minister’s request.

Singh is the most well-liked federal leader, and polling suggests the NDP will gain seats, but the Conservative opposition leader, Erin O’Toole, faces the prospect of his party losing a number of races. With coronavirus restrictions hampering in-person events over the last year, O’Toole has struggled make inroads with voters since winning the party’s leadership race last August.

“Canadians are worried about a fourth wave of Covid-19 … Now is not the time for an election. We can all wait and go to the polls when it’s safe,” O’Toole said in a video released on social media this week.

Canada’s chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, has warned that the country may be at on the verge of a fourth wave of the the coronavirus, driven largely by the quickly-spreading Delta variant. She said the scope of infection would likely be determined by vaccination rates.

Elections Canada, the national body that oversees elections has said it is prepared to safely conduct a vote nationwide, but warned that counts could be delayed.

Canadians will cast their ballot in five weeks September 20, the shortest election campaign allowed under federal law.




@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ronald Milam Jr, 19, Texas

Like for most young Americans growing up, 9/11 was a fairly constant presence, with online videos and TV documentaries, memorials and references to it on the news. I never wanted to ask Mum too much, instead putting the pieces together as I got older. I think I always knew my dad had died that day, but I’ve never felt a hugely emotional reaction. I know the basics of what happened, but there’s nothing I can do about it now.

Growing up, life at home was pretty calm. Both Mum and Dad were in the military, so I was born on Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. When I was aged three she left, and we moved to San Antonio, Texas. After that we travelled a lot – for a long time just me, my mum and my sister. Mum remarried for a while, and my younger brother came along 10 years ago.

I know that both my parents were working in the Pentagon in September 2001, on opposite sides of the building. I know that my mum survived that day, but my dad did not. Mum and I have never really sat down to discuss the details. Making her relive that day? No thanks. I don’t feel the need for closure – I wasn’t there. When things like this happen, you lose a loved one, you’ve got to carry on.

Mum has always been so careful to make sure our home and lives are full of fun, love and joy. So I prefer not to dwell on the past, but to look to the future. Why focus on things that happened before I was even around? I’ve got so much time to look forward to, I hope, I don’t want to bring myself down. Our family doesn’t do too much sentimentality; we’re not emotional people.

That said, I share my dad’s name: he was Ronald Senior, and I’m Ronald Junior. It means a lot to me that we have the same name. It means he is a constant presence, always there.

It has been 20 years since 9/11, and I know what I want for myself two decades in the future. I’m determined to make sure I reach my full potential. I study biology now, and want to be a PA, a physician’s assistant. What matters to me most, though, is being stable and happy. And I’d like to have a family – being a father would be pretty dope as well.

Last year I enrolled in my college major studying criminal justice. At one point I wanted to study counter-terrorism, but to make the difference I want to the world I’ve decided I need to get to law school, whether I end up writing, interpreting or fighting to uphold it. It’s a natural fit for me. Mum will tell you how I’ve never liked to shut my mouth since I learned how to open it. But that’s not the only reason why I’m drawn to the legal world.

In August 2001, a month before 9/11, my mum found out she was pregnant with me while she and my dad were on vacation in Poland. My dad was a contractor – wallpaper and mechanics – and after they returned he was assigned his jobs for the first week back. On 9/11 itself, he was supposed to be doing a job in New Jersey, but the night before he got a call saying he was going to be sent to the 104th floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center the following morning instead. It was a short job: he was only due to be there for two hours, from 7am to 9am. He’d never stepped foot inside the building before.

When 9am came around, my mum tried to call him when she saw the news on the television. She hoped with all she had that he had already made his way out. Mum couldn’t get through, rightly fearing the worst had happened. To this day we think he was probably done with work, and on his way out of the building when it was hit. Dad never made it out.

‘Dad had never been in the building before’: Claudia’s parents. Photograph: Arrow Pictures

Each time I think about it, I feel super angry. He should have made it out, his job was over. Why didn’t he? My mum always says everything happens for a reason. I just don’t understand what this one is.

For much of my life, I’ve been reading about the events which led up to that day: it seems to me there was so much the US could have done to avoid the entire situation. We knew about al-Qaida, these names were known. Knowing this has always made me want to get my foot in the door of the justice system, to make sure events like this can’t happen again.

Growing up there was me, my mum and two sisters. I was born in Brooklyn, then we lived in Staten Island. When I was eight we moved to Florida, where we’ve been ever since. The four of us are close: a unit of best friends. In school, I found it difficult to tell people my story. I knew it would see me labelled, that I’d be looked at in a different way. I wouldn’t tell people I met, unless I really trusted them: I didn’t want their pity. It just felt so fake.

In time, I’ve grown out of that a little. It’s more important to remember that thousands of people are in the same situation that I am. Twenty years may have passed, but we don’t educate people about what happened that day anywhere near enough. Our lives are constantly shaped by what happened, I know I’ll never stop grieving. Meanwhile there are people in the United States spreading conspiracy theories, or pretending 9/11 never happened at all. This is a part of American history which destroyed the lives of so many: I’m living proof.

I remember going to the memorial at Ground Zero before it was even erected. On 11 September we’d go and listen to the names. We’d walk along this long path towards two pools of water into which we’d throw roses. It shocks my mum that I have these memories. I was so young. I might not have understood what was happening, but even then I knew the importance of that day. I don’t remember if Mum ever sat me down and told me what exactly happened to Dad. I always knew it was going to be just us girls.

Still, he’s a real presence in my life. I’ve got pictures of him in my room which I speak to every night at bedtime. We talk about him as a family all the time. He already knows about my dream – to take up a seat in the US Supreme Court.

I don’t have much family in the United States. Mum immigrated here nearly 30 years ago from Brazil. Most of her relatives remain in South America. My dad, meanwhile, came to America from Germany for work in the 1990s. Through my paternal grandparents, I feel a strong connection to my father and his European heritage. It’s a way, I think, of me being close to him.

Mum might remember it differently, but I can recall, aged around eight or nine, the first time 9/11 came up in conversation at home with crystal clarity. On TV, kids always called their dads “father” – which was a word we just never used at home. When I asked mum why, she sat me down and explained this to me carefully: the man who I knew as dad – her partner at the time – didn’t actually share my DNA.

I was only a child, but that day she told me the story. My parents had met at a New York party and felt an instant connection. As she puts it, theirs was love at first sight. They both worked in finance: Mum at Morgan Stanley, Dad at Deutsche Bank. They started to date, and had made plans to move in together after finding out she was pregnant with me.

The morning of 11 September 2001 was one of the first after they’d secured an apartment together. Dad worked in Midtown, but that day he’d volunteered to take an early morning meeting at the World Trade Center. Mum always worked inside the Twin Towers, but that morning, struck with morning sickness, she was running late. It was a beautiful day, so she decided to take a minute for a breath outside the office. That’s when she heard a noise above her, and looked up to see a big ball of fire. If I hadn’t been making her nauseous, she too would have been 70 floors up. Dad died that day, aged just 27.

As she recounted that day, we watched videos on YouTube. Before then, I knew nothing of 9/11. Suddenly I was aware of this terrible piece of US history, and how it had shaped our family. I’m not sure I could quite comprehend it all.

Just a couple of years after learning what had happened, in May 2011, I was on the bus home from elementary school. They were talking about 9/11 on the radio. It was weird, and given I was playing with my friends, it felt like a real mood killer: if I’m trying to have a good time, it’s just not a topic I want to think about, thanks. Back home, I went upstairs to find Mum frantic in front of the television. I asked what had happened, she told me Osama had been killed. I thought she was telling me Barack Obama had been assassinated. Once the confusion was cleared up, I learned for the first time who Osama bin Laden was.

Both Mum and my grandparents say I remind them of my dad: the face shape, long hair, and cavity-free teeth I inherited from him. They say we share an enthusiasm for life, too. His passion was banking; mine are cheerleading and computer science. In the same way he chased his dreams – becoming a vice president in his 20s – I want to follow mine. I like to think I’m continuing the life he led, despite the fact I never met him.

I think a lot about what happened that day. It’s like Mum and I were spared – whether I thank God, the universe or just our luck – by the grace of something we survived. The fact I’m even alive today? I can’t tell you how often I just feel grateful.

People always say “9/11, never forget”, but Mum would always tell me about the compassion she was shown in the aftermath. In the days following the attack, she was searching hospitals for my father. She met people from all over the country, who helped her in her efforts to track him down. So yes of course, we should never forget the tragedy of what happened, but I hope we also never forget 9/12, 9/13 and the days that followed: the care and love that our families like ours were shown.

Until recently, I’d not talked much about 9/11 to friends or family. Of course it came into my relationships, it’s a constant presence, but I’d never taken the time to deep dive into it. It all somehow felt both deeply private and extremely public at the same time: I wasn’t sure how best to navigate it. I wasn’t born when it happened, I was in my mum’s womb, so my relationship to it and how it makes me feel is constantly evolving.

I think that’s because we were “the 9/11 family” for so long that it basically just became a label. It meant I got attention, and played a role. I didn’t really get to experience the emotional side. In the 20 years that have passed, I think my family have had time to reflect and process what happened. Now, as I get a little older, it feels, finally, that I’m going through that, too.

My dad was on board flight AA11, the first plane which crashed into the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001. I don’t know much about that day from his perspective, but when my mum gave a TED talk, I heard about how she experienced it. Some details stick out, things she said in her talk which have stuck with me.

Mum was in the grocery store parking lot when she heard on the radio that a plane had made impact with the World Trade Center. She had just pulled up, the car was still running. Instead of going shopping she decided to drive home again to check my dad’s flight number. It’s a human moment that made the story real. I could put myself in her shoes.

I also learned in her talk that my dad was sitting next to one of the terrorists on the aeroplane. Again, it’s a deal that suddenly made everything feel real.

There was a message to her talk, too, a mantra which has really shaped me: our experiences and what we do with them shape who we are.

In the aftermath of 9/11, Mum received so much love and support from friends, family, neighbours and the entire country. She took a step back, and looked across the world: over in Afghanistan, she saw how many widows just like her were being treated so badly and felt sickened. Women who had lost their husbands were treated like they were worthless. At first, Mum wanted to try and help just one woman in a situation like hers; she started small.

I’m so proud that from her pain, Mum decided to show kindness to others. When so much of the United States was filled with hatred – war, bigotry and violence – she was full of love. Today she runs a non-profit called Beyond the Eleventh, supporting Afghan widows trying to build lives after their husbands have passed. We do fundraisers and events, and a charity bike ride from Ground Zero to our home in Boston. I did the ride in my senior year of high school, and I’m doing it again this year – alongside my entire family – to mark 20 years having passed since we lost Dad.

I’m determined to find out more about him from anyone who knew him. I’m gathering up his memories and stories, which I can keep and pass down in the future, so I know he’ll always live on.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@From the patio of his winery high in the north Mexican desert, David Mendel surveys vineyards spread across a bowl-shaped valley under a scorching afternoon sun.

Mountains shade the vineyards in the morning and the late afternoon – creating a short window of intense daytime heat. After dark, the altitude of 2,100 metres sends temperatures plunging.

“Grapes need hot conditions as much as the cold so there’s a very slow maturation process,” says Mendel, director of Viñedos Don Leo. “If you put these two things together, you get really good quality fruit.”

And that means really good wine, too.

Vineyards are blooming in the desert of Coahuila state, where the wine business is burgeoning in a revival of a tradition dating back more than 400 years.

The Valle de Parras now forms part of a tourist trail christened “vinos y dinos” – wine and dinosaurs – which winds its way through the desert landscape, taking in vineyards and a paleontology museum.

The oasis town of Parras de la Fuente is home to the oldest still-functioning winery in the Americas, Casa Madero, which was founded in 1597.

Spanish producers were hostile to competition from the new world, however, and successfully petitioned King Felipe II to prohibit the planting of vineyards in the Americas and ban imports. Those restrictions lasted two centuries and prevented the development of a wine culture in Mexico, historians say.

Farmers focused on growing grapes for brandy production, but in the 1970s many ripped up their vines after the drink fell out of fashion, said Francisco Rodríguez, a former head winemaker with Casa Madero.

“Nobody wanted to invest in vineyards 20 years ago,” he said.

The one exception was Casa Madero, whose owners sent Rodríguez to France in the 1970s to study winemaking. Their early efforts were not totally successful, however.

“Nothing sold,” said Rodríguez. “Mexicans didn’t accept it because they didn’t think there could be quality Mexican wines – and they didn’t even want to try it.”

But before long, Casa Madero found success in foreign markets and slowly started gaining acceptance at home. The owners began to offer technical support to new wineries.

Don Leo – named for David Mendel’s father, Leo Mendel, who fled Nazi Germany in 1938 – was among the first to jump into winemaking, bottling its first vintage in 2006.

The Valle de Tunal lies at the end of a long road lined with cactus, mesquite and date palms Water is piped in from a deep well 6km (3.7 miles) away.

“This valley is difficult,” Mendel says. “But with the quality you get here, it’s worth the difficulties.”

Traditionally, Mexican wine has not been known for its quality. The best-known brand was Sangre de Cristo – Christ’s blood – often used for communion wine. Its sweetness appealed to the Mexican palate and the perception was “it took away their sins”, joked Rodríguez.

But tastes changed over time – and so did the quality.

“Mexico is a little behind in quantity,” said Manuel Negrete, head of the Mexican sommelier association. “But one of the good things about Mexican wines is we have a focus on quality.”

Consumption still lags at roughly 1 litre per capita annually, Negrete says, but consumption has tripled over the past decade.

“Twenty-five years ago, you wouldn’t find a Mexican restaurant that would have a Mexican wine on its wine list,” said Jonathan Heath, deputy head of the bank of Mexico and a Mexican wine enthusiast.

“It’s hard now to find a restaurant without a Mexican wine on its wine list.”

Prices remain on the high side, mainly due to low production and a lack of government support. Mexican authorities also “tax the heck out of it”, said Heath.

Still, regions such as the Valle de Guadalupe in Baja California have become known internationally. Now attention is turning to other parts of Mexico – such as Rancho El Fortín, a patch of Coahuila vineyards nestled in the mountains near the Texas border.

Winemaker Roberto Díaz flew into the site for the first time in 2013. He confessed that as he descended into the rugged mountainous region he thought: “What am I getting into?”

But he found a plot with potential for growing varietals like syrah, malbec – and especially merlot – which he says resembled a cabernet sauvignon from Chile.

He also found an opportunity to make his mark in a young industry – which is now drawing winemakers from around the world.

“In another country, it’s impossible to get a project like this at age 26 and be in charge of something so large,” he says.

Lucía García, 29, had barely paid attention to Mexican wines before becoming the winemaker at Parvada, a project of homes and vineyards on the outskirts of Parras de la Fuente.

García, who is from Salamanca, Spain, was working in Chile and planned to take a position in Germany.

But her partner joined a winery in Coahuila and called her to say: “This is the future. This is where the big projects are.”

That future worries some in Coahuila, a parched region where competition for scarce water reserves has grown more acute in recent years.

Local farmer and activist José Luis García Valero has worked with campesinos for decades, and watched their water dwindle. Over a lunch of carne asada and tequila – he doesn’t drink local wine – he recalled a litany of projects with competing plans for local water reserves: a massive industrial and residential development, a toxic waste dump and organic agriculture projects.

“Opening a winery looks a lot prettier than these other projects,” he said.

Supporters say the wine industry is still small; Rodríguez estimates it covers barely 9,000 hectares nationally.

Wineries also install efficient irrigation systems, he says, whereas pecan growing, which covers more terrain than the vineyards, consumes three times as much water.

Looming over any industry in the scorched Coahuila desert is the spectre of climate change. Rancho El Fortín harvests grapes three weeks earlier than when Díaz arrived in 2013. The seasons are also “becoming similar”, he says – winters stay warm.

“Water is increasingly scarce in pretty much any place here,” Díaz says. “That’s the limitation we’re facing.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban leader freed from a Pakistani jail on the request of the US less than three years ago, has emerged as an undisputed victor of the 20-year war.

While Haibatullah Akhundzada is the Taliban’s overall leader, Baradar is its political chief and its most public face. He was said to be on his way from his office in Doha to Kabul on Sunday evening. In a televised statement on the fall of Kabul, he said the Taliban’s real test was only just beginning and that they had to serve the nation.

Baradar’s return to power embodies Afghanistan’s inability to escape the bloody shackles of its past. The story of his adult life is the story of the country’s unceasing, pitiless conflict.

Born in Uruzgan province in 1968, he fought in the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets in the 1980s. After the Russians were driven out in 1989 and the country fell into civil war between rival warlords, Baradar set up a madrassa in Kandahar with his former commander and reputed brother in law, Mohammad Omar. Together, the two mullahs founded the Taliban, a movement spearheaded by young Islamic scholars dedicated to the religious purification of the country and the creation of an emirate.

Fuelled by religious fervour, widespread hatred of the warlords and substantial support from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, the Taliban swept to power in 1996 after a series of stunning conquests of provincial capitals that took the world by surprise, just as the movement has done in recent weeks. Baradar, Mullah Omar’s deputy who was widely believed to be a highly effective strategist, was a key architect of those victories.

Baradar played a succession of military and administrative roles in the five-year Taliban regime, and by the time it was ousted by the US and its Afghan allies, he was deputy minister of defence.

During the Taliban’s 20-year exile, Baradar had the reputation of being a potent military leader and a subtle political operator. Western diplomats came to view him as on the wing of the Quetta Shura – the Taliban’s regrouped leadership in exile – that was most resistant to ISI control, and most amenable to political contacts with Kabul.

The Obama administration, however, was more fearful of his military expertise than it was hopeful about his supposedly moderate leanings. The CIA tracked him down to Karachi in 2010 and in February of that year persuaded ISI to arrest him.

“The capture of Baradar was predominantly instigated because of his role in the war rather than because of the likelihood that he was going to suddenly make peace,” a former official said. “The fact is, the Pakistanis held on to him all those years in large part because the United States asked them to.”

In 2018, however, Washington’s attitude changed and Donald Trump’s Afghan envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, asked the Pakistanis to release Baradar so he could lead negotiations in Qatar, based on the belief that he would settle for a power-sharing arrangement. “I had never seen any real substantiation of that point, but it just took on a kind of mythic idea,” the former official said.

Baradar signed the Doha agreement with the US in February 2020, in what the Trump administration hailed as a breakthrough towards peace but which now appears a mere staging post towards total Taliban victory.

The US and Taliban agreement not to fight each other was supposed to be followed by power-sharing talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government of Ashraf Ghani. Those talks stumbled along with little progress, and it is clear now that Baradar and the Taliban were playing for time, waiting for the Americans to leave and preparing a final offensive. Baradar’s life has taught him patience and confidence in ultimate victory.
