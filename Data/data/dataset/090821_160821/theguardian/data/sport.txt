Even Lionel Messi seemed wowed by the power of Paris Saint-Germain’s new strikeforce, as he described the prospect of combining with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé as “madness”. In scenes very different to his tearful adieu to Barcelona three days earlier, the Argentinian was unveiled by his new club at a press conference at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday while a large and giddy crowd gathered outside to sing hymns of praise.

“The reception from the people of Paris has been amazing, I will try to live up to your expectations,” said Messi, who felt “incredible happiness” at joining a team that he believes can help him win his fifth Champions League and his first since 2015. Asked, in particular, about playing with Neymar and Mbappé, he replied: “It’s madness to be able to work with such great players on a daily basis,” adding that his admiration was not confined to those new teammates, since Sergio Ramos, Georginio Wijnaldum, Achraf Hakimi and Gianluigi Donnarumma have also joined this summer.

“PSG have made spectacular signings on top of the players that were already here,” Messi said. “I’m eager to get playing and I’m going to be doing it alongside some of the best players in the world. It’s going to be a marvellous experience every day. I hope I can continue to win titles. I have the same hunger as when I was younger.”

He said he was not sure when he would be ready to play, explaining: “I have been inactive for the last month so I basically have to do a pre-season by myself.”

PSG’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, said that Messi’s arrival should help convince Mbappé to pledge his future to the club. The Frenchman has resisted attempts to secure him to a new contract, with his deal expiring next year. Khelaifi said he expected Mbappé to stay because “now he has no excuse to do anything else”.

Khelaifi also said Messi’s arrival would generate enormous revenue for PSG, suggesting those benefits would help the club to comply with financial fair play regulations. Asked specifically how the club that already offers huge salaries could afford to hire Messi on an annual wage of nearly £30m for at least the next two years, Khelaifi thanked the journalist for asking “a very great question” before replying: “We have always followed FFP regulations from day one and we always will. Before doing anything strategically we look with our commercial, financial and legal people.

“We said if we have the capacity to sign him, we will do it. If not, we’re not going to sign him. What Leo is bringing to the club is huge and what the media have to focus on is not only the negative side but also there are a lot of positives Leo is bringing in terms of the commercial and social media. He’s a big asset for the club. It’s been an unbelievable three days [since reports of Messi’s arrival emerged]. If we give you some numbers, you are going to be shocked.” He added with a chuckle: “I hope Leo will not ask for more salary now … but we will always follow FFP regulations.”

Khelaifi said PSG’s aim was to win “every match and every trophy … but we have won nothing yet; now is the time to work, work, work. To win trophies you have to have a winning mentality and discipline.” On a day when superlatives were not always deployed with rigour, Khelaifi hailed PSG’s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, as “the best coach in the world”.

Messi admitted that Pochettino was a factor in luring him to Paris. “The fact we are both Argentinian helped,” he said. “I’ve known him for a long time and we have always got on well. As soon as I heard the move was possible, I spoke to him right away.”

He also expressed excitement about playing with Marco Verratti, saying he had been hoping for years that Barcelona would sign him. In an observation that must have provoked grimaces at the Camp Nou, Messi said: “We wanted to have him for a long time and now it’s the opposite – I have come here to play with him. He is a phenomenon. The players here are the best in their positions in the world.” Then he added what may be the biggest understatement in football history: “I’ve come to add my two pennies’-worth.”

Messi to PSG: the inside story | Barça left with gaping wound
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lionel Messi has pledged to “help build something special” at Paris Saint-Germain after completing his move and signing a two-year contract on Tuesday.

The 34-year-old who bade an emotional farewell to Barcelona after a trophy-laden 21 years at the club will be paraded in Paris on Wednesday with the Argentinian ready to start a new chapter in his remarkable football story. After signing a two-year deal with a option of another 12 months, Messi said: “I am excited to begin a new chapter of my career at Paris Saint-Germain. The club and its vision are in perfect harmony with my ambitions.

“I know how talented the squad and the coaching staff are here. I am determined to help build something special for the club and the fans, and I am looking forward to stepping out on to the pitch at the Parc des Princes.”

Messi, who will wear the No 30 shirt in Paris, will earn a net salary of around €35m (£29.6m) with bonuses factored in. He flew in from Barcelona and was greeted by a PSG tweet that confirmed he was joining and welcomed a “new diamond in Paris”. Messi waved to crowds of celebrating fans from a window at Le Bourget airport, north of the capital. He had boarded the plane in one T-shirt and emerged at the window in another, with the club’s trademark “Ici c’est Paris” on the front.

Messi, his lawyers and his father, Jorge, had been in talks with PSG since Thursday, when the player’s plan to stay at Barcelona collapsed because of the club’s financial situation. Messi had agreed a five-year contract with Barcelona worth about €20m a season.

Jorge Messi had confirmed to the Spanish television station La Sexta at Barcelona airport that his son would sign for PSG on Tuesday and was asked whose fault it was that his son was leaving the Camp Nou. “Ask at the club,” he replied. A press conference and presentation is planned for 11am Paris time on Wednesday.

The move enables Messi to link up again with Neymar, a former Barcelona teammate who has been working to convince the Argentinian to join him in Paris, and gives PSG attacking options of Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and Ángel di María.

On Tuesday Neymar posted “Back together” on Instagram above a montage of his and Messi’s best goals and assists from their time together at Barcelona. Messi wept on Sunday at a farewell Barcelona press conference at which he said he had wanted to stay at the club where he has spent his whole career. On Tuesday images of Messi on the Camp Nou facade were taken down.

The PSG chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: “I am delighted that Lionel Messi has chosen to join Paris Saint-Germain and we are proud to welcome him and his family to Paris. He has made no secret of his desire to continue competing at the very highest level and winning trophies and naturally our ambition as a club is to do the same.

“The addition of Leo to our world-class squad continues a very strategic and successful transfer window for the club. Led by our outstanding coach and his staff, I look forward to the team making history together for our fans all around the world.”

For PSG, beaten into second place in Ligue 1 by Lille last season and knocked out of the Champions League in the semi-finals by Manchester City, the signing is a major coup.

Mauricio Pochettino, who has spoken to Messi as part of the process, has already had his squad bolstered by the signings of Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, Sergio Ramos and Georginio Wijnaldum. The goalkeeper, Donnarumma, told Sky Italia regarding Messi: “He is the best player in the world. I am excited and happy at the thought of having him in the team.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Barcelona striker Sergio Agüero has been ruled out of action for 10 weeks, the club said on Monday, deepening their troubles after Lionel Messi’s shock departure.

Agüero, a close friend of Messi and his international teammate with Argentina, joined Barça as a free agent in June after 10 years with Manchester City.

Barça said the 33-year-old had injured a tendon in his right calf and would be out for about 10 weeks, meaning he will not make his debut until 17 October at the earliest, when Barcelona host Valencia in La Liga.

Agüero’s problem comes after a final season with City blighted by injuries, limiting him to seven Premier League starts.

Ronald Koeman is now short of striking options for Barcelona’s opening league game against Real Sociedad on Sunday, with Martin Braithwaite, Antoine Griezmann and Memphis Depay his only available forwards.

Messi is reportedly finalising a move to Paris Saint-Germain after his teary farewell from Barcelona, who could not afford to sign him on a new contract.

While supporters of the French champions gathered outside the Parc des Princes on Monday were disappointed to hear reports that the 34-year-old’s move had been delayed 24 hours, one Barça member filed complaints with a French court and with the European Commission to try to block any move to sign Messi.

There were no signs of movement around Messi’s house in the hills of the wealthy Barcelona district of Castelldefels where fans waited to catch a glimpse of him.

“I feel devastated,” said Cristian Garcia, wearing a Barça shirt with Messi’s name and No 10 on the back.

“To see a player that I have always followed, who is an example for me, to see him leave now brings me a lot of pain.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@England head into Thursday’s second Test against India here under a cloud after Stuart Broad was ruled out for the remainder of the season and Jimmy Anderson emerged as a major doubt with a thigh injury.

Broad underwent a scan after pulling up in training on Tuesday and the upshot is a tear to his right calf muscle that will require around two months rehabilitation. The 35-year‑old will now set his sights on returning for the Ashes series in Australia.

The news came on the day that Anderson, his long-time new-ball partner, reported soreness in his left quad muscle and is now awaiting scan results himself. Saqib Mahmood, his uncapped Lancashire teammate, has been added to England’s squad in response, and a new-look attack awaits.

With Ben Stokes taking a break for mental-health reasons, Jofra Archer out for the rest of the year and Chris Woakes not yet fit after a bruised heel, the problems continue to mount for captain Joe Root and Chris Silverwood, the head coach, even if the series remains locked at 0-0 after last Sunday’s draw in Nottingham.

“I don’t think it’s too much of a destabiliser to be honest,” said Jonny Bairstow. “With the nature of professional sport there is going to be injuries at times, there is going to be illness. It can happen overnight and you’ve got to be adaptable within the group. That’s what we have been.

“It would be a big loss, naturally because [Broad and Anderson] have got more than 1,000 Test wickets between them. But with that comes an opportunity for other people. When we’ve seen that previously in the summer, in the Pakistan ODI series, opportunities arose for other people and they rose to those challenges.”

Ollie Robinson looks set to take the new ball in his third Test, with Mark Wood expected to add pace to the lineup. Moeen Ali was already down to play as a spin-bowling all-rounder at No7, with Sam Curran at No 8. If Anderson misses out, either Mahmood will make his debut or Craig Overton will return.

There could be as many as four changes to England’s lineup when they walk out to a sell-out crowd, with Nottinghamshire’s Haseeb Hameed being considered for a recall in place of either Zak Crawley or Dom Sibley in the top three.

India are expected to recall Ravichandran Ashwin after the all-rounder Shardul Thakur suffered a hamstring injury, with Virat Kohli stressing that picking an attack to take 20 wickets will take precedence over bolstering their batting lineup.

India’s captain welcomed the return of Moeen to England’s ranks, the pair having struck up a strong rapport during their time playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League.

He said: “Moeen is a good friend of mine, we’ve got to know each other very well over the years. He’s obviously a very talented cricketer, brings consistency with the ball. As a middle-order or lower-order batsman especially in Test cricket, he can change the momentum of the game with the bat.

“We are wary of his skills. He’s in great form right now, he’s batting really well and with the ball he is always someone that the team has banked on, so we will have to be at our best going up against Moeen.

“He’s a great guy. Whenever we take the field, with skills we compete but it’s always mutual respect and a really nice environment when he’s playing on the field, whether it’s with or against he’s always been a pleasure to share the field with.”

The players will need to pick up their heels in the field, with both teams docked two World Test Championship points and 40% of their match fees after a slow over-rate at Trent Bridge.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@India are notoriously slow starters in Test series and when the first ball was bowled at Trent Bridge it was easy to assume this would again be the case. Most of the players may have been in the UK since the start of June but they have seen very little action since the World Test Championship final – some travelled, some took breaks from the grind in parks and restaurants and football matches – and with only one practice game, they should have been rusty. Except, they were switched on.

England were even more underprepared than the visiting team and it showed. What was especially critical was the clarity of one team when it came to selection and balance, compared to the other, and India came out comfortably on top.

To leave out Ravichandran Ashwin, arguably the best spinner in the world, after he had shown glimpses of beautiful bowling in the final of the World Test Championship, and then similar rhythm turning out for Surrey while his mates were posting photos in cafes and parks as they chilled out, was a big call.

But the captain, Virat Kohli, and Ravi Shastri, the head coach, were not thinking about one player. Rather they were plotting how to win the first Test at a ground where seamers of all kinds are always in business.

Enter Ravindra Jadeja. Before he played for India, Jadeja had two first-class triple-centuries to his name. For this reason alone, expectations of his batting were sky high and he was often ridiculed when he did not come good. But on Indian pitches his bowling was deadly. He got through overs in lightning quick time and when he was not blasting batsmen out with lethal straight balls he was bowling dry overs, giving nothing away. Add his fielding and there was a strong case for his name being the first on the team sheet.

In his home state of Gujarat, in his city of Rajkot, this was an unusual specimen. Playing on pitches that were either rank turners or complete roads, based on the kind of result his team needed, Jadeja evolved into a player who could be all things for all people.

Jadeja grew up poor, in a one-room home – his mother was a nurse and his father a security guard. His mother, a pillar of strength, died in a kitchen accident in 2005. But, while he grew up in poverty, there was clearly no shortage of pride. Jadeja is a Rajput by birth. Rajput literally means son of a king and they are believed to be descendants of warriors, which is why he celebrates batting milestones with the rapier celebration using his bat.

As a kid he was always scrawny, although as he grew there was the realisation that he was actually sinewy, muscular and powerful. Jadeja played the first Test as the premier all-rounder in the India team, not as the lone spinner, or as the person who kept Ashwin out. And, when the final day’s play was rained off, the way the match was set up, the position India were in, it would be fair to say the aggressive selection gambit from the think tank had paid off.

What this did was put down a marker. When the action moves to Lord’s, India will know that they have a combination that works.

And, to help matters, they have Ashwin in reserve. With the slope at Lord’s and the possibility of better weather and a pitch that has a tendency to flatten out, India can think about bringing Ashwin into play. Most critically, England’s reliance on Joe Root means that Ashwin will have earned his wages even if he just dismisses the opposition captain early. In most series he has played, Ashwin has targeted the best batsman, coming up with specific plans, keeping secondary plans under his belt and generally working them over, and making life as difficult as possible out in the middle.

If India do make a change – and predicting what combination Kohli will pick is generally a fool’s errand – Shardul Thakur could make way for Ashwin. Any which way, it is difficult to see Jadeja being left out, even if he failed to pick up a single wicket in Nottingham.

The quick turnaround between Tests will also favour India, who are looking to keep the pressure on England. In the course of a five-Test series, the shock and awe of one outstanding performance or a collapse in one bad session rarely separates the teams. The better team will prevail, weather permitting, and man for man India have the edge.

One of the reasons India have struggled in England in the past is overcoming the challenge of getting the balance of the playing XI right. India have not had a seam-bowling all-rounder who could do the job consistently and this often meant they went into battle with the premier fast bowlers having to do too much, or one batsman light.

The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.

In their latest iteration, India are attempting to remedy this by playing Jadeja as a batting all-rounder. And he should know a thing or two about balance. After all, when he is not playing cricket and is back home, Jadeja spends his time astride Ganga or Kesar, his horses, with not a saddle or stirrup in sight.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It was 10pm in Barcelona on Thursday when Paris Saint-Germain made their move for Lionel Messi. The stunning news had broken two hours earlier that the forward would not be staying at the Camp Nou and the way PSG went about their business showed how determined they were to get their man.

In transfers approaches are regularly made via intermediaries or agents, and clubs hoping to tempt Messi from Barcelona had often gone down this route. But PSG calculated this was a moment for the personal touch and, seeing an unexpected opening, they pounced.

The sporting director, Leonardo, made a direct approach to Messi’s father, Jorge, and the player’s lawyers – and the president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, joined the talks later that night. It is rare for Khelaifi to get involved but he did so with Neymar’s transfer from Barcelona four years ago and his presence here confirmed the move’s scale and the seriousness of PSG’s push.

On Thursday morning such a turn of events had seemed impossible. Messi and his father had travelled back to Barcelona from Ibiza for the player to sign a five-year contract to stay at the Camp Nou. An announcement was planned for 8pm and the details were clear: two years’ salary paid over five years to help the financially troubled club.

Messi was stunned and distraught when Barcelona’s president, Joan Laporta, said La Liga’s rules on salary limits meant the club had no way to register him. But his father quickly stressed to him the need to find a solution and both were impressed that two of the most important people at PSG came straight to them. Messi also spoke to the manager, Mauricio Pochettino.

Talks involving Khelaifi, Leonardo, Jorge Messi and the player’s lawyers went late into Thursday night and continued all through Friday. The Messi camp were excited by the project presented to them and accepted the wage proposal of about €35m (£29.6m) net, including bonuses, on a two-year contract with an option for a further season. Negotiations on issues such as taxes and sponsors took much of the time. The need to factor in financial fair play rules was discussed but PSG were always confident on that front. Messi’s deal, like Neymar’s, has a clause that guarantees him a bonus if PSG win the Champions League.

On Saturday a verbal agreement was reached and PSG prepared a formal contract with their legal team. This was sent to Messi at 10am on Sunday, not long before his tearful farewell press conference at Barcelona. Although Messi denied there that a deal with PSG was done, in reality it was all but sorted.

Messi’s lawyers wanted two days to check every detail and rumours that the player was flying to Paris were at that stage false. By Monday night, though, everything was in place and final agreement was confirmed at about 10am on Tuesday morning. A short while later Messi and his family set off for Barcelona airport.

In the PSG dressing room celebrations at Messi joining had started as early as Friday. That was because Neymar had confidently told the squad his former Barcelona teammate would be coming. From Thursday night Neymar had acted almost like a member of the PSG board, calling and messaging Messi and pushing him to make the move.

Messi was certainly tempted by the opportunity to play again with his good friend but there is no question Barcelona had been his first choice. In the last week of April Messi had, through his father, turned down an approach from PSG, determined to stay at the only club he has really known.

The previous month Manchester City had made an approach via Pep Guardiola and club executives who also have a background at Barcelona. Messi had given the same response: he was continuing at the Camp Nou.

The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.

This time City have not made a move for Messi. Guardiola is happy with Jack Grealish as the new No 10 and is looking at Tottenham’s Harry Kane as his priority if one more big attacking signing can be made. With Chelsea focused on getting Romelu Lukaku from Internazionale they too stayed away from talks with Messi.

Less than a week ago PSG had no chance of signing Messi. But it often pays to expect the unexpected when it comes to transfers and so a seemingly impossible deal has been done.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Guardian writers’ predicted position: 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)

Last season’s position: 15th

Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 500-1

The plan

The unhelpful will-he-won’t-he saga has been resolved but for Southampton everything seemingly hinges now on how effectively they replace Danny Ings, sold little more than a week before an opening-day trip to Everton. A poor second half to last season, following premature chatter about qualifying for Europe after the team briefly topped the league, quickly turned to relegation concern and – given Ralph Hasenhüttl has stressed they cannot afford to head into this season so underpowered – whether Adam Armstrong and Armando Broja adequately fill the void left by their talisman will surely define their fate.

Aston Villa, whom the striker has joined, are adamant they can be stronger in the post-Grealish era and Southampton must reinvest the guaranteed £25m, add-ons could follow, to spruce up a thin squad exposed by injuries to key players last season, including Ings, Kyle Walker-Peters and Oriol Romeu. Signing a goalscorer is crucial – after Ings’s return to Southampton three years ago he scored 41 league goals in 91 games and finished the team’s top scorer in each season – and they may yet need to replace the defender Jannik Vestergaard, another player into the final year of his contract who is attracting interest.

There were magical moments last season – victory against Liverpool, a stirring comeback at home against Burnley and an efficient run to the semi-finals of the FA Cup – but one win in 11 matches after Christmas paved the way for a worrying finish. A safety-first approach is not Hasenhuttl’s style but too often Southampton have displayed a frailty that prevents them from killing off teams.

They are fuelled by their captain, James Ward-Prowse, a versatile midfielder with bottomless energy levels who did not miss a league minute last season and could count himself unfortunate not to rack up a few more with England at Euro 2020. His set pieces are always on the money but his work ethic coupled with his evolution into a more aggressive presence and an attacking threat under Hasenhüttl have made him an invaluable piece of the jigsaw, one they firmly intend to keep after rejecting a £25m bid from Villa.

Romain Perraud has been signed for £10m from Brest, where he played with the midfielder Ibrahima Diallo, and is a like-for-like replacement for the left-back Ryan Bertrand, whose seven-year stay had run its course. Southampton beat Brighton to the signing of the highly rated Chelsea full-back Tino Livramento, adding depth to a key area, and Saints regard his arrival a significant coup. The loan arrival of Broja, another teenage Chelsea prospect, who spent last season at Vitesse, will supplement their attack.

Theo Walcott has returned on a permanent deal but the fringes of the squad still feel stale despite the club offloading the high-earners Mario Lemina and Wesley Hoedt, taking a significant hit on both, as well as the third-choice goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Meanwhile the centre-back Dynel Simeu has re-signed from Chelsea, joining the club’s B team after rejecting a new contract at Stamford Bridge.

Southampton have some talented individuals but, as they were reminded last season, it is a squad game. Diallo impressed in midfield and will get more opportunities this campaign, and there is more to come from Moussa Djenepo, whose progress has been stop-start through injury, with Hasenhüttl suggesting the Mali winger could operate from left-back. There are high hopes for Nathan Tella – Hasenhüttl said the aim for the academy must be to feed the first team with at least one breakout player each season – and Mohamed Elyounoussi will be given a chance to stake his claim after returning from a fruitful loan at Celtic.

Another conundrum for Hasenhüttl is whether to hand Alex McCarthy or Fraser Forster the No 1 jersey. Southampton are keen to strengthen the spine, with a centre-back and a No 6 high on the manager’s wishlist. Only the relegated West Brom conceded more top-flight goals last season and Hasenhüttl knows they must improve the goals-against column if they are to be taken seriously. “The way we defended in and around our box is far away from a top Premier League club,” he said in May. “If we don’t change this in the future, we will always struggle when we want to speak about the top-10 positions.”

The manager

A navy waistcoat, a white mandarin-collar shirt and blue chequered tartan trousers seemingly fit with a wallet chain that would look at home in Ian Poulter’s wardrobe. Ralph Hasenhüttl’s eccentric get-up for Southampton’s first pre-season friendly was indicative of his exuberant touchline persona. The Austrian, who signed a new four-year contract last summer, is a demanding coach and his fingerprints are all over this high-pressing Southampton team. He guided RB Leipzig into the Champions League but erratic streaks have prevented him from returning Saints to the Europa League. He enjoys playing the piano – and has been known to do a rendition of Elton John or Queen on away trips – and is fond of the odd analogy, too. “I hope Che Adams is like a ketchup bottle,” he said of the striker finding the golden touch in front of goal. “Nothing at first and then a load at once.”

Key player

The softly spoken Stuart Armstrong is an unsung performer and his creativity will be key if Southampton are to prosper after the sale of the talisman Danny Ings. The 29-year-old Armstrong joined from Celtic three years ago, when Mark Hughes was in charge, but now embodies everything about Hasenhüttl’s side. He is graceful in possession but a selfless operator, whether hurtling towards goal or extinguishing danger. He did not have an agent until the age of 21, steers clear of social media and before breaking through at Dundee United he enrolled on an Open University law degree.

The owner

Gao Jisheng has been a near-invisible presence since purchasing an 80% share of the club four years ago and such an image has hardly helped to woo supporters. Gao believes self-sufficiency is king and has cut his cloth accordingly, making funds available if players are sold. Gao, a real-estate magnate, has detailed his London-based daughter, Nelly, and Martin Semmens, the chief executive, to run the club day to day. Southampton are never too far away from takeover whispers, with Gao thought to be open to selling. Saints denounced plans for a European Super League with a pithy statement but Hasenhüttl arguably put it best. “Nobody wants it,” he said.

Euros factor

The towering frame of Vestergaard impressed as Denmark reached the semi-finals, where they lost against England at Wembley. Stuart Armstrong and the Leicester-born Adams, given the moniker “McAdams” by his teammates, were part of the Scotland squad unable to advance from Group D. James Ward-Prowse was a surprise omission from England’s 26-man squad having impressed Gareth Southgate, but he stayed put to feature in both friendlies on the eve of the tournament. A true modern professional.

We’ll be singing

“Oh When the Saints Go Marching In” is the most familiar refrain heard in the stands but the academy graduate and now captain James Ward-Prowse – “he’s one of our own” – and the combative midfielder Oriol Romeu are at the heart of supporter chants. Southampton laid on a resounding 3-0 win against Sheffield United for 2,000 supporters in December before restrictions tightened, and treated fans to a comfortable victory against Fulham in May.

Back to St Mary’s

The good For a modern-day bowl, the ground can whip up a decent atmosphere, particularly in the Northam Stand that houses away fans.

From top to bottom, the halo above the ball is a reference to the club’s roots at St Mary’s Church, as is the nickname Saints, the red and white scarf a nod to the fans, the tree represents the nearby New Forest, with the water representing Southampton’s history as a port, from which the Mayflower and Titanic left for America. Below that is a Hampshire rose. In a 2018 April Fools’ gag the club replaced the ball with a “Saint” emoji.

The 51-year-old had surgery in Canberra for a reported aortic dissection – a tear in the body’s main artery – but was transferred to St Vincent’s hospital on Tuesday night. A spokesperson for St Vincent’s on Wednesday said Cairns was in a “serious but stable condition”.

Support for a player regarded as one of the best all-rounders of the 1990s included the former Black Caps captain Brendon McCullum, who was a young member of the squad during Cairns’s most senior days.

“It’s a difficult subject to talk about,” McCullum said on his SEN breakfast show. “We haven’t seen each other for quite a long time.”

McCullum testified against Cairns in court before the latter was found not guilty in 2015 of charges relating to alleged match-fixing.

“We’ve been reflecting on just how fine a cricketer he was when the news came through and what he did for the game and New Zealand cricket throughout his career as well.

Cairns has lived in Canberra for several years after his marriage to an Australian, Melanie Croser, in 2010. She said: “Chris’s family and friends are heartened by the respectful and warm manner in which this terrible news has been reported, and received by the public, both in New Zealand and around the world, and thanks everyone for their warm wishes, prayers and kind words.”

After retiring from international cricket, Cairns was the subject of allegations of match-fixing as captain of the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League in 2008.

He denied any wrongdoing and fought several legal battles to clear his name, winning a libel case against the former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi in 2012.

In 2015, he was cleared of perjury in London in relation to the libel case.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Given everything in football is relative, Steven Gerrard has quickly lurched towards territory marked “crisis”. Suffice to say this was not in the script amid wild title celebrations around Ibrox in May. For the first time in his Rangers tenure, Gerrard has presided over three defeats in a row. This one, which ended Rangers’ dreams of competing in the Champions League once again, was particularly ignominious, arriving against a Malmö side that was formed of only 10 men for the entire second half. Rangers had even taken an early lead through Alfredo Morelos, before the kind of bemusing capitulation that will haunt their manager. Rangers are making catastrophic errors in defence and lack punch in attack, as now punished by Malmö – twice – and Dundee United.

Malmö must celebrate pairings with Scottish opposition. A decade ago, they also defeated Rangers on Champions League qualifying business. They did likewise to Celtic in 2015. In between, they swaggered to a 7-0 win at Hibernian. The stuff of Swede dreams.

The first Scottish football crowd of roughly 50,000 for more than 500 days formed the backdrop to this fixture. Rangers rightly revelled in title success last season but a run to the last 16 of the Europa League led to wider recognition of the work undertaken by Gerrard here. More than a decade has passed since Rangers competed in the Champions League’s group phase; financial incentives and a desire to be classed once again as among Europe’s elite clubs fuelled the desire to return.

Perhaps unsurprisingly given the raucous atmosphere, the game opened at breakneck speed. Malmö forced a corner within 30 seconds but were fortunate not to find themselves behind just a minute later after Joe Aribo’s effort was deflected wide. Rangers had been slack during an attritional first leg but Steven Davis’s goal, with the last kick of the game, afforded them hope.

Morelos was to raise spirits even further. Malmö’s approach of sitting off Rangers looked curious, including because of the vulnerability within the Scottish champions’ defence. Malmö had exposed that much a week earlier. Rangers dominated much of the first half, with tangible reward coming via their Colombian striker.

Rangers were actually fortunate to win a free-kick just inside the visitors’ half after it appeared Borna Barisic was legitimately robbed of possession. The Croatian full-back fed Ryan Kent, who was left in blissful isolation to jink towards the penalty area and float a cross to the back post. Morelos miscued his header – the ball actually flew off his back – but did enough to beat Johan Dahlin. Ibrox erupted, with Malmö made to pay for their passive style.

Malmö did offer a response of sorts before the break. Antonio Colak should have done better than head wildly over the crossbar from Jo Inge Berget’s cross, before Veljko Birmancevic barely tested Allan McGregor with a low shot. Gerrard’s touchline remonstrations were telling, with the ex-Liverpool captain clearly of the view his team’s play was too frantic.

The half was to finish with a moment of controversy. Bonke Innocent, earlier booked for holding Morelos, collected a second yellow card after challenging Connor Goldson. If not the case already, momentum had firmly swung Rangers’ way. Jon Dahl Tomasson, the Malmö head coach, had complaints over Innocent’s second booking which on first view appeared legitimate.

Morelos could have edged Rangers ahead on aggregate within three minutes of the restart but shot high and wide with Dahlin out of position. Malmö were soon to punish such profligacy; and some.

Colak, a peripheral figure until this point, produced an outstanding finish after an equally impressive reverse pass from Birmancevic. McGregor, at full stretch, was rendered helpless by the Croatian.

Colak was far from done. Some appalling Rangers defending, straight from a throw in, allowed him to control the ball and cut inside both Leon Balogun and Aribo before slamming home. The 10 men celebrated wildly with their coaching staff, with good reason. Rangers found themselves in catch-up mode against a team with confidence fully restored.

Understandably, the closing stages were played in Malmö territory. Yet Tomasson’s men never looked in serious danger. For them, another memorable evening. Gerrard must scramble towards the reset button.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Welterweight champion Errol Spence Jr has been forced to withdraw from his 21 August fight against Manny Pacquiao due to a retinal tear in his left eye, organizers said on Tuesday.

Cuban Yordenis Ugas, who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, has agreed to replace Spence in the main event at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and defend his World Boxing Association welterweight belt against Pacquiao, who has won titles in eight divisions.

Spence, the World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation welterweight world champion who has a 27-0 record, learned he had a torn retina during a pre-fight medical examination by the Nevada Athletic Commission in Las Vegas on Monday.

“I was excited about the fight and the event,” Spence said in a news release. “Unfortunately, the doctors found a tear in my left eye and said I needed to get surgery on it ASAP and that there was no way I could fight with my eye in that condition.”

Spence, who has returned home to Dallas and will have surgery to repair the tear on Wednesday, is expected to make a full recovery and return to the ring.

“I ask everyone to join me in praying for a full and complete recovery for Errol Spence Jr,” said Pacquiao. “Thank God his physical examination discovered his eye condition before he suffered any further damage.”

In Pacquiao’s most recent fight, in July 2019, the Filipino southpaw beat Keith Thurman in a split decision to win his since-vacated WBA super welterweight title belt.

Ugas (26-4, 12 KOs) has established himself as an elite welterweight since returning from a layoff in 2016 and was elevated to world champion in January after winning a WBA championship belt by defeating Abel Ramos last September.

The 35-year-old Cuban said it is an honor to get a chance to fight Pacquiao and that he is ready for the challenge despite the short notice.

“I have a tremendous amount of respect for Pacquiao, but I am coming to win this fight,” said Ugas.

“I’ve been in camp working hard with my coach Ismael Salas and I know together we will come up with a masterful game plan to combat anything Manny will bring to the ring.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fans who engage in racist abuse, or other forms of discriminatory behaviour, will be banned from all Premier League grounds under measures announced ahead of the new season.

Supporters are set for a full return to stadiums this weekend, as the English top flight returns. But the sentiment that “football is nothing without the fans” has been matched by a determination, led by players, to stamp out discrimination that persists both online and on the terraces.

The league confirmed that new sanctions are to be added to their “No Room for Racism” strategy, joining up punishments that were formerly administered only by individual clubs. It accompanies an increased focus on identifying abusive behaviour, both in the stands and through the league’s online discriminatory abuse reporting system.

Punishments will be accompanied by new educational efforts: matchday stewards will be trained to identify discriminatory behaviour while a video asking supporters not to boo the taking of the knee before matches this season is to be released this week. Last week the players renewed their commitment to the protest with the league “wholeheartedly supporting” the move.

The developments came as Twitter announced the results of its own analysis into the online abuse directed at England players during the Euros. The social media platform said it had removed 1,622 messages containing racist language from its platform in the 24 hours during and after the final between England and Italy. It also claimed that the greatest number of abusive messages came from the UK and that only 2% of the messages received more than 1,000 views by users.

Another claim made by Twitter was that 99% of the accounts suspended by the company for offensive content were publicly identifiable. One of the main demands from the football industry is for platforms to hold more identification information on their users, but Twitter said such figures showed “ID verification would have been unlikely to prevent the abuse from happening”. Twitter did not share information on the total number of accounts suspended, nor if any accounts were permanently removed.

The Premier League do not believe that attempts to drive racist abuse off platforms have reached an impasse and will continue to work with the social media companies over the forthcoming season.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@They were the medals that had been made for the 1940 Games, which were due to be held in Tokyo but had to be cancelled when the second world war broke out in 1939
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“There have been hard moments, many defeats, but the next day you go to training and then there’s another game, another chance,” Lionel Messi said. “Not this time; this time it’s not coming back.” And that was when reality dropped: this is it, it’s over.

There will be more moments like that in the coming months, little reminders, pangs of loss. That will include on Sunday against Real Sociedad, the first time Barcelona begin a season without him since 2005. They did not even get to say goodbye. His last game, his last goal, number 672, came in front of barely 200 people.

After 18 months, 29,803 supporters will be allowed back into the Camp Nou but it will feel empty on Sunday and beyond. There will be Messi shirts, Messi chants, but no Messi. He will be everywhere but on the pitch. After 17 seasons, he has departed early, taking part of Spanish football with him. How do you calculate what that means, the void it leaves, his legacy? Twenty-one years he has been at the club, Charly Rexach signing a “contract” on a napkin because losing him would be something they would “regret for the rest of our lives”. There is regret now, too: it became his club, one he didn’t want to walk away from. Not this summer, anyway.

This is his life, Messi said. It is many others’ lives too, a generation of fans who haven’t known anything else and others who can hardly imagine it any more. When Messi got the goal that meant he had scored more times for a single team than anyone else ever, the assist was provided by Pedri González. The day Messi made his first-team debut in a friendly against Porto, Pedri hadn’t celebrated his first birthday.

For so long Messi was Barcelona, even with the talent alongside him: Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Ronaldinho and the rest. “I’ve never seen a player like him and never will,” Pep Guardiola once said. There was a flash of fear when he last collected the Ballon d’Or and admitted time was running out, but this may be worse. Retirement, described as the first of a sportsperson’s two deaths, can at least be reached at the right moment the right way. This feels like something broke.

It can be overplayed, inconvenient truths conveniently airbrushed, but it did matter that he looked set to stay loyal to the last, remaining at the club he joined aged 13. Morality tales are a trap too easily fallen into, talk of purity best avoided, and there is a risk of laying it all on too thick. Yet you needn’t be a Barcelona supporter to see Messi in a Paris Saint-Germain shirt and for it to feel weird. Wrong, even. If only because of how long it has been, how deep the impression, the sense that he has always been here, always been the best.

On Sunday night, Barcelona played the pre-season Gamper Trophy against Juventus, on the day Messi tearfully announced his departure. In the 10th minute, the few fans there sang his name, a trend likely to continue. The day he announced his arrival was the Gamper Trophy against Juventus too. That night, Fabio Capello sidled over to Frank Rijkaard, the Barcelona manager, and asked him to loan them “that little devil”. That was 16 years ago, the devil fast becoming a deity, a superman.

Sure, there are debates, but there’s a case to be made for saying that Messi has been the best footballer around for almost 15 years. Not three or four, or even seven or eight: fifteen. In the beginning Johan Cruyff said he would probably win five, six or seven Ballon d’Ors, which seemed absurd then but not now. There are 10 years between his first and his most recent and that may soon be 12. Before winning it in 2009, he was twice on the podium. And it’s not just that he has been perhaps the best across 15 years but in each of those years, almost from the start of his career to its end.

Back then Ronaldinho introduced him as the kid who was “better than me”, which seemed impossible too but it happened. He has been Spain’s player of the year in eight of the past 13 years on these pages, despite – sorry about this – a tendency to seek less obvious candidates and new stories which is not limited to here. Even the handing of the award to Luis Suárez last year and Karim Benzema the year before carried an apologetic preface admitting: “Messi is still the best.”

Widely seen as the world’s finest footballer, perhaps ever, Messi may still be underrated, stupid though that sounds. He has had many victims, including himself. His “bad” seasons are mostly brilliant, the only man held to his standards. A question asked by the ESPN presenter Dan Thomas during one Ballon d’Or debate sticks in the mind: if this was his first season would you vote for him?

01:33 'I wanted to stay more than anything': Lionel Messi tearful at Barcelona exit – video

He has scored 672 goals and registered 306 assists at Barcelona, but then you know that, which is part of the problem: he made the ridiculous routine, no longer news. If Messi had done that, we’d hear about it endlessly, is the line when a less known player does something incredible. No, we wouldn’t, because it became normalised and soon repeated. “Messi is Maradona every day,” Jorge Valdano likes to say, and even Maradona wasn’t that. He has scored more than 20 league goals 13 seasons in a row. Testimony to effort as well as inspiration, the consistency is as absurd as the quality.

Only it’s not. Nor is what Messi did always quantifiable. A colleague likes to say that when the Argentinian retires, we may as well do the same, although it might finally liberate, no longer embarked upon an impossible mission to find adequate words, a recurring nightmare where you’re looking at dull, battered keys and thinking: so, now what? Asked about Messi after one game, Joaquín Sánchez just laughed: “I don’t even know what to say any more.” Guardiola once said: “Don’t try to explain Messi, don’t try to write about him, watch him.” It was good advice, or it would be if the beauty, the brilliance, didn’t bring joy and inspire too.

There is so much to see, even if you didn’t always believe it. It has not been about the numbers; it has been the moments, a highlights reel that could occupy the whole evening, a goals tape to take you into next week, and various phases of Messi, an evolution of excellence. You could list the best, most iconic images – that hat-trick in the clásico aged 19; the Maradona goal, the first he would dedicate to El Diego but not the last; Athletic Bilbao in the Cup final; the Bernabéu run, criminally lost amid all the noise surrounding that semi-final – but someone else would come up with four more and they wouldn’t be wrong.

In terms of technical perfection, there may be no display like the 5-0 against Madrid in which he didn’t score. Only, there are probably plenty. The point really is that they wouldn’t even need to name the goals or the iconography, shirt in hand at the north end of the Bernabéu, say. Some moments are personal, seemingly inconsequential but there to be clung to; everyone has their own, chosen from so many. There is the anticipation before every match, realised with ludicrous frequency and yet with the capacity to surprise intact.

There’s the touch, the ball treated gently. The vision, seeing the pass no one else can. Playing the pass everyone else can, but doing it so well it can’t be stopped. The way he doesn’t so much kick the ball as watch it dash alongside him like a faithful, enthusiastic puppy. Everything really. The shock, the silliness. The bloodyhelldidyouseethat? And we did, over and over. There is a sense of achievement that will grow with the years in just having been there the day that Messi did that, a desperation almost to be part of it in some tiny way.

Nor is it just us, the supporters. At the end of this year’s Copa del Rey final, one by one, Barcelona’s players lined up, queueing for a photo, not with the trophy but their captain. Which may just be the most eloquent comment of all. There have been neat words, lots of extraterrestrial talk and grand eulogy – Jorge Sampaoli saying that comparing any other player to him is like putting a normal cop alongside Batman stands out – but it’s those more spontaneous, speechless moments that best measure the impact, the significance, the superiority, the sense that this is his era which is coming to an end.

Think Guardiola cracking up with that nutmeg on James Milner. Samuel Eto’o’s head in his hands when Messi scored against Getafe. Or fans at the Benito Villamarín cheering him and chanting his name. The Betis fans, that is – as if honoured to be beaten by him, to have shared another stupidly good moment, even if they suffered it. In some way he belonged to all of them, not just Barcelona. For Real Oviedo fans, to take one not entirely random example, it is a source of regret, of having missed out on an entire epoch, that he never set foot in the Tartiere.

When Lionel Messi scored a late winner at the Metropolitano on the eve of winning his sixth Ballón d’Or, approaching the Atlético Madrid area like Luke Skywalker flying into the trenches on the Death Star, Diego Simeone followed the move from the touchline. Urging his players to stop Messi but knowing deep down that they couldn’t, he said that he had been gripped by a feeling of inevitability. “All you can do is applaud,” he said and so, like so many others before but too few since, he did.

The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.

Soon, there was silence and now as the fans return at last Messi will not. After all that was shared all the way across the country for so long, now he goes alone, leaving them all behind, without the ending his story should have had. “I wouldn’t have imagined my departure this way,” he said. “I would have liked it to be with people there, to have heard one last ovation, felt that affection, celebrated a goal together. I missed them over this year and a half and I go having not seen them. If I had imagined leaving it would have been with a full stadium, saying goodbye the right way.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Guardian writers’ predicted position: 19th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul MacInnes’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)

Last season’s position: 1st in the Championship

Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 1,000-1

The plan

It was pretty bad for Norwich the last time they were in the top flight. Two seasons ago the trajectory went from unexpected victory against the champions in September to “bottom of the league but playing some nice stuff” by Christmas and laughing stock by May, when the Canaries lost their final 10 matches to become the first team to be relegated from the Premier League five times. It goes without saying that to avoid relegation this time would be a significant improvement.

Daniel Farke has said that if he were to receive an offer of 17th position at the end of the season – a copper-bottomed guarantee – he would not accept it, preferring instead to aim higher. Presumably he hasn’t actually met that particular genie, but his response still seems a touch punchy. Norwich were humiliated two years ago. This summer they lost their best player, Emi Buendía. The club are operating on one of the smallest budgets in the division and have been hit by a pre-season Covid outbreak: 17th would be a triumph.

Staying up is not an impossibility. Norwich return as Championship champions, as they did in 2019, but with a very different season behind them. They finished with 97 points, three points more than in 2019. They scored 18 fewer goals (75 down from 93), but conceded 21 fewer (36 down from 57) and kept 18 clean sheets in 46 games (up from 13 in 2019). Signs of a defensive improvement are backed up by more advanced statistics that show Norwich played from a deeper defensive line in their second title win and were more effective in counter-pressing. These analytical observations were backed up by the eye test.

When Norwich were relegated in 2020 the club accepted they had to, if not change their possession-based style, then reinforce it. More athleticism was needed, more height, greater experience. Ben Gibson exemplified the switch, with the defender joining on loan from Burnley. He brought greater strength and aerial power to the backline but also offered progression with the ball and a sharp range of passing, both very Norwich traits. Gibson made his loan permanent this summer, as did Dimitris Giannoulis, a composed, defensively sound Greece left-back who still offers the attacking threat from wide so crucial to Farke’s preferred approach.

Those two have been joined by a raft of other signings, again a distinct difference from two years ago. First through the door was Angus Gunn, son of the club legend Bryan, returning on a permanent deal to Carrow Road, where he spent a successful year on loan in 2017-18. The Kosovan right-sided forward Milot Rashica was picked up for about £8m from Werder Bremen, a contender to take Buendía’s place, but a different, more direct attacking outlet. Pierre Lees-Melou joined from Nice for £5m, providing greater height and defensive ability in midfield. Billy Gilmour, the Chelsea youngster, joins after announcing himself on the international stage for Scotland.

Another name was in the door this week: the US international striker Josh Sargent also joined from Bremen, and the Greek prodigy Christos Tzolis is set to follow from Giannoulis’s former side PAOK. Norwich’s sporting director, Stuart Webber, has said he sent Farke “to war without a gun” last time, with a gross spend of £7m. This time it’s more than £35m already.

Norwich will still try to play their way through teams, like the “Manchester City of the Championship”, as Luton’s manager, Nathan Jones, described them. But this time they are likely to do it with fewer passes and at greater pace. They will also hope to be more resolute. The challenge of staying in the division is a very real one, Norwich hope to show they have learned from what has gone before.

The manager

Farke signed a new four-year contract this summer, which shows not just how highly he is regarded by the club but what kind of man he is. The German says he will not break an agreement and is therefore prepared to spend eight years of his career in Norfolk, despite his growing reputation. At Norwich he is working at a club increasingly shaped in his image. His technical style of play is replicated throughout the age groups, his values of honesty, hard work and respect are reflected by the club. In claiming the second of his Championship titles last season he showed the ability to adapt those principles, with the team more defensively robust than in 2018-19. To achieve his next target of making Norwich an established top-flight side, he will probably have to adapt again.

Key player

Grant Hanley. The Scotland international and club captain was pipped by Buendía to the player of the year award last season. After a year of defensive obduracy language such as “granite”, “girder” and “big forehead” is often used to describe him, but Hanley is intelligent, comfortable on the ball and one of the fastest players at the club. Most of all he represents Farke’s commitment to continual improvement and has a mental resilience that his teammates would be well served by imitating.

The owner

Bizarrely there is still an element of the Norwich fanbase which likes to take shots at Delia Smith, the sort who would rather have money than values. By the standards of Premier League owners, Smith is something of a pauper, but her achievements exceed those of many a dodgy sugar daddy. Five of the past 10 seasons have been spent in the top flight and last season the club achieved the biggest points total in their history playing scintillating football and staying within their financial means. She’s a legend.

Euros factor

Hanley played well for Scotland before an injury against Croatia. Tim Krul did not feature for the Netherlands. Teemu Pukki, meanwhile, played every game for Finland. He did not have a sniff of a goal, however, and the few chances that came to him were squandered. The striker, as much a talisman for country as club, had been rushed back from injury and the results were underwhelming, like the second half of his last Premier League season when he also played through pain. Fans will hope it is not an omen.

We’ll be singing

On the Ball City will remain the anthem and any return to the Blur-pastiching Farke Life will have to edit out references to “All the Germans” as most of the players recruited from the second tier of the Bundesliga have been sold. Norwich’s Project Restart was a dismal affair and the absence of fans at Carrow Road was undoubtedly a significant factor. Supportive voices will be needed from the off and throughout this time around.

Back to Carrow Road

The good Carrow Road is a prominent sight in the city and welcomes all travellers approaching Norwich station. It remains, however, an intimate space where 27,000 supporters can make a lot of noise if they choose.

The bad The flipside of the capacity is that there remains a large demand for tickets that cannot be met. Plus the food at the concessions does not quite match up to the owners’ standards.

The crest

There is a canary on the crest. It is standing on a ball and in the background there is a castle and a lion. That’s it; that’s the logo. Simple and effective, it has stood the test of time although the eternal question as to why the canary hasn’t punctured the ball with her talons remains unanswered.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A decision is to be taken before the end of the year about the possible launch of a female British & Irish Lions touring team. A feasibility study is under way with officials insisting they would like to see a Lionesses squad take the field in the not-too-distant future.

With the next men’s tour to Australia scheduled for 2025 there remain several logistical and financial hurdles to overcome if a women’s side is to tour, say, Australia and New Zealand during the same time period. Ben Calveley, the Lions’ chief executive, said further work had to be done on its viability but that he hoped it would eventually happen.

“We have always said it’s a case of when, not if, when it comes to the women’s Lions,” he said. “It is certainly something we are looking at very, very seriously. We think women’s sport generally is riding something of a crest of a wave. We would hope to be a part of that.”

With only a handful of countries able to support professional women’s rugby, the Lionesses do not have a vast number of tour destinations and must also avoid clashing with men’s and women’s World Cups. A Barbarians women’s team played against England in 2019.

Calveley said the feasibility study, backed by the insurance company Royal London, had yet to identify a preferred option: “We wouldn’t assume, if there was to be a women’s tour, that it would have to happen at the same time as the men or at the same location.

“It could be a completely different model. We have a blank sheet of paper. We are looking into how you can make a women’s team viable, where it fits into the overall cycle, who might you play against and so on. Recommendations will be made off the back of the feasibility study that will take place over the second half of this year.”

The Lions have already revealed the men’s tour agreement for 2025 has yet to be signed off although Calveley, at this stage, does not foresee major changes to the existing rota of tour hosts. “We’re not looking to deviate from the traditional Lions model. We do a tour-by-tour deal.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Luka Dončić welcomed all his bosses with the Dallas Mavericks to his home country of Slovenia to watch the young superstar sign the richest contract in club history.

Now that the record rookie supermax extension of $207m (£194.6) is in the books, it’s back to the business of trying to win for a team that hasn’t advanced in the playoffs since winning their only championship 10 years ago.

“I’m proud of Luka,” owner Mark Cuban said Tuesday as he sat next to his point guard during a news conference in Dončić’s hometown, the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana.

“I’ve seen when he first came in, the pressure that was on him and the way he dealt with it, how hard he worked,” Cuban said. “How he recognized that it was always about the team winning and that was what was most important to him. That was always most important to me, whatever we could do to win.”

The Mavericks have the most important piece of their next title pursuit under contract through 2026-27, although that final season in a five-year deal that starts in 2022-23 is a player option.

Dončić was eligible for the massive payday because he made the All-NBA first team twice, in his second and third seasons. At 22, he is the youngest in league history with multiple first-team selections.

“I still kind of don’t know what to say because I never imagined this happening,” Dončić said. “I was only dreaming of only playing in the NBA.”

New general manager Nico Harrison made the trip along with new coach Jason Kidd. Both were hired after the firing of longtime GM Donnie Nelson in June, followed a day later by the resignation of coach Rick Carlisle.

Agent Bill Duffy acknowledged Nelson’s role in targeting Dončić when he was a teenager playing for Real Madrid, and engineering the draft night trade in 2018 that sent Dončić, the third overall pick, to Dallas while Atlanta got No 5 selection Trae Young.

Kidd, the point guard when another European star in Dirk Nowitzki led the Mavericks to the 2011 title, once again tried to explain his role in helping Dončić find postseason success for Dallas again.

“I think when you talk about Luka’s gift, he’s a special player,” Kidd said. “And for me, as a coach, it’s just to guide him. Be an extra set of eyes and ears to make the game as simple and as easy for him on the court. To give him the answers to the test so that he can do what he does at a very high level.”

Dončić put his name in the company of LeBron James with an early penchant for triple-doubles, and now sits 11th on that all-time list. The two-time All-Star has averaged 33.5 points in the playoffs with six 40-point games in two postseasons.

Both playoff trips ended in the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers, and now Dončić is fresh off leading Slovenia to their first-ever Olympics in basketball and a fourth-place finish in Toyko.

Kidd believes he can turn Dončić and Kristaps Porzingis into the European duo the Mavericks envisioned when getting the 7ft 3in Latvian in a blockbuster deal with the New York Knicks. The Mavericks also just re-signed a secondary piece in that trade, shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr, to a $75m, four-year contract.

Dallas also is bringing back fan favorite Boban Marjanovich, the 7ft 4in Serbian who has been one of the backups to Porzingis. He re-signed on Tuesday, when the club also announced the free agent addition of Sterling Brown, who played at nearby SMU.

Brown and Reggie Bullock are the two new options behind Dončić and Hardaway in the backcourt, a pair of shooting guards the Mavericks hope will help defensively.

“I think we made some great moves in free agency, but I think one of the most important things to win is the chemistry that the team has on the court,” Dončić said. “Like for example in Slovenia we had amazing chemistry, and I think that led us to winning games.”

Cuban had chemistry in mind in coming to Slovenia for the signing with his front office and Nowitzki, the 7ft German who spent all 21 of his seasons in Dallas – an NBA record – and is now a club consultant.

“Just to confirm to Luka how important he is to us and how this is just the beginning,” Cuban said. “We want him to know that we’re there for him whether it’s here in Slovenia or anywhere in the world. Part of that process is not only getting to know him, but getting to know what’s important to him and how he looks at things.”

With the money secured, it’s all about championships now for Dončić.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The biggest move of a busy NBA offseason was Russell Westbrook’s return to his native Los Angeles to join the LA Lakers franchise he grew up worshipping. As soon as the trade was announced, questions sprung up about how the ball-dominant guard would fit in alongside demanding floor general LeBron James in an offense built around maximizing the generational talent of Anthony Davis.

The nine-time All-Star from Long Beach who played college ball at UCLA said he was still eager to learn on Tuesday. “I will always stay true to who I am. But I’ll also make sure that I am able to listen and be all ears because I am coming to an unbelievable organisation and a team with players that I’m able to learn from.”

Westbrook called James one of the best to play the game and said he wanted to make life easy for the four-time champion, who led the Lakers to a championship inside the bubble two seasons ago. “I’m coming to a championship-caliber team and my job is make sure I’m able to make his game easy for him,” he said. “As it pertains to ball handling and all that, it really doesn’t matter. There are many different ways you can impact the game without having the ball in your hands.”

The 32-year-old is a uniquely gifted player. In 2017, he became the second player to average a triple-double during the regular season en route to picking up league MVP honors. He has averaged a triple-double in four seasons and is the all-time leader in the category. Last season with the Washington Wizards, he averaged 22.2 points, 11.5 rebounds and 11.7 assists per game.

The fiercely competitive Westbrook has also been criticised for his lack of post-season success, where his willingness to take on opponents by himself has sometimes put his team at a disadvantage.

Westbrook, who is entering his 14th season, said he is clear on his role and determined to help the franchise to hang its 18th championship banner at the end of next season. “It’s my job to do what I’m supposed to do and make sure we have a chance to compete for a championship,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For my money, the indelible image from the Malice in the Palace – the notorious 2004 on-court riot that pitted NBA players against spectators and changed the shape of basketball as we know it – wasn’t Ron Artest pouncing on that wide-eyed fan in the stands. Or Artest and his fellow Indiana Pacers making their off-court escape as the unruly crowd hailed down their half-consumed concessions from on high. Or even the hard foul Artest committed on the Detroit Pistons’ Ben Wallace at the end of this nationally televised Pacers blowout that kicked off the ugly affair.

No, my indelible image was Artest lying on the scorer’s table like a blasé sunbather just before a cup of beer lands on him, the Palace at Auburn Hills descends into madness and the NBA is decried as a league of thugs. But as it turns out Artest wasn’t trying to escalate the situation; he was searching for peace. How I couldn’t see that back then has a lot to do with why the Malice in the Palace came to be interpreted as the ignominious moment when the players snapped and assaulted the fans, and not the opposite.

The fresh perspective comes courtesy of a five-part Netflix docuseries that drops on Tuesday called Untold, which revisits some of the more complex sports sagas of yesteryear. The evening of 19 November 2004, a date that lives in sports infamy, was overdue for reexamination – and I say that as someone who should’ve been more skeptical. I covered that 2003-04 Pacers team as a junior “newsman” at the Associated Press and had moved on to Sports Illustrated’s engine room when the magazine put Malice at the Palace on cover, with that still of Artest about to choke out that wide-eyed spectator laid under the headline “SPORTSRAGE”. That effectively set the tone for the conversation around the riot, which had grizzled hoops observers harkening to those days in the early 1900s when the game was played inside cages and players and spectators scrapped on the regular.

With his league facing more scrutiny than ever, commissioner David Stern threw the book at the visitors. Artest was hit with an 86-game suspension, Stephen Jackson drew 30 games and Jermaine O’Neal drew 25 – which was reduced to 15 games on appeal. In addition to those nearly $12 million in lost wages and the potential for more fines for violating a Stern-imposed gag order, those Pacers had to reckon with varying levels of assault and battery charges. Five minutes into Untold, O’Neal basically says this is how people see him. And as someone who still remembers O’Neal as the Pacers measured and mature high school prodigy turned team statesman who was an automatic 20 and 10, this might’ve been the most heartbreaking moment in the episode. “I never had an opportunity to talk about it,” says O’Neal, who’s an executive producer on the episode. “Nor did I want to talk about it, to be completely honest.”

But the biggest thing that we learn as he, Artest and Wallace reconstruct that fateful night – well, besides the fact that one of the refs was none other than Tim Freakin Donaghy – is just how quickly the narrative formed around ESPN’s tunnel vision. On their cameras the players are the focus; that’s who they’re supposed to be following, after all. But directors Chapman and Maclain Way went deeper. They filed a Freedom of Information Act request and gained access to the security cameras inside the Palace. That raw footage, which many will likely be seeing for the first time, tells a much different story – one of lax security, liquored-up fans and Pacers players feeling as if they had no choice but to fight their way back to the locker room. And when the cavalry finally came, they couldn’t make heads or tails of the situation either. One cop nearly maced Reggie Miller.

As for Artest, he was perfectly cast as the instigator – a loose cannon who had been begging for time off all season to promote a rap album that Rolling Stone said, “does not suggest talent”. But underneath those bars and the bereavement time that turned into a random appearance at the Source Awards was a man crying out for help. In Untold, he explains that his lie-down on the scorer’s table was actually him trying to apply a coping mechanism from his therapist, who had encouraged him to pause and count to five before making any rash decisions. The first time Artest does this, he doesn’t seem to make it past three before Wallace starts flinging his armbands in his direction. The second time Artest lies down, the beer cup comes hurtling down. “We were conditioned to some of the crazy things that Ron did throughout the previous two years,” O’Neal says. “But what we weren’t conditioned to is the information and tools to help the brother. I’m sure all of us wish we had more information about Ron and the struggles that he had.”

In the years since the Malice at the Palace has become something of a joke, the stuff of novelty t-shirts and Disco Demolition-type fight lists. But the consequences of that fight were profound. To shake its thuggish reputation, the NBA instituted a dress code and barred rookies from entering straight out of high school. The countdown clock started on the Lunch Pail Pistons. (Interestingly, Rasheed Wallace and Larry Brown also gave interviews for Untold, but were cut for the 1h08 runtime.) The Palace was razed. Miller retired. The Pacers went from an ascendent Eastern Conference power to a non-factor. Hell, you could even argue that was the moment Indiana turned from hoops haven to Colts country.

This sense of loss comes through in another piece of rare footage that Untold unearths, of Artest (now Metta World Peace) being interviewed by a local sports crew in the aftermath of the Lakers’ 2010 championship. Here he was, at the top of the mountain, and all he could think about were the Pacers he left behind—not least O’Neal, who plummeted from the cusp of superstardom to a workaday journeyman. Since the riot, O’Neal – now a powerhouse businessman and mentor to top draft pick Cade Cunningham, Orlando Magic upstart RJ Hampton and thousands of others through his youth organization – says relations between him and Artest had been frosty.

It wasn’t until two years ago, after they had signed up for the Big3 summer league, that the old teammates wound up going to lunch to talk about everything. And even so, O’Neal found himself learning even more in the making of this Untold episode. “You have to understand, when we filmed this, we didn’t film it together,” O’Neal says. “The first time I saw his side of the story was the rough cut, OK? And it was just like, Wow, all this makes sense now.”

Untold doesn’t redeem Artest and the like or reframe the Malice at the Palace as an excusable blip in time. What the episode does do is show how easy it is to rush to judgement before all the facts have come in, and how hastily we move on without ever having the full picture.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Australian Olympic Committee has condemned the South Australian government over its “cruel and uncaring” decision to force athletes who have already quarantined in Sydney to complete an additional 14-day home quarantine on return to the state.

Sixteen athletes are due to return home to SA after returning from the Tokyo Olympics and finishing their hotel quarantine in Sydney.

The SA government has rejected AOC appeals to grant exemptions for the returning Olympians, who will isolate at their homes rather than at quarantine hotels.

In a strongly-worded statement released on Wednesday, the AOC chief executive, Matt Carroll, said the move was contrary to expert medical advice and posed a significant mental health risk.

“While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment,” Carroll said.

“They are being punished for proudly representing their country with distinction at the Olympic Games.

“We are all promoting the obvious benefits of vaccination, but this important layer of protection is not working in favour of these athletes, given this decision. By any measure, this group of returning Olympians is extremely low risk.

“Not only are our Olympians fully vaccinated, but they have also been living in a highly controlled bubble in Tokyo, taking the upmost precautions – tested daily over many weeks.”

SA Health requires people arriving from overseas who have completed their quarantine in New South Wales to apply for an exemption to approve travel to the state.

The 16 athletes in quarantine in Sydney, believed to include gold medal-winning rower Alexander Hill, are among a total of 56 South Australia-based Olympians who have returned from the Tokyo games.

Carroll said the AOC had followed the exemption process, submitting medical evidence based on advice, but was on Wednesday told the athletes must apply to quarantine at home, with no certainty of approval.

The Australian Institute of Sport’s medical officer, Dr David Hughes, described the decision as “profoundly flawed”.

“To have individuals quarantined for such a lengthy period of time is, in my opinion, unreasonable and cannot be scientifically justified,” Hughes said.

“It poses a significant risk to the physical and mental wellbeing of the individuals concerned. Athletes subject to home quarantine will not be permitted a welcome home hug.

“Either the athlete’s family must move away, the athlete must find a way of isolating from the family or the entire family goes into quarantine. That is not an acceptable option for someone who is fully vaccinated and who has already just completed two weeks’ quarantine.”

SA Health said in a statement: “Due to the high risk of the Delta strain of Covid-19 in NSW, anyone travelling from New South Wales must undertake 14 days quarantine upon entry into South Australia.”

“SA Health advised the Australian Olympic Committee on 30 July that team members who quarantined in Sydney before travelling to South Australia would need to undergo a further two weeks of quarantine on return,” the department said on Wednesday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Real Madrid has said it will launch civil and criminal lawsuits against the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, and the chief of CVC Capital Partners, Javier de Jaime Guijarro over their proposed €2.7bn (£2.3bn) deal.

The Spanish football club also said on Tuesday it would pursue legal action to block approval of the planned deal, which is to be voted on by the 42 teams in the top two divisions.

The league said last week that the deal, called “Boost La Liga”, would strengthen its clubs and give them funds to spend on new infrastructure and modernisation projects as well as increasing how much they could spend on players’ salaries.

But Real and Barcelona have fiercely opposed the deal as it gives the private equity firm CVC a 10% share in the league’s future television rights.

Tebas responded to the statement with a message on Twitter in which he criticised Real president Florentino Pérez for using “threatening methods”.

CVC Capital Partners was not available for immediate comment.

Barcelona president Joan Laporta last week said the deal was like “mortgaging the club’s rights over the next half-century” and said he would reject it, even though the deal would have helped alleviate the Catalan club’s financial problems and allowed it to sign Lionel Messi, who has left Barça, to a new contract.

The Spanish league last week said it was not worried by legal moves from Real Madrid and that legal disputes between the two entities were common.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The International Cricket Council has confirmed it will campaign for the inclusion of the sport at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, launching its effort in traditional cricket fashion with the formation of a committee, the ICC Olympic Working Group.

“Our sport is united behind this bid, and we see the Olympics as a part of cricket’s long-term future,” the ICC chairman, Greg Barclay, said. “We know it won’t be easy to secure our inclusion as there are so many other great sports out there wanting to do the same, but we feel now is the time to put our best foot forward and show what a great partnership cricket and the Olympics are.”

The ICC’s bid to end what will by then have been a 128-year absence from Olympic schedules will include multiple demonstrations of cricket’s suitability for multisport events: it will return to the Commonwealth Games schedule with a women’s Twenty20 competition in Birmingham in 2022 and to the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, the following month, while there are plans for it to be included in the 2023 Africa Games in Ghana.

The England and Wales Cricket Board’s chairman, Ian Watmore – who will also chair the ICC’s Olympic Working Group – has previously promised that the ECB will “enthusiastically support” efforts to add cricket to the Olympics, while the Board of Control for Cricket in India gave approval at its AGM last December.

Cricket Australia is also supportive, having already promised to “work closely with the Queensland Olympic Council to ensure cricket is front of mind” when the hosts come to propose new sports for the 2032 Games in Brisbane. Cricket West Indies will also back the bid, even though the 10 sovereign states that feed into its team would have to compete individually.

IOC regulations stipulate the lineup of sports must in ordinary circumstances be decided “not later than three years before the opening of the Olympic Games”, and there will be several years of campaigning before a decision is made. Other sports known to be keen to be involved in Los Angeles include lacrosse, which has been out of the schedule since 1908, flag football – a non-contact version of American football – and mixed martial arts. Baseball and softball, which were both on the Tokyo Olympic schedule but have been dropped for Paris in 2024, are expected to return, while lawn bowls, squash and netball are lobbying for inclusion in 2032.

On the only occasion that cricket featured on the Olympic timetable, in 1900, Great Britain – actually a repackaged Devon and Somerset Wanderers CC – took the title by comfortably beating the only other side in the competition, a French team made up largely of expat Britons, at the Vélodrome de Vincennes in Paris. Chasing 185 to win in their second innings, France were bowled out for 26. Cricket was also scheduled to be a part of the 1904 Games in St Louis – along with a competition for throwing a cricket ball, a popular athletic discipline in cricket-playing nations at the time – only for it to be dropped because of a lack of facilities and interest.

The ICC has formed an Olympic working group chaired by Watmore. It also includes the former PepsiCo Inc chief executive Indra Nooyi and the USA Cricket chief, Paraag Marathe.

“With so many passionate cricket fans and players already in the USA, and a huge global audience and following for the sport around the world, we believe that cricket’s inclusion will add great value to the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games,” Marathe said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Although the challenges of Covid made planning difficult, the aim of the project was to show the different journey each athlete made in preparation to represent Great Britain at the Tokyo Games. The work offers a snapshot of what’s been going on behind closed doors, showing the extraordinary lengths each athlete is going through to keep at elite level and maintain the highest level of sporting ability. For some, their selection places were confirmed, pre-pandemic, while others the qualification process went right up to the wire.

Frazer Clarke, Super heavyweight boxer, Tokyo 2020 bronze medal winner

Six months after the Road to Tokyo Olympic qualifiers were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, with lockdown rules relaxing, I met up with Clarke at his home in Burton to document what life as an elite boxer looked liked during the first lockdown. With The Lions’ Den, the GB Boxing training centre, tentatively opening for elite contact training, and new tournaments on the horizon, things were beginning to get back on track for Clarke and GB Boxing. This was cemented with a sensational return to the ring when Clarke secured gold at the Bocskai Memorial Tournament in Hungary in February.

“I have dedicated the last 10 years to this and earning the right to represent my country at the Olympic Games so to finally achieve it and be selected to represent Team GB is an amazing feeling,” Clarke said. “This is a really strong team so to have been named captain is an unbelievable honour. GB Boxing has played an enormous part in shaping me, not just as a boxer, but also a person and to be made captain of the team is amazing. It is one of the proudest achievements of my life.”

Lauren Smith and Marcus Ellis, Badminton - mixed doubles

Couple and mixed doubles Badminton England teammates, Marcus Ellis and Lauren Smith are a tour de force. The northern powerhouse have accrued numerous high-ranking medals and trophies during their respective careers. Since the first shoot with Smith and Ellis at their home in Milton Keynes, the pair have gone on to compete at various world circuit events including the Denmark Open, the Asian leg of the HSBC BWF World Tour, and the YONEX All England Open where they put on a sterling effort and made the semi-finals. Competitive life under Covid has been challenging; during the World Tour tournament in Bangkok, athletes were confined to their hotel rooms except for training and competition, with meals being delivered to their rooms three times a day.

“We’re so excited to be Olympians again, after so much uncertainty and the longest wait we’re excited to get out there,” Lauren Smith and Marcus Ellis said. “It’s always such a proud moment representing Team GB and hopefully the work we put in at home during lockdown will pay off!”

Tom Squires, RS:X Windsurfer

Squires, from landlocked Oxford, was bitten by the windsurfing bug on a family holiday in Cornwall at the age of 11, when Squires’ father bought an old windsurf board and rig, and let his son have a go. He enjoyed it so much that on their return to Oxford they immediately signed up to the nearest Royal Yacht Association Windsurfing course. As lockdown restrictions began to lift last summer, I ventured to Weymouth, home to the RYA training base, to see what life of a sailor looks like coming out of Covid restrictions. Since my initial visit, Squires has gone on to compete on the world and European circuit, competing throughout mainland Europe, bagging a third position at Silvaplana, Switzerland.

I’m the first British male windsurfer whose name isn’t Nick Dempsey to represent Team GB at an Olympic Games since 1996!

“I actually didn’t have such a great time this year and there were times when I felt I didn’t perform well, but this summer I got some great training in and really came on in the areas I was struggling in,” Squires said. “There were even times where I thought about giving it all up and getting an adult job, but I managed to pull through in the end and qualify for a Games … I’m just super happy all my training has paid off. Now I’ve qualified, of course I am going for a medal.”

Nekoda Smythe-Davis, 57kg Judoka

Hailing from Ealing Judo Club, West London, Nekoda Smythe-Davis has embarked on a celebrated career as a 4th Dan Judoka and triumphantly smashed podium positions and was crowned Commonwealth and British champion in 2014. In 2016 she made her Olympic debut in Rio. When British Judo were given a green light to resume contact training at the Centre of Excellence in Walsall, following strict Covid guidelines, I joined Smythe-Davis on her journey back to elite training.

“I unfortunately sustained a concussion in November 2019 in the week leading up to the masters tournament,” Smythe-Davis said. “I was told I couldn’t fly to China and compete which was devastating. In the weeks following I started to struggle with delayed concussion symptoms that stayed persistent for some months. I struggled to get treatment when the pandemic hit and I regressed in my return when elite sport got the green light to return.

“After extensive rehab with a specialist physio and also seeing a neurologist to see how I could get better. It was after a consultation in November 2020 that I decided it would be too risky to rush back to try and be ready for the Games. I decided to put my health and well-being first. This decision came with a heavy heart as I knew I was likely to qualify for Tokyo. Making that decision is the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I know now with the games just a few weeks away and I’ve only just started to feel normal again that this was the right decision to make. It’s amazing that I did qualify even though the last time I competed in an Olympic qualification event was October 2019 where I won gold in the Brasilia grand slam.”

“I am currently pregnant with my first child and I hope to return to the sport, injury permitting in the new year. I will aim to qualify for my third Olympics in Paris 2024.”

Liam Heath MBE, Sprint canoe – men’s K-1 200m, Tokyo 2020 bronze medal winner

Heath is the reigning Olympic Champion and holds the world’s fastest time in the men’s K1 200m. In 2016, Heath became Team GB’s most successful Olympic canoeist following gold and silver medals during the Rio Games, adding to the bronze he won at London 2012 with teammate Jon Schofield.

During the initial lockdown, unable to attend his home training facility at Dorney Lake, Heath set up a home training tent in his garden in Guildford and maintained fitness from home. It wasn’t until August that I was able to first capture Heath at Dorney, with a training day in March 2021. A month later, Heath joined Britain’s best flat water racers in his first competitive event in over 18 months at the National Water Sports Centre in Nottingham, with Heath putting down a strong performance to win the K1 Mens 200m sprint. All Heath’s training has taken place either at his home gym, Dorney Lake or Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre.

“Being selected to represent Team GB at the Olympics for a third time is such an honour and I feel incredibly lucky to compete once again.

“Each Games is so different and special in its own way,” Heath said. “I’m excited to get to Tokyo to experience what this one will be like - I have no doubt it will be amazing! I just want to thank everyone who has helped me get to this moment, Team GB, British Canoeing, National Lottery players, my coaches, support staff, team mates, volunteers and family. I’ve not got here on my own and I hope everyone will share in this incredible moment with me.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There is a case to say England should have left Moeen Ali where he was, merrily blazing a trail of languid destruction for Birmingham Phoenix in the Hundred and furthering his claim to be Eoin Morgan’s No 3 berserker come the T20 World Cup.

After all, the number-crunchers at CricViz tell us no batsman in the history of the shortest international format greets spinners with such unfettered violence and the pitches in the United Arab Emirates this October may well demand such approach when Morgan’s white-ball machine begins its hunt for a second piece of silverware.

For the organisers of the Hundred the 34-year-old Moeen is also the dream ticket: a talented and likeable British Asian cricketer who grew up in inner-city Birmingham. They want more children from a similar background to know they, too, can pursue the sport – and, rightly or wrongly, created a whole new tournament and format to spread this message.

But England’s Test needs must come first and, with the loss of Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes leaving the team unbalanced, Moeen has once again dutifully answered the call. “Buzzing” was his reply when contacted about this latest selection and judging by social media – a sketchy barometer, admittedly – there are plenty who feel the same.

Moeen was the clear choice for England’s predicament (in fact you wonder why the call-up did not come the minute Stokes withdrew). A Test average of 28 with the bat from 61 caps is far too low for a left-hander of his talents, even when factoring in numerous moves up and down the order, but at No 7, the berth he is expected to occupy, this rises to 37. That spot has also been the launchpad for three of his five Test centuries.

And though spin bowling may be the second string to his bow, and containment not a forte, Moeen puts significant revs on the ball, leading to dip, drift and turn, and he has picked up 189 Test wickets this way. Against India at home he has 31 from seven Tests in 2014 and 2018, twice running through the tourists during those two series wins.

Lord’s, where off-spinners enjoy natural variation from the slope, is also where he registered his best bowling figures – six for 53 against South Africa in 2017 – and it is the scene of the second Test this week. An in-form Moeen Ali allows England to play five bowlers without compromising the batting too much whereas selecting their first-choice spinner, Jack Leach, either lengthens the tail or sees them drop down to three seamers.

There is, however, a risk of expecting too much, not least against an Indian side with a high-class attack and an abundance of right-handed batsmen. Moeen’s confidence is up right now – see highlights of his 23-ball half-century against Welsh Fire on Monday for more details – but like Jos Buttler, Sam Curran and Jonny Bairstow before the rain-affected draw at Trent Bridge, he has not played cricket with a red ball all summer.

This is partly down to the schedule but also a catch-22 situation in terms of England’s interest and vice-versa; a sense that, with the head coach Chris Silverwood openly planning to build a team for the Ashes this winter, and Moeen’s previous visit in 2017-18 so subdued in response to an onslaught from the pre-sandpaper Australians, they had moved on.

Quick Guide England v India: projected XIs for the second Test Show England (possible): Dom Sibley, Rory Burns, Haseeb Hameed, Joe Root (c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Craig Overton, Ollie Robinson, Mark Wood

Many believed this to be the case after his last Test outing in Chennai in February, not that his performance was poor. In fact despite coming in cold, his start to the winter was scuppered by contracting Covid-19, Moeen claimed eight wickets – including Virat Kohli in both innings – before an incendiary 18-ball 43 during the final throes of defeat.

But as much as this was a timely audition for the Indian Premier League – resulting in a £690,000 deal from Chennai Super Kings – it felt like a farewell, something only furthered by Joe Root describing his subsequent departure as having “chosen” to go home, a phrase not used for the scheduled breaks of other multiformat cricketers.

Root and Silverwood quickly apologised both publicly and to Moeen after realising how this inconsistency came across. And there was also a private acknowledgement that the late request to stick around from Ed Smith, then national selector, placed the player in an unfair position.

Nevertheless, with England having dropped Moeen in 2019 after 12 bumper months with the ball followed by one overwhelmed Ashes Test – the impact of Jimmy Anderson’s injury on day one is often overlooked here – and responded to his request for a breather that winter by taking away his Test contract, a return seemed unlikely.

That contract decision contrasts with England’s (rightly) sympathetic response to Stokes asking for time out a fortnight ago. Naturally there are differences in terms of individual circumstances, but it still adds to the argument of those who believe Moeen could have been better supported at times; that some of his inconsistency could have been reduced by some more nimble man-management.

Still, Moeen is back in whites now and buzzing. Provided he can get up to speed quickly, and England have learned from past shortcomings and harness his current confidence, rather than douse it, the Hundred’s loss may yet be the Test team’s gain.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@‘The taekwondo was full of drama’

What I love about the Olympics is getting invested in sports I would never watch otherwise. This time, I was absorbed by the taekwondo. The rules are quite easy to pick up and the sport itself is full of drama. There were so many matches decided by a last-second point being scored, which really kept me on the edge of my seat. Having some British athletes to cheer in the medal matches definitely helped. The gold medal bout between Matea Jelic and Lauren Williams in the women’s 67kg category stood out. It was an incredibly close contest and Lauren heartbreakingly lost, having had a three-point lead in the final seconds of the final round that Jelic was able to overcome with a pair of late kicks.

‘I enjoyed Bermuda’s breakthrough moment’

What I enjoyed most about the Olympics is how medals are being won by athletes from unexpected places: a cycling gold for Ecuador, a fencing gold for Hong Kong, a triathlon gold for Bermuda. Perhaps talent is starting to overcome the size of a nation and the money it invests. A more democratic Games is good for everyone. My favourite moment was Flora Duffy winning the triathlon. Bermuda is one of the smallest nations participating in the Olympics: it only has 62,000 people. Prior to this, they had only won one other medal: a bronze in boxing in 1976. Breakthrough moments like this are memorable: I recall when Anthony Nesty, a swimmer from Suriname won the gold in the 100m butterfly at the 1988 Olympics. These moments prove that the Olympics is for everyone: yes it’s more difficult for smaller or poorer nations to win medals, but anything can happen at the Games. Talent can rise to the top, no matter where it comes from. Christian DeFeo, 49, communications manager, Peterborough

‘I loved Tom Daley knitting a bag for his gold medal’

Every four years I love to watch some weightlifting, diving and beach volleyball. It all makes a welcome change from football. I’ve loved Tom Pidcock and the mountain-biking, Tom Daley knitting, the stewards with their clipboards, small countries getting a bronze in some unusual competition, Qatar and Italy sharing the high jump gold. Forget Team GB’s performance in the medal table; just embrace the internationalism and the personal achievement of athletes qualifying to be there. Oh, and well done Japan for making it happen during the Covid pandemic. Every four or five years we watch half an hour of high-jumping. I loved it when the official approached the two men with a clipboard – not a tablet – and Gianmarco Tamberi and Mutaz Essa Barshim asked to share the gold. Yes, that would be possible, came the reply and the pair were filled with joy. The whole thing spoke of humanity and hope. I loved Daley knitting a little bag for his gold medal, too.

‘The Fiji men’s sevens hymn stood out’

I loved watching the rugby sevens. The star has been the tiny ball delivery car. The Olympics is the best way to bring rugby to new audiences. We have been lucky to have witnessed some incredible moments, such as Argentina beating South Africa despite being down to five players. But the standout moment was definitely the Fiji men’s team singing a hymn as beautifully as they played after they won gold. It showed their passion and unity, and what the Olympics means to people.

‘The skateboarding gave me hope’

The skateboarding was wonderful. The youngsters are so brave and their tricks a joy to watch. They fall on to concrete with and get up smiling. They hug their opponents and greet each other with cool gestures that are their own shared language. There is no antipathy and yet they have competed with all the skill and determination of true competitors. It gives hope for a more harmonious and joyful future for humanity.

‘The story of Barshim and Tamberi was touching’

My favourite event was women’s volleyball. I watched all the games that USA played. I used to play volleyball in high school, so I’ll always love it. I love seeing the sportsmanship and friendships between athletes. The story of Barshim and Tamberi sharing gold in the men’s high jump was especially heartwarming. Most people may not want to share gold medals so they can prove they are better. But it takes even more spirit to share success. That’s true sportsmanship. It was touching to see Simone Biles overcome her fear and finish her routine on the balance beam. It was brave of her to tell the world about her mental health issues. I’m rooting for her.

‘Alfie Tiernan collapsing twice before finishing said it all’

Despite my hesitation at the Tokyo Games even going ahead, it became all-consuming. We are in lockdown in Australia and it has bought our family closer and made quarantine a little easier. There were so many stories about athletes sacrificing to get there that I teared up on several occasions. Not giving up is what the Olympics is about and I guess the Aussie Patrick Tiernan, who collapsed twice before finishing the 10,000m, said it all. Jessie Fox winning a gold in the kayak slalom after missed attempts at three past Games was also special. Scott Wilson, 62, Adelaide, South Australia

‘This has been a games about people, not stars’

I was finding it all a bit sterile, but then I remembered how the Olympics throws up incredible stories, such as Anna Kiesenhofer’s shock win in the women’s cycling road race and the Tunisian swimmer Ahmed Hafnaoui’s surprise gold. Even the disappointments brought drama, such as Jade Jones’s loss in the taekwondo and Geraint Thomas’s cycling crash. It’s the emotion I’ve experienced with every Olympics I’ve watched. For me, the highlight was Tom Daley and his medals. He has been a joy to watch over the years and despite three previous Olympics, we’ve finally seen who he really is and what this means to Tom the person, as opposed to Tom the competitor. It seems this has been an Olympic Games about people, not stars, and he sums it up. Matthew, 39, Brighton
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Adelaide Crows forward Taylor Walker this week offered a public apology for the racist remarks he directed as a spectator toward Indigenous player Robbie Young, the exact details of which have not been made public. The video was hard to watch. Not because of Walker’s purported contrition, but rather the awkwardness of the whole set-up of a pre-recorded interview instead of a press conference.

Sitting in the empty stands, Young was situated one row behind Walker, watching on and listening to a very brief scripted statement. Then we were all subjected to a strange seven-second pause, before the silence was eventually broken. “I’m going to lean on you Robbie,” Taylor concluded, “I’m going to lean on the AFL and others around me to support me.”

Perhaps that last line was off-script. At least, one would hope it was, because the logic of a perpetrator of racism leaning on his or her victim for support is outrageous. Unsurprisingly, this “apology” was met with a level of outrage reflecting a well-worn path when it comes to the handling of racism both on and off the playing field.

In fact, the parallels between Walker’s recorded statement with that infamous Collingwood press conference at the release of the Do Better report are glaring. Both Walker and Collingwood’s responses were scripted and orchestrated. Walker’s execution was, albeit, less polished than that of Magpies chair Eddie McGuire. Yet both invoked an Indigenous actor and, typically, such casting is not done to centre the account of those who experience racism, but with the intent of absolving those who inflict it.

This is not to deny the agency of Indigenous peoples in this situation; there was a clear difference in the expressions of Magpies board member Jodie Sizer, who smiled through that Collingwood press conference while defending the club, when compared with the almost blank expression of Young, who remained silent throughout Taylor’s apology.

Journalist and former AFL player Tony Armstrong this week voiced frustration at the role in which Indigenous peoples are cast after experiencing racism. “It’s always on Indigenous people to take the higher road, always having to extend the olive branch out and be the ones to help and to educate,” Armstrong said on ABC News Breakfast.

But the truth is, even in taking the higher ground, victims of racism cannot be assured the same redemptive path their perpetrators are afforded. In 2013, when Adam Goodes found himself in this position, he performed in all of the ways expected of him, absolving the 13-year-old girl who called him an “ape” as “still so innocent” and “uneducated”. He said she needed support.

Yet as we now know, the exoneration Goodes offered did not protect him from the onslaught that ensued.

In the case of Young and Walker, it was an official who reported the racial vilification. This unknown and unnamed official has since been described as courageous, but rarely are Indigenous peoples or people of colour who speak out about racism described in the same way.

Victims of racism are typically accused of “playing the race card”, deemed sooks, whingers and mentally unstable. The AFL, for its part, is comfortable and complicit. The silence surrounding the actual words uttered from the stands that day towards Young is an example of such complicity. So too is the AFL and Adelaide Crow’s position of the AFL and the Crows in standing by the apology video.

If we return for a minute to that supposed watershed “day of pride” – as McGuire put it – Collingwood claimed was theirs on the release of the Do Better report, we can see how the code’s culture of racism is sustained via these responses.

For those of us who took the time to read the report, rather than rely on the narrative Collingwood constructed in that near hour-long press conference, it is most revealing. The narrow terms of reference show how the parameters for attending to racism are always framed to centre around the innocence of white actors and white institutions. The review did not seek to examine the culture of the club in fostering racism, but instead asked: “How effectively did the club [including staff, Board and players’] respond to allegations of racism?”

That Collingwood positioned themselves as good-faith actors merely responding to racism, rather than fostering it, is telling.

But despite this inglorious tradition of racism, the terms set for the review consigned the culture of racism in the club to one of isolated incidents to which the club, through its policies, procedures and systems, is innocently oblivious.

It was that review which enabled coach Nathan Buckley to declare himself guilty of unintentional systemic racism – a kind of admission requiring no real accountability.

Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley says he was unintentionally guilty of a form of systemic racism in being dismissive of Heritier Lumumba’s experience and claims about the club.https://t.co/nFp7pqE96B — The Age (@theage) March 3, 2021

Indigenous people’s frustration is palpable. It is groundhog day, particularly given the AFL continues to claim it is on a journey yet refuses to heed the lessons of the past.

The failure of the AFL’s own executive manager of social policy and inclusion, Tanya Hosch, to recognise the legitimacy of that frustration is most disappointing, as is her posturing about the supposed “real work and real commitment” over “calling out racism”.

The irony here is that Indigenous people are not seeking a pint of blood or pound of flesh from perpetrators of racism. What is sought is a better world, a level playing field and a safe workplace for those who follow.

Given the Walker saga is one of those rare occasions on which the racist act has been acknowledged as real, it offers an opportunity to have a real conversation about the everydayness of racism in all facets of life. There is a chance to hear from Young, to hear how he felt, perhaps with support from the Indigenous Players Alliance, rather than using him as the lone backdrop to Walker’s contrition. There is an opportunity to hear from the official who spoke up, to hear what prompted them to raise the complaint, to bear witness and understand how it was handled. Airing the testimonies and accounts of victims is not a form of punishment, rather an occasion to undertake the educative journey offenders are supposedly seeking on their path to public redemption.

There remains a real opportunity – should the AFL choose – to actually do better. Not in the form of a better-crafted apology, but a better kind of conversation that focuses on victims. One which restores a sense of dignity and humanity, and inspires all of us to act better.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Most memorable rugby moment

To be frank, there were not loads of them across the three Test matches so I’ll plump for the obvious one. When Morné Steyn was named as part of the South Africa squad, you had to wonder. When he was selected on the bench, you could see it coming, and when he came on to the field with two minutes to go there was an inevitability that 12 years on from kicking the Springboks to victory over the Lions he would do precisely the same again. Warren Gatland had the grace to chuckle at what fate had dealt his side. Steyn’s second coming was an irresistible narrative in a series that, on the field at least, did not provide too many. GM

Throwing long miss passes inside your 22 during a Lions Test is not meant to be the done thing. Nor is playing up in the faces of the world’s most effective rush defence. Finn Russell, happily, is not constrained by received wisdom: might the series outcome have been different had the Scotland fly-half been on the pitch for longer? Along with the twinkling Marcus Smith, Russell deserves this award for reminding us all that big-time rugby can still be fun. RK

Best tour game

After a number of one-sided warmups against inferior opposition and two turgid Test matches, the third Test sparkled into life, almost to the second when Finn Russell came on to the field. The Lions clearly approached the third Test with a bolder gameplan but it took Russell’s introduction to free them from the straitjacket. The Springboks, for their part, had a bit more intent to play too and even if both sides grew increasingly conservative as the clock ticked down, the finale was a nerve-shredder. GM

In hindsight the fluctuating SA “A” match – basically the Springboks in disguise – set the tone for the entire series. The Boks, disrupted by Covid, had little option but to give their main men a run, and after the one-sided provincial games how good it was to watch a proper contest. The Lions went 17-3 down but rallied to lose by just 17-13. Ten days later, having been forewarned, they won the first Test 22-17 in the same stadium. RK

Try of the tour

The Lions ran in so many in the warmups and so few in the series that it is hard to pick one that really stands out. Louis Rees-Zammit’s, late on against the Stormers, came from a trademark goose-step from Marcus Smith, however, and rounded off a fine individual showing by the Harlequins No 10. It gave a glimpse into the future – Smith will be the No 10 in the majority of those teams for 2025 currently being put together – and demonstrated what happens when talent is given the platform to shine. The penny eventually dropped for the Test team, just a little too late. GM

Few candidates from the Test series but, once again, the SA “A” game – aka “the fourth Test” – delivered. Eight minutes before half-time a misjudged clearance from Elliot Daly found Cheslin Kolbe who shimmied assuredly between Rees-Zammit and Chris Harris and sent his captain Lukhanyo Am away for a wonderful try, converted by the metronomic Steyn. No one realised then that Steyn was merely warming up … RK

Best Lions player

Honourable mentions for Robbie Henshaw and Courtney Lawes, who both come out of the series in considerable credit, but Maro Itoje proved to be the Lions’ totem throughout the Test series. In the opener it was he who led the resistance in the face of both an early onslaught and late flurry from South Africa and in the third Test again he came up with some trademark interventions. He came out second best in the second Test but looking at his overall series performance, perhaps South Africa supporters will now acknowledge his class. GM

Henshaw was everywhere, Tadhg Furlong was endlessly committed and the fit-again Russell sprinkled some aforementioned late stardust on the series. The most prominent Lion, though, was Itoje in the second row. One minute he was soaring in the lineout, the next making a nuisance of himself around the tackle area or demanding more from those around him. It is a tribute to Itoje and his captain Alun Wyn Jones that South Africa’s influential big men never had it easy. RK

Best Springbok player

Lukhanyo Am captained South Africa A to a victory over the Lions and then set the tone for the series by marmalising Daly inside the first few minutes of the first Test. Much more to his game than big hits however, he marshalled the defensive line superbly and scored the try which put South Africa out of sight in the second Test. Eben Etzebeth was excellent at times – particularly in the second Test – and Damian de Allende showed no after-effects of his fire-pit incident to dovetail alongside Am to superb effect. But Am edges it and is beginning to get the global recognition he deserves. GM

A three-way fight between the outstanding Am, the relentless De Allende and the consistent Franco Mostert. Am and Mostert would both have been deserving winners but De Allende shades it for his all-round contribution. The Munster centre was among the major reasons why the Springboks conceded only two tries in three Tests and was equally forceful whenever he had the ball. Given the horrible fire-pit accident prior to the tour, his was some effort. RK

Unsung tour hero

Ronan Kelleher was called into the preparation camp, essentially to make up the numbers with Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie still occupied by their clubs. He was then kept on a week but not considered for the match against Japan in Edinburgh. That was supposed to be the extent of his involvement but amid concerns from the South African camp that a flurry of Lions injuries in the front row could lead to uncontested scrums, he was called out to join the squad. He was the only member of the touring party not to make an appearance but there were no hints of complaint from the Ireland hooker. That selflessness keeps the Lions concept going. GM

Marius Jonker. The South African was placed in an invidious position when he was asked to step in as the TMO after the original neutral appointee withdrew. Given how many calls were referred “upstairs” he was almost as busy as the on-field referees. Will have been mightily relieved he did not have to adjudicate on the series-deciding penalty. RK

Abiding tour memory

To wonder what might have been with 30,000 supporters in attendance. Cape Town is a beautiful city even in midwinter but there was something disturbing about seeing it so empty at times. Covid-19 has been devastating while riots and looting broke out elsewhere in the country mid-tour and with unemployment so high you could not help but wonder just how far the economic boon from a fully-attended tour would have gone, and if that was not considered by those who refused to entertain delaying the tour by a year it is to their shame. GM

Anyone with a chance to do so should visit Robben Island. Nelson Mandela’s old cell is a stark reminder of the grim injustices of the apartheid era but it was the searing testimony of our guide, an ex-prisoner himself, that really resonated. “Here’s where we went on hunger strike” puts even the most Covid-disrupted rugby tour into instant perspective. RK

Best quote(s)

“No, I’m actually not Jaco Johan, I’m Johan Erasmus. I actually follow Jaco Johan, he’s a big supporter of us. He’s been feeding me some really good clips for a while now, things that I’ve actually used in the past. He’s a very big supporter, a really funny guy and I quite enjoy the things that he does.” Before things turned sour with an hour-long evisceration of the referee Nic Berry, Rassie Erasmus stole the show with bizarre if entertaining press conference in which he had to deny being behind a Twitter burner account as a not-so subtle way of bringing decisions he disagreed with into the public eye. The quote pretty much sums up a stranger-than-fiction second Test week. GM

“You’re looking at him.” Liam Williams, asked to nominate the world’s best full-back under a high ball. “We want to see a change in mentality from our players in terms of speeding up the game. We want to see less ‘ball out of play’ and more action.” SA Rugby’s director of rugby Rassie Erasmus, 25 February 2021 RK

Biggest disappointment

Another obvious one but we must hope that this is the last major international series played out in empty stadiums. There are some advantages to the absence of supporters – particularly when you are sitting so close to the Springboks coaches – and hearing a fiercely pumped up Bundee Aki rallying the Lions troops in the first half of the last Test was a unique insight. But had the stadiums been packed to the rafters for all tour matches the warm-ups would have been significantly more animated and the Tests on another level entirely. GM

The reluctance of many in South Africa to call out Erasmus for his social media and waterboy antics. Everyone was impressed by the way he steered the Springboks to World Cup glory in 2019 but trampling all over rugby’s values of respect was not a good look. Sometimes referees get it wrong and, just occasionally, so do leading coaches. RK

My wish for 2025 …

The Lions have insisted that if it wasn’t for the pandemic, the Springbok players would have been playing for their franchises and there would not have been so many one-sided drubbings. Warren Gatland and his coaches have highlighted how it hardly helped their preparation but for watching supporters the tour really didn’t come to life until South Africa A named a Test side in all but name. The worry is that there are similar issues in Australia in four years’ time so it is heartening to hear both the Wallabies and the Lions open to potential tour matches against the Pacific Island nations, something that would suit all parties. Little is to be gained by thrashing weakened sides by more than 50 points. GM

A Lions itinerary with a refreshing twist. The days of routine walkovers over second-string state opposition are now over. What about a Test in Tokyo en route with either Fiji or a Pacific Island XV added to the fixture list, on the strict proviso that a decent slice of the tour profits go to the opposition and their unions? Or a British & Irish Lionesses tour, running in parallel with the men and perhaps featuring a Test series against a Rest of the World XV? It is time to start thinking more imaginatively. RK
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@About the medal table

As is traditional, the table prioritises the number of gold medals won. On this basis in 2016, the United States led the field with 46 golds, with Great Britain second on 27 and China third with 26. If countries have the same number of gold medals, the order is then dictated by which has the most silvers, and finally bronze if the numbers are still identical.

The US won 121 medals overall in Rio, while China had more medals overall than Britain, 70 to 67. UK Sport has said it hopes Team GB will win “between 45 and 70” medals in Tokyo.

Japan, the host country at the 2020 Games, came sixth in the medal table in 2016 with 12 gold medals. Before the pandemic it was targeting 30 golds at these Games, but its Olympic committee says it no longer has a target.

Australia came 10th at Rio, with eight gold medals, equal on golds with Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Farewell then, Tokyo 2020. On a sweltering night at the Olympic Stadium, Japan said goodbye to its troubled, quietly glorious Games with a closing ceremony that was by turns elegant, sombre and hilariously unbound. Not to mention, in the grand Olympic tradition, crammed full of schmaltz and corporate doublespeak.

At 10pm local time the IOC president, Thomas Bach, emerged on to his lighted plinth to declare Tokyo 2020 closed – and to offer up something else too, to lobby for its place in history.

“Dear athletes, over the last 16 days you have amazed us,” Bach told his worldwide TV audience, coming on like an irresistible corporate rain-maker in turquoise tie, light blue suit and crisp white mask, and surrounded with the traditional hand of handsome young people draped in medals.

“You created the magic of these Olympic Games, Tokyo 2020. You were stronger because we all stood together in solidarity.” There is a weary Olympic bingo to these platitudes, these join-the-dots uplifting statements. But for all the usual peace stuff, the unity stuff, there was an added urgency here as Bach used his closing notes to apply the IOC gloss to the way these Games in the time of plague will be remembered.

Tokyo has been a warm, courteous and resourceful host, but also a troubled one. Outside the stadium there were protests in the streets and cries of “No Olympics” as the delegates, wonks and team members left the show at the end. The display of disaffection was orderly but assertive, marking the anger many people have felt at the staging of this global event in a city where the line between contagion and control is already stretched thin.

“You were competing fiercely with each other in pursuit of Olympic gold,” Bach went on. “At the same time you were living together in peace. This is a powerful message of solidarity and peace. For the first time since the pandemic began the entire world came together. Sport returned to centre stage … This gives us hope. This give us faith in the future.” Does it though? As ever these occasions tend to pose other questions.

Questions like, what is the Olympics actually for? Why, exactly, are we doing this? The Olympic Games still likes to style itself as “a movement”, an arm of international relations, a force for fellowship and joy, as opposed to, say, a heavily branded corporate circus. The insistence on these transcendent qualities springs from the burden the Games place on those sleeted to host and fund it. That empty host stadium cost $1.3bn (£0.9bn). There must also be magic dust.

This kind of talk might carry more weight with critics of the Olympic-industrial complex were it not for the fact this celebration of love, so recently in Azerbaijan and Russia, heads next to China for the winter Games. But never mind that for now. Just look at the lights.

“The Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020 are the Olympic Games of hope, unity and peace,” Bach concluded, having maintained, disingenuously, that the reason for staging Tokyo 2020 at such a dangerous time was to fulfil the wishes of the athletes, as opposed to commercial contracts carrying ruinous losses.

Sign up for our Tokyo 2020 briefing with all the news, views and previews for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

And yet, as every Big Sport executive knows, something in that human spectacle will always keep us coming back for more. Bach had emerged into the Olympic arena two hours earlier as inspirational music swelled and a thrilling blue sheen spread across the tiers of this reconditioned ghost-stadium. The staging was lavish, kitsch and lavishly kitsch, the central area fitted out with an arrangement of plinths and podiums, plus at one end the Olympic flame itself, leaping up out of a kind of squashed dinosaur egg affair.

For much of the two hours that followed this was an elegantly stripped back ceremony, commemorative rather than celebratory. At the start the Japanese flag was carried into the arena very slowly, with a moving sense of formal calm.

The flags of the competing nations followed, Great Britain’s held by Laura Kenny, now the most decorated female British Olympian ever. And steadily the night dissolved into kind of world music mashup, from rhumba to nose flute twirls to jazz funk bass, as the athletes came bouncing into the stadium, clapped on heartily by a row of stewards who, besides dancing like your aunt at Christmas, seemed to be having a genuinely great time.

For a while the stadium resembled a human Fantasia, a whirl of colour and marching music – barks and bings, bagpipes, klaxons, strange gurgling noises. The volunteers passed through, waving at the crowd and drawing their own ovation. It is hard to do justice to the Tokyo 2020 volunteer army, who have been warm and stoical and endlessly patient with this mess of uncooperative humanity, and all this at a Games many Tokyoites didn’t want.

The nations came and went. Team Russia (Not Russia) waved for the camera.

The oddity of Russia’s presence here in such numbers despite an apparent doping ban – another dismal IOC saga, a tarnishing of the sports it is charged with preserving – was never the fault of the athletes. This was just a bunch of very happy young people having the time of their lives.

And by now the central carpet was crammed with all the flags of the world, glowing examples of physical splendour, of species power. OK, people of the cosmos. We’re ready for our close up now. That lot over there under the lights. That’s what we’re like. At its best Tokyo 2020 has been like this, not just spectacular but also soothing, a reminder that the world can also be a fun place.

As the flame was handed over by video link to Paris 2024, skyline captured in a stunningly beautiful film, it was hard again to avoid that duality.

For all the talk of a new “sustainable” Olympics, the world’s largest industrial sporting event will continue to toy with overspending, waste and dubious regimes. Men will appear on plinths talking about peace and love while the stadium noise drowns out the shouts beyond its walls.

And Tokyo will now breathe again, at the end of 14 days of spectator-free, fiercely marshalled competition, from rhythmic gymnastics to the two-person dinghy, from the fastest humans on Earth to the 87kg clean and jerk. This brilliantly seductive mess of a global sporting beano has now finally said goodbye – with grace and verve, but with a sense, also, of relief.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jason Kenny has become Britain’s most decorated Olympian after winning gold in the men’s keirin at Tokyo 2020, a victory that has put on hold talk of an end to his glittering career on the track.

Kenny, who conceded he was “struggling” during the men’s sprint earlier in the week, now has seven golds, one more than his fellow keirin specialist Sir Chris Hoy. Those, plus two silvers, have also taken him past Sir Bradley Wiggins, who is on eight medals.

Having seen Kenny fail to defend his individual and team sprint titles, the five other finalists may have been guilty of underestimating the 33-year-old in a keirin final like no other in the event’s 21-year Olympic history.

As the derny peeled off the Izu Velodrome track with three laps remaining, Kenny led the six-man paceline, followed by Matthew Glaetzer, the Australian’s focus on a potential attack from behind. Kenny glanced back and took his chance with an explosive turn of speed that gave him an immediate quarter-lap lead on the rest of the field.

The gap had barely shrunk when Kenny crossed the finish line 0.763sec ahead of Azizulhasni Awang of Malaysia. Harrie Lavreysen of the Netherlands took the bronze.

The victorious rider removed his helmet, threw it to a Team GB official and soaked up applause from a Japanese crowd that had earlier seen their two medal hopefuls, Yudai Nitta and Yuta Wakimoto, fail to reach the final of the track event their country invented after the second world war.

Kenny said he and his Team GB coaches had briefly discussed the possibility of an audacious breakaway. “I said just before the start that ‘if they’re asleep shall we just launch one?’ When the time came and [Glaetzer] left a massive gap, I looked and thought: ‘It’s just too big an opportunity not to try,’ so I launched it and rolled the dice.

“Going into the final, I didn’t feel like one of the favourites, and I wouldn’t have been betting on myself, personally. In that instance you’ve got to be prepared to take your chances, and a massive chance came along.”

His GB teammate Jack Carlin, who missed out on a place in the final and finished eighth overall, watched open-mouthed from the velodrome pit as Kenny stunned the chasing pack.

“Seven gold medals is really special, when you look back on the ones you have already got it seems pretty easy. Then when you try and get more, you remember how hard it is,” Kenny said, laughing at the suggestion that he and his wife, the five-time gold medallist Laura Kenny, could now construct a clock with a gold medal representing each hour.

“It is easy to forget the hard work that goes into it. I have been disappointed this week, I haven’t been as competitive as I wanted to be. But in the keirin you can race hard and ride your luck a little bit.”

Kenny was speaking as Laura struggled to recover from a crash in the first part of the four-discipline omnium that ensnared multiple riders and injured a trackside official. The Briton, winner of the event in London and Rio and looking for her sixth Olympic gold medal, was one of at least nine riders sent hurtling to the track and among four who were each awarded 16 points after being unable to finish the scratch race.

Despite a spirited attempt to make up lost ground over the following three races, Kenny came in sixth. The American Jennifer Valente recovered from a crash in the points race to take gold, with Yumi Kajihara making up for Japan’s keirin disappointment with a silver-medal finish that had spectators on their feet, some waving hinomaru flags, while the homegrown rider lifted her bike above her head in celebration. Kirsten Wild picked up bronze for the Netherlands.

In the other medal race of the final day, Canada’s Kelsey Mitchell won the women’s sprint – just two years after taking up cycling – beating Olena Starikova of Ukraine, while Hong Kong’s Lee Wai-sze won bronze.

Boris Johnson was among those to congratulate Kenny, describing his new status as Britain’s greatest Olympian as “magnificent” in a tweet.

The manner of Kenny’s keirin victory appears to have quelled any thoughts of retirement. “If you’d asked me this morning [if I’d retire] I’d probably have said yes, but I’m feeling good now so I might just carry on,” he said. “Before today I had all but given up, I was counting my career in days and races as opposed to years, but maybe I have bought myself more time now.

“In my head this morning I was 33 and getting slower and you’ve got to think from a British cycling point of view you’d rather back someone who’s 20 and getting faster. It was difficult, I’ve not been able to train the way I want to. It might not be up to me at the end of the day. I might not be able to get back to the level I want, but we’ll wait and see.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Joe Biden held a Zoom call with Team USA Olympians on Saturday as the Tokyo Games drew to a close.

“You handle yourself with such grace, and such decency,” Biden said. “You made me so damn proud.”

Fairly standard stuff. After all, what else could an American president say about an Olympic team? Wait. Don’t answer that.

In a nation where everyone seems to take sides on everything, athletes are still being told to stick to sports by politicians who don’t stick to politics. But Biden’s praise was non-partisan, heartfelt and apt. There was no attempt to deploy sports as ammunition in a cynical culture war, stoke hostility or equate political leanings with athletic performance.

The men’s track athletes were mostly outrun, a resurgent Australia and Britain gobbled golds in the pool, the usually dominant women’s soccer team were flawed and the US won fewer medals than in 2016, only topping the table by one gold ahead of China. But these were a triumphant Olympics for the US. Better than Rio, because class and empathy shone through as surely as the glinting medals around Team USA’s necks.

“These are the things that people look at around the world – more than anything that I do as your president, or other people do in public life, they get the impression of who we are as Americans,” Biden said.

That image was blurry in 2016. Sure, Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps were paradigms of excellence. But headlines damned the swimmer Ryan Lochte as an emblem of the “ugly American” abroad after his commotion in a gas station. The goalkeeper Hope Solo upset Brazilians with social media posts that seemed to make light of the Zika virus outbreak.

In a manufactured controversy that seemed to be an echo of the aggressive demands for ostentatious displays of patriotism that swept the country after 9/11, the gymnast Gabby Douglas was excoriated for not placing her hand over her heart as the gold medal-winning gymnast and her four teammates stood for the national anthem.

In a nation that constantly brags about its free speech credentials, her critics conflated patriotism with conformism, an attitude as wrongheaded as it is persistent.

As the Rio Games ended the world was about to notice a quarterback named Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem and athlete activism would soon divide fans along political lines. Looking back, it is plain to see that a few months before the presidential election, America was under the dark clouds of a gathering storm that is yet to abate. Tokyo was the social-distancing, facial-covering Games, but Rio was when the mask slipped.

Better memories will endure from Tokyo, and not only the visceral images of sporting triumph and disaster that cascade into our vision, race after race, game after game, day after day, with the relentless energy of a waterfall.

Biles cheering on her teammates. Ledecky warmly congratulating Ariarne Titmus after the Australian passed at the last to take the 400m freestyle. The openly gay basketball star Sue Bird and the Cuban-American speed skating and now baseball silver medallist, Eddy Alvarez, voted by their peers as opening ceremony flag-bearers, representatives of a proudly and passionately multicultural, diverse, nation.

Karate bronze medal winner Ariel Torres, born in Cuba, retelling his immigrant story. The shot-putter Raven Saunders’ “X” protest in support of people enduring oppression. Tamyra Mensah-Stock becoming the first Black woman to win Olympic wrestling gold. Caeleb Dressel, the fastest swimmer on the planet, a five-time gold medallist in Tokyo, striding into interview rooms and talking about feeling the pressure, about being vulnerable. If it was tempting to call his feats superhuman – well, he was here to tell us he isn’t, and and we wrote it and believed it.

When you’re watching a festival of the best athletes in the world, many of them more brilliant at doing what they do than any competitor who has ever lived, abnormality is baked into the whole arrangement by definition.

But in Japan, amid the bromides of IOC president Thomas Bach and in a subdued general atmosphere and rigid protocols – a cursed context of inflexibility and anxiety that sucked some of the joy out of the whole overwrought party – US athletes made valuable contributions to add nuance and bring attention to discussions of mental health, civil rights, tolerance and diversity.

American Olympians, traditionally honoured on cereal boxes, are no longer content to be perceived as cardboard cut-outs. Biden is right: they were decent. And they also won a ton of medals.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was never going to be an Olympic Games quite like any other. The bike racing in Tokyo reflected that, and within that bubble so did the fortunes of Great Britain’s cyclists. It was a bizarrely apposite conclusion to a Games that had seen a string of one-off episodes on two wheels that Laura Kenny’s luck should run out in the cruellest style in the omnium, a discipline that she has made her own since its inception in 2012, while her husband Jason should become Britain’s most-crowned Olympian with a jaw-dropping gold medal in the keirin.

Sir Chris Hoy, the man Jason Kenny deposed as Olympic match sprint champion in 2012 after a fraught selection battle, compared his nemesis to a predatory big cat that spends most of its time asleep in the sun, turning into a ruthless apex predator at the flick of an eyelid. Kenny’s keirin opponents would concur that you cannot give the man a fraction of an iota of a glimpse of an opening.

You cannot call any win by Kenny a fluke, but the way he pulled this one out of the bag was distinctly outlandish. Few international keirins are won with an attack two and a half laps out but Kenny’s sustained acceleration through the brief, intense moment pointed to an unerring ability to gauge the effort, which – on reflection – might be expected of a rider who a few days earlier had anchored the Great Britain team sprint trio to a silver medal, albeit a painful one.

Kenny has reflected in the past on his status as the stealth champion of British sport a man who “likes to keep his head down” and just get on in his own quiet way, but since edging out Jason Queally and Craig Maclean for a sprint slot in Beijing, he has inexorably made his way past the two knights of the track, Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins, to become the nation’s most prolific Olympian.

The Kenny household is a competitive one – “When I won two gold medals there was no way [Laura] wasn’t going to get two,” he told me in 2013 – and there must be a chance that in Paris Laura Kenny will equal or overhaul her other half. Together with Filippo Ganna’s flabbergasting final kilometre to win the men’s team pursuit for Italy, her relentless, perfect madison gold with Katie Archibald was the highlight of a week’s track racing, but the loss of a clear run at a medal in the omnium through no fault of her own will have left a bitter taste.

Kenny was one of several victims of one of the worst pile-ups in international track racing in recent years, flying headlong into the boards after Italy’s Elisa Balsamo ran into a back wheel shortly before the finish of the scratch race; the crashes in this event and the men’s and women’s madisons suggest that some of the racers were ring-rusty because of a lack of racing through the pandemic.

Since Kenny took gold at the European championship in 2011, her personal party piece has become the elimination race in the omnium, so when the wheels came off in that discipline after she had staged a courageous fightback in the tempo race, it was clear that the impact had – not surprisingly – taken its toll.

Great Britain topped the cycling medals table but not in the way we have come to expect. There were no medals in road cycling, so Olympic inquests may want to examine why the men’s team featured three riders who had all fallen heavily at the Tour de France, and why GB only qualified one support rider for Lizzie Deignan. Tom Pidcock’s mountain bike gold confirmed his precocious talent, while the plethora of BMX metalware could hardly have been predicted, but will give huge impetus to a discipline which is the best entry point to bike racing for most urban-dwelling youngsters.

In the velodrome, the long years of Great Britain’s dominance are finally over. The bellwether event, the men’s team pursuit, saw Team GB go home without a medal for the first time since Atlanta 1996. There was no British medal of any colour in any of the women’s sprint disciplines, a first since 2004, and the failure to find a replacement for Becky James, who retired in 2017, looks particularly glaring.

Sign up for our Tokyo 2020 briefing with all the news, views and previews for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

However, there is more than enough going on in terms of emerging talent – the bronze sprint medallist, Jack Carlin, and the men’s omnium champion, Matt Walls, to highlight just two – to suggest that currently the production line in the “medal factory” is being switched to a different mode rather than the whole operation stuttering. And few would bet against the golden Kennys jointly deciding that it’s not actually that long until Paris in 2024, via next year’s Commonwealth Games.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Which team has played the highest number of current Premier League and Football League teams in competitive matches,” asks John Sullivan.

“I am sad enough to have spent a pre-internet school holiday drawing up charts of who had played who,” writes Mitchell Sandler, saving us a job. “These days it’s all on spreadsheets and much easier to update. The key to the question is new boys Sutton United who have, occasional FA Cup matches excluded, yet to play any of the other 91 ‘first-class’ clubs. Twenty-three of these will have played them in the next few months and of these, precisely four – Bradford City, Northampton, Port Vale and Swindon – will be able to claim the full set.”

That’s if we’re only looking at the current 92 clubs. “If we assume a team can’t play itself then the answer lies outside the Football League,” says Richard Gunn. “I think Notts County have faced all 72 Football League sides, as well as all 20 currently in the Premier League. I suspect Wrexham might have played all 72 as well, but not all 20 in the Premier League.” Now would be a handy time to be invited to share Mitchell’s spreadsheet. We thought Notts County might have missed out on facing Salford City but an FA Cup tie in 2015 means they have ticked the Class of 92’s favourite plaything off their “competitive game” list .

And David Price takes us on a trip north for an answer that would have done the job a season ago. “With our tumultuous fall down the leagues in the last few years (and now thankfully moving back in the right direction), this has enabled my team, Bolton Wanderers, to have played every team that was in the 2020-21 Football League in a league match, not just a competitive match. However, if by ‘current’ you mean the members of the Football League in the 2021-22 season, then the only exception is league newcomers Sutton United.”

Supreme individual feats in humiliating defeats

“Barbra Banda scored a hat-trick for Zambia in the 10-3 defeat by Netherlands at Tokyo 2020,” begins John Carlisle. “Has there been a more supreme individual feat in a humiliating defeat before?”

Almost, says Jeremy Simmonds, who notes that Everton’s Jimmy Harris scored three in a 10-4 defeat by Spurs in October 1958. He takes up the story: “This was the legendary Bill Nicholson’s first game in charge at Tottenham, the new boss apparently spending most of the post-match debrief castigating the home defence for letting Harris in so often. Harris was outdone by Tottenham’s Bobby Smith, who bagged four that afternoon.”

John Brough also suggested the same performance, sending the bucket back into the Knowledge well with the related query: “Has anyone had a better start to a managerial job?”

But back to the original poser, Doncaster fan Howard Groves says Kerry Dixon went one better: “I can recall visiting Reading forward Kerry Dixon scoring four in a match in September 1982 – a tremendous effort although Doncaster eventually won 7-5. In one of football’s twists of fate, Dixon became the Doncaster manager some years later.”

Horses named after footballers (the final furlong)

Last week we brought you a selection of racehorses named after footballers and a best XI. A few more have arrived in the paddock since then.

“I once bet on Frank LeBoeuf,” writes Nick Gascoigne. “It ran at Del Mar (California), probably around 2000. I lost my money. Better player than racer.”

Devin Govender also writes in, informing us as follows: “Here in South Africa, we had a sprinter called Tevez who enjoyed a pretty successful career, winning up to Grade 2 level. There was also Solskjær – actually an Irish-bred who won a couple of stakes races in Ireland but ended up in South Africa for stud duties, where he sired a filly called Giggs (not sure how they got the gender mixed up, but there it is). Surprisingly, none of his other progeny were named directly after footballers, although many had football-themed names, the most apposite perhaps being a filly called The Special One.”

And Peter Gorvin keeps the Manchester United theme going. “I named a horse Bryan Robson about 25 years ago,” he says. “I wish it had been 10% as good as its namesake. I got him to sign a consent form for use of his name at Bangor-on-Dee races one day.”

Top, top players winning nothing

“A couple of weeks ago someone asked about unwinningest top players,” writes Adam Webster. “Seeing as nobody has answered I feel it is my obligation to put forward Bernd Schneider. He played 81 times for Germany, including a World Cup final, and for a fine Bayer Neverkusen Leverkusen team which does explain it somewhat.”

“Honours”: Bundesliga runner-up: 1999–2000, 2001–02. DFB-Pokal runner-up: 2001–02, 2008–09. Champions League runner-up: 2001–02. World Cuprunner-up: 2002.

“Which was the last team to win the English top flight playing in a striped home kit?” asked Stuart Young in November 2007.

Well Stuart, it basically all depends on how discerning you are about your stripes. Obviously we’re not going to count teams with a few skinny lines down their sleeves and shorts, nor indeed will we accept Blackburn’s blue and white halves, but would you accept the alternating shades of red on Arsenal’s title-winning top from 1988-89?

If not, then the white pinstripes Liverpool sported during their triumphant 1983-84 campaign (and indeed in 1982-83), are a little more clear cut. But if you’ll only settle for wholehearted, chunky, even slices of markedly different colours, then you actually have to go all the way back to 1935-36, when Sunderland won the old first division in their traditional red and white.

Can you help?

“On 1 August in the EFL Cup, Huddersfield won their 10th penalty shoot out of 13 in their history. Which English team has taken part in the most such events and which has won the most,” asks Richard Askham.

“By the end of the second matchday, no team in the Polish Ekstraklasa has a 100% record (each team has at least drawn). Has this ever happened sooner (each team drawing in the first week) anywhere? And what is the soonest it has happened in the English top flight,” asks Paul Vickers.

“Whilst excruciatingly bored ‘working from home’ I came across the Wikipedia entry for a Mr J Bosman (no, not that one). This is the former Dutch international. It turns out that he scored nine of his 17 (52.9%) international goals against one side, Cyprus. Has anyone with such a decent international return ever had a better strike-rate against a single team,” asks Mike Shaw.

“Albion Rovers’ capacity is reported as 1,238 on the SPFL website,” begins Adam Hookway. “The record crowd at the same ground is 27,381. Has anyone got a more impressive record to capacity difference? That ratio might be unbeatable.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Wayne Rooney described Derby’s penalty shootout win over Salford in the Carabao Cup as his “proudest moment” as a manager.

Derby survived a scare before beating Salford 5-3 in the shootout at Pride Park.

The Rams trailed 2-0 and 3-2 before Ravel Morrison made it 3-3 and goalkeeper Ryan Allsop saved Luke Burgess’ spot-kick to put the Championship side through.

Rooney said: “Last season, staying up was massive for everyone but tonight is the proudest moment I’ve had as a manager. I think the situation we’re in and the pressure on those young lads, I’m so proud of them in the second half and, for the fans who were here and the ones who watched at home, I think they can all be proud of the team tonight.”

Derby made eight changes and were behind after eight minutes when Jordan Turnbull headed in after Ashley Eastham flicked on a corner.

Salford scored again in the 14th minute when Josh Morris beat Allsop with a 20-yard shot that curled just inside his right-hand post.

Allsop saved from Conor McAleny but Derby pulled a goal back four minutes later when Isaac Hutchinson turned inside the box to fire low past Tom King.

Derby were much better in the second half and levelled in the 70th minute when Josh Lowe tripped Festy Ebosele and Colin Kazim-Richards scored the penalty despite slipping as he ran up.

But Salford regained the lead four minutes later when Burgess was barged over by Craig Forsyth and Morris dispatched the penalty.

Derby equalised in the 82nd minute when Morrison fired into the top-left corner after his free-kick came back off the wall.

Morecambe came from behind to earn a famous 2-1 win at Blackburn.

And the League One new boys secured victory over the 2002 winners six minutes from the end when Burnley loanee Adam Phillips emphatically converted a penalty.

Joseph Anang was the hero with two shootout saves as League Two Stevenage defeated local rivals Luton 3-0 on penalties to progress to the second round following a 2-2 draw in normal time.



The home side conceded the lead twice in a chaotic four-goal first half, with goals by Elliott List and Ben Coker cancelled out by Luton’s Cameron Jerome and Admiral Muskwe.



A goalless second half led to penalties, in which Championship Luton failed to score.

Marley Watkins struck twice on his Cardiff debut to save the Bluebirds from embarrassment and help them seal a 3-2 win over Sutton.

EFL new boys Sutton struck first through Donovan Wilson and they should have moved further clear as they missed several chances in their first League Cup appearance.



It allowed Watkins to turn the tables for an underwhelming Cardiff with goals either side of the break before Josh Murphy added a late third. Sutton rallied again with a late strike from Coby Rowe, but Cardiff saw the match out.

Lewis Thomas was Forest Green’s penalty shootout hero as the League Two side stunned Championship Bristol City. Regan Hendry equalised for the hosts deep into stoppage time as the game went to spot-kicks after a 2-2 draw. And with Rovers leading 6-5, Thomas dived the right way to keep out Cameron Pring’s kick.

Rhian Brewster finally broke his Sheffield United duck as the Blades advanced to the second round following a 1-0 victory over Carlisle.

Brewster’s first goal for the club since his transfer from Liverpool last summer separated the two teams, giving Slavisa Jokanovic his first win as manager.

New signing Sam Surridge bagged his second goal in as many games and skipper Harry Souttar was also on target as Stoke eased to a 2-1 home victory over Fleetwood.

New Swansea head coach Russell Martin secured his first victory at the second time of asking when his side defeated a youthful Reading 3-0.

Much-changed Birmingham squeezed through to the second round after debutant Marcel Oakley’s late goal downed a spirited Colchester 1-0 at St Andrew’s.

Rochdale have been handed a bye into the second round after first-round opponents Harrogate were unable to fulfil the fixture following a coronavirus outbreak.



The League Two sides were due to meet at the EnviroVent Stadium on Tuesday evening, but the EFL announced on Monday that the Yorkshire club had asked for its next three fixtures be postponed with a number of players either having tested positive or self-isolating.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thomas Tuchel has suggested it will be Tammy Abraham’s decision whether to stay and battle for a starting place at Chelsea after the imminent arrival of Romelu Lukaku. With the Belgian’s return to Stamford Bridge edging closer, his fellow striker Abraham has been linked with clubs including Roma and Arsenal.

The 23-year-old Abraham has played a bit-part role for Chelsea since Tuchel’s appointment as head coach in late January. Abraham is, at least, in the Chelsea squad for Wednesday’s Super Cup meeting with Villarreal in Belfast.

“He was clearly not happy with the last half a year,” Tuchel said. “Maybe he has reason not to be happy and maybe it was also my fault, not to push him and trust him on the same level I trusted other players. I can absolutely understand that he wants more minutes so that decision will be: how do we plan, what are Tammy’s plans, does he fight his way back into the team from the position where he ended last season or does he want to change club to have a better chance to be a regular starter, which I can completely understand?

“This is the situation with him, quite a normal situation until the window closes. Tammy is one of these players where we constantly evaluate the situation and adapt to the needs.”

Speaking from Windsor Park, Tuchel was far less inclined to offer thoughts on Lukaku. The former Paris St-Germain coach implied he did not want to besmirch the status of a meeting between Champions League and Europa League winners by talking transfers. “It is not a preparation match, it is our first competitive match,” Tuchel said. “It is clearly not the moment for personnel discussions about our squad. As you know I have a lot of trust in the existing squad and we have proved already we can be a strong side.

“I have said many times that we have spoken about our ideas to improve the squad, which is not easy. With Olivier Giroud having left the club and having had an important role in the last few years, we miss a certain profile of attacker. We need to wait and see what is possible or not possible but we are not hectic, we are not in a panic. I will not talk about it until the moment we have something to announce.

“I am very happy with the potential and the actual performance of the group. They played with a fantastic spirit and mentality for half a year. I always said I was happy starting the next season with the same group again. We had some ideas, we discussed them because we have fantastic scouting and a very clear structure in the club. We always try to improve but we believe in development of our players. There is nothing to worry about. Other clubs signed heavily this summer, which is their right and is good for the league; it is a huge challenge to compete with them but football is a team sport and we have a strong squad in which we believe.”

Still, Tuchel confirmed there was benefit to adding fresh faces in respect of “keeping everybody on their toes and not making people feel too comfortable, in the so-called comfort zone. But there has to be a realistic chance to fight for your place.”

Tuchel reflected on a “pretty new and pretty demanding” pre-season. “We arrived here with a squad where we have players who had one in-house game for 45 minutes,” he said. “We arrived also with players who have had five weeks of training and four matches in their legs. So it’s [a] wide spread regarding the physical level. We will be in a much better shape with a lot of players after the next international break.”

Chelsea begin their Premier League campaign at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jack Grealish has said Britain’s most expensive footballer is “a good tag to have” and one he aims to repay by helping Manchester City finally win the Champions League this season.

The England international became the first £100m transfer in Premier League history when ending his 19-year stay with boyhood club Aston Villa last week. Rather than feel the pressure or burden of such a staggering fee, the 25-year-old insisted it fuelled his confidence to know how highly Pep Guardiola and the Premier League champions valued his talent.

Speaking before greeting City fans outside the Etihad Stadium at his unveiling on Monday, Grealish said of his £100m transfer: “It probably hasn’t sunk in yet. It means so much to me that the club were willing to spend that much money on me. If anything it just fills me with confidence. I don’t think there’s any pressure with that price tag at all. It just shows how much the club and the manager value me and that only gives me confidence going forward.

“I take it as a compliment. I actually like it [being Britain’s most expensive signing], I think it is a good tag to have. I think when you see a club paying that much for a player it means they trust and value you highly and see so much potential there to work with. I see it as a good thing. Now I just hope I can repay this whole football club by winning as many titles as possible and winning that trophy we all want.”

“That” trophy, of course, is the Champions League prize that continues to elude City 13 years after Sheikh Mansour’s takeover. Grealish revealed Guardiola stated this season’s aim was to become champions of Europe for the first time.

“The club were so close to winning it last year; they were one goal away from winning it,” the midfielder said.

“That is exactly why I have come here – the manager said it to me when I spoke. I look around the changing room and there is so much talent and depth and I fully believe we can win it this year. The depth in every position is absolutely crazy.

“It has been difficult watching the games on those Tuesday-Wednesday nights. I believe I can play in those games. I remember watching Manchester City-PSG last year and the standard in the first half especially was outrageous. To be involved would be a dream come true. I remember speaking to John Terry at Villa about it and he said when you stand there and hear the Champions League anthem there is nothing better.”

Grealish described leaving Villa for a six-year contract with City as “one of the toughest decisions I have ever had to make”, but one made for the betterment of his career.

He said: “I reported back for pre-season as I was meant to. It was obviously difficult because in the back of my head I knew I might be going so I didn’t really train, I just did a few things on my own.

“ Everyone saw the way Messi was at his final press conference [with Barcelona] and that is the exact way I felt myself. Before I left, I spoke to the team and staff at the hotel and teared up a bit myself but I felt it was time for me to move on.

“I have always said I wanted to play Champions League football and I couldn’t do that at Villa this year. I am at a club here that has so much potential and is the most successful English side of the last 10 years. They showed so much faith in me and I felt it was the right time.”

The former Villa captain cited trophies, Guardiola and playing alongside Kevin De Bruyne as other factors in his decision to move and admitted securing a regular role in the England team before next year’s World Cup was another reason to join the champions.

Grealish said: “I feel if I am performing for Manchester City week in, week out and performing in the Champions League it could set me up to have a brilliant future with the national team and help me start in the World Cup and in the qualifiers.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dawn Scott will leave her position as the Football Association’s senior women’s physical performance manager at the end of September.

Scott, who joined the FA for a second spell in 2019 after an original nine-year stint, will step down in just over seven weeks to pursue a management role elsewhere.

Scott said: “It has been a privilege to come back home and support England and Team GB over the past 20 months – the players have been brilliant to work with and I will miss those interactions.

“Having worked in the field for over 20 years now, I am still passionate about supporting the growth of women’s football, as well as my own professional development.

“I plan to take some time out and initially work on some exciting projects with Fifa aimed at developing physical performance strategies designed specifically for women. I wish [incoming England head coach] Sarina [Wiegman] and her team the best of luck, and will be supporting from the stands next summer.”

The FA’s director of women’s football, Baroness Sue Campbell, said: “Dawn’s impact on individual players has been immense. Every player knows she has their performance and welfare at heart and her detailed preparation and execution are world class.

“We have been enormously privileged to have had Dawn work with us for the past two years. She is meticulous in her work and sets very high performance standards. Her care and concern for every player has been exceptional and we know they will miss her greatly.

“We respect and support Dawn’s decision to further her career in a senior management role outside the FA and we wish her every success in the future.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Leo Messi’s dreams of lining up in the same Paris Saint-Germain team as Ander Herrera, Mauro Icardi and Idrissa Gueye could be dashed, following reports from Spain that the trio are among up to 10 players the French side are hoping to offload in a bid to trim their ludicrously large wage bill after their low-key signing of the Argentinian free agent.

Quite who they hope will buy them is anyone’s guess, given the manner in which they’ve completely distorted the European market by offering absurdly bloated salaries – even by the standards of football – that few if any European clubs will be able to match.

For what it’s worth, the striker Icardi has recently been linked with a move to Roma as a potential replacement for Internazionale-bound Edin Dzeko, while a possible return to Manchester United for the popular Herrera doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility. Sensible chap that he is, Gueye has already turned up his nose at the prospect of a loan move to Newcastle.

Tammy Abraham is another striker being linked with Roma, a state of affairs that hasn’t precluded Thomas Tuchel from including the 23-year-old in Chelsea’s squad for Wednesday night’s Uefa Super Cup ding-dong with Villarreal. The player himself is reported to be eager to stay in the Premier League and has already agreed personal terms with Arsenal. Speaking before the match at Belfast’s Windsor Park, Tuchel refused to give any clues on what the short-term future holds for Abraham but did confirm he understood the player’s dissatisfaction with life at Stamford Bridge.

“He has reason not to be happy after the lack of game time last season but it’s maybe also my fault for not trusting him as much as other players,” said the German. “He wants more minutes so the decision will be does he want to fight his way back into the team here or does he want to change to be a regular starter elsewhere?

“That’s completely up to him and I understand, it’s quite a normal situation. But right now he’s with us and available for the team tomorrow.”

With Jonny Evans and Wesley Fofana sidelined indefinitely, Leicester are in the market for a central defender and have identified Southampton’s Jannik Vestergaard as just the man to fill the gaping hole in their back four. Valued at between £15m and £20m with only two years left on his current deal, the 29-year-old Dane has also been getting the glad eye from West Ham boss David Moyes and is believed to be keen on a move away from the south coast.

The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.

Leicester are also believed to be interested in Bologna’s Takehiro Tomiyasu but will have to outbid Tottenham if they are to secure the Japanese 22-year-old’s scrawl.

And finally, the Royal Antwerp right-back Aurélio Buta is wanted by Celtic, whose hopes of luring him to Glasgow have been dealt what can only be described as “a blow” by reported interest from Everton. The Angola-born former Portugal youth international is reported to be available for less than £5m and is apparently viewed by Everton scouts as an upgrade on Jonjoe Kenny, who is currently first in line to Seamus Coleman’s right-back throne.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Guardian writers’ predicted position: 2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Jamie Jackson’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)

Last season’s position: 2nd

Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 8-1

The Plan

A 21st title is Manchester United’s ambition so if there is failure again this venerable institution will embark on their latest inquest. The autopsies have run through seven editions and four managers, including the incumbent, Ole Gunnar Solskjær. David Moyes’s 34-league-match tenure: bottom line, job too big for the Scot. The two terms of Louis van Gaal: sluggish style of play. José Mourinho’s two-and-a-half-season stint: fractious/past his best. Solskjær’s two full campaigns: third and second but can he really take United that final, golden step?

Note the pattern: two complete seasons is the most any of Alex Ferguson’s successors have managed. If Solskjær remains until next summer he will set a new mark (make it to mid-December and it will be three years since he took over – initially in caretaker mode). Should the Norwegian follow his post-Ferguson title-less predecessors then his brave new world may be cast as being as unprogressive as those of Moyes, Van Gaal and Mourinho.

If Champions League qualification is secured, though, will the owners care? The Glazers are at an interesting juncture in a deeply unpopular 16-year ownership. A point where fan-engagement-phobic proprietors have been forced to do that very thing. When the Americans signed up to the European Super League and Joel agreed to be vice-chairman this was a seismic strategic blunder, as a fresh wave of anti-Glazer feeling was released. Withdrawal from the ESL was followed by protests on 5 May outside Old Trafford and The Lowry, the team hotel, which caused Liverpool’s visit to be postponed after the stadium was broken into and violence occurred in the Munich Tunnel.

The fallout: a frantic damage-limitation scramble that had the Glazers promising to create a fan advisory board to liaise with them and Joel engaging with the club’s official fans’ forum. Frantic because of commercial imperative: a £200m training kit sponsorship deal with THG was lost after fury channelled into digital guerrilla warfare that incorporated the online targeting of United’s 23 “Global Partners” – as billed on the club’s website – .

What of the squad? Solskjær is trying to upgrade quality and depth, with the arrivals of the forward Jadon Sancho and centre-back Raphaël Varane fine starts, and the Atlético Madrid full-back Kieran Tripper being pursued. Varane brings World Cup-, Champions League- and La Liga-winning talent. Trippier is wanted for the “defensive animal” qualities cited by Gareth Southgateand a being dead-ball threat.

Even if Trippier is acquired United will remain light in midfield and at centre-forward, unless strengthened. West Ham’s Declan Rice, who is of interest, would add muscle, guile and a less recognised penchant for forward surges to an area of the pitch where only Scott McTominay convinces. Paul Pogba can operate there but prefers a free role; Fred is of substitute-level ability; Nemanja Matic is way past his peak; and Donny van de Beek appeared to be in detention during his first season after he was bought by Solskjær and never given a run in the side.

At No 9 Harry Kane would be the dream ticket but that is a (virtual) non-starter so Solskjær may well end the window having to cross everything that Edinson Cavani – 35 in February and prone to niggles – can stay fit and prolific enough, for long enough.

What, too, of the goalkeeper situation where Dean Henderson had dislodged David de Gea only to commit enough howlers for Solskjær to (seem to) give the Spaniard another chance at last season’s fag end?

Solskjær may switch from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3 so the following could be his best proposition if he lands Trippier: De Gea/Henderson; Trippier, Maguire, Varane, Shaw; McTominay, Fernandes, Pogba; Sancho, Cavani/Greenwood, Rashford.

Is it strong enough?

The manager

Solskjær is constructing a considerable squad. What he is yet to do is win something – May’s Europa League final penalty shootout defeat by Villarreal a desultory performance and disappointing result. Until Solskjær gets his hands on a trophy the naysayers will remain, a corps whose main reservation is that he is a mini-Alex Ferguson without the winner’s creed. A lingering question concerns whether Solskjær is a manager with a plan beyond hitting sides via quick breaks. A counter might be that this is lazy carping and/or that even if correct does it matter? His strategy took United to second last season with what surely no one believes was a superior squad to Manchester City’s.

Key player

Luke Shaw. A left-back, you say? Yes, because at Euro 2020 United players’ player of the season was even better than on the domestic front: a true point of attack for England and a formidable defender, sticking his head in to save the side, while a technical ability that would grace a maverick midfielder also impressed. Shaw has shown fortitude in coming back from a double leg break and a near-character assassination by Mourinho during the Portuguese manager’s time at Old Trafford. It leaves Solskjær with another bona fide leader in the ranks.

The owners

The proprietors are so reviled by large swathes of the fanbase that their name could be deployed as a byword for alienating supporters – as in doing “a Glazers”. The main charge against the American family is 16 years old and is the leveraged purchase of the club (interest owed, circa £455m). The most recent is the European Super League debacle. Slack (close to nonexistent) communication is another count: one the owners have at least begun to address. Can they ever make themselves popular? It seems as doubtful as United changing shirt colour to sky blue.

Euros factor

Harry Maguire entered as an injury doubt and ended as a billboard act whose waltzes from defence into midfield gave England a fluid back-to-front dimension and had him selected for the team of the tournament. This crowned an impressive turnaround from the dog days of last August when after two nights in a Greek prison cell he was convicted of aggravated assault, resisting arrest and attempted bribery. Maguire denies wrongdoing and has appealed. He may not be the fleetest of foot but the football brain is sharp.

We’ll be singing

The comedic element of Fulham’s visit to Old Trafford for last season’s first home game with fans was the clear and constant grumbling from United enthusiasts seated near this correspondent. After 13 months away there was still no will to allow a player/referee an easy break and simply celebrate being back. Expect more of this plus hymns to Sancho of which one, surely, has to feature a stanza that taunts Manchester City who he “rejected for Borussia Dortmund before choosing his true love” – except in fruitier language.

Back to Old Trafford

The good The history created at the stadium is rich and storied and it is always a joy to see night-time European competition there.

The bad Seating is cramped in a venue that needs dragging into the 21st century. Even worse it is hardly a cauldron of noise from first whistle to last.

The crest

Twenty-three years have passed since “Football Club” was removed and “United” replaced these words at the bottom of the badge with “Manchester” at the top. It provoked a response that this was an unedifying nod to the corporate world and that United were keen to thrive in that as a brand not a football club. The pitchfork-wielding red devil is for the Matt Busby-given nickname.

Trending topics

“United have drawn their first two games – Ole has to go!”

“Five years and still no one knows Pogba’s best position!”

“We will never win anything with McFred in midfield.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Southampton have signed the Chelsea forward Armando Broja on a season’s loan and striker Adam Armstrong from Blackburn in a deal worth up to £15m.

Saints targeted the 24-year-old Armstrong, who scored 29 goals last season, as a replacement for Ings, who joined Aston Villa last week. The striker has signed a four-year deal at St Mary’s.

“It’s unbelievable to be here – such a massive club with a great fanbase and it’s just something that I’m really looking forward to,” Armstrong said. “I thought it was perfect as my next step. I wanted to get back to the Premier League from what I’ve done for Blackburn, so I’m over the moon.”

Broja, who spent the 2020-21 campaign on loan at Vitesse in the Netherlands and turns 20 next month, gives them further options. He got 11 goals in 34 appearances to help Vitesse to finish fourth in the Eredivisie.

“Armando is a very talented player who we were impressed by last season,” said Southampton’s manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl. “He is young, but he comes now with a full season of experience in senior football with a good team and he brings a lot of qualities that can help us. He is a strong, quick player with a good instinct.”

Armstrong, who had less than 12 months remaining on his contract, also attracted interest from Crystal Palace and Norwich. Blackburn had been holding out for closer to £20m but Saints made a breakthrough with their latest bid.

Armstrong was left out of Blackburn’s squad for their opening-day victory against Swansea on Saturday. Newcastle, who sold Armstrong to Blackburn in 2018, are due 40% of the profit from the sale.

Broja, an Albania international, is the third player to move this summer from Chelsea to Southampton, who have also signed the teenagers Tino Livramento and Dynel Simeu.

Ings scored 41 league goals in 91 games for Southampton in three years and he was top scorer in each season.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Premier League has announced fans are set to be subject to random spot checks of their Covid-19 status at some grounds in the opening few weeks of the new season.

The 2021-22 campaign, with supporters returning to stadiums following the easing of coronavirus restrictions, kicks off on Friday when Brentford host Arsenal.

In a statement released on Monday regarding matchday protocols, the Premier League said fans going to games should be prepared to show they have been fully vaccinated or have received a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours, via their NHS Covid pass through the NHS app or website link.

And it said: “Initially, in the first few matchdays of the season, supporters can expect the introduction of random spot checks for ticket holders at some grounds as we establish the required processes so clubs and fans are prepared for all match attenders to have their Covid-19 status checked upon arrival, should it become mandatory.”

The league also said fans must comply with a supporter code of conduct, and stressed the importance of wearing masks in indoor areas, avoiding close contact with people you do not know and following one-way signage around stadiums.

The statement added: “Even though the nation is reopening, the government has made it clear that this pandemic is still far from over. It is possible the safety measures for matches could be subject to change at short notice. Fans should continue to follow the latest public health guidance and guidance from their club.

“However, even in these uncertain times we are optimistic that by continuing to work together with fans, supporter groups, football stakeholders, national government and local authorities everyone can enjoy full and vibrant stadiums while staying safe from Covid-19.

“The Premier League will continue consulting with all key stakeholders, including the Football Supporters’ Association, and will be running a series of fan-engagement campaigns to help all ticket holders ensure they are match-ready.”

The government swept away restrictions on capacity limits on 19 July, and these are now decided at local level. There remains uncertainty over whether so-called “vaccine passports” might be introduced – either across the board or at venues holding 20,000 or more spectators – from the end of September.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær says the club has showed its ambition by agreeing deals to sign Jadon Sancho and Raphaël Varane. Sancho has completed his move from Borussia Dortmund, while Varane should soon follow from Real Madrid subject to a medical.

'The club has showed its ambition with one of the most exciting forwards in world football and one of the most respected centre-backs in the world,' said Solskjær.

Sometimes The Fiver struggles to believe the horrors that continue to occur in a supposedly civilised society. We are three days away from a new Premier League season, yet still nobody has published the definitive piece that quantifies how much we should expect Jadon Sancho to improve Manchester’s United Expected Goals. There’s no time for such soulful analysis because, although the new season is almost upon us, transfers are still the only thing anyone is talking about.

This is what happens when the start of the season and the closing of the transfer window overlap. Uefa, the FA or whoever runs this thing of ours need to prioritise what’s important. The Fiver has a simple solution: the 2022-23 season must start on 1 September, so that actual football no longer has any chance of impinging upon our maladaptive daydreams about what might happen if such and such sign so and so and play him in such and such a position.

Yep, it’s been another big day for those who have shares in Jim White. (Yes, yes, we know he’s left Sky but he’s still doing the business elsewhere, and it’ll always be Jim White Day, at least in our souls.) There’s only one place to start, and that’s with the news that Romelu Lukaku will soon – possibly by the time you read this, in which case today’s Fiver was an exercise in futility even by our market-leading standards - complete his £97.5m move to Chelsea.

It’s seven years since Chelsea sold Lukaku to Everton for £28m, which means they have effectively received a loan fee of minus £69.5m for giving seven of his peak years to Everton, Manchester United and Internazionale. Not that any of this is Thomas Tuchel’s fault, or lookout. “Romelu is one of the guys like [Erling] Haaland at Dortmund, [Robert] Lewandowski at Bayern Munich, Harry Kane at Tottenham, who is a real No 9 who loves to score and who has a presence in the box,” said Tuchel before bursting into a chorus of “don’t want no false, false nine” while thrusting his hips and throwing his hands enigmatically.

Lukaku’s arrival has extinguished the 0.0001% chance Tammy Abraham had of being allowed within 100 yards of a football on Tuchel’s watch. Instead he must comfort in the warm, loving bosom of José Mourinho, whose Roma side have had a bid of £34m accepted. José’s up to something, but we’ve given up trying to work out what it is.

Another Chelsea forward, the teenage Albania international Armando Broja, has joined Southampton on a season-long loan. Southampton are also hoping to buy Adam Armstrong from Blackburn. He and Broja will act as replacements for Danny Ings, who in turn is one of 47 Jack Grealish replacements signed by Aston Villa.

Norwich have bought the American forward Josh Sargent from Werder Bremen, while Brighton have signed the Japan international midfielder Kaoru Mitoma, who will go straight to Belgium on loan. And former light entertainer John Stones has signed a new five-year deal at Manchester City. We’ve saved the biggest news for last. Leo Ostigard has moved on loan from Brighton to Stoke, where he hopes to prove once and for all that he can do it on a wet, windy night.

FIVER LETTERS

“I was disappointed to see that it wan’t Mr Messi’s fault that he had to leave his beloved Barcelona. If so, I was going to write a Fiver letter punning about ‘Lionel Itchy’ to leave. But I guess I’ve done that now anyway …” – Gerry Rickard.

“Funny enough, the discussion about Fantasy Football names (Fiver letters passim) came up with a colleague just today with the news Adam Armstrong will play alongside not just Stuart Armstrong at Southampton, but also Che Adams, just to really grate on commentators dealing with Adams and Armstrongs. It could be especially entertaining when they play Aston Villa, what with the dynamic duo of Mings and Ings. You have to feel for Paul Merson if he ends up on that game for Soccer Saturday, don’t you?” – Ferg Slade.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Magnus Carlsen has never won the biennial World Cup knockout, and the No 1 was eliminated in Tuesday’s semi-finals of its $190,000 2021 renewal in Sochi. Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda, 23, again proved himself a nemesis on big occasions for Norway’s world champion, and went on to win the tournament.

Last autumn, Duda ended Carlsen’s record 125-game unbeaten run and was congratulated by his namesake Andrzej Duda, president of Poland. This week, the chess-playing Duda did still better as he defeated Sergey Karjakin, the 2016 title challenger, in the World Cup final. Their first game was a speedy draw, but in the second Duda was well prepared against a fashionable counter to the Queen’s Gambit. Karjakin never got in the game and resigned just a pawn down but with a poor position.

Duda’s success has qualified him for the eight-player 2022 Candidates, which will decide the next world title challenger following the 2021 match, in which Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi takes on Carlsen over 14 games in November-December in Dubai. The Krakow student will be the first world title candidate ever to represent Poland.

From a world top 20 player Duda has suddenly jumped to the verge of the top 10, and at age 23 his best years still lie ahead. Decades ago, the legends Miguel Najdorf and Samuel Reshevsky were both Polish-born, but they competed in the Candidates as representatives of Argentina and the US.

Duda’s decisive win against Carlsen came after they made three uneventful draws. He outplayed his opponent strategically in a position where the Norwegian had little active play for his pieces, just like the rising star Andrey Esipenko, 19, in his two 2021 wins against the champion.

Carlsen’s opening choice against the Sicilian 1 e4 c5 went wrong as 2 Nf3 d6 3 Bb5+ Bd7 4 Bxd7+ Qxd7 soon turned into a kind of French where Black had exchanged light-squared bishops and could infiltrate Carlsen’s dark squared pawn front.

The world champion’s body language looked static and uncomfortable as his position worsened. Later, he admitted that he felt defeatist about his impending elimination in a position where Duda controlled the board with little counterplay, and this state of mind contributed to his missed drawing chances when Duda, short of time, erred in the bishop ending.

Freed of the burden of expectations in the third place play-off on Wednesday and Thursday, Carlsen overwhelmed Russia’s Vladimir Fedoseev 2-0 with imaginative attacking play. First he won with Black in a King’s Indian where White’s army was comically squashed into the right-hand corner, and then, even more crushingly, as White in a Caro-Kann 1 e4 c6.

The Women’s World Cup also had a surprise outcome as Alexandra Kosteniuk, 37, who won the event in 2008 when it doubled as a world championship, defeated the top seed, Aleksandra Goryachkina, 22, by bold attacking play.

It was a victory to savour for Kosteniuk. “When you’re young and you win, you don’t really appreciate it that much,” she said. “When you become older, every win is like something unbelievable and you start to appreciate it much more.”

The 2021 World Cup counts as an important success and a milestone in the return of normal over-the-board chess, especially since the Covid-19 cases at the start were absent in later rounds. It advanced the careers of Duda, Esipenko, and several younger talents, while the lone English entrant, Ravi Haria, twice beat highly rated grandmasters and strengthened his reputation as a rising star.

International online play continues this week with the Chessable Masters, the penultimate event in the Meltwater Champions Tour which concludes at San Francisco in September.

Wesley So has been a standout player on the Tour and the only one who can compete consistently with Carlsen. The US champion was rocked when Jorden van Foreest trounced him in 19 moves in classical attacking style, but So is resilient and still won their match. The Chessable Masters concludes this weekend (3.45pm start) with semi-finals on Friday and the final on Saturday-Sunday.

3775: 1 Be5+! Kc6 2 Ra6+ Kd7 3 Rxe6! Kxe6 4 f5+ Kxf5 5 Bxg3 and wins. The white king captures both black pawns, then escorts White’s h pawn to promotion. With K+B+h pawn v K, the bishop needs to control the queening square.

Mutaz Essa Barshim and Gianmarco Tamberi are deadlocked in the men’s high jump final, so an official explains what happens next, but nope. Instead: “History, bro” for the rivals and firm friends.

Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands falls on the final lap of her 1500m heat, “leaving her hopes of qualifying in tatters” – you might stupidly think. Meanwhile Peru’s Angelo Caro Narvaez provides a key first in skateboarding’s Games bow.

2) Today and tomorrow it’s race-walkin’ time. In 2000, Australia’s Jane Saville prepares to enter Sydney’s Olympic stadium with a comfortable cushion, and then … not so much.

Four years ago at the world championships in London, China’s Lu Xiuzhi – in the bronze medal position – is shown the red card five seconds before the finish. At Rio 2016, France’s world-record holder Yohann Diniz was a man on a mission. Unfortunately he was also suffering what we’ll tastefully describe as “intestinal problems”. He led at halfway before suddenly stopping at the 33km mark. After some swift, subtle work with a sponge, he continued, only to suffer a shocking collapse. And yet he batted away the attentions of officials to plough on, finishing eighth.

3) More official-swatting to mark Thursday’s men’s 400m final: 29 years ago in Barcelona, Jim Redmond memorably gave his son Derek a helping hand. More one-lap memories from Michael Johnson at Atlanta 1996 (where he did this too), and then again in his Sydney swansong; there’s no dream defence for Wayde van Niekerk this year, but we’ll always have his stunning sneak attack on the world record from lane eight in Rio. Ninety-seven years ago in Paris, Eric Liddell put the hammer down and gave Vangelis a story to soundtrack.

Friday sees the women take centre-stage in the event, but it’ll take some performance to eclipse Cathy Freeman. And, from downtown at Beijing 2008, Christine Ohuruogu. Last time out saw a thriller between Shaunae Miller-Uibo and Allyson Felix.

4) Saturday sees another Lions series decider. In 2017 against the All Blacks, it was all to play for at Eden Park … and honours ended even. Four years earlier, Sydney hosted a markedly less tense final Test, thanks to Leigh Halfpenny and George North.

4) Andreas Pereira, pre-season specialist for Manchester United against Brentford. Joe Willock rues the absence of a beep in the ref’s ear in defeat by Chelsea. Dartford turn on the style against Southend. A fairly regulation equaliser for Wolves at Stoke, but a nice moment as Raúl Jiménez returns to scoring ways.

Meanwhile, just the seven goals in 34 minutes for Fiorentina’s Dusan Vlahovic in an 11-0 victory over amateur side Polisportiva C4 Foligno.

6) Fifty-five years ago today: Garry Sobers clobbered England all over Headingley as West Indies cantered to an innings victory. Forty-nine years ago today: Patrick Ewing was born, so here are 10 big moments from the Knicks mainstay. Sadly, Colin McRae, born on this day in 1968, is no longer with us but ample evidence of his staggering command of a rally car remains.

1) Just tap it in, nice and easy, move on to the next hole … oh. A concise selection of gruesome missed gimme putts.

2) Kimi Raikkonen does Nascar.

3) More friendly fire: Pepe adds a trademark touch of nark for Porto v Roma.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Start all the clocks, plug in the telephone … Joe Willock’s to sign following his half-season loan. Yes, the Mill’s back, albeit operating on pandemic-enforced “half-power” mode.

“Where have you been? What have we missed? Feed me etc,” we hear you cry (one email and counting). To bring you up to speed, the window so far has been a typically elaborate session of Cones of Dunshire, with long pre-announced England striker departure getting messy and Lionel Messi testing the salt-water-repelling properties of a lectern as he laments leaving Barcelona, (checks notes) contrary to his wishes.

With either Manchester City or Nuno looking to get their way re: Harry Kane, and PSG simply the only option for Messi if we’re all abiding by both the spirit and the letter of financial fair play, probably best to find other levels to this summer’s 3D chess.

With that in mind: howsabout Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain back to Southampton. The suddenly 27-year-old, having slotted seamlessly into the Adam Lallana role of “back from injury problems but not really trusted to actually play all that much” at Liverpool, is being lined up for what one source comically refers to as an “ambitious” move by the Saints, who he left a full decade ago this very week.

Potentially on the way out of St Mary’s is Jannik Vestergaard, with Brendan Rodgers once again finding himself light on defenders at Leicester after Wesley Fofana’s grim fibula fracture. West Ham are also having a look-see at the stern Danish defender.

Back in L4, Jürgen Klopp is apparently eyeing Aurélien Tchouameni to fill the hole in the middle of Anfield ploughed by Georginio Wijnaldum. The France Under-21s midfielder, who enjoyed a breakthrough season at Monaco last time out, is also the subject of fluttering eyelashes from Juventus.

The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.

Tammy Abraham has read Tommy Tuchel’s tealeaves at Chelsea, and with Romelu Lukaku seemingly on the way, the occasional England forward will be making his own way to the Do One Door ta very much. José Mourinho may be the man sending a car, with Roma really quite interested, and “long-term replacement for Edin Dzeko” the label on the poisoned chalice that potentially awaits.

Last but by no means least, Willock’s expected permanent move to St James’ Park could help untangle the kite string keeping Mikel Arteta from Aaron Ramsdale. Sheffield United, who were looking around bemused, wondering quite what they would do without him, have now realised that another keeper is probably the answer, with QPR’s Seny Dieng looking just the man.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It is Saturday evening in Cape Town Stadium and up goes the final restart. There is no audible roar around the empty arena, just an inner screech of locked-in tension. The scores are tied and, entering the last minute of a hugely controversial series, the outcome remains unclear. As the ball descends and the Springbok forwards surge towards the waiting Lions receiver, 12 years of intense anticipation have come down to this.

At which point let’s press the pause button. Imagine the would-be catcher is the Lions and Wales hooker Ken Owens. Put yourself in his position. In 2017 it was the “accidental” offside call against “The Sheriff” at a similar juncture of the tied All Blacks series that shaped the whole outcome. By the letter of the law the referee Romain Poite should have awarded a penalty, only for the Lions captain Sam Warburton to ask for the decision to be referred upstairs. A scrum was the result. Was justice served? The answer, even now, mostly depends on the part of the world from which you hail.

Now let’s imagine a similar scenario happening again. Owens fumbles the ball and one of his teammates – let’s say Maro Itoje – inadvertently grabs the rebound for a split second whilst standing in an offside position. The referee Mathieu Raynal – another Frenchman – has a decision to make and an unavoidable precedent. Already, though, he can hear Alun Wyn Jones calling out “Monsieur” and can sense a certain Springbok waterboy sprinting towards him. Up in the stands the television match official is clutching his head in his hands. How on earth did it come to this?

We do not yet know, of course, how the final reel of this particular Hammer horror show will play out. But all concerned already know – with a nagging sense of dread – that liberal helpings of sod’s law appear to feature in the tour agreement. The highest profile series of all minus any expansive rugby? Tick. Referee-influencing shithousery on an unprecedented scale? Tick. Open season on rugby’s reputation, integrity and values? Tick. Tick. Tick.

Part of the whole appeal of elite sport, clearly, is the element of jeopardy. Not knowing what is going happen next is the beauty of it. But maybe now is the moment, with this sulphurous-fumed series still undecided, to put a foot on the ball, suspend partisan loyalties and ask whether it has to be like this. Could the supposed holy grail really exist? A major tour or tournament where the players live in less fear of officiating confusion, where clarity rules OK and where a monumental refereeing row does not pollute the entire narrative?

It may be too late to heal all the unsightly sores opened up on this tour but, hopefully, World Rugby will have realised enough is enough. Matches have become ridiculously stop-start and cynical gamesmanship is increasingly rife, on and off the field. The world’s governing body have taken their time issuing a strong statement but, whatever happens, these are three immediate tweaks they can make.

The first is to instruct the TMO to butt out and leave virtually all in-game decisions to the on-field officials, save for the option of reviewing forward passes, feet in touch or players potentially in front of the kicker prior to a try being scored. If a grounding beneath a heap of bodies looks likely on the balance of probabilities, award it, as happens at every other level of the sport. If not, move on.

Next up, foul play. Again, if it is clear and obvious let the officials decide. If they are unsure or unsighted stick the player on report – as in rugby league – and pore over the replays afterwards. Added to the list can be players who feign injury, gesticulate at the touch judge or pat an opponent condescendingly on the head when a mistake is made. Charges of unsportsmanlike behaviour should also be possible if a coach or director of rugby posts self-serving, referee-knocking clips on social media.

Third is the banning of all headsets on the field, aside from the referee’s microphone, and allowing only one waterboy per team. If anyone else wants a drink they must go to the sideline or await the next break in play. If there are injuries, the game will not stop unless there is a potentially serious head injury or a player in obvious distress.

Sign up for The Breakdown.

Slowly but surely, in other words, rugby needs to be pulled from the mire of stoppages and red tape into which it has descended. And then what? Miraculously, the pace of the game will pick up again, with fatigue becoming more of a factor. Players who bellyache or whinge on the field will have to shut up or risk a sanction. Coaches who micro-manage their teams will only be able to do so during the week. Technology will continue to play an important role but more as an educational aid than as a tool to sway officials during a game.

And, who knows. Maybe rugby could yet be dragged back from the edge of the abyss upon which it currently hangs. Maybe older fans will feel like reconnecting with the irresistible spirit which attracted them to the game in the first place. Younger audiences will be struck by a competitive valour and sportsmanship few other sports can match. And just maybe, when Owens stands beneath his next series-defining high ball, there will be a greater chance of a happier, less divisive ending for all.

And finally …

This is the final Breakdown column of a uniquely long rugby union season, stretching all the way back to last August when the Covid-interrupted 2019-20 Premiership campaign resumed. It’s time for a short break. On behalf of everyone at Guardian Sport, many thanks to all our subscribers and see you again in a few weeks’ time.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“There was a horse called Zlatan running at Ascot. Is it possible to make a starting XI from racehorses named after footballers? And what would be the best team?” asks George Jones.

Jonathan Bartley has covered a furlong or two with an extensive answer, highlighting that in the UK and Ireland alone each year there are roughly 20,000 foals born into the racing industry, meaning there’s ample potential for this. However, his research also raises some pertinent additional questions …

“1) Does the horse have to have shown any talent? A horse called Schmeichel ran 10 times in Ireland between 1992 and 1994, but could only be considered a racehorse in a very loose sense. If you allow yourself to include all horses who have ever raced it naturally gets much easier.

2) Is the horse definitely named after the footballer? I would expect that a horse called Zidane (winner of the Stewards’ Cup at Goodwood in 2007 was named after Zinedine Zidane, but is a horse called Smith likely to be named after Alan Smith?

3) Do we allow nicknames or events? Tom George’s The Romford Pele is clearly named after Ray Parlour, but do you allow Gerrard’s Slip?” We’d say yes.

He then provides two teams. Firstly, “horses who share a name with a footballer and have shown some actual talent (defined as placing or better in a Group 1 race):

Talented Horses XI (4-1-3-2) [David] Marshall (Third G1 Criterium de Saint-Cloud)



Lauren[s] (Six-times G1 winner in UK/France/Ireland)

[Miguel Ángel] Nadal (Won G1 Arkansas Derby)

[Rio] Ferdinand (Won G1 Kentucky Derby and G1 Breeders Cup Classic)

[Dennis] Irwin (Second in G1 Gran Premio Estrellas Juvenile at Palermo)



[Roy] Keane (Won G1 Gran Premio Dardo Rocha at La Plata)



Johan Cruyff (Second in G1 Hong Kong Gold Cup at Sha Tin)

[Zvonimir] Boban (Multiple G1 winner in Australia)

[Lionel] Messi (Third in G1 Northern Dancer Turf Stakes at Woodbine)



[Mario] Kempes (Won Irish Gold Cup at Leopardstown)

[Ruud] Van Nistelrooy (Second in G1 National Stakes)



Coach: Roy H[odgson] (Twice won G1 Breeders’ Cup Sprint)

Secondly, horses “unambiguously named after footballers who have not necessarily competed at the highest level (criteria here is that they have to have won a race of some description):

Kempes, ridden by David Casey, on the way to Irish Gold Cup glory at Leopardstown in 2011. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA

Definitive Names XI (4-2-2-2, with a couple of makeshift full-backs) Fox Kasper [Schmeichel] (Won a maiden at Ripon in 2002)



[Virgil] Van Dijk (Three-times winner for Antony Brittain in 2021)

Sir Billy Wright (Multiple winner for David Evans)

John Terry (Three-times winner for Amanda Perrett)

Kool [Vincent] Kompany (Won G2 Railway Stakes at The Curragh in 2014) Yorkshire Pirlo [Kalvin Philips] (Won a maiden at Southwell in 2020)

[Steven] Gerrard’s Slip (Won a maiden at Southwell in 2015)



[Roberto] Baggio (Won six races in Ireland)

[Zinedine] Zidane (Won the Stewards Cup in 2007)

Ooh Ah [Eric] Cantona (Five-times race winner in the 1990s)



[Salvatore] Schillaci (Multiple G1 winner in Australia)



Coach: [Marcelo] Bielsa (Three-times winner for Kevin Ryan in 2019).”

Managers injuring players in training

“Have any other managers ‘done a Rooney’ and injured players in training?” enquires John Blythe.

Colm McAuliffe immediately had the words “Graeme Souness” spring to mind, recalling an incident in which the Scotsman severely injured Dwight Yorke while in charge at Blackburn. He takes up the story: “Andy Cole later recalled: ‘Souness did Dwight in a tackle in training, causing a gash so deep in his shin that you could see the white of his bone. He could have broken his leg. Dwight was still spitting bullets when I heard the commotion as he slaughtered Souness in the canteen – right in front of Blackburn’s chief executive’ … which rather sums up that rancorous period in Blackburn’s recent history.”

Meanwhile, Diarmuid Daly offers up a tale from October 2004:C“News emerged that Sunderland midfielder and Republic of Ireland international Colin Healy had re-broken his leg in training; this was as Healy was on his way back from a previous double leg break suffered 10 months earlier. Rumours soon surfaced that manager Mick McCarthy was responsible for the tackle that did the damage, rumours that the former Ireland manager denied. However more recently former Sunderland striker Chris Brown, who was playing in the training game in question, confirms that McCarthy was indeed the culprit.”

Good with a ball and on a bike

“Professional cyclist Remco Evenepoel was a Belgium youth footballer and played at PSV Eindhoven and Anderlecht but never signed a professional contract,” notes Graham Stockwell. “Has any professional cyclist also played professional football?”

All eyes on Belgium for this, reckons Joran: “Greg Van Avermaet kept goal in Sint Truidense VV’s youth team – at the same time as Simon Mignolet – before going on to win gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics.”

Meanwhile, JP Hunting suggests “walking ego” Roger De Vlaeminck, who played for his local team Eeklo as a teenager. “I remember reading an interview where he was very confident he would have had an amazing career in football if he’d wanted to,” JP adds. “His cycling rivalry with fellow Belgian Eddy Merckx also extended to who was the best footballer as they used to regularly used to participate in kickabouts back in the 70s.

Ian Pugh got in touch in October 2004 after QPR went on a record run: “A list was published of their run back in Division Three South in the early 1930s. One of the teams they beat was ‘Thames’. I’ve never heard of this team. Where did they play? Did they change their name? Or did they merely fold?”

Thames started life in 1928 and finished it very shortly after. The club was founded by the owners of West Ham stadium, home not to West Ham United but to speedway and greyhounds, who were looking for ways to make some extra cash.

The club started life in the Southern League, finishing third in their second season and pipping Aldershot to a spot in the Third Division when Merthyr weren’t re-elected. Over the next two seasons Thames played 84 games, won 20, drew 17, and lost 47 – conceding 202 goals. They finished bottom with just 23 points in 1931-32, and promptly resigned from the league. Bad news for Leyton Orient, fellow strugglers hankering after a merger (and cheap rent); good news for Aldershot, who replaced them.

Thames did set one record in their brief existence however, and it’s one they still hold: the lowest league attendance for a single game. Despite playing home games in a 50,000 capacity stadium, the glut of local sides meant Thames never really cut it on the east London scene. The atmosphere must have been electric on December 6 1930, when Thames beat Luton Town 1-0 in front of a whopping 469 fans.

Can you help?

“By the end of the second matchday, no team in the Polish Ekstraklasa has a 100% record (each time has at least drawn),” toots Paul Vickers. “Has this ever happened sooner, ie each team drawing in the first week anywhere? And what is the soonest it has happened in the English top flight?”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The new season is already here and our cartoonist takes a look at some of the summer EFL stories
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The first Test against India starts on Wednesday at Trent Bridge, with barely an ahem; let alone a ta-da. It has been a peculiarly modest buildup to a five-Test series, to what Virat Kohli calls “the absolute pinnacle of the game”. This is no reflection on India, but on a sport-soaked summer, the Euros wallchart barely pulled from the fridge before the Olympic supplement kicked down the door, demanding immediate attention. Wimbledon barely got a look-in.

Throw in a vat of international white-ball men’s cricket, a women’s multi-format international series and then the Hundred, which seems to be shouting at me every time I pass the living room, and the weight of sport is almost overpowering. It is possible to flick from the Tokyo velodrome to the rhythmic gymnastics to two Hundred games and back to the Olympics again without clocking either the rising or setting sun. Certainly, my children are giving it their best shot.

India have been in the country long enough that they greeted the soon-to-be-fading summer. The players arrived in early June, the women for their red- and white-ball series against England before a handful joined various Hundred teams. The men came for the World Test Championship final against New Zealand, before taking a UK holiday and being snapped at various Instagram-able locations. There has been time for Rishabh Pant to catch Covid and recover, Shubman Gill to fly home with an injury, the opener Mayank Agarwal to develop concussion after being hit on the head by Mohammed Siraj in the nets and for Ravichandran Ashwin to take six for 27 to unpick Somerset’s second innings in his one County Championship game for Surrey. Not to mention a warm-up match against a County Select XI behind closed doors in Durham.

But the big buildup, the Jackanory narrative, England’s bid to avenge the winter’s 3-1 thrashing, that 81 all out and defeat in less than two days, India’s dreams of reversing their 4-1 defeat in 2018, has all been lost in the general noise. The most famous cricketer on the planet has been able to walk around in plain sight. In a few weeks, it won’t matter – England v India always develops an intriguing thread of its own and this time the meeting of the second- and fourth-ranked Test nations, led by two of the world’s best batters, are the first matches to be played in the new World Test Championship.

But one thing will not arrive this time round: the huge group of journalists that usually accompanies a travelling India team, reflecting the enormous interest back home. Hosting a series against India (in non-Covid times) usually involves press officers imaginatively using every spare inch of space – a quick mention here for those 41 kilos of biscuits consumed in the Old Trafford press box during India’s World Cup game with Pakistan in 2019.

But India was put on the government’s red list in April. India’s second wave, which at times overwhelmed the healthcare system, has peaked, but experts predict a third wave of infections in October, with less than 10% of the population fully vaccinated. The Centre for Global Development reported that excess deaths in India during the pandemic could be as high as 4.7 million, 10 times the official toll. Elite sportspeople and support staff have had an exemption for travel but though a few broadcast journalists have made the journey, there are currently no members of the written press.

I will miss their ability to slip into three languages during a chat about the merits of Rahul Dravid

This is obviously a real shame for Indian fans, whose writers cannot do on-the-spot reporting, but also for English readers and journalists. One of the best things about watching another touring team is the chance to spend time with, and learn from, the writers who come with them.

I will dearly miss my two best Indian buddies, Sharda Ugra, longtime of Cricinfo, now a freelance, and Neeru Bhatia, sportswriter of the Week magazine – the only time the three of us meet is when India tour. I will miss their friendship, of course, but also their insight on the India team, their gossip – gloriously scandalous – their acute observations on the team dynamics and their encyclopaedic knowledge of the background of India’s players.

I will miss their patient cultural explanations of this and that, their exasperation that restaurants in England close so early and their ability to slip into three languages during one short conversation about the longstanding merits of Rahul Dravid.

Sign up for The Spin.

Cricket is a beautiful vehicle for developing international friendships, as more and more cricketers are discovering through the less-highly charged world of franchise cricket – see India’s Jemimah Rodrigues and South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt, of Northern Superchargers, singing and playing the guitar together; Dale Steyn cheering on Mitchell Starc’s brother Brandon in the high jump at Tokyo; the closeness of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers as teammates at Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Ugra and Neeru are writing, brilliantly, about India’s women hockey players beating Australia to get through to the Olympic semi-final. They will be here in spirit for the Test series, but cricket lovers will be the poorer for their, and their compatriots’, absence from the press box.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Olympics may be thought mostly to be the preserve of the young, but there are some sports where experience brings an advantage. The Australian equestrian Mary Hanna is 66 – the oldest competitor atTokyo, her sixth Games.

Her teammate, Andrew Hoy, became Australia’s oldest Olympics medallist at 62, winning an individual bronze in the eventing after leading his team to silver. Asked whether age or experience was more important, he said: “Age.”

The Georgian shooter Nino Salukvadze, 52, is competing in her ninth Olympics, a record for a woman. She made her debut so long ago that she was representing the Soviet Union when she won gold as a teenager in Seoul in 1988.

Veteran status might not be a huge disadvantage when you’re on a horse or using a gun, but perhaps the most impressive seasoned Olympian at the Tokyo Games is Oksana Chusovitina. She turned 46 in June, and competed against gymnasts three decades younger than her. She won a gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics as part of the Unified Team that succeeded the Soviet Union in international competition. Having also won a medal representing Germany, she has said her dream is to finally win one for her home country, Uzbekistan.

Dallas Oberholzer, 46, said he’d finally impressed his mum by competing at the Olympics, but the South African wasn’t the only veteran taking part in skateboarding’s Olympic debut. Rune Glifberg of Denmark was also competing at the age of 46.

The all-time record for the oldest Olympic competitor is held by Sweden’s Oscar Swahn. He was born in 1847, and won two shooting gold medals at the 1908 London Olympics. He won another gold in Stockholm in 1912, but finished fourth in another event behind his own son. He competed again in the 1920 Antwerp Games at the age of 72.

At 13 years and 28 days old, Sky Brown became Britain’s youngest summer Olympian and youngest medallist at the Tokyo Games, but she was beaten by someone even younger. Japan’s Kokona Hiraki, 12, became the youngest Olympic medallist in 85 years with her silver in women’s park skateboarding. Syria’s table tennis prodigy Hend Zaza is also 12, and was the youngest competitor at the Tokyo Olympics.

The figure skater Cecilia Colledge competed for Britain in the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid in New York at the age of 11.

There is some dispute about who is the youngest ever Olympian. Dimitrios Loundras represented Greece in the parallel bars at the inaugural modern Olympic Games in 1896, and came third as part of the team event. At 10 years and 218 days he is the youngest known medallist, and before he died in 1971 he was the last surviving competitor from the 1896 Games.

Photographic evidence, however, appears to show a medal winner at the 1900 Paris Games who was possibly as young as seven. He’d been swapped into the Dutch rowing team as cox after the first Dutch Olympic champions, Roelof Klein and François Brandt, realised their original choice, Hermanus Brockmann, was putting them at a weight disadvantage, and recruited the local boy instead.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Olympics are racing towards the finishing line; the Euros gave us euphoria and heartbreak; and Wimbledon revealed that the true hero on Centre Court was not an Adonis in crisp tennis whites, but rather a middle-aged vaccine researcher. More than anything, though, this summer has thrown a spotlight on the inspiring and surprising strength and character of young people like never before.

We have watched elite athletes behave with the sort of dignity and respect that world leaders would do well to emulate. They have competed under intense global scrutiny at the highest levels and never lost sight of the fact that how you behave matters more than the goals you score or the aces you serve. Here are 20 things we learned about youth politics and culture from an astonishing summer of sport.

Naomi Osaka put mental health before trophies

When the 23-year-old pulled out of the French Open, then Wimbledon, to focus on her mental health, Osaka showed the world that elite athletes are people; that we cannot use them like arcade machines. In her Roland Garros withdrawal statement, she wrote that she experienced “huge waves of anxiety” before interviews and had endured “long bouts of depression”. Her bravery prompted a groundswell of support from tennis legends, including Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King. Osaka destigmatised mental health concerns for a generation of athletes. For that, she should be commended.

The England team ended the culture wars (for a few weeks)

Once a fortnight, the UK collectively loses its mind over flags/children’s books/statues. It is an endless cycle of outrage in which the only winners are chattering pundits and merchants of hate.

When Gareth Southgate announced that England would take the knee before Euro 2020 games, bad-faith provocateurs accused the team of cultural Marxism – because multimillionaire footballers are always on the brink of trying to overthrow capitalism. Southgate, with characteristic decency, backed his players, explaining that they had “a responsibility to the wider community” to use their voices on “matters such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice”.

With this, Southgate and his team helped to define a patriotism that is not boorish or rooted in rose-tinted nostalgia, but rather focused on trying your best for your country and giving back to your community.

This young, diverse team did not shy away from passionately defending these principles. When Priti Patel condemned the racist abuse of Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho after they missed penalties in the final, their teammate Tyrone Mings accused the home secretary of “stoking the fire” by refusing to condemn those who had booed players taking the knee. His comments prompted much soul-searching among Conservative MPs, with Johnny Mercer and Steve Baker suggesting that the Tories needed to rethink their attitude to the gesture.

A squad of footballers – two of them teenagers – ended the culture wars (albeit temporarily). For that, we should be grateful.

The Danes protected the dignity of their teammate

Christian Eriksen’s cardiac arrest during Denmark’s game against Finland was horrifying to witness: the hush descending on the stadium as fans realised the gravity of the situation; the sight of his panicked partner. But the way Eriksen’s teammates formed a human shield around their fallen friend, preserving his privacy while medics worked successfully to resuscitate him, was a spontaneous and heartfelt gesture of dignity – even as the cameras refused to cut away.

Mason Mount made a little girl’s dream come true

A glow settled over England when Mason Mount spotted a young girl in the crowd after England’s semi-final win over Denmark, climbed into the stands and handed her his shirt. She collapsed in ecstatic squeals while the spectators around her cheered. Properly heartwarming.

Kye Whyte had Bethany Shriever’s back

With UK Sport no longer funding female BMXers, Bethany Shriever had to crowdfund even to qualify for Tokyo 2020. Nonetheless, she stormed her way to Team GB’s first ever gold medal in BMX racing. Her friend and fellow Team GB BMXer Kye Whyte, who won the UK’s first ever silver medal, was cheering her all the way. After Shriever crossed the finishing line, she collapsed with agonising leg cramps – so Whyte scooped her up and held her aloft, as triumphantly as she deserved. Did you have something in your eye? Me too.

England’s footballers reminded us that the game is for everyone

From Harry Kane’s rainbow armband – showing solidarity with LGBTQ+ people – to Jordan Henderson’s tweet supporting a non-binary, queer fan who attended an England game in makeup, the conduct of the Three Lions this summer showed that football is for everyone – not just the beer-guzzlers and bum-flarers.

The high jumpers shared gold – and history

The Olympics is not just about medals, but also, as the Games’ charter puts it, “friendship, solidarity and fair play”. Qatar’s Mutaz Essa Barshim and Italy’s Gianmarco Tamberi embodied this spirit after tying in an exhausting two-hour high jump final. They were offered the opportunity to have a jump-off. Instead, Barshim asked an official if they could have two golds. If you agree to share, came the response. “History, my friend,” said Barshim, shaking Tamberi’s hand. It was a joyous example of sportsmanship at its best.

Kalvin Phillips rushed to console Bukayo Saka

Penalties are organised cruelty at the best of times, but during an international final they can feel positively medieval. After Saka missed the tournament-deciding penalty in the Euros final, the Italian team flooded past in glee. Saka was distraught, choking back tears. All alone, he looked like the teenager he was. Then Kalvin Phillips – a man who had just run for two hours straight – bolted towards his teammate and pulled him into a tight hug. It was a moment that cut through, because it showed that supporting your teammates in triumph and adversity is more important than any goal. In that embrace, Phillips reminded us that the best athletes have heart.

The Irish Olympic team showed their class

The Irish consistently show up the British – in drinking ability, accents and devotion to the craic. At Tokyo 2020, they added manners, stopping to bow to their Japanese hosts as a token of respect during the opening ceremony. It was a gracious, Olympic-spirited move.

Marcus Rashford was … Marcus Rashford

Marcus Rashford is not only a national hero but a national leader. At just 23, he has forced the government into two U-turns on free school meals, launched a nationwide reading initiative – and somehow found time to play for England and Manchester United.

What makes Rashford so remarkable is how he uses his experiences of growing up in a low-income household to destigmatise and advocate for such children today. He represents the very best of this new generation of principled athletes: never self-aggrandising, always quietly determined to use his platform for good.

Tom Daley wept beautiful tears of joy …

Those two fat teardrops on Tom Daley’s cheeks after he and Matty Lee took gold in the men’s synchronised 10-metres represented the culmination of a lifetime’s work. Hours training in the pool beside his beloved father. The bullying at school. The struggle of coming out. The heartbreak of his father’s death before Daley won his first Olympic medal. His disappointing finish at the 2011 world championship. Crashing out of the 10-metre semi-finals in Rio in 2016. And then coming back from it all, to win the gold he had coveted his entire career. They spoke volumes.

… and showed us the true meaning of Pride …

Daley has redefined what it means to be a man in sport, speaking about his sexuality with openness and sincerity. After taking gold, he spoke movingly about this. “When I was younger, I always felt like the one who was alone and different and didn’t fit … I hope that any young LGBT person out there can see, no matter how alone you feel right now, you are not alone,” he said. “You can achieve anything.” Thanks to trailblazers such as Daley, this has been a “rainbow Olympics”, with at least 172 LGBTQ+ athletes competing in Tokyo, more than three times as many as in Rio. Afterwards, he said he wanted to embrace his son and husband – and suddenly his tears were catching.

… and became a knitting icon

Not content with being an LGBTQ+ Olympic champion with the torso of a mountain range, Daley also knits. At the women’s springboard finals, he was serenely creating what looked like a purple scarf. At another event, it was a Team GB cardigan. On social media, Daley has shown off: a pouch for his gold medal, a cat couch, a doggie jumper and, best of all, a tiny Bernie Sanders. Daley’s knitting reminds us why he is a hero of British sport – because he is utterly unafraid to be himself.

Simone Biles showed that mental and physical health are the same thing …

Simone Biles, widely acknowledged as the greatest female gymnast ever, arrived at Tokyo 2020 with the weight of the world on her shoulders. Commentators were predicting a clean sweep for the first woman to land a Yurchenko double pike. (I could try to describe it, but it wouldn’t do it justice. Just imagine the rules of gravity have been suspended.)

But things began to go wrong in qualifying. They fell apart when she stepped out of bounds during her floor routine, then aborted her vault in mid-air during the women’s team finals, narrowly avoiding serious injury and scoring one of the lowest marks of her career. Biles subsequently pulled out of the women’s all-around and the women’s team event, explaining that she had lost her air-awareness – a phenomenon known as the “twisties” – and was struggling with her mental health.

She later said it “sucked” not to be able to compete when she had spent the past half-decade preparing. But she explained that she had been inspired to talk about her mental health by watching Osaka and that she had quit to protect her “mind and body”.

Some armchair experts would have preferred Biles to risk her neck for their viewing pleasure. But, overwhelmingly, the reaction was compassionate and supportive. Biles showed us that mental and physical health are connected – and that there is no shame in quitting to prioritise your wellbeing. For this, not for her Yurchenko double pike, Biles will always be the Goat.

… and what it means to be resilient

Even as she struggled, Biles showed up to support her US gymnastics teammates, whooping and shouting from the sidelines. “I’m proud of how the girls stepped up,” Biles told reporters. It was no less than we now expect of Biles, who has overcome incredible personal adversity (she was in foster care before being adopted by her grandparents) and trauma (she is a survivor of sexual abuse by the US team’s former doctor Larry Nassar) to become one of the greatest athletes of her generation. After a week of nonstop speculation about whether she would pull out of the Games entirely, she took bronze on the balance beam. That single medal showed her deep resilience more than her embarrassment of golds.

Ruby Tui announced herself

The New Zealand rugby player is a charisma atom bomb. So under the radar that she doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, Tui became a viral sensation after being pulled aside for a post-match interview after a stunning 36-0 defeat of Russia. After thanking her village, her family and God in Samoan, Tui grinned her way through the most charming, feel-great interview of the Games, congratulating her opponents on a well-fought fight, describing the Russians as “really cool people, man”, and revealing that her team had donated to the British team’s fundraising efforts. Tui represents pure Olympic vibes: respecting your opponent, loving the sport and having a laugh.

Norwegian women take zero sexist nonsense

It is 2021, but still we expect female athletes to dress to titillate audiences. After campaigning to no avail for an astonishing 15 years to be allowed to wear shorts, the Norwegian women’s beach handball team decided: enough. They went thigh-length, like their male peers, at the European championship in July to protest against the sexist dress code – and were fined €1,500 (£1,295). But the world – and the pop star Pink – was with them. She offered to pay their fine – and the officials of the sport’s governing body looked like regressive dinosaurs.

England’s footballers showed what it means to be accountable

We live in the age of the political non-apology – which is why the astonishing statements put out by Saka, Sancho and Rashford after their missed penalties during the Euro 2021 final were stunning to behold. “I would like to say sorry to all my teammates, coaching staff and most of all the fans who I let down,” Sancho wrote. Here were three young men apologising fully (even though they didn’t need to), taking accountability and promising to work harder – all after coping with vile racist trolling online.

Charlotte Worthington showed us what bravery looks like

Charlotte Worthington had to work 40-hour weeks in a Mexican restaurant to support her biking career, competing during annual leave. Fast-forward to Tokyo 2020 and she tried a groundbreaking 360-degree backflip – but came off her bike. If she had completed it, she would have been the first woman to do it in an international competition. But Worthington took the risk, tried again – and nailed it. For these unbelievable levels of bravery and self-belief, she took gold.

Sky Brown became Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist

A tiny, gravity-defiant, flying figure: at 13 years old, Britain’s youngest-ever Olympian took bronze in the women’s skateboarding. Tony Hawk has called her “one of the best well-rounded skaters ever”. Sky Brown has the maturity of a competitor thrice her age – and the fearlessness of a babe of two. (Tellingly, she is also good friends with her young rivals, including fellow Olympians Sakura Yosozumi, Leticia Bufoni and Rayssa Leal. “We motivate each other to go hard,” Brown told the Guardian in July.) Refreshingly, there are no pushy parents or brutalising coaches in the background. Instead, Brown exemplifies the spirit of a new cohort of gen Z athletes: wildly talented and competing for the joy of the sport.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@So now we know. Harry Kane really is prepared to do whatever it takes to force a move from Tottenham to Manchester City. The question had nagged away since the final week of last season when Kane and his camp had given the definitive signal that they wanted out and the battle lines were drawn, with Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, digging in and refusing to countenance the sale.

Would Kane be prepared to activate the nuclear option and withdraw his cooperation at Spurs? Surely not, most people had hoped, because to do the dirty like this would be so unbecoming of a homegrown hero, of an England captain.

And yet on Monday morning, Kane did the dirty, he did the bad thing, the last-resort play, when he refused to turn up for his first day of pre-season tests and checks. Now we knew.

What a mess, and the first thing to say is that Kane has let himself down. There has been some understanding among Spurs fans about his desire to join a club that can challenge for the biggest prizes this season, even if none of them have wanted to picture the reality of him actually wearing the colours of a rival.

They know how Spurs ended the previous season – without a permanent manager, with qualification only to the new Europa Conference League (they have been drawn to face Paços de Ferreira or Larne in the play-off round), with disarray the most prominent sentiment. And they know that under Nuno Espírito Santo, appointed as José Mourinho’s replacement after a chaotic 72-day search, it is likely that there will be a period of transition.

Why should Kane, who turned 28 last Wednesday and has not won any team honours, want to stick around for that? Most of the supporter anger has been directed at Levy for enabling the climate for such a situation to develop.

Kane was on a reasonably firm footing. Everybody knows that he wants to leave. Why not sit tight, focus on his conditioning and respect his contract for another month while the negotiations with City – or any other high-bidding club – play out? It has been obvious that Kane, after a three-week post-Euro 2020 break, will struggle to be fit for Spurs’ season-opener on Sunday week, coincidentally against City, and, thereafter, they have only two league matches before the transfer window closes – against Wolves and Watford on 22 and 29 August respectively. Kane has gone early with the awol move.

The upside of not reporting for work is questionable because one thing is plain – it will only harden Levy’s position, his resolve that Kane is not for sale and, if he absolutely is to be prised away, it would be for an eye-watering sum, which is rather more than the £100m City have offered. The defending champions have dismissed as nonsense the notion that they would pay £160m. Players in part-exchange could enter the equation but those deals are notoriously difficult to balance.

The downside for Kane is the reputational damage. He has built a career upon single-mindedness, an ability to blot out the criticism and background noise in pursuit of his goals, and it has long been held up as a positive. It no longer feels entirely that way.

Kane’s decision comes from a place of overwhelming frustration, at how he feels trapped by the six-year deal that he signed in 2018 and the lack of success of his exit strategy, which has been marked, increasingly, by openness. He wanted to leave last summer only for Levy to stand in his way and the terms of a so-called gentleman’s agreement for a departure this time are open to interpretation.

Kane has perhaps learned a lesson from history, having seen the lengths to which previous Spurs stars had to stoop to drive moves. Levy refused to say whether Dimitar Berbatov had gone on strike to get his transfer to Manchester United in 2008 – the striker missed matches against Sunderland and Chelsea before the deal went through – although a quote from the chairman was telling. “That’s something you’re going to have to ask him but, clearly, he didn’t play for those two games,” Levy said in November of that year.

Luka Modric failed to board the flight for a tour to the United States in the summer of 2012 – the one in which he eventually joined Real Madrid – and Gareth Bale became difficult in the summer of the following year before also going to Real. By the end of that transfer window, Bale was refusing to report for training. “It’s up to the club to decide if it’s a fineable offence,” said André Villas-Boas, the manager at the time. Levy had blocked Modric’s proposed move to Chelsea in the summer of 2011, despite the player claiming he had a gentleman’s agreement with him.

And yet those dramas were from different times and it would probably be wise to look purely at the current circumstances, with Levy operating in a coronavirus-scarred financial landscape, fan unrest high and Kane’s goals, not to mention what he means to the club, feeling extremely hard to replace.

Spurs were not prepared to discuss whether Kane was on strike and there are other more obvious imponderables, including the player’s mindset if he were retained against his will. Levy would hope that Kane simply gets over the disappointment.

What next? Will Kane be in on Tuesday? Spurs do not know. In Kane’s mind, it is all in the game. He needs an end to justify the means.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“I don’t understand why people come up with stuff like that. I just don’t get it. It’s very cruel.” Beatrice Masilingi is 18, born and raised in Katima in the Zambezi region of Namibia. In Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium she was as excited as you might expect of any teenager who has barely raced outside her home country, who lists “my grandmother” as her key influence, and who had minutes earlier come cantering in behind Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce to make the women’s 200m Olympic final.

If Masilingi was also a little wary, it is because she knows some part of the future is likely to take a difficult turn if she performs with the same level of grace and fire in Tuesday’s final. Masilingi is one of a pair of Namibian teenagers, schoolmates at Grootfontein Agricultural College, who have a serious chance of a medal in the blue-chip sprint event of these Olympic Games.

At which point, that cruelty. In June Masilingi and Christine Mboma were barred by World Athletics from running in the 400m, their chosen event at these Games. In Tokyo they have already faced questions about whether they should be running at all, and indeed (again, aged 18) whether they should be classing themselves as women at all.

This stems from something with which both Masilingi and Mboma were born. Naturally occurring raised testosterone levels mean both have been classified as DSD, or athletes with Differences of Sexual Development, and placed – to their surprise – in a strange, indeterminate category of sporting womanhood.

The 200m, for reasons of procedure, has yet to be closed off, but it may well be soon. Both are running that distance instead as late entrants (“I used to run it at school,” Masilingi shrugged shortly after making the Olympic final).

Mboma is a slighter, more soft-spoken figure. Two years ago she was a netball player, invited by a school coach to give the track a whirl. On Monday she did something sensational, and then for good measure did it again. To get the scale of Mboma’s performances in Tokyo on Monday it is necessary to contemplate first the hugely impressive figure of Gabby Thomas, the golden US 200m hope at these Games.

Thomas studied neurobiology and global health at Harvard. She set Ivy League records in the 100 and 200 metres. She had her first Reebok deal while she was still at college. Now 24, she ran the third fastest time ever at the US Trials in June. Her 21.61sec has been bettered only by Flo-Jo and gold here would confirm Thomas as an out-and-out superstar of US athletics. Well, she’s got to get past the teenager from Divundu first.

First up, at 10.54am Tokyo time, Mboma strode away from Thomas to clock the fastest time of the round. Eight and a half hours later she beat her again, this time with that glare of public scrutiny ramped up a little more.

Thomas was in lane six for the semi-final, an imposing figure in pink, already with her own champion’s aura. Mboma looked terribly nervous, but perked up to smile at the camera. She was slow out of the blocks, and lagging into the bend. At which point she just let it go (“I don’t give up, I keep pushing”), arms pumping a little wildly, but catching Thomas, who grimaced, losing that wonderful stride as she was passed. Ahead of them both Elaine Thompson-Herah won the race in a hugely impressive personal best, then took a moment to lie prone on the track. Mboma barely looked out of breath.

No one really knows how fast the girls from Grootfontein might run on Tuesday night, although it will have to be extremely fast indeed to crash that stellar podium. But then, win or lose, this is not the story that will be told.

Back to that cruelty. The situation for athletes placed in this category is both confusing and incendiary. World Athletics, tooled up with scientists and lawyers, has wrestled with this issue in public since the grim, horribly insensitive treatment of Caster Semenya at the same age. It is an issue that refuses to present an easy answer. It is the job of sport to adapt, to scrutinise this, to find a way. Categories must be maintained in some sense: they exist for a reason, to create fair competition.

But right now the power, the decision-making, the tide of regulation lies in a strange and indeed uncomfortable place. The issue here is the definition of womanhood, as decreed by a narrow band of sporting administrators. Mboma and Masilingi are women. The raised testosterone levels, often a result of internal sexual characteristics, is simply a part of who they are. This state is far from unheard of. It is not an attempt to cheat, or a cancellation of biological sex, or anything other than, in pure sporting terms, a naturally occurring advantage, albeit one that is deemed unwomanly to an unacceptable degree, unfairly undainty by Sebastian Coe, the head of World Athletics, and his teams of experts.

There are pressing questions here about the way this kind of issue has played out in the past: the toxic spectacle of administrators, unsympathetic media and – of course – men on the internet arguing so publicly and with such certainty over the bodies of these young women.

The root of the issue is testosterone, a key metric of both doping control and biological masculinity. The science is complex, and keenly fought, but some ideal state might lie in a way to distinguish between artificially raised levels and those that are natural. The pragmatic situation, proposed by World Athletics, is for women with those levels to take testosterone-suppressing drugs if they want to race at distances from 400m to 1500m. There is something troubling about asking a woman athlete to take a drug that alters your natural state, affects your mood, interrupts your talent, suppresses what your body does naturally. This solution feels like the wrong side of history. Time will not judge it kindly.

For now that 200m final promises a thrilling contest. The two Jamaican women will be favourites to take silver and gold. Fraser-Pryce, such a serene, reassuring figure in the gloom of these peculiar Games, is almost twice the age of her Namibian rivals. Thompson-Herah can complete a Bolt-lite double-double with a fourth Olympic gold.

There was one telling moment in the mixed zone as Mboma stuttered a little in front of the gathered throng. Marie-Josee Ta Lou of the Ivory Coast, 32 years old at her second Games, and also in Tuesday’s final, came across and wrapped her arms around her teenage competitor, offering a fond, maternal hug, and excited congratulations. It felt like a significant gesture from a fellow athlete. It is to be hoped that the world will be similarly gentle with a pair of 18-year-olds who have had these complicators thrust upon them and still just want to talk about racing. “It’s crazy,” Masilingi said, looking forward. “Now I’m in the final I’m just really happy with myself.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When it wasn’t making you tear your hair out, the first Test was a lot of fun. But let’s face it, England got out of jail, thanks to Joe Root’s hundred and the last‑day washout. And now, in the brief gap between the first and second Tests, there are a few knots for the management to untangle. The first one is this: how do you solve a problem like Dom Sibley?

On paper, he did a job at Trent Bridge. In making 18 and 28, he stuck around long enough to shield the middle order. But he was painful to watch, like a fearful football team, forever playing sideways. He used up an awful lot of deliveries: 70 in the first innings, 133 in the second. Of those 203 balls, he hit just four to the boundary. And he dropped a clanger when he spilt a nick from KL Rahul, his opposite number, who had 52 at the time and went on to 84.

If Sibley had held that catch and made his runs at a decent speed, England might well have had time to win the match. Or, to be fair, to lose it. While Rory Burns tries to bring back the mullet, Sibley is on a mission to make the draw fashionable again.

And yet he’s an endearing figure, admirable in his way. There’s a Sibley in every school or village team, plodding along with nothing to declare but his (or her) determination. Many England fans are fond of him, even proud: he turns them into the parent at sports day who cheers loudest for the child struggling not to come last. He’s the ugly duckling who will never turn into a swan, but his method has somehow brought him two Test hundreds, plus a third in the England Lions’ only recent Test in Australia.

Now, though, after a long run in the first XI, Sibley’s signature inertia is getting worse. Of the 21 international innings in which he has reached 15, the two at Trent Bridge were the slowest. On a good day he brings zen, which can be needed in the drawn‑out drama of a Test; on a bad day he’s a zombie, sucking the life out of the contest, as he did when England dismally refused to chase a modest target against New Zealand.

They have a ready-made replacement in their squad, now that Haseeb Hameed is finally back in form. He’s a slowcoach too, but has a classical style that at least contains the possibility of scoring faster. And he made a hundred only last month against Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Shardul Thakur.

Chris Silverwood’s selection for Trent Bridge was a muddle. There was no spin, no pace and barely any balance. A four-man attack doesn’t suit Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson (too old to be mere stock bowlers, yet their strike rate has begun to fade), or Sam Curran (best used as a rabbit from a hat, not a workhorse). They got away with it because the rain kept giving the old-stagers a break and because Ollie Robinson, in only his second Test, performed like a senior pro.

England are not just missing Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes: they’re missing Ed Smith. By sweeping away Smith and his role as national selector, Ashley Giles has deprived the Test side of vision, audacity and strategic thinking – all of which are there in the white-ball teams because Eoin Morgan provides them.

Without Smith or Andrew Strauss, the Test brains trust doesn’t have much of a brain. There are bright sparks such as Mo Bobat, the performance director, and Nathan Leamon, the team analyst, but the people making the big decisions – Silverwood, Root and Giles himself – all have similar backgrounds, involving a lot more dressing rooms than lecture halls.

Nothing wrong with the university of life, it’s just that a top-class education does have its uses. Smith, the most erudite England cricketer since Mike Brearley, could be too clever for some tastes, but when Strauss put him in charge of selection in 2018 England’s Test results suddenly improved. They did roughly twice as well, going from 0.80 Test wins per defeat in the previous three years to 1.75 in Smith’s time, and rising from seventh in the world, by that measure, to third.

Smith was bold, bringing back Jos Buttler and Adil Rashid, daring occasionally to sideline Broad. He believed in youth, promoting Sam Curran and Zak Crawley. He figured out that the best use of England’s resources was to have five or even six bowlers, because the all‑rounders would make as many runs as the top order.

On an English greentop, facing the Dukes ball, even a gifted batsman will average in the low 30s. Root’s hundred at Trent Bridge was his first in England for three years, and until he reached 20 his flowing drives were interspersed with inside edges.

The question Silverwood should ask himself now, even if it sticks in his gullet, is: what would Ed do? The answer might well be to pick a lineup for Lord’s looking like this: Burns, Hameed, Crawley, Root, Bairstow, Buttler, Moeen Ali, Robinson, Mark Wood or Saqib Mahmood, Jack Leach or Matt Parkinson, and Anderson. A team with speed, spin, swing, classical stroke‑makers, counterattackers – and no Sibley.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Stuart Broad has emerged as a serious injury concern before what would be his 150th Test match and will undergo a scan on Wednesday after tweaking his right calf muscle during training.

A day that began with England confirming Moeen Ali’s call-up for the second Test against India at Lord’s ended with doubts over one of their premier seam bowlers, Broad slipping while undertaking a light warm-up jog.

Unable to place any weight on his right foot after the incident, the 35-year-old is now waiting to discover the full extent of the issue amid fears that either a calf strain or an achilles tendon problem could rule him out for the remainder of the five-match series.

As well as highlighting the issue of scheduling before the series – Broad played just one match for Nottinghamshire in July – the injury could open up a spot for Mark Wood in the XI, with Jimmy Anderson and Ollie Robinson likeliest to share the new ball.

Sam Curran was the fourth seamer during the rain-affected draw at Trent Bridge, while Craig Overton is also in the squad, and some relief will come for the attack overall with Moeen likely to make the XI at No 7 and provide Joe Root with a spin option.

Asked about his advice to Moeen, who has recently been playing in the Hundred, Root replied: “Just to go out there and be Moeen Ali. He has the ability to win games with bat and ball; he’s proven that. He plays his best cricket when he is enjoying it and he’s full of confidence.

“It certainly looks that way at the moment, the way he has taken to the Hundred and led Birmingham Phoenix. I think as well I would happily give him a huge amount of responsibility if he does play because he responds extremely well to that.

“He is a leader within the dressing room, a great personality and he drags people with him on the field and in the dressing room. It will be great to have him back around.”

Moeen’s recall means a middle-order batsman is set to make way. It is likely to be Dan Lawrence, with Jonny Bairstow’s experience retained, while Ollie Pope may be forced to wait after returning from a thigh injury unless introduced higher up.

The 23-year-old right-hander is an option to replace the struggling Zak Crawley at No 3 – even if this would be higher than his usual roles for Surrey and England – but then the management are clearly considering a recall for Haseeb Hameed here also.

Asked about Hameed, who shone as a teenager in India five years ago but has only just rediscovered form, Root replied: “Ever since the first day I met him I’ve been extremely impressed with him as a person, with his maturity as a young man back then.

“I think that served him really well during a difficult spell in his career. We think of him physically maturing but I think his game has grown as well, he’s added shots to a very strong defence and has turned himself into a brilliant player.

“His work ethic is outstanding. He thinks about the game extremely well and it’s great to have had him in and around the squad this summer. If he gets an opportunity I’m sure he’ll look to take it with both hands and try to make the position his own in this team.”

India also have an injury concern, with all-rounder Shardul Thakur understood to be struggling with a hamstring problem. If so, and with the weather in London forecast to be hot, spinner Ravichandran Ashwin may reclaim his spot in their XI.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@UK Sport has a strong, proven and ongoing commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion (Letter, 2 August). For the first time at a summer Olympics, Team GB contained more female athletes than male. And Britain’s women produced a host of trailblazing performances in Tokyo.

Laura Kenny became Britain’s most decorated female Olympian and the first British woman to win gold at three Olympics. Hannah Mills is now the most decorated female sailor in Olympic history, and Emily Campbell was the first British woman to win a weightlifting medal. And who can forget the 13-year-old skateboarder Sky Brown, Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist?

UK Sport has been supporting BMX since 2005. While there was a time when women’s BMX wasn’t in receipt of funding at the start of the Tokyo cycle in 2017, that only lasted one year, following an annual review that saw funding reinstated in early 2018.

For the avoidance of any doubt, the gender of the athletes had no bearing on the decision for them not to be funded. Men’s mountain biking was in an identical position during this timeframe and was also reinstated. Bethany Shriever has been part of British Cycling’s national lottery-funded World Class Programme in this cycle since 2019, and we shared British fans’ pride and joy as she, Kye Whyte, Charlotte Worthington and Declan Brooks fulfilled their dreams in Tokyo.

​None of the trailblazing moments delivered by Britain’s female Olympians would have been possible if UK Sport’s culture and processes were tainted by the slightest hint of misogyny. UK Sport’s commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion will continue through to Paris and beyond.

Numerous writers agree with Matthew Engel’s damning verdict on the Hundred (Letters, 6 August). In its defence, it is a brilliant showcase for the women’s game and has given visibility to a number of excellent female players. I’m an activator for All Stars cricket and took my seven-year-old daughter to Headingley last week. It was a great day, her first live cricket experience; she met female players and loved it. We’re enjoying watching the matches as a family. Do I still watch the Tests? Yes. And I hope my daughter will too, after having her love of cricket reinforced by a fun competition and easily accessible format.

The ECB gets a lot of stick, but its efforts to engage young people and women in cricket should be applauded. There’s room for different types of cricket.

I accept longtime cricket lovers may query the ECB’s expenditure on the Hundred and may find aspects of the spectacle irritating, jarring or unnecessary. But my 10-year-old daughter and her three friends wouldn’t have been at the Oval for the first match if it weren’t for the free tickets distributed by the ECB via the local girls’ cricket team; wouldn’t have appreciated the first-half boundaries as much without the pyrotechnics; wouldn’t have stuck around for the second half without the added incentive of Becky Hill; and so wouldn’t have been on the edge of their seats for the final few balls, and then dancing in the aisles when the Invincibles hit the winning runs.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@You have to go back to the visit of West Indies to Old Trafford in 2007 – the summer when India last won a Test series on these shores – for the previous time England went into a “live” home Test without either Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad at their disposal.

The pair were rested at Edgbaston in 2012, West Indies again the opposition, but that match was a dead rubber. The second Test that begins on Thursday at Lord’s, where the sun is set to shine and the series with India is locked at 0-0 after the soggy end at Trent Bridge, sees England staring into a future they have long been agonising over.

In the case of Broad, who was in line to win his 150th cap, a torn right calf is to blame for his absence for the foreseeable future. For Anderson, a tight left quad leaves him rated “50-50”. The 39-year-old last went into a Test with a niggle at the start of the 2019 Ashes and four overs in his series was over. England were left with a sense of “what if” after failing to win back the urn and with this five-match series so condensed, a similar gamble on his fitness feels unlikely.

If both miss out then opportunity knocks for the support cast and the 23-year-old Sam Curran would be England’s most experienced seamer with 22 caps. This represents a fair old drop from losing the combined 312 matches and 1,145 wickets of experience banked by Anderson and Broad over the course of their stellar careers.

The returning Mark Wood is next on 20 caps and Ollie Robinson – the banker in terms of form – makes just his third appearance and returns to the scene of that soured debut back in June. Moeen Ali’s return at No 7, the spin-bowler in a five-man attack, appears to leave a choice between Saqib Mahmood, a late addition and uncapped in the longest format, or Craig Overton handed his fifth appearance.

Mahmood offers slingy pace and swing, Overton similar bounce and nip to Robinson. If there is to be a tiebreaker, it may well be that the latter’s adhesive hands at slip, and the potential to extend the batting all the way down to 10, sees him shade this. That said, Wood, the likely No 11 in this scenario, would doubtless argue it goes all the way down given he has a Test half-century to his name.

India will be delighted with all this, even if newcomers bring a sense of the unknown, and though the tourists have lost Shardul Thakur to a tight hamstring, they had been planning to draft in Ravichandran Ashwin anyway.

Uncertainty also remains over England’s top three. Haseeb Hameed is creeping closer to a first Test cap since that zesty debut tour of India 2016. Zak Crawley’s average of 11 this year is troubling them hugely, even if his future is considered bright, but they are starting to wonder if Dom Sibley is just too limited.

Moeen’s expected return in place of Dan Lawrence reflects well on a cricketer who could easily have told England where to go after two years of indifference on their part. Chris Silverwood, the head coach, is delighted with the energy Moeen has brought into the dressing room, although a lack of first-class cricket means expectations should be tempered.

But then this summer has been a scheduling car crash overall and beyond the English batsmen caught cold last week – and the absence of any red-ball cricket until 30 August should a player like Crawley drop down – there has been some chuntering about this having led to Anderson and Broad’s issues.

England were already without Ben Stokes, taking time off to prioritise his mental health, Jofra Archer, out for the rest of the year with an elbow stress fracture, and Chris Woakes, whose annus horribilis was summed by slipping on some stairs and bruising his heel. Poor old Olly Stone says it will still be another six months before he bowls again after his lower back stress fracture in June.

But the dearth of first-class cricket in the lead-up to this series always risked the available seamers going physically soft and the GPS tracking data that logs workloads is said to have seen both veterans in the red zone – the point where injury might occur – after Trent Bridge. Anderson bowled just 22 overs for Lancashire in July, Broad 19 for Nottinghamshire, and that was before five Tests in six weeks.

England have overcome such issues in the past with either a warmup match of their own or loan deals to counties who are in action. But this summer the Hundred has been prioritised and England players required for the launch. Anderson and Broad were not part of the new tournament but their options were still limited.

The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.

Seamers can build up hardiness in the nets but nothing compares to competitive multi-day cricket, where second, third and fourth spells are required in a day. It is why Woakes currently faces an uphill battle to get back to full fitness, with even Warwickshire’s second XI team not playing red-ball cricket until 23 August.

It all feeds into a sense that if England are to prevail against India over the next four Tests, it will be in spite of the system rather than because of it. Joe Root, a captain looking to secure his legacy over the next six months, deserves better.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The third ball Jonny Bairstow faced at Trent Bridge last week was an inswinger and he flicked at it without effect as it passed him and into the keeper’s gloves. Staring back down the wicket at the bowler’s retreating form, with quiet intensity, it was possible he was trying to get a look at the ball in the bowler’s hand. It was, after all, the first red one he had seen in a match this season.

Bairstow’s performance in the first Test suggested two things. First, that there is nothing wrong with his colour vision. And second, that he may be on the verge of a considerable comeback. The batsman suggested no less on Wednesday, when he positively vibrated with joie de vivre. It was, pleasing to spend some decent time at the crease, he said. “If I keep doing what I was doing in those two innings – keep with that method and approach and mindset – hopefully there’s a fairly big one to come soon.”

Going from the Hundred to a Test match is not so much a gear shift as it is swapping a rally car for a Rolls-Royce, but Bairstow made the switch more smoothly than several of England’s batters. One evening he was “trying to hit as many balls into the River Taff” as he could. The next day – after a 150-mile drive to Loughborough and a compulsory Covid test – he was facing Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson in the nets with the Dukes ball. “It was, obviously, slightly different,” he said with a chuckle.

The key, he says, has been to manage his own expectations: “I was content, yeah. I was happy.” He made only 59 runs in the opening Test, but they were important ones. The Yorkshireman stuck beside Joe Root like an emotional support animal in both innings, quietly helping the England captain score his side out of trouble.

It was a calmer, quieter Bairstow than the one-day version, content to play a slow-scoring role while Root busied about with the run-getting. He rode his luck, just a little. Hustling for first-innings runs, a throw from the deep would have run him out halfway up the pitch if it had gone to the right end. He cut and missed at Ravi Jadeja’s spin and there were enough lbw shouts to persuade India’s quick bowlers that he is still vulnerable to the straight ball.

There was plenty to admire, too. When he came out in the second innings, England were effectively 40 for three and Mohammed Siraj was looking deadlier than he had all game. This was a proper tussle and one Bairstow may have considered himself to be winning until he played a hook shot on 30. It was only as his eyes followed the ball on its trajectory to deep square‑leg that he spotted the fielder there.

Just like Moeen Ali, Bairstow has returned to the Test fold flying high from the Hundred. Captaining his team has given him wings. It is a role he says he has “thoroughly enjoyed and really relished”, which will offer Gary Kirsten little solace given England, rather than the Welsh Fire coach, are poised to reap the benefit.

Bairstow led from the front in the first two games of the new tournament, dancing around his crease and laying into the ball with enough power to cause blunt-force trauma. At times his open-chested stance has resembled Captain America squaring up for a throw down with a Nazi super-soldier and there is a look on his face that suggests that he can, indeed, do this all day.

The signs Bairstow is back in dangerous form have been hiding in plain sight. In June, his super-heroism extended to scoring a 48-ball century on one leg, having injured his ankle in a Blast innings against Worcestershire. The England coach, Chris Silverwood, has noted that he seems as happy as at any point in the past two years.

“It’s been tricky hasn’t it?” said Bairstow, reflecting on a period that has not always been easy for him. “There’s been a lot of different cricket, a lot of changes in circumstances.”

In February, he gave up a payday in the Big Bash League to reclaim his Test spot against Sri Lanka, averaging 46 in the two-Test series. It was “a good trip” and he enjoyed batting at No 3, but then came three ducks in four innings on the India tour.

Bairstow remains phlegmatic about those scores, pointing out that on difficult turning wickets no one on either side scored big runs. And while he has been moved about the order yet again, he looks genuinely chuffed to be back in a middle order that has spent plenty of time at the crease with each other over the years.

“It’s something we can latch on to,” he said. “There’s some very fond experiences of batting together. Being able to recall those experiences and relish those partnerships is something we’ll definitely be able to have a chuckle about before and during [the Test].”

Bairstow is a player who likes to be needed and England, with their brittle top-order batting, need him now. Do not bet against the fairly big one to come – and soon.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Talking points can arrive when you least expect them. With a minute remaining of a humdrum, lethargic extra-time that Chelsea and Villarreal could clearly have done without, Thomas Tuchel made his first bold move of the season. Kepa Arrizabalaga, a £71m player named among the substitutes for the Super Cup, stepped forward to replace Edouard Mendy. Tuchel’s strategy was to be fully justified as Kepa, at full stretch to his right, batted away Raúl Albiol’s penalty to claim the trophy for Chelsea. The scale of celebrations from the Champions League winners – and the dejection easily visible among the Villarreal contingent – painted a picture of something that mattered.

Kepa’s contribution, such a belated one, was crucial. And yet it will be a surprise if he plays against Crystal Palace on Saturday. “We needed to do what was good for the team,” shrugged Tuchel. “Kepa has the better percentages at saving penalties.” Data gurus have a lot to answer for.

With Romelu Lukaku set to begin imminently for Chelsea, Tuchel must be content. His team were dominant in the first half here, with the failure to fully capitalise on that pressure likely to be offset by the prolific Belgian striker’s return. Villarreal, so pleasing on the eye under Unai Emery, offered considerably more threat in the second period but Chelsea looked – as should be the case – the superior side.

Tuchel had gone to great length during pre-match media duties to emphasise the significance of a fixture many would not unreasonably regard as a glorified friendly, even going so far as to suggest that he would be “angry” should any of his players treat Villarreal lightly.

This game was played amid a broader, uplifting context. There was a time when Belfast would never have been deemed suitable – or, to be precise, safe – for a marquee game such as this. Northern Ireland’s societal growth, the redevelopment of Windsor Park itself and the nation’s international football momentum as started by Michael O’Neill were all factors that made this venue choice sensible. European or global events need no longer be shielded from a city reborn.

Chelsea’s supporters, many of them locally-based, understandably made up the bulk of the 13,000 crowd, but two significant pockets of Villarreal followers, in their striking yellow, added to the sense of occasion. That Emery paid no attention whatsoever to the boundaries of the technical area, even during seemingly humdrum spells of the game, suggested he, too, was delighted at being here.

Tuchel sprung a slight surprise by deploying Trevoh Chalobah among a three-man defensive line. This marked the 22-year-old’s first competitive start for Chelsea, after loan spells that have stretched from Ipswich to FC Lorient. Yet the Chelsea head coach had hinted before kick-off that unorthodox selections were likely.

He believes Timo Werner will benefit from the experience of his first season in England. Wastefulness remains Werner’s biggest issue; he should have scored from point-blank range after six minutes but instead allowed Sergio Asenjo to palm the ball away. As N’Golo Kanté flashed a 20-yard shot wide, Chelsea had an early grip of the game.

That much was emphasised by a wonderful opening goal. Marcos Alonso fed the marauding Kai Havertz on the left flank, with the latter delivering a menacing cross that narrowly eluded Werner. Hakim Ziyech appeared to stub his shot but, with Asenjo exposed, it found the net anyway. Emery’s agitation was quite the sight.

Villarreal responded through the recently recruited Boulaye Dia. Mendy saved smartly at the feet of his fellow Senegal international. Chelsea fired back through Alonso and Kurt Zouma, who both had decent opportunities to double the lead before the interval. Seconds before the break, Alberto Moreno crashed a volley off the underside of the Chelsea crossbar.

By that juncture Tuchel had received a yellow card for protests towards the referee and Chelsea had made an enforced change. Ziyech, hitherto a menace to the Villarreal defence, landed badly after challenging for a header inside his own penalty area. Christian Pulisic replaced Ziyech, who left the scene clutching his right shoulder. Tuchel later confirmed the injury seems “serious.”

Villarreal came within the width of a post of restoring parity, six minutes after the restart. A poor clearance from Mendy landed at the feet of Dia, who fed Gerard Moreno. With time and space to pick his spot from an angle, Gerard Moreno instead mixed up his angles. Villarreal were visibly boosted by the chance, Chalobah’s last-ditch clearance necessary to prevent Dia from surely nodding home.

Villarreal were, though, to claim the equaliser their play at this point deserved. Dia supplied a glorious back heel that Gerard Moreno ran onto before clipping beyond Mendy. That glorious piece of attacking movement – assisted by Antonio Rudiger gifting possession to the Spaniards, it must be noted – had Emery dancing for joy. Rudiger later atoned by scoring Chelsea’s final penalty.

Alonso came closest to winning the game for Chelsea in normal time, his fierce shot rippling the side netting. Pulisic fluffed his lines when it looked easier to score. Mendy did not look perturbed at all about being summoned towards the bench. “He accepted it,” said Tuchel. Not that he really had much choice. Tuchel remains Chelsea’s man with the golden touch.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Here’s a match report from Windsor Park:

At the conclusion of a pre-season campaign described as “pretty demanding” by Thomas Tuchel, it seems obvious that extra-time in the Super Cup did not form part of any grand plan. The laboured efforts of players on both sides during those added 30 minutes added to a sense of inconvenience. Sudden death penalty kicks were still to come.

Still, winning covers a multitude of irritations. Tuchel opted to throw on Kepa Arrizabalaga with penalties looming; a decision fully justified as the Spaniard saved the decisive spot kick from Raul Albiol. Unai Emery’s Villarreal contributed much but this was Chelsea’s trophy.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A prominent horse racing trainer pleaded guilty on Wednesday to involvement in what US prosecutors have called a global scheme to systematically drug horses and cheat the betting public.

Jorge Navarro admitted in federal court in Manhattan to involvement in a conspiracy to administer performance-enhancing drugs to horses, in order to win more prize money at racetracks.

“I was the organiser for a criminal activity that involved five or more participants. I coordinated the administration of non-FDA approved drugs that were misbranded or adulterated to horses under my care,” he said a statement to the court. “I abused a position of trust as I was a licensed horse trainer and the horses were in my custody at the time.”

He could be jailed for five years at his sentencing, which is scheduled for December. He has agreed to pay $25.9m in restitution, reflecting winnings tied to doping. Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil accepted Navarro’s guilty plea.

“As he admitted today, Navarro, a licensed trainer and the purported ‘winner’ of major races across the world, was in fact a reckless fraudster whose veneer of success relied on the systematic abuse of the animals under his control,” US attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.

Jason Kreiss, Navarro’s lawyer, said in an email the trainer accepted responsibility for his actions.

At least 31 trainers, veterinarians, drug distributors and others have been charged since March 2020 over alleged doping affecting races in New York, Kentucky, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and the United Arab Emirates. Seven defendants have pleaded guilty and one entered a deferred prosecution agreement, court records show.

Other defendants include Jason Servis, the trainer of Maximum Security, who appeared to win the 2019 Kentucky Derby before being disqualified for interference. That horse also won the $20m Saudi Cup, the world’s richest horse race, before Servis was charged.

Servis is seeking to suppress a variety of wiretap evidence, including from Navarro‘s phone. Rita Glavin, a lawyer for Servis, declined to comment.

Navarro’s career winnings total $34.9m, led by $3m for the gelding X Y Jet, according to racing industry database provider Equibase.

Prosecutors said Navarro regularly drugged that horse, including with a substance he called “monkey,” in March 2019 before it won the Dubai Golden Shaheen, collecting $1.5m. X Y Jet died of an apparent heart attack in January 2020.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As a boyhood Barcelona fan and Monaco man Cesc Fàbregas has ample reason to fear the ramifications of Lionel Messi’s seismic shift to Paris Saint-Germain. The ripple effects of Messi’s every move, however, are not lost on a friend and former teammate still processing the astonishing events of the past seven days.

“For France and Ligue 1 this is another dimension,” admits Fàbregas, who was 13 when he first encountered the great Argentinian trialling for Barcelona. Their friendship survives 21 years on.

“Sometimes I tell Leo he doesn’t know how big he is. He goes to places and thinks the reaction is normal because he has been raised being the best and has been always surrounded by fans. But when you see it from the outside it is something I’ve not seen around anyone else. Sometimes there are more followers of Leo as a person than for a single club. A lot of people now will be following Ligue 1, especially with Leo there. The three of them, with Neymar and [Kylian] Mbappé there, will be fantastic to watch.”

The reaction to Messi’s arrival in Paris has been surprisingly enthusiastic inside the Monaco dressing room too. Niko Kovac’s young team finished third in Ligue 1 last season, one place and four points behind their Qatar-funded rivals from the capital, and while their chances of closing the gap may have suffered their motivation to do so has only increased.

Fàbregas, an elder statesman of the team at 34, says: “All the boys are super-excited. For some, they were only dreaming of this and now they have a lot of enthusiasm knowing they will be playing against Lionel Messi. Most of them are French kids – maybe Monaco fans or PSG fans from Paris when they were little – and they cannot believe that Leo is playing for PSG. Everyone wants his shirt. They all want me to ask him already to keep a shirt for them when we play each other in mid-December. I’ve told them he probably has two and we are 25 [players] so I don’t know how to do that.

“But it’s nice to see the excitement and the will – they want to compete against the very best and show their talents. This Monaco team is full of young talent right now and it will be a big test for them. They know that and I think this excitement will be a good thing for them to be motivated throughout the season. When the right time comes to play against the best player in the world they can show what they can do.”

The former Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder is in the final year of his contract and does not buy the argument that, with Messi, Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi Donnarumma and others on board at PSG this summer, his last season with the club will be spent chasing their shadow. With Lille winning Ligue 1 last season, Marseille improving and Monaco developing, Fàbregas believes there will be external as well as internal pressure on PSG, for whom a first Champions League triumph is now a must.

“When PSG don’t win the league everyone sees it as a disaster because they spend a lot of money,” he says. “Everyone takes it that this is a one-team league but in the last five years they’ve won three because Lille and Monaco have also won the title and put the brakes on their winning streak. It is a competitive league. It is not as easy as people think. It’s very aggressive, very intensive, very fast with strong players who defend very well.

“I’m sure as a coach [Mauricio] Pochettino prefers to have a fantastic squad with a lot of pressure on himself knowing he needs to win than the other way around. They must have pressure when they create a super team like that. It’s obvious they want to win the Champions League.

“They’ve been trying to catch it for a very long time and it seems like this is the last push – like, there is nothing better than Lionel Messi, there is no better defender than Ramos, [Georginio] Wijnaldum is one of the best midfielders at the moment, [Achraf] Hakimi is one of the best right-backs in Europe. It feels like they are doing the little extra final push to see where it takes them. We will see.

“Football these days is very competitive. The line is so thin between winning and losing, more than ever I would say. That’s why there are so many 0-0s, 1-1s, extra times and penalties. It’s all penalties nowadays because all the coaches study each other and all the teams know each other very well.

“Football is about competing and having the passion to do well. Football is about having the dream and the enthusiasm to always be better than the rest. Is it going to be possible? We don’t know. But we have to try.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It provided the story of this and plenty other golfing years. Phil Mickelson, a few weeks short of his 51st birthday, strode to US PGA Championship glory at Kiawah Island as giddy crowds engulfed the 72nd fairway. Mickelson had done his bit for ageing sportspeople everywhere by virtue of a freakish result on account of form alone.

Mickelson balanced South Carolina “realism” – the concept that he may never win again with the potential to go on a streak. By July and the Open Championship, a dejected Mickelson departed after 36 holes. “I’m having some challenges staying sharp,” he said. His focus, one assumes, was hardly helped by a needless and very public spat with a local reporter in Detroit immediately before he signed for rounds of 80 and 72 at Royal St George’s.

He remains newsworthy because of what lies ahead. Mickelson has played in a dozen consecutive Ryder Cups since 1995 and is, therefore, a part of the event’s fabric. Yet it increasingly looks the case that, despite being a current major champion, he will not form part of Steve Stricker’s team at Whistling Straits. Mickelson appears resigned to that fate. “I haven’t had a top-10 outside of the PGA,” he said when en route to a share of 17th in Memphis last weekend. “You can’t take somebody that is that inconsistent.”

Mickelson’s PGA Tour finishes since January make stunning reading. Cut, T53, Cut, T35, T25, Cut, T21, Cut, 69, 1, Cut, T62, T61, T74, Cut, T17. To say Kiawah is the outlier is something of an understatement. Even more so, that is, when the calibre of those Mickelson held at bay is considered; Brooks Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen shared second.

A Ryder Cup minus Mickelson seems hard to imagine, just as Stricker will inevitably come under at least an element of external pressure to pick him. Stricker, it must be remembered, has six wildcard selections at his disposal. The PGA of America preside over the Ryder Cup; Mickelson is their 2021 champion. The two need not inevitably go hand in hand – just ask John Daly – but the optics are not entirely favourable if a major winner crowned four months earlier finds himself out of the picture.

Stricker has spoken effusively about having Tiger Woods involved in a background capacity in Wisconsin, should the 15-times major winner be physically able, but intriguingly there has been no such hint about Mickelson. Early this year Mickelson said it would be an honour to serve as a vice-captain but refused to explain further, on the basis that he harboured playing hopes. Removing Mickelson from the fold entirely would seem curious, not least because he appears nailed-on as a Ryder Cup captain of the not-so-distant future.

The relationship between Mickelson and the Ryder Cup is a fraught one. He won a singles match in vain on his debut, as Europe prevailed at Oak Hill, and did likewise in 1997. Mickelson sampled victory for the first time two years later, with his infamous – and disastrous – pairing with Woods next in 2004. Justin Rose’s victory over Mickelson was crucial to the miracle of Medinah in 2012, with Lefty taking very public aim at the US captain, Tom Watson, after a trouncing at Gleneagles in 2014.

Despite much talk of a Mickelson-inspired revolution in the US camp thereafter, Europe still eased to a win in Paris last time out in 2018 with two high-profile members of the visiting party involved in a Sunday night fracas. Any thoughts of succession planning are undermined by the appointment of Davis Love III, Ryder Cup captain in 2012, as the 2022 Presidents Cup captain.

Mickelson’s Ryder Cup record is not a case for selection. He has won 18 of 47 matches. The six-times major winner has creativity and shot-making capacity that may be ideal for Whistling Straits – where it would be normal for Stricker to insist on light rough, thereby assisting wayward shots – but the scale of Mickelson’s poor play is surely ominous enough to count out such a gamble.

At 32nd in the world rankings, Mickelson is one place behind Lee Westwood but even that element is skewed by the fact the former was 116th before US PGA success. Mickelson has a tiny window to produce something even approaching a decent run, thereby perhaps affording Stricker food for thought.

American galleries fawn over Mickelson, but even that would wear thin if he was an obvious Whistling Straits passenger. With Woods recovering from a serious car accident, we are faced with the very real prospect that neither he nor Mickelson may play in a Ryder Cup again. Both have won majors since the start of 2019.

In Collin Morikawa, Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Koepka, Justin Thomas and Xander Schauffele, Stricker has serious talent at his disposal. A revived Jordan Spieth for now sits just outside the automatic qualifying places, as do Patrick Reed, Patrick Cantlay, Daniel Berger and Harris English.

The Ryder Cup need not be the sole domain of the young, but the vigour in that group surely renders an out-of-sorts Mickelson unnecessary. Coming so soon after the greatest of personal highs, and despite his self-deprecation, for the 51-year-old this promises to be a troubling scenario.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jamaican hurdler Hansle Parchment has tracked down and thanked a Tokyo 2020 volunteer who paid for his taxi to the Olympic Stadium, where he won a gold medal the following day.

Parchment told the story in a video posted to social media last weekend, which ended with him meeting the volunteer, whom he called Tiana. He thanked her, showed her the gold medal, gave her a Jamaican Olympic shirt and paid her back the money she had lent.

“You were instrumental in me getting to the final that day,” he told her before they posed for a photo.

Tiana’s biggest prize may be yet to come though: the Sunday Gleaner reported Jamaica’s minister for tourism intends to host her on a trip to the Caribbean island.

“No matter where in the world she is, we want to reciprocate the kindness shown to one of our own,” Jamaica’s minister for tourism, Edmund Bartlett, told the Sunday Gleaner.

At the Olympics, Jamaican hurdler @ParchmentHansle accidentally showed up to the wrong venue for his race.

Then, he tracked down the woman to say thank you.

Parchment feared he would miss last Wednesday’s 110m hurdles semi-final when he got on the wrong coach and ended up at what he believes was one of the aquatics venues. All the official Tokyo 2020 cars were booked and taking a bus back to the Olympic village and then another to the stadium would have left him struggling to make the start of the race.

“If I had done that, I wouldn’t get there in time to even warm up. I had to find another way. I was trying to get one of the branded cars for the Games to take me, but these people are very strict and adhering to the rules, and I would have to have to book the car from beforehand to get it to leave,” he said on the video posted to social media.

That is when he saw Tiana. “I saw this volunteer and I had to beg, ‘cause of course she is not allowed to do much, and she actually gave me some money to take one of the taxis. And that’s how I was able to get to the warm-up in time, and had enough time to compete,” Parchment said.

Parchment won bronze at the 2012 Olympics but missed the Games in 2016 due to injury. The 31-year-old only finished third in the Jamaican trials for Tokyo and did not win either his heat or semi-final on his way to the final. However, once there he beat a high-quality field in a season-best time of 13.04 seconds to take the Olympic title.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lauren Price is to speak to the promoter Eddie Hearn about the prospect of turning professional after winning Olympic gold on Sunday.

The 27-year-old – who appeared 52 times for Wales in football, was a world champion in kickboxing and also competed in taekwondo before switching to boxing – has yet to decide whether to make the switch to becoming a professional, having previously said she would like to defend her middleweight title at the next Olympics in Paris. But in an interview on Wednesday after she returned home from Tokyo, Price revealed that Matchroom promoter had been in touch.

“I’ve had a lot of people message me – obviously the big man as well, Eddie Hearn” she told BBC Radio Wales. “He’s asked to have a chat with me. It’s opened my options up, but for now I’m just going to take some rest and enjoy the moment.

“When you win an Olympic medal it changes your life. Starting off as a pro, if you’ve got that type of background, you’ve reached the top in the amateur game … then the price, as you say, will be pretty interesting.”

Price could follow the example of Nicola Adams, who made history by winning gold at London 2012 and successfully defended her title four years later at the Rio Games. If she remains as an amateur she would also be in line to compete for Wales at next year’s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.

“I’m still young and Paris is only three years away, so I could be a double Olympian,” she said. “ I’ll take a few weeks off and chill out and then go from there. But I love what I do – I’ve got a great life training in Sheffield, training with world-class coaches in a world-class programme.

“In the women’s game it’s getting bigger and bigger all the time, so another three years it will be bigger again and [I can] just go from there then.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A grand jury has charged two coaches with murder and child cruelty in the death of a Georgia high school basketball player who suffered a heat stroke after practicing outdoors in nearly 100F (38C) weather, an attorney for the player’s family said Tuesday.

The Atlanta-area grand jury indicted Larosa Walker-Asekere and Dwight Palmer last month, according to court records and news outlets.

Imani Bell, a 16-year-old junior at Elite Scholars Academy in Clayton county, just south of Atlanta, was participating in drills for the girls’ basketball team in August 2019, when she collapsed after running up the football stadium steps, according to a lawsuit her family filed in February against administrators at the school. The temperature was in the high 90s fahrenheit (more than 35C), and the area was under a heat advisory.

Imani died later that day of heat-related cardiac arrest and kidney failure, according to the suit.

Justin Miller, an attorney for the girl’s family, said Tuesday that the indictment “sends a signal that the DA is taking this seriously.” His office had received a copy of it.

But he added that he wants to see the case move ahead “swiftly.”

“The point of the case is the prosecution, not just the charges,” he said.

Miller identified Walker-Asekere as the head basketball coach and Palmer as an assistant, and he said both were on site at the time and in charge of the children.

Court records do not list an attorney for either defendant. Messages for attorneys listed for Walker-Asekere in a separate case were not immediately returned.

The family’s lawsuit says school officials violated a Georgia High School Association rule banning outdoor practices in weather conditions such as those that Imani faced. It also says they never properly measured the temperature in advance.

The school district declined comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Football’s coming home – and away. After a year and a half of TV games with piped fan noise and the only swearing from the suddenly audible players, the frisson of real away travel is here. Soon will come the excitement of seeing the floodlights of a strange town as you arrive on the train and the despairing chants when your side go 6-0 down with 20 minutes left of: “You’re nothing special, we lose every week!”

Old rituals will have to be remembered. The dress code for an away day is always difficult. Colours under a concealing jacket, perhaps? A long coat marks you out as a soft southerner, a furry parka or cap as an Essex Man. Something blander to blend in is best. Big pockets are useful to conceal anything intellectual such as books. Accessories are important, too. My pal Big Joe once took a copy of Granta and an umbrella to Sunderland, making me wonder if we’d ever get out alive.

Train journeys always seem to involve strangely optimistic fans drinking at unfathomable hours. Then comes the expectant rush at the ticket barrier. Upon arrival there is the ceaseless search for alien chip shops and greasy spoons and then an attempt to find where they sell the programmes and a pub that might serve away fans. Getting past the stewards can present several problems. One friend had his four mini‑yogurts confiscated by a steward at Manchester City. Yet he also liked to shave on the train up north and managed to get into another northern enclave carrying a packet of disposable razors. Another pal had his copy of the Saturday Guardian confiscated at Stoke because it was deemed a fire risk.

Away tickets are difficult to get hold of following West Ham and I’ve often had to pass myself off as a home fan, having obtained a seat through friendly rival fans. This can necessitate strange actions, such as pretending to be a senior citizen at Chelsea and having to be nice about Frank Lampard, or north of Watford never speaking in case they detect your accent. It’s also rather difficult when you almost leap out of your seat after a beautiful curler from Michail Antonio and then have to pretend you are simply applauding the home goalkeeper’s fine parry.

At least in the designated away section you can enjoy chanting without censorship. Humiliating defeats still create moments of surreal humour. A 4-0 West Ham loss at Charlton was memorable for a rousing and lengthy chorus from the away end of: “Oh Christian Dailly, you are the love of my life!” – the next line is probably best not repeated.

The fans’ internal jukeboxes also take some fathoming. It was at Crystal Palace with its wooden seats and low roof where I first discovered the West Ham fans’ chant of “We’ve got Payet” was being sung to the unlikely tune of Achy Breaky Heart by Billy Ray Cyrus. When an anti-board chorus of “It’s all lies, lies, lies!” went up at Watford two years ago, it was intriguing to think that someone had kept Slade’s Cum On Feel The Noize in their mental library just in case it might be useful for a dig at David Sullivan.

Certain grounds can evoke a Proustian rush of frying burger smells and other memories. Seeing the lyrics of Elton John’s Your Song on the stand at Watford takes me right back to black vinyl and being 13. Old Trafford evokes Hammers’ fans singing “My name is Ludek Miklosko, I come from near Moscow!” at a tram station after a draw in the FA Cup. Sitting up in the gods at Newcastle still reminds me of an all-you-can eat Chinese lunch and sitting with a posh anthropologist friend who compared both home and away fans to pike-wielding yeomen about to fight in the Hundred Years war.

Away days can give great highs and massive lows. There was nothing better than standing outside the Emirates singing: “Last win at Highbury, first win at Emirates!” in the Great Escape season of 2007. Conversely a 3-2 defeat at Wigan after being 2-0 up ensured West Ham were relegated in 2011. To round it off a plane flew above the stadium with the banner: “Avram Grant: Millwall Legend.” Grant was sacked on the way home and it was the footballing equivalent of Joy Division’s Atmosphere, or perhaps Love Will Tear Us Apart.

But it is, as they say, a day out. Soon away fans will be back, Covid passes permitting. We’ll be listening to the angriest men in the world on car radio phone-ins, returning on delayed trains that have invariably run out of beer and sandwiches, and staggering off the train wanting a compensatory pint in the Doric Arch at Euston only to find it’s shut. Can your team do it on a cold night in Brentford or Burnley? We’re about to find out.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Crystal Palace have confirmed that John Textor has become the club’s newest investor and director after paying almost £90m for his stake.

Textor, who failed with an attempt to purchase 25% of Benfica last month, will join his fellow American co-owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer and the chairman Steve Parish on Palace’s board, despite being understood to have initially hoped to buy the club outright.

“I have looked at many opportunities across European football in which to invest so I could follow my passion for football and have a meaningful stake in a club,” said Textor, who made his fortune through the hologram company Facebank, which has merged with FuboTV. “Over the past six months of discussions, I have also developed a real affinity to Crystal Palace FC, its history, the staff and, of course, most importantly the supporters who create an incredible atmosphere at every game – one I cannot wait to witness again when supporters return to fill Selhurst Park this season. I very much look forward to working with the chairman and the other partners.”

It is hoped that Textor’s investment of £87.5m for what is believed to be a substantial percentage of the club close to Parish’s 18% controlling stake will significantly reduce debts at Selhurst Park and help to redevelop the stadium, with plans for a new main stand yet to progress despite years of planning.

The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.

“We have been looking for the right investment for the right investor for a while, both to progress the club and deal with the significant financial challenges of the past 18 months due to Covid,” Parish said. “I’m delighted that search led us to John, who has invested significant sums, helping to facilitate the rejuvenation of the squad, bolster the balance sheet and enable the club to finalise the academy. We all look forward to working with John, who has a strong passion for football and a growing knowledge and affinity to Crystal Palace.”

Palace face Chelsea on Saturday in Patrick Vieira’s first match since succeeding Roy Hodgson as manager, with the former France international having added the defenders Marc Guéhi and Joachim Andersen for more than a combined £35m up front. He is believed to still have significant funds to make more additions after the departures of several regular first-team players, with another left-back and striker likely a priority.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Phil Foden has revealed he is likely to miss the first three or four weeks of the season with his foot injury. The Manchester City and England midfielder is troubled by the problem that ruled him out of the Euro 2020 final.

“It is still a little bit sore,” Foden told Sky Sports News. “It was such a shame to do it just before the Euro final. It was really unfortunate but I am working hard in the gym and hopefully I can get back as soon as possible. I would say [it will be] around three to four weeks. Hopefully it flies by and I can just get back on the pitch.”

Foden’s injury will means he will have to wait to line up alongside his England teammate Jack Grealish, City’s new record £100m signing. He said: “I am really happy he has signed here and hopefully I can just get back playing with him and enjoy my football. He’s fearless on the ball and can change a game on his own. He’s a really special player for us and he’s going to be key for us.”

City’s playmaker Kevin De Bruyne is also set to miss the start of the Premier League season with the ankle problem sustained with Belgium. The club play their first match at Tottenham on Sunday.

Foden said he wept when it became apparent he would miss the Euro 2020 final against Italy. “I remember speaking to the manager [Gareth Southgate] when I got injured and just burst out crying – the devastation that I was injured,” Foden said. “But I was just praying on the day that the team won; it’s just unfortunate that we didn’t.”

Article 13 of the Scottish FA’s rulebook deals with dual interests in clubs; in this case, both play in the same division. It may well be that Strachan is asked to sever ties with one of the clubs.

Celtic announced on Tuesday evening that Strachan, their manager between 2005 and 2009, was returning in a three-month consultancy role.

A statement read: “Gordon will spend his time looking at our activities within our football academy, our women’s team and newly established B team, with a view to providing recommendations to chief executive Dom McKay on how we can develop these areas further, feeding into wider work ongoing across the club.”

Strachan said: “Great people at Celtic always do great work. I look forward to building on this work, liaising with Dom and all our Celtic colleagues once again and hope we can work together for the benefit of the club and these teams so they ultimately can develop further and bring Celtic success.”

Eyebrows were raised with Strachan’s subsequent assertion that he was looking “forward to continuing my work at Dundee FC where I have established a great working relationship and close bond with the manager, managing director, staff and coaches”. Strachan has been Dundee’s technical director since the summer of 2019.

In a subsequent statement Dundee said: “This evening it has been announced that Gordon has taken a short-term consultancy role with Celtic Football Club but this will not affect his role with Dundee FC. We have been in constant communication with Gordon and Celtic throughout this process.”

Yet not, it would seem, with the Scottish FA. Its articles of association state that without written consent of the board: “any person who (i) is a member of a club, (ii) is involved in any capacity whatsoever in the management or administration of a club or (iii) has any power whatsoever to influence the management or administration of a club may not take up any such role with another club until such time as the Scottish FA is reasonably satisfied that such person has ceased to hold such role in the first club.”

The professional game board is scheduled to meet next week. Celtic cantered to a 6-0 win over newly-promoted Dundee on Sunday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In what is a YouTube classic, Walter Smith makes his discontent at a line of questioning from BBC Scotland’s Chick Young perfectly clear. It is the mid 1990s and Smith, after yet another harrowing European evening for a team untouchable in Scotland, is asked in pretty mild terms whether his high-profile signings from abroad have lived up to expectations. The manager and reporter get on very well normally, but the obliteration of Young by Smith makes plain his frustration with the result.

Postmortems attached to Rangers in Europe are neither new nor particularly appealing. It is just that the one necessary now has changed in form. Whether at the behest of Steven Gerrard or Rangers as a club, the manager conducts no regular media briefings outside commercial and contractual obligations. The whys and wherefores of that are for another time, but besides this being a dire look for a manager of such high profile and a club that prides itself on class and status it presents him with a problem.

There may well be underlying reasons for Rangers’ dismal start to the season – it would seen sensible to believe there are – but Gerrard has no forum to properly articulate them, attributable or otherwise, to bemused supporters. Despite what that YouTube clip may suggest, Smith was a master at delivering media messages that favourably shaped coverage of his team in good times and bad. Gerrard’s detachment may well appeal to those who want Rangers on a permanent war footing with the world, but it is counterproductive.

Even in a city where football-related exaggeration is practically an art form, it is perfectly fair to say Rangers’ Champions League exit at the hands of Malmö on Tuesday was an embarrassment. The visitors played the second half at a packed Ibrox with 10 men, Alfredo Morelos having levelled the tie on aggregate in the 18th minute. Jon Dahl Tomasson worked magic at half-time as Rangers wilted. Gerrard used “fear” and “panic” to describe his players’ approach.

There is a curious theory on the rise that contrasts Rangers’ behind-closed-doors stroll to the Premiership title last season with their travails this season and suggests the presence of supporters is causing them difficulties. Three losses in a row fuels this narrative. It isn’t yet particularly valid; 4,600 Dundee United fans should not legitimately prompt fear and alarm. At Ibrox on Tuesday, even when the tide was turning, those in the stands audibly backed Rangers rather than screaming in collective anxiety.

Gerrard’s problems look more fundamental. What the former Liverpool captain has to prove is that last season’s title was not the exception to the rule for a team easily second-best to Celtic in the two previous seasons. An outstanding campaign by their goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, and the paucity of domestic opposition, masked defensive deficiencies that came to the fore against Malmö.

Rangers’ full-backs are superb as attacking options; they are shaky when put under serious pressure. The centre-backs, whoever he picks, are prone to errors. These problems are not breaking news. Neither is the refusal or inability to switch from pretty standard tactical approaches, much as that is irrelevant with defensive calamities such as those that occurred against Malmö. The absence of Ryan Jack and Glen Kamara hinders Gerrard in respect of shielding his backline, but that provides even more reason for a shape rethink.

It reflects on Ross Wilson, the sporting director, as much if not more than on Gerrard, that from a position of strength Rangers have not made many signings that affect their starting XI. Ryan Kent joined, initially on loan, in 2018. Other key players – McGregor, Steven Davis, Connor Goldson, James Tavernier, Borna Barisic and Morelos – have been in situ since, at the latest, 2019.

There is much to be said for stability but Rangers have recently largely signed players who lurk on the fringes. The notion that the existing players are of blue-chip variety is undermined by the lack of top-level interest in their services. Kent, consistently linked with Leeds, is woefully out of sorts.

John Lundstram, who arrived from Sheffield United with considerable hype this summer, was consigned to the bench for Malmö’s visit after some dismal displays. It is almost as if he moved to Rangers from a team who collected 23 points in last season’s Premier League. Fashion Sakala, signed from Oostende, did at least appear in the latter stages and looked lively.

The all-consuming celebrations after Rangers reclaimed the league flag were understandable. The club had waited a decade. Nonetheless, there was a hidden danger this focus on blocking Celtic’s 10-in-a-row quest – and Celtic suffered from the same skewed vision as they pursued it – blocked development. It was abundantly clear Rangers were going to win the league early in 2021, at which point attention should have been on readiness for a Champions League qualifying campaign. Serious stuff, if you will. Instead, they have arrived at games that could have given Rangers a massive financial boost looking unprepared, in terms of personnel and physicality.

Speculation now surrounds whether the lack of Champions League bounty will nudge Rangers towards player departures, which one glance at their accounts suggests would be wise. Yet it may also be that in a football sense this team are in need of far more rejuvenation than many appreciated. Gerrard has little time to find solutions, even if he has no scope to expand on what, from his perspective, his headaches actually relate to.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lionel Messi has been presented as a Paris Saint-Germain player for the first time. The forward has arrived in Paris after leaving Barcelona earlier this week. The 34-year-old has signed a two-year deal which is worth about €35m a year net and has an option to extend. He made an emotional farewell to Barcelona after a trophy-laden 21 years at the club and was paraded in Paris on Wednesday with the Argentinian ready to start a new chapter in his remarkable football story.

• Messi to PSG: the inside story of how a stunning deal was done
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ICI C’EST LE FIVER

The Fiver is not one to wallow in nostalgia unless it’s spillage from last night’s Tin. But on Wednesday we did find ourselves pining for the days when Parisians were impressed by no one but themselves, and would greet newcomers to their city with a sniff and a subtle but emphatic shooing motion. OK, maybe that was just for The Fiver, which is nothing if not an unkempt vagabond, but still, there was definitely something undignified about the way many Parisians abandoned all decorum as they welcomed Lionel Messi to the French capital for his official introduction.

Hundreds of fans assembled outside the stadium to stare at walls while singing songs of praise to the Argentinian maestro, while inside PSG set the tone by beginning their coverage of “the first unveiling in Messi’s history” an hour before the event. At one point the camera focused on the door out of which Messi would walk on his way to the auditorium, prompting the presenter to gush: “We will be able to listen to his footsteps!” Another presenter nearly swooned as she contemplated the “love story between PSG and Messi”, which, in fairness, is one way to describe a whirlwind relationship sealed by nearly 30 million kisses per year.

PSG’s top blazer gave a warm welcome to the mention of money, praising a BBC journalist for asking “a very great question” when she inquired about how the club can pay Messi’s salary, on top of those of all their other lavishly remunerated stars, while complying with financial fair play regulations. “We have always followed FFP regulations from day one and we always will,” insisted Nasser Al-Khelaifi – PSG president and Uefa executive committee member - before suggesting Messi will effectively pay for himself, at least partly, by attracting commercial partners and social media likes. The Fiver knows nothing of such concepts but would be interested to get a breakdown of the figures. Come to think of it, it’d also be intrigued to see evidence for Khelaifi’s subsequent assertion that Mauricio Pochettino is “the best coach in the world”.

In fairness, the excitement was getting to everyone – even Messi described the prospect of him linking up with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé as “madness”. Khelaifi then took the opportunity to tell Mbappé that the prospect of being part of the Eminem strikeforce should convince him to sign a new contract with the club, warning: “Now he has no excuse to do anything else.” All in all, Messi cut a very different figure to the forlorn patsy who, just three days ago, sobbed at Barcelona’s inability to keep shovelling money into his account. He aired his “immense happiness” at joining PSG, declaring that the team had world class players in every position, and on a day when even the understatements were over the top, Messi said: “I’ve come to add my two pennies’ worth.”

QUOTE OF THE DAY

“If I get the best out of him this season, I think it will be very difficult for us to keep hold of him. I am sure there will be Premier League teams knocking at the door trying to get him” – Wayne Rooney predicts his own coaching skills are going to be so good that he’ll have to beat off suitors for Ravel Morrison, who scored on his debut as Derby Rooneyballed their way to a Milk Cup win on penalties over Salford.

FIVER LETTERS

“Re: Gerry Rickard’s letter [Yesterday’s Fiver] regarding the ‘Lionel Itchy’ missed opportunity. When Manchester United released Quinton Fortune, I was eager for the South African midfielder to become a target for numerous clubs before settling on a move to Sheffield United, thereby teeing up the headline “Fortune Favours The Blades”. This didn’t happen. Have any other readers constructed amusing headlines that have never seen the light of day due to events not unfolding as they might have wished?” – Andy Korman.

“How do you say ‘thank you very much’ in Parisian football slang? Messi beaucoup?” – Peter Oh.

“I finally followed your link and read Big Website’s comprehensive list of summer transfers from Europe’s top five leagues. While I appreciated your summary of certain major moves (Tuesday’s Fiver), how could you have missed reporting on Lokomotiv Moscow’s acquisition, from Bayer Leverkusen, of defender Tin Jedvaj? Moreover, why didn’t you buy Jedvaj yourselves? I don’t know what the transfer budget is at Fiver Towers FC, but I’d have thought that Tin would have filled most of your squad’s pressing needs” – R Reisman.

“I see on Big Website that ‘Ronald Koeman is now short of striking options with Martin Braithwaite, Antoine Griezmann and Memphis Depay his only available forwards’. Slavisa Jokanovic must relate, having only Lys Mousset, Rhian Brewster, Ollie McBurnie, Ollie Burke, David McGoldrick and Billy Sharp available …” – Trevor Townson.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After Joe Root surpassed Graham Gooch’s tally of 8,900 Test runs, Jimmy Anderson has said that he is “absolutely” backing his England captain to make it the top of the list. That feat would require Root to overhaul his predecessor, Alastair Cook, whose total stands some way off at 12,472.

“Every time he goes out there he is just class,” said Anderson, “and today he looked class from ball one.” Root had come to the crease against India at Lord’s with England 23 for two – and with Mohammed Siraj on a hat‑trick, after Dom Sibley and Haseeb Hameed had fallen in consecutive deliveries.

But Root weathered the hat-trick ball and piloted England through choppy waters to leave them 119 for three at the close, chasing India’s first-innings score of 364.

“When you see your captain go out and play like that on a hat-trick ball, it does seem to have a really calming effect on the dressing room,” said Anderson, “so I’m sure there’s much more to come from him.

“Joe’s been amazing through his career and this last 12 months in particular. With everything that we’ve been through with the pandemic and the pressures on this team, to be able to captain the side and perform the way he has been is nothing short of superhuman.”

Anderson, who added his own name to the honours board again with his seventh five-wicket haul at Lord’s, also had words of encouragement for his fellow England bowlers. He said the group were “still trying to feel our way and get some rhythm” after their lack of red‑ball cricket.

The 39-year-old Anderson was an injury worry the day before this Test began, having undergone a scan for stiffness in a quad. But the bowler said the Lord’s ground where he made his Test debut and took his first ever Test five-fer “does seem to bring the best out of me”.

“Certainly the last few times I’ve come here you think: ‘Will this be my last time playing here?’” he said. “So hopefully it’s not my last time here, and hopefully it’s not my last time on the honours board.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As England’s openers walked out to bat at Lord’s on the second afternoon, a ghostly figure took his seat on the balcony to watch them. Half in light, half in shadow, Haseeb Hameed perched in the doorway of the dressing room and patiently waited for a chance that has been almost five years in the making.

Hameed is 24 years old, England’s incumbent No 3 batsman, a player of immense promise and potential, and yet ever since his Test debut in India in late 2016 his career has largely been conceived in terms of loss. In a parallel universe, in the world of romantic imagination, he does not break his thumb and lose his place. He does not return to Lancashire and spend the next two seasons mislaying all concept of his off stump. He does not spoil or ruin or succumb to paralysis and self-doubt. Instead, he nails down one of the toughest jobs in international cricket: opening the batting for England in the post-Alastair Cook era. Of course he errs and struggles, as England err and struggle, but along the way he also repays a little faith. He scores a gutsy, heartwarming century in the 2019 Ashes. He hits an emotional ton at Lord’s against the future world champions. He makes runs on the baked earth of South Africa, the warm soil of the Caribbean, the green pastures of New Zealand. By mid-2021, he’s faced and survived more balls than any opener in the world since his debut.

Instinctively, this feels like a tale of modest triumph. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it isn’t. Either way, it didn’t happen, or at least not to Hameed.

The description you’ve just read is, in fact, the international career of Rory Burns. The 30-year-old Burns is not the shiny new thing any more, and nor is he the winsome comeback kid. Even on his better days, I don’t get the feeling he inspires any great affection amongst English cricket fans. Partly this is because he is associated with so few golden memories: of his eight highest Test scores, two have come in draws and five (!) in defeats.

Partly it’s because he so rarely dominates or takes attacks apart. Partly, you sense, it’s because – unlike Hameed – he looks so skewed and awkward at the crease, like a man being forced to bat in a store cupboard, and so when he gets out on some level you feel like he deserved it. Burns averages just under 33 in Test cricket. Actually, this isn’t bad. It’s slightly higher than the average for all Test openers since his debut. According to the ICC rankings, he is the seventh best opener in the world. He scored 81 two games ago. He scored 132 the game before that.

But this is the England Test team in the time of Covid, where nothing is ever quite fixed or settled or embedded, and so none of that really gets remembered. For all but a handful of his 49 Test innings, Burns has been playing for his survival. Getting to international cricket feels like the pinnacle. In fact, it’s just the start. Once the initial mystique has gone, you’re essentially an open book. By the time a batsman has played 20 Tests – and these days, often much earlier than that – they have already been dissected and anatomised like a laboratory frog. It’s all there: the clips, the pitch maps, the scoring analysis, where you like it, where you don’t. The first time Burns played Australia, he got off the mark with his favourite clip through midwicket. Captains don’t make that mistake any more. Here, the midwicket gap was plugged right from the start.

Nowadays, teams have intricate, bespoke plans for you: probing your weaknesses, or maybe just messing with your head. Here it was two slips, a slightly closer fourth slip and a slightly deeper fifth slip. Later it was with two men out in the deep, in the knowledge that Burns often likes to pull from outside off stump. And unlike in county cricket, the challenge is relentless. When you play Hampshire in May, you know that the reward for seeing off Kyle Abbott and Mohammad Abbas is a bit of Ian Holland medium pace. Here, the reward for seeing off 11 testing overs from Ishant Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah, is 11 more from Mohammeds Shami and Siraj.

Burns hasn’t always thrived in the glare. Like most openers, he’s failed much more than he’s succeeded. But he doesn’t lob the ball straight to midwicket when a trap has been set for that very purpose, as Dom Sibley did in the first over after tea. He can keep out a straight half-volley on middle stump, as Hameed could not. And under the highest pressure, with England more than 300 behind, with the ball hooping around at pace, against a world-class attack and a backdrop of fatalism and dismay, he endured for 136 balls and three precious hours.

And yes, 49 runs is still only 49 runs. But in an England team riven by uncertainty and neglect, where the pool of talented top-order batsmen has dried to a sludge, Burns still feels like part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The clouds had rolled in and the lights were on by the time he finally made his way back to the pavilion, the job frustratingly only half-done. Up on the balcony, now wrapped in a tracksuit, Hameed was still watching.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There’s a long view from the top of the Edrich stand, these days. Make the mountainous climb to the new highest point of the Lord’s ground, and you can see out over blocks of flats, past London’s southwestern sprawl, all the way past the river. The green ridge of a wooded hill rises from the horizon like a mirage – that can’t, surely, be Richmond? – and gives you the sense that you’ve discovered your own private periscope above the crowded city.

Kumar Sangakkara, MCC’s current president, officially opened the new Compton and Edrich stands on the first day of the Test here. Just before play, he cut the ceremonial ribbon that the press release insisted was scarlet and gold, even if everyone in the ground knew that was just a fancy way of saying egg and bacon. But the spectators at the Hundred matches have been filling these seats for weeks now. They’ve already learned that you pace yourselves on the stairs if you don’t want to get a headrush.

The upper stands of the Compton and Edrich have always been exposed to the elements – and the new design offers no more shelter from the rain – but those who favour them appreciate them for the angled view over the bowler’s arm, and the backdrop of the world’s most famous cricketing edifice. Now, with a bit of juggling on Google maps and a decent imagination, you can trace a line from Thomas and Frank Verity’s pavilion to the streets of South Kensington, where their rich legacy of Victorian architecture mirrors the ornate detailing of the Lord’s turrets.

Cast your eyes back down to the field, and even the action takes on a different perspective. When you follow the game on the television it can feel like a series of miniature detonations, a tale told in morse code. Rory Burns trapped in front. Haseeb Hameed’s stumps broken first ball. The individual moments and close-up reactions we see repeated on the screen take on a life of their own, like the constructed memories of something you never actually witnessed.

From the eyrie at the top of the Edrich, you see both less and more. Events can be more ambiguous from this distance (was that a dropped catch by Joe Root at slip, or did Rishabh Pant miss the ball entirely?). But they can be more revealing, too. The scrambled running of India’s lower order, for instance, suggests that they’re not in quite the same carefree mood as Trent Bridge, and so does Ravi Jadeja, gesticulating at his batting partners from 20 paces. When Jonny Bairstow misses the stumps, attempting to run out Ishant, only those in the ground see how long he holds his hands to his head. It’s longer than it takes Virat Kohli to call for a DRS review.

From this vantage point, the field expands and contracts with the rhythm of the overs like the pulsing of a living organism. White-clothed players move across the greensward in endlessly shifting patterns, every movement and player invisibly connected. Cricket has always had a close kinship with mathematics but from this high in the stands the urgent power of statistics – the numbers that fill the scorers’ books and the data analysts’ heads – give way to the gentle beauty of geometry.

Sports stadiums are fascinating spaces – both public auditoriums, and the private workplaces of the players who perform there. We’re contained within them together, but separated by the touchline or the boundary rope. A ground like Lord’s comes with an even more complicated set of boundaries. It’s the home of cricket, a place of pilgrimage for all lovers of the sport, but it’s also the home of an exclusive private club rooted in the days of Empire, whose colonial power and privilege have reached across oceans and centuries.

That makes its architecture, and the message it offers, even more important than most. The ground has undergone constant development throughout its history, ever since Thomas Lord – a net bowler himself – first bought this St John’s Wood field to rent to a bunch of enthusiastic aristocrats from Islington – the original metropolitan elite. It may never cease to be an exclusive space, but it can become less exclusionary.

It was, one imagines, a financial inevitability that parts of the Compton and Edrich would end up off limits to all but the wealthy. A middle tier for debenture holders – containing two upmarket restaurants only they have the chance to eat in – merely continues the line of hospitality boxes encircling the ground. But it is something, at least, that the elegant walkway connecting them, which offers views across the Nursery Ground, has been opened to regular ticket holders, too.

And while Lord’s cannot pretend to be a democratic space, it can at least be a collective one. Friday was #RedforRuth day, when all those coming to the ground are encouraged to wear red in support of the Ruth Strauss Foundation. When the England team took to the field, they fanned themselves out into a heart shape, a beautiful gesture and one that you suspect took a little rehearsing beforehand. It looked great from above, but even better when your eye scanned the ground, and saw the stands illuminated by the red outfits of the spectators, who had followed their lead.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mikel Arteta smouldered and in front of him, Arsenal wilted. A comprehensive defeat to exuberant newcomers, a clutch of experienced players absent and others simply missing in action: this was the stuff nightmare starts to the season are made of and, in a situation that he is aware demands freshness and optimism, the manager finds himself on the back foot before 18 of his rivals have kicked a ball. Brentford’s night was a triumph for Arteta’s opposite number, Thomas Frank, and the latest occasion that laid the visitors’ long-standing problems starkly bare. Frank had noted before the match that there is “a part in every single game where all players feel a little bit insecure, a little bit under pressure”; he was spot on and it was Arsenal, facing top-flight novices, who buckled under moderate strain.

The mitigating factors are clear, although Arteta knows there is little room for excuses now and was unwilling to gloss over Arsenal’s vices. He entered this assignment without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, both of whom had fallen ill in the build-up. He had known for longer that Thomas Partey, who is likely to be out until next month, would not be around to anchor the midfield.

But it was initially possible to detect a silver lining in the reshuffle that ensued. There is legitimate unease about the lack of an obvious succession plan for Arteta’s two first-choice forwards, who are both struggling for consistency and in the autumn of their careers. The selection of Folarin Balogun and Gabriel Martinelli may have been forced on Arteta but it could have been framed as a welcome opportunity to point a way forwards. In the event neither player made much impression and it would have taken Olympic-level contortions to detect a revolution starting here.

0 'I would have been disappointed not to win': Thomas Frank on Brentford win over Arsenal – video

That was little reflection on the understudies. Balogun’s start was his first in the top flight: the 20-year-old’s reputation had preceded him until now, a protracted contract saga and overtures from clubs around England and Germany the most public clues surrounding his potential. Martinelli is a comparative veteran of 13 Premier League starts, although he is a fortnight younger than Balogun and started to his left. With Albert Sambi Lokonga, signed from Anderlecht this summer, making his own debut in midfield an optimist might have detected a vigour to match that of the hosts. Arsenal’s resources may have resembled an overly familiar comfort blanket during pre-season but circumstances had lent them a welcome airiness.

The theory was appealing but then the cloud descended. Balogun was involved in Arsenal’s two brightest first-half moments, such as they were, but shot over and was foiled by Rico Henry as he attempted to spin in the box. For Martinelli the gruel was similarly thin, although he miscued a near-post header after the interval. Both players had been withdrawn by the time Christian Nørgaard exploited a bouncing ball and atrocious defending to seal the outcome and reduce an improved second-half display to huff and puff.

Who could Balogun, Martinelli or Lokonga look to for leadership when the going got tough? Their burden became infinitely greater when Sergi Canós lashed inside Bernd Leno’s near post midway through the first half; there was a tide to turn and senior players needed to step up. At 26 Nicolas Pépé was the closest approximation to that in Arsenal’s front line but his performance was inconsequential; he was handed a lesson in initiative by the 21-year-old Emile Smith Rowe. Lokonga put in a claim to be their most effective performer over 90 minutes, impressing with his scanning of space and smartly-weighted passes, but would have been excused a sense of exasperation given the lack of protection Granit Xhaka offered the back line before half-time.

The youthful new blend could hardly be held responsible for old habits further back. The night’s biggest concern was the ease with which Brentford, with Canós and Bryan Mbuemo causing particular havoc, exposed familiar defensive uncertainties.

Ben White endured a debut to forget but, in the circumstances, might be bracketed similarly to his fellow newcomers: would he have fared better under the guidance of a more resolute, brave and commanding partner than the woeful Pablo Marí?

The nagging fear for Arteta may be that, although £75m has already been invested this summer, it is hard to see how Arsenal will look significantly better even when Aubameyang, Lacazette and Partey return. The odds favour a deal for Martin Ødegaard before the transfer window is done but changes of the “ruthless” nature he demanded in May look far-fetched unless the revolving door speeds up dramatically. Against a Brentford side whose own rawness had been well trailed, with 19 minutes of Premier League action between them before kick-off, this was an opportunity to calm suggestions that the rebuild Arsenal desperately need looks far off. Instead the question marks loom as large as ever.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A few years ago I wrote a piece on “double-header” matches – the phenomenon whereby a women’s match is played directly before a men’s match in an effort to increase crowd sizes for the women. The headline will give you an idea of my view: “Double headers are the future – but they stink”.

When I found out, therefore, that the inaugural edition of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s new competition, the Hundred, would be played almost entirely as double headers, my heart sank. I envisaged the women’s matches relegated to “warm-up” status; press boxes filled with retrograde journalists who only bothered to turn up to cover the men; female players being hurried along by the umpires to make way for the day’s “main event”; crowds who arrived to watch the men. In the 10 years I have been covering women’s cricket, these have all been regular occurrences at double headers in England and around the world.

But here is the revolutionary thing about the Hundred: it is transforming the double header into a format which is wafting a much-needed, delicious aroma of equality across English sport.

The biggest difference between the Hundred and previous double headers is in the numbers coming through the gate to watch the women’s matches. At the time of writing, after 22 completed matches, the cumulative crowd figure for the women’s competition is 170,000 – an average of 7,500 a game. The match between London Spirit and Southern Brave at Lord’s on Sunday 1 August broke the record for the highest attendance at a women’s domestic match in England, attracting 15,189 spectators. Ticket sales for the remainder of the competition are said to be flying.

These crowds are bigger than anything we have seen before in women’s cricket outside World Cup finals. The 2019 Kia Super League attracted 27,000 (an average of 870 people across the 31 match days), while at the 2019 Women’s Ashes in England, the most high-profile bilateral series in the women’s game, the average crowd was only 2,400.

Cricket is even beginning to look like seriously challenging football as the best-attended women’s sport in England, something which no one would have thought possible a month ago. The average attendance across the 2019-20 Women’s Super League (the last to commence pre-Covid) was 3,401.

There’s no doubt that the popularity of the Hundred (women’s competition) has taken everybody by surprise. That includes the ECB, whose attendance objectives for the women’s competition have already been smashed. “If we’re honest, we didn’t quite know how the double headers were going to go,” said Beth Barrett-Wild, head of the Hundred women’s competition. “But when I walk into the stadium now, I’m expecting 7,500 people to come and watch – it’s mad!”

Why, then, are double headers working in this context? Barrett-Wild says it comes down to “the core proposition of the Hundred – men’s and women’s sport on the same platform”, adding: “The marketing has really signposted the fact that this is one match day – two matches, one club. We’re not trying to sell two separate competitions – it is one competition played by men and women, and I think that really helps.”

It is noticeable that largely speaking, journalists seem to be paying equal attention to the women’s and the men’s matches. A small caveat is that hiring the same TV commentary teams for both games is not working. It is embarrassing how little most male former professionals appear to know about women’s cricket, and infuriating that they assume viewers won’t know or care they are getting basic facts and names wrong.

Also crucial is the fact that the matches have been scheduled with less than an hour between the women’s and men’s games. Previously, I’d been huffily informed that it was unreasonable to expect male cricketers to adjust their two-and-a-half-hour pre-match routine (requiring full use of the main ground) for lowly females. That this ridiculous attitude has been dispensed with is testament to a shifting power dynamic in cricket, which seems to have finally woken up to the fact that alienating 50% of the population is not a sustainable strategy.

There is also the fact that the women’s teams are proving what some of us knew – they are just as entertaining as the men. Be it 16-year-old Alice Capsey hitting a half-century in her first match at Lord’s, or Jemimah Rodrigues scoring 92 not out from 43 balls (the highest score in the men’s or women’s competitions to date), it does make a mockery of the huge competition pay disparity. (The highest-paid women earn £15,000; the lowest-paid men £24,000.) Even Barrett-Wild acknowledges this. “The contribution that the women have made to the success of the Hundred is almost unquantifiable – for the Hundred to work it needs to have a strong men’s and women’s competition. We need to reward the women appropriately.”

The million-dollar question is whether the success of the Hundred can be translated into bigger audiences for other women’s cricket. Barrett-Wild is hopeful of a “halo effect”, whereby interest in female players increases across the board. The long-term future of the game depends on investment in the new regional domestic structure which sits alongside the Hundred, and in the struggling club network underneath. One successful competition does not make a summer, as the saying doesn’t quite go – but it is a decent start.

The irony is that double headers in the Hundred were conceived as a Covid necessity and not engrained into the ECB’s original vision for the tournament. And yet as the ECB plans next year’s competition, and as other women’s sports look to the Hundred as a possible model to emulate, it would be fair to say this: given the right marketing and match-day arrangements, double headers don’t have to stink after all.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Italy’s Olympic sprint champion, Lamont Marcell Jacobs, said he smiled after hearing that the British sprinter CJ Ujah had been provisionally suspended for an anti-doping rule violation.

Surprise has been expressed at Jacobs’s performance in Tokyo, mostly by the British media, after he became the first Italian to win a 100m Olympic gold medal. Jacobs, 26, was the seen as an underdog before he powered to victory.

He has taken the insinuations in his stride. “The situation hasn’t touched me so much, I know the sacrifices and blows I went thorough to get here,” Jacobs was quoted saying in the Italian newspaper Tuttosport. “Instead, I want to enjoy it 100%. Having seen the investigation into Ujah I would say that perhaps it’s better [for the British] to look closer to home before attacking others. It made me smile.”

The investigation into Ujah, who tested positive for two banned substances, could mean the Team GB men’s 4x100 relay team face being stripped of their medals, with Canada upgraded to silver and China receiving bronze, unless Ujah can adequately explain how the substances got into his body.

If the suspension is upheld it would be the biggest doping scandal in British Olympic history, and will take some of the gloss off Team GB’s 65-medal haul in Tokyo. Ujah, meanwhile, would likely face a four‑year ban.

Jacobs, who returned to Rome on Monday, was also part of Italy’s gold-winning 4x100m relay team. Giovanni Malagò, the president of the Italian Olympic Committee, described the doping insinuations against Jacobs as “unpleasant”.

Italy came home from the Olympics with a record 40 medals, including 10 gold. Gianmarco Tamberi shared first place in the high jump. Others who won gold medals include Luigi Busà in the men’s 75kg karate and Antonella Palmisano in the women’s 20km race walk.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tom Pidcock’s career trajectory may suggest a young man in a hurry, but for now the Olympic gold medallist is putting his Tour de France ambitions on the back burner. The 22-year-old winner of the Tokyo Games men’s mountain bike race will make his Grand Tour debut this weekend with the Ineos Grenadiers team at the Vuelta a España, which begins in Burgos with a prologue time trial on Saturday.

Pidcock is the youngest of the “new wave” of versatile riders, such as the double Tour de France winner Tadej Pogacar of the UAE Emirates team, and the Tour stage winners Mathieu van der Poel of Alpecin-Fenix and Wout van Aert of Jumbo-Visma, who excel in multiple disciplines. But when asked if he would be starting the 2022 Tour de France, the Yorkshireman responded with a flat and emphatic “No”.

Instead, Pidcock is seeking Grand Tour experience in Spain, although based on his impact on the road racing scene already, it is possible that he could teach some of his elders a thing or two. After suggesting that he might start the Tour in 2023, he emphasised that for now his focus is more on one-day races, such as Paris-Roubaix, which this year will be raced in October.

“I’ve won the junior and under 23 versions of Paris-Roubaix, so there’s only one more to go,” he said. “It’s a goal, and it’s also one of my favourite races. I don’t know if I’ll ride this year, but for sure I want to try to win it some time.”

Pidcock will be at the Vuelta, ostensibly, to watch and learn, playing a supporting role to the 2021 Giro d’Italia champion Egan Bernal and his team’s co-leaders; the Olympic road race champion, Richard Carapaz, and Adam Yates.

“I’ve been celebrating the Olympics,” Pidcock said. “I’ve been enjoying every minute. The Olympics is something that some people work their whole careers towards. I’ve done it already at my first try, and at 21. I think it’s a massive achievement and I’ve let that sink in.

“I probably won’t be great in the first week [of the Vuelta] and people should perhaps forget about me riding the race. I’ll just roll along and take it day by day. Maybe I’ll start feeling good and motivated but there’s no plan.”

Whatever his own form, Pidcock will be expected to support another of Ineos Grenadiers’ multi-pronged leadership strategies, this time with Bernal, Carapaz and Yates primed to cover all the bases in the general classification.

Although Carapaz secured a deserved third place in Paris, it was a strategy that crashed and burned in this year’s Tour, leading Tao Geoghegan Hart to say: “You can’t protect four riders in the Tour – it’s never going to happen.”

However the Vuelta, lacking the pressure-cooker frenzy of the French race and the gamechanging aggression of the absent Pogacar, will offer different challenges, including nine summit finishes, a defending champion with a point to prove, and anticipated searing heat.

The 2020 Vuelta champion, Primoz Roglic, winner in Japan of the Olympic time trial, is on a mission to reinvigorate his Grand Tour career after being forced out of the Tour de France due to crash injuries.

Bernal, meanwhile, winner of the 2019 Tour and this year’s Giro, starts the Spanish race seeking a hat-trick of Grand Tour wins and is apparently almost back to full fitness after being plagued by back problems in 2020. The Colombian said he may have to “put up with” back issues for “some more months” but added that it was not significant enough to hamper his racing.

“I rested up after the Giro, and I had Covid-19, so I had to stop for some weeks and then get back into it,” Bernal said. “It’s not been the ideal preparation, but I hope to be in good shape.”

The fly in the ointment of the Ineos Grenadiers multi-leader plan at the Tour was both the chaotic nature of the opening stages, which led to numerous crashes, and the volatile attacking surges of Pogacar. Neither will be factors in the Vuelta, with the double Tour winner opting to give the Spanish race a miss. Quizzed once again over his team’s strategy, Carapaz played his usual dead bat. “The road will decide,” the Ecuadorian said. “It always does.”

“It’s not so easy to decide who the leader is,” Bernal said. “But we’ve got a good team, so it’s important to be very honest.”

“We have a lot of leaders but it gives us options,” Yates concluded. “We’ll try to keep ourselves out of trouble and hopefully having options can help us toward the end of the race.”

In the absence of Pogacar, they may be proved right, with the Vuelta contenders facing the music in an almost absurdly difficult final week, climaxing with a 34-kilometre time trial. Time will tell if a further Ineos Grenadiers’ multi-leadership strategy will prove a stroke of genius or just another broken record.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The tenor and tone of the NFL’s approach to the pandemic has shifted as the league moves into its second season in a Covid world. Last year it was all kumbaya, rah-rah, football-will-guide-us-through-the-darkness type of rhetoric. There was a community aspect to the league’s attitude. Everybody worked to ensure that the season could go ahead and that the nation’s top entertainment vehicle did not default on any of its multibillion dollar contracts.

The league gave concessions to teams and the players. Safeguards were built in to try to protect the integrity of the competition. Players were not held personally responsible for testing positive or coming into contact with Covid. It was treated as a team-wide issue, a societal issue, not the fault of any single individual.

Not this year. Heading into the new season, the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, and team owners have signed off on some of the most stringent Covid guidelines this side of the military’s proposed vaccine mandate.

Changes to the NFL’s Covid-19 regulations for the upcoming season have turned vaccination rates among players and staff members into a form of an arms race. No longer will games be postponed. There is no extra week built into the season for make-up games. If your team deals with an outbreak, that’s on you. The message from the league office is clear: don’t want an outbreak? Get your roster, coaching staff, front office and administrative staff vaccinated.

The NFL is betting on market forces in a bid to head off any Broncos-style calamities that popped up during the last pandemic-hit season. There will be no more do-overs. It’s each man and team for themselves – may the most vaccinated win.

The league’s head office sent a memo to teams stating that if a game cannot be rescheduled during the league’s current 18-week schedule due to a Covid outbreak among unvaccinated players, the team with the outbreak will forfeit the game outright and will be credited with a loss.

Here’s the kicker: players on both teams will not be paid for the lost contest, and the team responsible for the cancelled game – the one with the outbreak – will cover the finances for the side without the outbreak. They will also be subject to further discipline from the commissioner’s office if it’s determined the outbreak was due to a team or player not correctly adhering to the league’s Covid protocol.

Last year the league did everything within its power to ensure no games were missed over the span of the then 17-week season. This season it’s over to the individuals, creating a natural dividing line between the haves and the have-nots: those who have taken a vaccine and those who have not.

As an abstract concept, freedom of choice and vaccine hesitancy would likely be viewed within a locker room as a personal issue. But once that choice shifts from the abstract to the real, once it starts to ding paychecks, much of the inter-locker room support will wash away.

Some players – Lamar Jackson, Kirk Cousins – have enough leverage by dint of their positional value and contract status to be able to ride out any issues or pressure this season. They will still receive the bulk of their paycheck no matter the knock-on effect on their team, teammates, family members, future earnings or legacy.

But the majority of an NFL roster holds no such value. Within the backend of rosters, the league’s strongarm tactics are working. Agents have reported that teams spent the summer checking in on the vaccine status of their back-of-the-roster clients. Want to be employed this season? Get the vaccine. Teams may be OK with adjusting their traditional practice structures for the starting quarterback, but not for a player looking to make the team as a third-string safety.

Unvaccinated players testing positive for Covid remain under the same 2020 protocols, meaning a 10-day isolation period and a return once asymptomatic. Any vaccinated and asymptomatic player can resume activity upon testing negative twice 24 hours apart. That’s a significant time difference. As the Washington head coach, Ron Rivera, recently outlined, that could result in his unvaccinated players missing two games as early as week one. Two losses could be the difference between a division title and people fighting for their jobs.

As a whole, the NFL’s vaccination numbers are strong compared with the rates elsewhere in the country. According to figures released by the league on Wednesday, 91.7% of all players have had at least one dose of a vaccine; 15 teams have more than 95% of their players vaccinated. But the league is still not satisfied. It wants to hit its 100% target figure by week one of the regular season.

Dr Allen Sills, the chief medical officer for the NFL, has often cut a frustrated figure throughout the league’s vaccination efforts. And it’s no wonder. NFL players have access to world-class physicians; teams have brought in virologists to explain the vaccine process, from creation to administration; players have been able to ask questions directly to those involved in the creation of the vaccine. Yet there remains outspoken hesitancy to the vaccine throughout the league.

Buffalo’s Cole Beasley continues to bicker with his teammates publicly about his stance. One moment he’s simply a sceptic, not an anti-vaxxer; the next he’s releasing a vaccine-Fauci-sheeple diss track. Beasley’s stance has been so vociferous and public in the face of the league’s pseudo-mandate that it has led executives to wonder whether he’s intentionally trying to get himself cut by the Bills.

Beasley has been the face and voice of the NFL’s vaccine-sceptic movement, but he is far from the only one. Recently, the Vikings lost all three members of their quarterback room for several days of training camp after the rookie Kellen Mond tested positive for Covid. Both the team’s starting quarterback, Cousins, and the backup Nate Stanley were deemed to be in close contact with Mond and were forced to sit out under the league’s protocol.

Cousins drew the public ire of his coaching staff for his stance on the vaccine. His response: “I’m still doing research.” His follow-up: pondering whether or not he should sit in a perspex box inside the team’s facility in order to limit further disruption of the Vikings’ pre-season activities. His second follow-up: suggesting the team meets outside all season, even in the Minnesota winter.

Kirk Cousins, who isn't vaccinated, says he'll continue to follow all protocols, the team is getting a bigger QB room so he won't be a close contact & he might even put plexiglass around where he is in the facility. Says key is to not be a close contact. pic.twitter.com/4PwJaVuJHa — Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) August 5, 2021

Meanwhile Jackson, a former league MVP, is still unsure about getting the vaccine despite contracting Covid twice in the past 12 months.

You have to wonder what resentments are fostered as teams continue to jump through hoops for unvaccinated players. From a cynical, non-health-based perspective, Jackson and Cousins have already put their teams and teammates at a significant competitive disadvantage by missing chunks of the pre-season, and the possibility that their status could affect games during the season will linger for all 18 weeks.

There will be further flashpoints of awkwardness. Already we’ve seen Rivera, who is immunocompromised after surviving cancer last year, publicly beg his players to get the vaccine. The response was a thudding silence; his team entered August with the lowest vaccination rate in the league. “I haven’t caught Covid yet,” the Washington defensive end Montez Sweat said. “So I don’t see me treating Covid until I actually get Covid.”

The nightmare scenario for any team is that an unvaccinated player compromises the health of someone on their team or someone they come into contact with. The bleak on-field scenario is that they’re forced to forfeit a game or two – and that they will have to pay for the privilege. It is a fissure between players and team personnel that will rumble on all season. The league has baked a competitive advantage into its protocol, and now it’s a race to see which teams can convince or cajole their roster into getting a shot in their arm before it compromises their season.

“I just don’t understand,” the Vikings head coach, Mike Zimmer, said this week. “We could just put this thing to bed if we’d all do this [get the vaccine].”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Twitter users banned after the torrent of racist abuse directed at England’s footballers are still posting on the platform, the Guardian has learned.

Fifty-six persistently abusive Twitter users had their accounts permanently suspended on 12 July, the day after the European Championship final, amid a blaze of publicity surrounding hateful messages directed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka. Some of these users, or ‘personas’, were observed to have joined in directly with the abuse. Thirty of the persistent offenders have since been found to be posting on the network, often under usernames only slightly altered.

The process of creating new accounts to get around suspensions or the blocking of accounts is known as respawning. Campaigners against online abuse, including those within the football industry, have long argued that such a practice is central to the persistent culture of abuse online. They believe it is too easy to respawn, with nothing more than a new email address or sim card required.

For more than a year football has been involved in a prominent struggle with tech companies over the issue of abuse. Arguing that the protection of players is a proxy for tackling hate in society more broadly, there has been protest, constant dialogue and some small concessions won. However, as a new Premier League season begins with the league calling on fans to show “unity against all forms of racism”, the debate appears to be at an impasse.

Respawning is illustrative of the broader problem. One of the key demands made by the game is that social media companies should require ‘verification information’ from their users, such as a passport number or driver’s licence, before they create an account. Tech platforms are against such a move, saying it is an infringement on civil liberties and could compromise some users’ safety. A report from Twitter this week on its response to the Euros abuse notably observed that 99% of accounts subsequently suspended had owners who were publicly “identifiable” and that “ID verification would have been unlikely to prevent the abuse from happening”.

Campaigners within the game, however, argue that respawning shows the importance of verification. If it were applied, it would be easier for a social media platform to take action against any user who submitted identification linked to a removed account. Furthermore, in the case of the most serious instances of abuse, football authorities believe verification information would make it easier for police to pursue prosecutions, with time currently spent tracking down the necessary information to proceed.

Information regarding 30 respawns had been provided to Twitter before this week, the Guardian understands. On Friday morning the Guardian approached Twitter for comment, providing two examples of respawn accounts active on the platform that day. Both accounts were subsequently suspended.

A Twitter spokesperson said: “The accounts referenced have been permanently suspended for violating our hateful conduct policy.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thomas Tuchel says Romelu Lukaku has returned to Chelsea to “finish his story here” after the striker sealed his club-record move from Internazionale.

Chelsea paid the Italian champions £97.5m for Lukaku, who rejoins the club he left for Everton in 2014. He struggled for opportunities during his first spell at Stamford Bridge, playing only 15 times and failing to score, but has since become one of the world’s outstanding centre-forwards. According to Tuchel, Lukaku was desperate to complete what he started upon initially arriving from Anderlecht a decade ago.

“He was super hungry,” Tuchel said. “He did everything to take this chance to make it happen. Of course he had a huge impact at Inter: he was a huge player with a lot of responsibility on his shoulders, winning a big [Serie A] title for Inter last season. So it was actually very important to us that it was his desire to rejoin Chelsea and to finish his story here in the way that he wanted for himself.

“We have a very strong group, defined by a very strong bond and with a certain attitude to be ready to help each other out. We think that Romelu, coming through here and always having Chelsea in his heart, is the perfect addition because he embodies all that.”

Lukaku will not be able to make his second Chelsea debut when they host Crystal Palace on Saturday because of quarantine rules, but it is hoped he will be available to face Arsenal on 22 August. Tuchel described Lukaku as “one of the best strikers in the world” and explained that the leadership role the Belgian assumed in helping Inter to win their first league title in 11 years, scoring 24 goals in the process, was a major factor when asking him to lead Chelsea’s line.

“He is a true No 9, like for me a No 9 that I always from outside see in a Chelsea shirt,” Tuchel said. “I see Chelsea with strong strikers and strong personalities, physical strikers. For me it’s a perfect fit for Chelsea, this kind of player up front.

“He is happy to take responsibility, he has matured, he has played abroad, he has had success at various big clubs. He will take weight off the shoulders from our younger strikers, from our younger players around him, and I think this is a huge part of the story, that he does not step away and is also happy to make life easier for players around him.”

Hakim Ziyech will also be missing against Palace, but Tuchel said the shoulder injury that forced his withdrawal during the Uefa Super Cup win against Villarreal on Wednesday would not require surgery. “We hope it continues like this and he can be back on the pitch in two weeks,” he said.

N’Golo Kanté is a doubt after what Tuchel described as an issue “from the final”, which Chelsea won on penalties after extra time. “Physically it was the worst thing that could happen to us in the stages we are in right now, to play 120 minutes,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bayern Munich had to work their way back from a goal down in their Bundesliga season opener on Friday as they earned a 1-1 draw at Borussia Mönchengladbach thanks to last season’s top scorer, Robert Lewandowski.

The Bayern forward, who scored a league record 41 goals last season, volleyed in from a corner to level in the 42nd minute after Alassane Pléa had put the hosts in front in the 10th.

There was no time for the new Bayern coach, Julian Nagelsmann, and the champions, who had won none of their four pre-season warmup matches, to settle in, with Gladbach instantly pressing high and Patrick Herrmann firing narrowly wide in the fourth minute.

With 23,000 fans allowed in the 60,000-capacity and firing up the home team, Herrmann should have finished a quick break himself a little later, instead of miscuing a pass for Lars Stindl.

With Bayern’s backline repeatedly caught out of position, Pléa did not miss when he latched on to a well-timed through ball from Stindl in the 10th minute to rifle past the keeper Manuel Neuer.

Bayern increased the tempo and Lewandowski twice came close to levelling but both times Sommer was in position to deny the striker.

Lewandowski, however, moved quickly to beat his marker three minutes from half-time to volley in the equaliser, and he came close to adding a second early in the second half but was denied by yet another superb Sommer save.

Gladbach’s Marcus Thuram also should have done better when he failed to connect with the ball in front of goal late in the game. He then twice protested for a penalty after going down inside the box after challenges by the Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano, but the game ended with honours even.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@No Edinson Cavani, no Marcus Rashford, no Raphaël Varane, no Dean Henderson. Maybe no Jadon Sancho from the start and certainly no Jesse Lingard, who would have been drafted in by Ole Gunnar Solskjær for what the manager bills as Manchester United’s crucial Premier League curtain-raiser with Leeds at Old Trafford on Saturdaytoday.

As Solskjær plots to thwart Marcelo Bielsa’s side, he might blow a raspberry at a welcome to the campaign that has him missing three A-list acts owing to Rashford being injured, compassionate leave for Cavani, and Varane yet to complete a £41m move, with a potentially first-choice goalkeeper (Henderson) and hardly average forward replacement (Lingard) absent because of Covid and its effects.

Of Sancho, who was limited by illness to one and a half training sessions this week, Solskjær says: “He has looked sharper than expected. I can’t tell you if he’ll start.”

Last season’s corresponding fixture ended as a 6-2 drubbing of Leeds by a Manchester United who had Scott McTominay in total-destruct mode, the midfielder scoring twice in the opening three minutes before Bruno Fernandes (two), Victor Lindelöf and Daniel James joined the goal-fest.

This time Manchester United will be denuded against Bielsa’s attack devotees. Solskjær’s mantra is a non-negotiable need not to lose any title challenge in the opening weeks, citing the truism that championships are never claimed when the air is still warm but are usually ceded if the start is poor.

The Norwegian is determined 2021-22 should not be like 2020-21 when Crystal Palace were the opening-day visitors who ransacked Old Trafford (3-1) before his team’s second home outing ended as a 6-1 humiliation from Tottenham, the misery compounded by Anthony Martial’s three-game suspension for a red card.

The Frenchman never recovered, going awol all year as insipid form and injury had him scoring a desultory four league goals in 22 appearances. This came after a career-best 17 in 32 in 2019-20. Martial started last season as the United No 9 and ended it as third choice – behind Cavani and Mason Greenwood – and a sale or loan candidate.

Solskjær says of the 25-year-old: “He has come back strong and hungry. You can see that little bit of grit [of] his teeth again. He’s up for the challenge and we’re happy we have him.”

Martial may remain at United only because of the absence of Rashford and Cavani. The former’s shoulder surgery rules him out until early October, at least, meaning a minimum nine-match lay-off (six league, two in the Champions League and at least one in the Carabao Cup). Cavani arrived in Manchester only this week after being given time in Salto with his extended family.

So Martial moves back up the pecking order and it will be a surprise if he does not start against Leeds after leading the line in last Saturday’s 4-0 rout of Everton. Although he failed to score, Greenwood, Fernandes, Diogo Dalot and Harry Maguire did. Maguire is Solskjær’s captain and a centre-back who may be as disappointed as the manager that Varane has not sealed a protracted deal in time to try to help repel Patrick Bamford and company.

“The big hold-up was the isolation and quarantine,” Solskjær says of the France World Cup-winner. “He’s in Manchester now; hopefully it’ll be done soon.” Varane’s role is to stabilise a faultline in central defence that runs through Maguire’s sluggish pace and Lindelöf’s feeble aggression. Leeds’s Bielsa-driven penchant for a contest of we-will-score-more-than-you is bound to test the Maguire-Lindelöf axis where it can be hurt.

Solskjær is in classic half-full/half-empty territory. There is no Varane to up the quality centrally but Luke Shaw returns from his Euro 2020 heroics a bona fide star turn at left-back. Rashford’s pace and leadership are missing but Greenwood has had the summer off and ended last season with a burst of eight goals in 11 outings before his final three were barren.

Expect Greenwood to start alongside Martial and Sancho or James in a front three, with Greenwood and Martial interchangeable in the centre-forward position. This is where the stricken Lingard misses out, after his half-season loan at West Ham was a revelation of potent forward play that forced him back into the England squad and had him returning to his boyhood club reborn.

Henderson’s slow recovery from Covid means the headache of whom Solskjær should plump for between the posts is eased – for the moment. But David de Gea cannot afford to be as erratic as he can be. In the joust with Henderson for the No 1 jersey the Spaniard’s early return to training was a statement of intent that will enthuse his manager.

”It is going to be a big game [against Leeds], as we are all aware of the intense rivalry between these two great clubs,” De Gea says. “And it is up to us to make a good start to the season and to do so by winning this first match. I feel great, really strong, both physically and mentally. We all have to be united together. It’s a vitally important season ahead.”

It is: for the club and a manager who after third- and second-place finishes in his two full seasons, and May’s dire Europa League final loss to Villarreal, has to claim the first trophy of his tenure.

Solskjær says: “We have to get a good start; we have expectations. This club is about trophies, football and my expectations are we keep developing our style and play good football. Hopefully by March, April, May, we’re there or thereabouts.

“The team is hungry, we’ve done good business, I feel confident going into the new season but the first couple of games are always the unknown. This is a one-off game against a Marcelo team: he’s got a unique style.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nuno Espírito Santo has suggested he will factor in the turmoil that Harry Kane is experiencing before deciding whether to name him on Sunday in the squad to face Manchester City – the club that the Tottenham striker is desperate to join.

Kane trained with his Spurs teammates on Friday for the first time in pre-season after a later-than-expected return from a holiday in the Bahamas and Florida (at least from the club’s point of view) and a requirement to quarantine for five days.

The England captain has made himself available for selection but there have to be questions over his fitness and psychological readiness to play against the team that are preparing a £127m offer for him. The Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, is not inclined to sell for less than £150m.

Nuno said he would decide whether to include Kane – most likely among his nine substitutes – after training on Saturday and it would come down to more than the player’s physical levels.

“All the decisions are not only based on fitness,” the manager said. “It’s based on many, many aspects that we have to consider. Football players are not only professionals, they are people that deal with many situations. All of us, we have our own lives. When we make decisions, I try to get as much info as I can so my decision is the best for the team.”

Son Heung-min is expected to start up front, as he did in pre-season, and the midfielder Oliver Skipp is also set to be included in the XI. Nuno has doubts over the new signings Cristian Romero and Bryan Gil, both of whom began to train with the team only this week – the latter after his participation with Spain at the Olympics. Romero’s arrival was confirmed on Friday of last week and he had not fully recovered from an injury sustained with Argentina in the Copa América final.

Tanguy Ndombele is still not ready, with Nuno saying that “like many players in our squad, it is not easy to adapt to a new idea, a new philosophy, but we keep on insisting and believing that this is the right way – the right moment will come when we believe it should be”.

Nuno was asked whether he saw Son playing as a central striker this season. “Yes I do,” he replied. “That’s why we decide to play Sonny with Lucas [Moura] and Stevie [Bergwijn] in wide areas [in pre-season]. Son has energy, adaptability and is versatile enough to play in different positions in the front three – one of those in the central areas.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There was a point during the first lockdown, when I’d daydream about becoming a “yes man”. I’d think to myself: “I got too sucked into the rat race, man. If this thing has taught me anything, it’s that life is about experiences. I’ve spent too much time on my phone. As soon as I’m able to I’ll say yes to that bungee jump. I’ll say yes to that National Trust dry-stone walling course. Life is lived on the margins so I’ll take up kickboxing and enter a dialogue with pain.”

As you can imagine, this nettle‑grasping lasted about 30 seconds into restrictions being lifted (realistically, why would I want to learn a skill that’s mainly relevant in the Peak District or get my head kicked off my body?), but the one thing I have approached with renewed vigour is football.

As I walked to the away end at the Madejski Stadium on Tuesday night, for a fixture that would stir the blood of any football fan (Reading v Swansea City in the first round of the Carabao Cup), I adopted the traditional football fans’ strut, a walk reserved exclusively for attending games and one so purposeful it would look insane at soft play or if you were buying a pot plant from Homebase.

I hadn’t been to a football match since the Swans lost 1-0 against Fulham at Craven Cottage in February 2020, and as I walked to the ground I experienced the same sharpening of the senses I have felt at every sporting event since I began attending games in 1988. I looked up at our fans, singing “YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR SUPPORT IS FUCKING SHIT!” and with contented sigh thought: “Aaah … this feels like home.” Our supporters sang a sarcastic version of “Three Lions” (with occasional cartoon blubbing gestures), Reading fans responded with a lusty rendition of God Save The Queen and sang that we wished we were Eng-er-lish, to which we did wanker signs. It truly is the beautiful game.

Matchday behaviour felt like easing into an old pair of slippers. I hadn’t signified an opposition miss with outstretched arms for 16 months, but it all came back, a comforting muscle memory. Those outstretched arms combined with ironic cheer were effortless, like an old heavyweight world champion shadow boxing on a chat show, 40 years after they were last king of the ring. It felt good to boo a Reading player’s every touch for 30 minutes, despite missing the original transgression because I was Googling Swansea’s Jake Bidwell to see how many caps he got for England Under‑19s (3). I loved shouting “USE IT”, a sentence which under careful examination is revealed to mean absolutely nothing.

For Swansea’s second goal, a Ben Cabango header midway through the second half, I became momentarily senseless, leaving my seat to run down the stairs towards the advertising hoardings, before thinking: “You’re 41 in November and Reading have seven teenagers in their side because of a transfer embargo, is this reasonable?”

I love the first week of the new season because, unless your club is very unlucky, things haven’t gone wrong yet. My enthusiasm was helped by Reading’s weakened team of course, but watching your side cruise to a 3-0 win on a warm summer’s evening can have an absurd impact on your expectation levels. It was only Russell Martin’s second game in charge of Swansea, so it was nice to see his new ideas unfold, shakily at times like a baby deer taking its first steps (thankfully wild animals only have predators to contend with during these crucial first few hours, and not men in replica shirts shouting “WANKER! WANKER! WANKER!”). It was interesting to get a feel for how our fans see Martin’s appointment, but in person and away from the distorting environment of social media.

Oddly for a club that has spent the majority of my lifetime in the lower divisions, a significant proportion of our supporters value an attractive playing style over success. Do fans of other clubs say things such as, “I can handle us losing and finishing in mid-table if we play the right way”? It might have been a representative sample of the six or seven people I talked to at full-time, but Swansea’s reputation for having a fanbase that values aesthetic, progressive, and entertaining football over almost everything else was borne out by the conversations I had on Tuesday.

The fans of most Championship clubs value hard work, effort, and success on the pitch. We have slightly loftier ambitions in our part of South Wales. Despite reaching two consecutive play-offs, Steve Cooper’s style of play was never universally popular among Swansea supporters, a difficult thing for people unconnected to the club to imagine. But I’ve met older fans who reminisce about the attractive football the club played in the 1950s, before Swansea had city status and when the BBC could make the April Fools joke that spaghetti grew on trees in Switzerland believable to millions. “The Swansea Way” goes back further than Roberto Martínez’s appointment in 2007 for some of our fans. It predates BBC Two.

As Reading’s teenagers were swept aside by a Swansea team that played like 1982 Brazil, I was sore from my own footballing exploits, having played that afternoon. I’ve loved playing since I was very young, occupying that middle ground of being on a totally different planet to a professional but garnering enough experience over the past 35 years to look fairly competent on the condition that I’m put under absolutely zero pressure. (I probably look my best during the 10 minutes or so before the game starts, idly kicking the ball into the net as the other players do those stretches that were discredited in the 1980s and talk about their weekends.) But even a kickabout now feels magical.

Swansea had around 860 fans at Reading, so the concourses were uncrowded and the stand felt safe. For thousands of vulnerable fans this isn’t the case, but the option for supporters to watch 3pm kick‑offs on iFollow or their club-hosted alternative has been withdrawn by the EFL, claiming it’s to protect attendances and the interests of their broadcast partners, which feels deeply unfair at a time when so many still feel uneasy. Playing football outdoors feels safe. Bungee jumping can wait, but playing and watching football were a normal part of my routine until last year. I will never take them for granted again.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rafael Benítez has confirmed the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules have constrained Everton’s transfer activity and left him no alternative but to tell several players they can leave.

Financial issues are only one of the problems confronting Benítez at Everton, where five senior players are in isolation because of Covid-19 protocols and a section of the fanbase remains opposed to the former Liverpool manager’s appointment.

The club have spent only £1.7m this summer on Demarai Gray, although they have also signed Andros Townsend and Asmir Begovic, having posted combined losses of almost £265m in the three years up to 2019-20, a breach of the league’s rules.

James Rodríguez, the highest-earner and one of the five players unable to face Southampton on Saturday because they are isolating, is understood to be among those told by Benítez they can go.

“The reality is that we know the financial fair play rules are there and we have to follow them,” Benítez said. “I know what is the situation and we will try to do our best with the players we have. If we can strengthen our squad we will try to do it. In these circumstances we have to move players on – that is simple to understand.”

Benítez would not name all five in isolation but confirmed two of Moise Kean, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and André Gomes were also among them. Despite the early difficulties in his reign, the Everton manager believes there is improvement to come from a squad that finished 10th last season.

“The relationship with the players has to be professional in terms of how you explain to them a decision,” he said. “If you are telling them you have to go because you will not be part of the squad, then you have to be clear and you have to be honest and you have to do it as soon as possible. Then they have time to manage the situation.

“At the same time, I know the ambition of the owners, the club and everyone here but the financial fair play rules are there and we have to manage that. I believe I can do it. My staff is quite good and we have experience and we know this group of players can improve. We will try to do that, we will fight from day one and if something is wrong we will fight even harder.

“That is our way to do things and that is how we won trophies everywhere. We will try to be sure we don’t give up at any time even if we lose a game, or two games. We will try to be sure that the next one we are ready and the fans they have to have this conviction, this belief, that we will do it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Virgil van Dijk's new contract with Liverpool is 'great news', manager Jürgen Klopp said on Friday. 'Imagine if we would have to buy this boy now,' he added.

The Netherlands international has signed a new four-year deal that rewards the huge impact he has made on Jürgen Klopp’s team since his £75m arrival from Southampton in 2018.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@With a host of European league seasons kicking off tonight, and 18 days before the transfer window does its traditional slam-and-flounce, things are not so much heating up … it’s more a case of a handful of lethargic bubbles slowly popping after spending months bouncing around the inside of the Mill’s rusty Tefal.

All the big names are gradually getting new branded satchels for the new term. Grealish: done. Lukaku: over the line. Messi: mais oui (and apparently being paid partly in cryptocurrency). Origi: any reasonable offers accepted.

Of the serious megabucks deals mooted for the summer, that leaves Harry Kane to Manchester City still up in the air. While Daniel Levy stays resolute as the pallets of pledged cash pile up, the Mill is less interested in the fee than what the move could mean in terms of outgoings at City’s end.

Bernardo Silva has done some hands-on-hips counting at the club’s training ground and started to wonder if last season’s tally of 24 league starts may end up sagging given competition for places. Arsenal’s interest hasn’t been reciprocated, with the Portugal playmaker preferring opportunities in, say, Barcelona, perhaps overlooking that club’s current financial predicament.

Juventus are eyeing a move for Aymeric Laporte, potentially on loan, as the defender fails to be impressed by the potential to be “rotated in” for those League Cup midweeks when the John Stones-Rúben Dias axis needs a rest. City reportedly floated the idea of palleting the Spain international up as part of The Kane Package, but nah.

Juve have also repeatedly been linked to Gabriel Jesus, who is perhaps getting a bit peeved at being the club’s first-choice striker for a limited period only, during which no competitive games took place and the club did everything they could to buy a new first-choice striker. The thinking is one of Silva, Laporte and Jesus may have to give way in order to make the whole FFP thing at least vaguely make sense.

Leeds are still interested in City’s never-present Yangel Herrera, a Venezuela international and serial loanee whose defensive midfield skills have also attracted come-see-me eyes from Southampton and West Ham. Another on-books, off-site player, winger Pedro Porro, made his international bow for Spain in March but has since joked: “I’ve never talked to Pep Guardiola. I don’t think he even knows they hired me.” Sporting, where he has spent the past two seasons, remain keen. Morgan Rogers is an England youth international forward and spent last season impressing at Lincoln. Nottingham Forest have their peepers on the 19-year-old.

Away from the Etihad and its assorted satellite outposts, Arsenal’s wishlist for the creative midfield slot now has a third bullet-point: Lyon’s Houssem Aouar. Though Mikel Arteta would prefer to have Martin Ødegaard or James Maddison as permanent fixtures, a loan move for the marauding Frenchman would be better than nowt, particularly with Joe Willock all but in the clutches of Steve Bruce now.

In disgruntled aspirant England goalkeeper corner: West Brom are hopeful that Sam Johnstone is feeling a bit less harrumphy over a contractual impasse, and will remain sufficiently focused to feature between the sticks against Luton tomorrow. Slavisa Jokanovic is crossing his fingers that Aaron Ramsdale’s thwarted move to Arsenal will see him curb his ambitions for a day or so and get his head screwed on for Sheffield United’s tricky trip to Swansea.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The door to the England dressing room had barely swung shut by the time Haseeb Hameed found himself walking back through it, his return to Test cricket after a five-year absence having been spectacularly terminated for a golden duck.

Mohammed Siraj was fresh from extinguishing Dom Sibley with his second ball after tea and as he charged in to bowl, 30,000 people inside Lord’s held their breath in the hope that a one-time wunderkind who has rebuilt his career after a baffling slump in form might dodge the ill-fortune that is supposed to strike on Friday the 13th.

It was not to be, Hameed pressing forward with an immaculate defence down the wrong line and hearing that deathly wooden rattle behind him. Quite why Siraj felt the need to put his finger to his lips after such a brief encounter is anyone’s guess, but there was plenty of time for Hameed to stew on all this in the safety of the dressing room.

Clearly this was not a day for the romantics, even if hearts were warmed by £500,000 being raised for Ruth Strauss Foundation. And come the close England could reflect on three sessions of creditable work that, from the now traditional 23 for two, kept heads just above water at 119 for three from 45 overs in reply to India’s 364 all out.

Jimmy Anderson was responsible for keeping a relative lid on the tourists after their dominant showing on day one with typically distinguished figures of five for 62, while with bat Rory Burns and Joe Root chiselled out a stand of 85.

Burns fell before the close, trapped lbw from around the wicket by Mohammad Shami, but Root will resume in the morning on 48, with Jonny Bairstow on six for company.

The England captain had arrived out in the middle after his side’s 33rd duck in 2021 and, more worryingly, the 14th by a member of the top three.

The latter is a record for a side in a calendar year but Root offered a confident defence to deny Siraj his hat‑trick and then rolled over the form witnessed at Trent Bridge.

India’s bowlers, augmented by the recall of Ishant Sharma, had delivered a stiff examination on this sluggish surface, even if Siraj tested the patience of Virat Kohli when two confident appeals for lbw against Root resulted in reviews being burned. The second, sliding down leg like the first, led to the India captain marching out of the huddle upon seeing the first replay, not even bothering to wait for Hawk‑Eye’s projection.

A penny for the thoughts of Anderson during this tense final session, feet up in the dressing room and taking a breather after the 31st five‑wicket haul of his career had earlier hauled England off the canvas. Mike Selvey once wrote that Angus Fraser was “like Eeyore without the joie de vivre” and one suspects Anderson let out a few sighs.

That Root finds himself leaning heavily on a 39-year-old, one who needed a late fitness test to play, is in part down to an absentee crisis that has thinned out the bowling stable. But even factoring in the loss of Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer, Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad – a handy Test attack in its own right – it is mildly troubling, too.

That said, Anderson’s class endures and though 29 overs of toil may not have been the preferred outcome after his captain had won the toss and elected to bowl, his reward came when, for the seventh time in his career at Lord’s, he found himself walking off the with the match ball aloft to the sound of warm applause.

India had started out in an ominous position, 276 for three with KL Rahul resuming on 127, but through Anderson’s incisions and three of the support cast chipping in, England claimed seven wickets at a cost of 88 runs. This represented a best-case scenario, even if two catches went down and their radar for run-outs remained wonky.

By 11.07am England had landed two early punches, Rahul chipping Robinson’s second ball of the day to short cover on 129 and Anderson nicking off the out-of-sorts Ajinkaya Rahane without adding to his overnight score of one.

Sam Curran finished wicketless once more – England are no closer to working out his role in Test cricket – but there were two wickets for Mark Wood, the dangerous Rishabh Pant first feathering a catch behind on 35 at a time when he was threatening to explode, and Ravindra Jadeja the last man out slogging one in the air on 40.

In between came Moeen Ali’s 190th Test wicket, Shami fiddling to midwicket, and Anderson making light work of Ishant Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah. Suddenly England’s predicament was not nearly so dire as the predictions and when Burns and Sibley survived 14 overs before tea, two full sessions had been won.

You can tell Sibley is desperately trying to get more side‑on and deliver on the orders to rotate the strike more. But when he emerged after tea on 11 and immediately chipped Siraj to short mid-wicket for the second time this series, it left a sense that his second innings will be make or break time for the opener.

It may be that Hameed is the batsman to move up should Sibley fail once more but after such a chastening initial return to the spotlight, the 24-year-old’s only thoughts will be on watching the ball more closely when he next gambols down the stairs in his pads.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root emerged from the pavilion on Saturday morning to a warm and sunny reception from a capacity Lord’s crowd, they took a moment to count their blessings. “Joe and I said to each other: ‘How good is to be walking out on a Saturday at Lord’s with your best mate?’” Bairstow recalled at stumps on day three. “To have a full crowd, with our family and friends here, was really special. The Lord’s buzz was definitely back.”

England’s buzz was back too, for now at least. They began the day with a mountain to climb but ended it with a slender lead of 27 thanks in large part to Bairstow’s 57 and Root’s gargantuan unbeaten 180 – the England captain’s fifth century in seven months, and one that took him past Graham Gooch into second place in the all-time list of England Test run-scorers. Only Alastair Cook now stands in his way.

“I’ve run out of superlatives, to be honest,” Bairstow said of his Yorkshire teammate. “To see him in the form that he is, playing the way he is, it’s awesome. Having batted with each over many years, you get a gauge of each other’s temperament. You bounce off one another, and we enjoyed every single moment. It’s been about having fun, enjoying the challenge, playing with a smile. We’ve scored nearly 400 today, and you can see the way in which we’re going about it, smiling and laughing, keeping that relaxed but focused attitude.”

Bairstow’s strong form on his return to the Test side has been one of the more cheering elements of the series, even if he was disappointed to succumb to India’s short‑ball trap two overs before the second new ball, gloving a pull to slip. “The game today went through a few different periods,” he said. “This morning the ball was a bit higher, and then the rate slowed as the ball got softer, and it was more difficult to rotate the strike and score boundaries.

“I’d have liked to have gone on, but it was one of those things. The pitch is slightly two‑paced, a few flying through to the keeper and a few that were dying. When you’re trying to duck and weave, it can get tricky. It caught the glove today; on another day it might go over the slip cordon, or you might get a bottom edge for one. But if they’re going short, then that means you’re doing something right with your defence.”

For all England’s dominance on days two and three, pegging India back from 267 for two late on day one, the game remains tantalisingly poised going into Sunday, and tellingly Bairstow was not yet prepared to install England as favourites. “Let’s see how tomorrow goes,” he said. “We’ve got a new ball, and it was tough and challenging when they got their second new ball, so we’ll come in tomorrow firing. We’ve got guys who can challenge them in every way possible. It’s going to be a really challenging day.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For the second successive Saturday and the fifth time this year Joe Root delivered a precious century for England, batting through three intoxicating sessions of Test cricket that both underlined his golden form and, more broadly, why the longest format continues to capture the imagination.

As he walked off at the close, his whites scarcely betraying the toil of nearly nine hours at the crease, Root was 180 not out from 321 balls and receiving handshakes and back slaps from his opponents. The final wicket had just fallen at the other end, Jimmy Anderson bowled by Mohammed Shami, but England had put 391 on the board in response to India’s first innings 364 and a slender lead of 27 had been secured.

Where the final two days of this pivotal second Test go from here is anyone’s guess but much like last week’s 109 at Trent Bridge, Root has kept his side in the contest. Jonny Bairstow delivered 57 from No 5 and others chipped in but once again this was chiefly a case of Root strapping cymbals to his knees, a drum to his back and delivering a one-man band performance for both colleagues and supporters.

Root’s 22nd Test century means only Kevin Pietersen (23) and Alastair Cook (33) have more for England, while it was also the first time he has made three figures in back-to-back innings. Virat Kohli’s attack, led by Ishant Sharma’s three for 69 and Mohammed Siraj finishing with four for 94, found the 30-year-old simply impossible to dislodge.

But then 2021 is fast becoming Root’s finest year and over the course of a third day that saw him pass 9,000 career Test runs the trend continued. The right-hander offered steadfast defence, picked off wing-heeled singles and, after picking off the bulk of his 18 fours square, including some handsome cover drives, he signed off by taking on Siraj with an impish reverse-ramp and a crunching slog sweep.

There had been mischief in the air all day, to be honest. KL Rahul was understandably miffed by some tedious types firing champagne corks in his direction on the boundary rope, while one spectator in whites took the field after lunch. Funnily enough, pointing to the India badge above his paunch didn’t sway the stewards as they bundled him off.

Out in the middle things began serenely from an English perspective, Root and Bairstow batting through the morning to shave 97 runs off the deficit and take the score to 216 for three. Root progressed his overnight 48 to 89 by the interval, while his fellow Yorkshireman again hinted at a corner having been turned with his first half-century since 2019 following a run of 20 Test innings without raising the bat.

After a green-tinged start on day one the pitch had turned straw-cloured and sleepy but having started the day 245 runs in front, India never lost heart. Kohli’s seamers charged in with purpose despite the fading assistance and Rishabh Pant showed just how far he has come since his last visit to England three years ago with an immaculate, energetic performance behind the stumps. He is some cricketer.

India knew it would be a day of patience and this first paid off on the cusp of the second new ball being taken, Siraj delivering a barrage of bumpers from the Pavilion End and Bairstow falling head first into a well-flagged trap when an attempted pull shot caught the glove and popped a simple catch to Kohli at slip.

After watching the same ploy to Root produce a couple of flirtations with disaster, and wearing one on the back himself, this was a rather tame end to the 31-year-old’s highest Test score since his century in Colombo in late 2018. Still, he had looked tight in defence and helped add 121 precious runs with his captain.

Root was on 95 by this stage, England 135 runs still in arrears, and it meant Jos Buttler for company upon reaching three-figures. Ravindra Jadeja had just produced a fine stop on the boundary to prevent the milestone initially but when Root swiftly dropped a single into the covers off Jasprit Bumrah, he let out a guttural roar and gave a punch of the air as the Lord’s crowd stood in unison.

This personal milestone was secondary to England’s predicament and Root still needed allies. A stand of 54 with Buttler was useful before the wicketkeeper was bowled by an inswinger from Ishant on 23. Moeen Ali’s first innings against the red-ball this summer featured four typically buttery boundaries in a 72-ball 27 that otherwise sat in contrast to his recent pyrotechnics for Birmingham Phoenix.

By tea a sixth-wicket stand of 58 had pushed England to 314 for five by tea but the complexion of the day shifted once more. Moeen was the first of two wickets in two balls for Ishant as both he and Sam Curran edged to slip and the start of the fast bowler’s next over meant Root facing a hat-trick ball for the second time in the match; like his arrival on day two, this was successfully repelled.

In fact it wasn’t until reaching his 150 from 266 balls, prompting the latest chorus of cheers from the stands, that Root offered the first genuine chance of his innings, a guide behind square catching the top edge and offering a sharp catch at gully. Rohit Sharma, wrong-footed, could only grasp at fresh air.

The tail stumbled thereafter, Ollie Robinson lbw to Siraj for six and Mark Wood run out for five. But 20 vital runs were eked out alongside Anderson, the No 11 wearing a nasty bouncer to the helmet from Bumrah, and thanks to Root’s masterclass we could yet have a classic Lord’s Test on our hands.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you wanted, you could still probably pick a few holes. He edged a few through the slips. He got bogged down a little in the 90s, and then again in the 150s. He didn’t hit a single six. Does an innings even still count these days if it isn’t accompanied by a big flashing bar along the bottom of the screen screaming “OH YEAH”? Most unforgivably of all, Joe Root’s unbeaten 180 against India lasted almost nine hours. Good luck fitting that into BBC Two’s teatime schedule.

In a way, this would be entirely in keeping with the past few years of his England career, a period curiously defined not by all the things he has achieved, but all the things he hasn’t. He averages 40 when he should be averaging 50. He scores fifties when he should be scoring hundreds. His team keeps losing series and getting bowled out for 130. He needs to bat at No 3. He needs to stop batting at No 3. He needs to play more Twenty20. He needs a break.

Root’s first three years as captain – between early 2017 and early 2020 – felt like an exhaustive tutelage in the daunting size and tedious scale of the job. There comes a point early in the life of all captains when they start to fancy themselves Kubla Khan: standing atop their stately pleasure dome, looking down on their chasms of ceaseless turmoil, wondering how they might recast the game in their own beatific image.

It never quite works out like that. As Root would find out, his dream job would consist largely of team meetings, hopeful pointing and endless questions about batting collapses and Jofra Archer. Over time, you could sense a certain joy and energy draining from him.

Michael Vaughan reckons the shelf life of an England captain is about five years. This is Root’s fifth and it has washed in on a lifeless ocean of disease, disinterest, isolation, his first home series defeat as captain and the mental health struggles of his friend Ben Stokes.

And yet, something deeply weird has happened. Somewhere on the long and lonely journey to his inevitable fate, Root rediscovered the secret to batting immortality. The sort of innings that other batsmen play in their dreams, Root has begun to play in his sleep. There was the 228 and the 186 in Galle, the 218 in Chennai, the 109 in Nottingham last week and now this glorious fifth symphony, all of them composed since January. He will almost certainly smash Mohammad Yousuf’s record for Test runs in a calendar year.

All while the team he captains seems to be crumbling around his ears. So just what is going on here?

Perhaps the answer, paradoxically, lies in the rubble of England’s recent form. Batting and captaincy are often described as two completely different skillsets and in most respects they are: one a function of athletic ability, the other of character.

For most of Root’s time as captain one seems to have been working against the other: the single-minded tunnel vision required to hone his game to the highest standards, versus the empathy and perspective demanded to captain a fragile team through a period of great flux.

But what if – quietly – the two jobs have essentially merged into one? What if the past 18 months have shown Root the limits of his influence? He can’t fix the domestic schedule or produce a new opening batsman out of thin air or slow the march of franchise T20 or put cricket back in state schools or cure Covid-19. He can’t even get himself back into the T20 side: his one innings for the Trent Rockets in the Hundred was a first-ball duck.

The only thing he can do to help his team win – the only thing he could ever do, really – was score runs. At a time when his runs are more needed than ever before, that sharpening of focus seems to have stoked his appetite for batting greatness.

It was a blissful Saturday here, the sun shining, the cricket of relentlessly high quality, the game beautifully poised. There were even plenty of women and children in the stands, which must have been a source of immense puzzlement to the ECB and its market research.

Perhaps, ultimately, all you really need to sell the game is a great setting, a meaningful contest, and just a touch of genius out in the middle.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pep Guardiola is the big spender whose greatest triumphs came on the cheap, even if it may not make him the poster boy for penury. As he cited his cut-price Champions League wins, the impression he gave is that he sees them as part of football’s rich tapestry. Guardiola is set to become the first manager to field a £100m footballer in the Premier League – and if he has his way then Jack Grealish will only possess the status as the division’s record signing for a few weeks.

If Sunday’s game at Tottenham doubles up as a tug of war for Harry Kane’s services, money may form a familiar backdrop. Guardiola can be an alchemist of a coach and an inventive tactician, but he is familiar with the accusation he has become a chequebook manager. English football’s maiden nine-figure buy may be used in the case for the prosecution. Tottenham offered £25m for Grealish in 2018; perhaps Daniel Levy’s reluctance to go higher amounted to a false economy as, three years later, Manchester City paid four times as much for the Aston Villa captain.

Guardiola reasoned that City’s ability to bring in fees for peripheral players such as Jack Harrison, Lukas Nmecha and Angeliño, plus Jadon Sancho’s sell-on clause, reduced their overall outlay. “I said last year that we couldn’t spend £100m,” he said. “We have bought Jack Grealish because we sell for £60m, so in the end we have spent £40m. Otherwise, we cannot do it.” Sign Kane, possibly for a fee 50% or 60% larger than Grealish commanded, and City’s net spend would be substantially larger. Perhaps Guardiola’s argument would then alter.

His old employers may look on enviously. Guardiola is the Barcelona ball boy turned captain and manager whose former club’s overspending meant they could not afford to keep Lionel Messi. City are altogether more affluent now. The balance of power has swung to the nouveaux riches. “Each club has its own reality, its own history,” he said. “And every owner of every club decides how he wants to live. Our owners do not want to benefit, they want to reinvest in the team. There is Chelsea with [Roman] Abramovich and our club with Sheikh Mansour. They want to be in this world, they want to be buying into football. What is the problem?”

Guardiola referenced Silvio Berlusconi’s Milan as he maintained ambitious owners are nothing new. Yet he was keen to stress he did not buy success when his managerial career started with a flourish. “I had the best player I’ve ever seen in my life – Lionel Messi – but we won two Champions League at Barcelona with seven players who came from the academy,” he said, and if Gerard Piqué was bought back for a bargain fee, his broader point still stood. “The finals against [Manchester] United with seven players from the academy: zero cost. You can win with different squads, different players and different situations. There is no guarantee.”

Now, as City look to win again, it is without changing much. Kane was earmarked to replace Sergio Agüero but Grealish has taken the No 10 shirt from City’s record scorer. A strategy of deploying a false 9, more Messi than Agüero, may continue in Kane’s absence. “It’s actually quite a similar team to last season. Sergio has left, so Jack comes in but the rest are the same,” Guardiola said. “I don’t know if we will sign a striker; that depends.”

He was reluctant to discuss Kane, let alone his potential cost. The other big numbers he quoted were not transfer fees. “Two teams, Manchester City and Liverpool, raised the bar and we have had to have 90, 90, 90, 90 [points] to be champions,” he said. “We have a trophy in our cabinet but we start from zero this weekend.”

Last season’s stuttering start – again when few players began the campaign in peak condition – was followed by a surge that owed much to an expensive signing, in Rúben Dias, but also to managerial brilliance and a capacity to adapt in adversity. “That is why we had success: because we did not cry in the beginning,” Guardiola added. “The reality is what it is: adapt and go forward.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Liverpool have condemned “offensive and inappropriate” homophobic chanting aimed at Norwich’s on-loan midfielder Billy Gilmour.

The Scotland player, who joined Norwich in July, was targeted during their 3-0 defeat to Liverpool at Carrow Road by a section of away fans, due to Chelsea being his parent club.

The chants were called out online by Kop Outs, Liverpool’s LGBT+ Fans Group, with the condemnation retweeted by the club, who added: “The chant is offensive and inappropriate – a message we have repeatedly communicated alongside Kop Outs. We urge supporters to remember the inclusive values of the club and to refrain from using it in the future.”

Kick It Out, the anti-discrimination campaign group, have previously condemned the chant, writing in 2019: “The ‘rent boy’ chants have been directed at Chelsea for years, with little action taken by The FA or Police – and that must not continue. We are absolutely clear: the chant is homophobic and must be treated as such.”

Liverpool’s victory featured goals from Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino, both assisted by Mo Salah, who then scored the third. It made him the first Premier League player to score in five consecutive opening weekends.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It was a chance to display new acquisitions. Manchester United led the way, parading Raphaël Varane on the pitch before kick-off, using a quadruple Champions League winner and a 2018 world champion as proof of their largesse. Leeds produced an idiosyncratic response. Enter Marcelo Bielsa, soon to perch on a new bucket.

Unlike the other United, Bielsa has never been a slave to the transfer market. He believes improvement comes from within, aided by relentless running. Luke Ayling has symbolised it. He was a right-back in the lower half of the Championship when Bielsa inherited him and a scorer of a spectacular goal at Old Trafford on Saturday. When Leeds were briefly level, it served as an endorsement of their manager’s credo.

Twenty minutes later, with Leeds losing 5-1 and with Bielsa’s aggregate score in two trips here standing at 11-3 in favour of the other United, he was left looking like the man who came to a gun fight armed only with a bucket.

Money can do that. Paul Pogba has shed his tag as the most expensive signing in Premier League history, Jack Grealish and Romelu Lukaku demoting him to a lowly third on the list. Whether or not a burden was lifted, the £89m midfielder looked liberated; here, at least, he appeared value for money. Four assists were testament to his remarkable passing range.

Bruno Fernandes’s fee could yet reach £67m, though he has dealt in other large numbers since his arrival. An insatiable quest for goals brought a hat-trick and, perhaps, an early reminder to Jadon Sancho that he will do well to outscore Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s flagship buy.

Leeds were outgunned. There is an ambition in playing attacking football against clubs who can afford a higher calibre of attacker. Bielsa’s two visits to Old Trafford have featured 68 shots and the suggestions Leeds were too naive peaked after their 6-2 defeat last December. Instead, a ninth-place finish and a fine record against their supposed superiors suggested pragmatism and purism allied in a beguiling blend.

Leeds were unaccustomed to a status as the neutrals’ favourites until they returned to the Premier League with a 4-3 loss at Anfield. They now specialise in spectacular starts to the season, after odd impasses. Lionel Messi was not the only iconoclastic Argentinian to spend much of the summer out of contract before putting pen to paper. Bielsa’s latest deal was less surprising and signed 48 hours before Leeds’s campaign started; that represented a case of getting things done quickly. Last season he formally committed to Leeds the day before that visit to Liverpool. The new terms and conditions probably did not include the upgraded, plusher bucket, compete with cushion.

Minus Roy Hodgson, Bielsa has inherited the mantle of the Premier League’s oldest manager. He makes few concessions to ageing and if he is not slowing down, his team certainly are not. Bielsa has become the division’s unlikely elder statesman, albeit in the manner of an odd, obsessive uncle. Certainly he pursues his own path. His wins feel triumphs of ideology, his defeats setbacks stemming from stubbornness.

Leeds found Fernandes irrepressible in the December defeat. Fast forward eight months and they had the same problem. Bielsa has had a transformative impact on Kalvin Phillips, but the England international’s excellence has underlined how Leeds lack a suitable alternative. With Phillips on the bench, Fernandes eluded Robin Koch at will. A defender crowbarred into midfield saw his immediate opponent score three times.

Not for Bielsa the safety blanket of two holding players, even though Solskjær prospered by continuing with “McFred”, the double act of Scott McTominay and Fred who afforded Pogba and Fernandes licence to roam.

The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.

Fernandes’s centrality means Pogba has been shunted out to the left. The Frenchman is Old Trafford’s enduring enigma but a recurring theme is that he often responds to the presence of quality players around him. He and Fernandes dovetailed, swapping positions at will, Pogba wandering infield. He looked the laid-back quarterback, clipping a pass of deft delicacy for Fernandes’s first goal, releasing Greenwood with a ball of surgical precision and artistic curve.

In quintessential Pogba fashion, it was not a perfect performance: he was labouring in pursuit of the all-action Ayling when the right-back hammered in an equaliser. It is early to recycle predictions this will be his season, but until France’s premature exit, it looked like it could have been his European Championships. But on his day, Pogba can outclass more gifted sides than Leeds and this was an afternoon when Bielsa’s boldness backfired.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@To many of those who know him best, James Simpson is an inspiration. A superhero, even. But in his own words: “I’m simply James Simpson the rugby player.” It is a remarkable show of humility from a man who will be one of the stars of Sunday’s Wheelchair Challenge Cup final.

While serving with the 1st Battalion Yorkshire Regiment in Afghanistan 12 years ago, Simpson lost his legs in an IED explosion. It ended his career in the army but it did not deter his spirit, drive and determination. If anything, it strengthened his purpose to make the most of life.

“It’s life-altering, but it’s not life-ending whatsoever,” he says. “I’ve never let that moment define me. I didn’t want to be known for having injuries. I’m not James Simpson, the guy who lost his legs when a bomb exploded. I’ve made sure I’ve created my own pathway.”

Nine years ago, Simpson – a boyhood Leeds Rhinos supporter – discovered wheelchair rugby league, a sport in its infancy. “It was just for fun initially,” he says. “I was in my 20s, I didn’t know anyone in my life who was disabled other than fellow soldiers. Suddenly, I’m surrounded with guys who’ve been disabled their whole lives. Fast-forward nine years and the game has evolved into something unbelievably competitive. I’m almost a professional athlete these days. I eat, sleep and live the game, and it’s given me a huge purpose in life.”

Simpson is adamant it is the people he plays with on a weekly basis who are inspirational, not him. Take Nathan Collins, the Leeds and England player who was born with dwarfism but has become one of the stars of the wheelchair game. There are countless other examples, too.

“In our game, we don’t really notice it because we’ve all had a journey,” Simpson says. “We’ve got guys who’ve suffered life-altering injuries, and some who’ve been disabled from birth. I love that everyone has a story.”

Those stories will be on full display on Sunday on the BBC website and iPlayer, when Leeds aim to retain the Challenge Cup they won in 2019 when they face the Argonauts of Kent in the final at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield.

Last year’s domestic campaign was wiped out by Covid-19 and the wheelchair World Cup, like the 13-a-side men’s and women’s tournaments, has been pushed back to 2022. It is typical of Simpson, though, that he remains pragmatic and positive about the future of the sport despite the setbacks.

“Don’t get me wrong, I was fuming when they called it off,” he says with a laugh. “But I got over it, because I knew we had this cup final to prepare for. We’ve been playing two games a day in the Super League and this weekend is such a monumental moment.

“I just want everyone to see how good this game is, and this is the opportunity. A few years ago, the games were being streamed on Facebook by someone stood at the side of the pitch with a phone. Now, we’re on the BBC. It’s incredible.”

It is the first wheelchair club game to be given this platform but interest is mounting. A clip of an incredible try scored by the former England international Harry Brown recently went viral, being shared by Adam Hills and Johnny Vegas, among others.

“I watch games back from when I made my debut and I really wasn’t that good,” he says with a smile. “The standard now is incredible and the game has evolved. When we first started out it was mainly wheelchair basketball players playing rugby … you didn’t see a lot of rugby-isms. Now we’re all rugby players with rugby backgrounds.

“I’m 35 now and I have to work so hard to keep up with the demands at the top level. You’ve got to because all the leading players are in their early 20s. These are the stars of the future and these are the guys who will take wheelchair rugby to the next level.”

The World Cup is a pivotal moment for rugby league in the UK, not least for the wheelchair game. It has made considerable steps forward in recent years, and the cup final being shown by the BBC is another huge leap of progression. But this is far from the end of the journey for Simpson. “I want the next big international star to not even be playing the sport yet,” he says. “I want them to tune in on Sunday and be inspired. To see that anything is possible, and you can play sport no matter what.

“The World Cup isn’t the end. I want to grow the game even bigger. It should be the launchpad for the game. To those who haven’t seen the sport before, all I’d say is tune in. You’ll be amazed.”

For someone who has been through so much, that is high praise indeed from Simpson. Perhaps you would be wise to heed his words and give wheelchair rugby league a go on Sunday. You won’t regret it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Primoz Roglic got off to the perfect start in his bid to claim the Vuelta a España for a third consecutive year by winning the individual time trial in Saturday’s opening stage in Burgos.

Roglic (Team Jumbo-Visma) arrived in Spain in top form after winning the gold medal in the Olympic time trial in Tokyo and set off last, aiming to topple the early frontrunner Alex Aranburu (Astana–PremierTech).

The reigning Vuelta champion finished the 7.1km course in 8:32, beating Aranburu by six seconds to take the red jersey and a healthy early lead in the general classification.

The Jumbo-Visma star was a further two seconds clear of Jan Tratnik (Bahrain-Victorious), who finished third, with Tom Scully (EF Education-Nippo) and Josef Cerny (Deceuninck-QuickStep) fourth and fifth respectively.

The Slovenian has a lead of 27 seconds over Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers), the 2019 Tour de France winner, who is seen as Roglic’s main rival for this year’s Vuelta title and came 46th on the day. Bernal’s teammate Adam Yates fared better, finishing 20sec down on Roglic and taking 16th place. Richard Carapaz, the 2019 Giro d’Italia champion and winner of the men’s Olympic road race, trails Roglic by 25 seconds after coming 35th.

The Frenchman Romain Bardet (Team DSM) finished a very creditable 14th, 17 seconds down, after a surprisingly good time trial performance. Jack Haig, of Bahrain-Victorious, who crashed out of the Tour de France having targeted the general classification there, finished 20th on the stage, 21 seconds behind Roglic.

“I am very happy to have achieved this result today,” Roglic was quoted on Jumbo-Visma’s team website. “Although the time trial was only seven kilometres, it was still very tough. I rode full speed from start to finish. Fortunately, it was enough. I don’t know exactly where I made the difference. We had to go straight up and then get through the corners well.

“We’ll see if I can keep the red jersey for three weeks.” Roglic added. “It’s a great start to this race. Hopefully we can enjoy this with the team in the coming days.”

Sunday’s stage two is a flat 166.7 km route from Caleruega to Burgos and should finish in a sprint. Fabio Jakobsen, of Deceuninck-QuickStep, who is riding his first grand tour having recovered from his shocking high-speed crash at the Tour of Poland last year, Arnaud Démare (Groupama-FDJ), Michael Matthews (Team BikeExchange) and Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Fenix) are all expected to feature in a bunch sprint.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The All Blacks claimed the Bledisloe Cup in stunning fashion, punishing the wayward Wallabies 57-22 in a record Eden Park drubbing.

A ripping first-half contest turned ugly for Australia after the break in the Auckland rain, New Zealand running in four tries in a lethal 18-minute spell. The All Blacks now have an unassailable 2-0 lead before the series concludes in Perth in a fortnight, and lengthens the Bledisloe Cup’s stay in New Zealand to 19 years.

Australia’s wait at Eden Park also goes on: losers in their past 21 matches at their house of horrors across a miserable 35-year run. In terms of points conceded, none was worse than Saturday night.

David Havili’s 82nd minute effort pushed New Zealand to their highest score against Australia in 118 years of Tests.

It could have been so different for Dave Rennie’s side, which were enterprising and - as promised - physical in a pulsating first half.

At 21-15 at the break and with Ardie Savea in the bin, they will rue a wayward lineout deep in All Blacks territory that preceded their butchering. Turnovers killed their hopes: twice the Wallabies threw into the arms of All Blacks players for runaway tries.

Noah Lolesio - who improved his kicking from 2/7 last week to 3/4 - threw a bullet to Rieko Ioane, who opened the tryscoring by running 70m unchallenged. Lolesio made amends with a kick wide to Kellaway, who danced past McKenzie to score.

Dave Rennie’s desired physical contest was on view: Korobiete laid out Dalton Papalii in one of several hits that had the crowd gasping. However, sloppiness undid the Wallabies again, with Lachlan Swinton stripped by Mo’unga during another Australian attack.

Five passes and 15 seconds later, Brodie Retallick had the ball over the try line as the All Blacks engine started to purr.

Brute All Blacks strength saw Savea score on 31 minutes, Mo’unga’s conversion pushing the score to 21-8 and giving the Wallabies a mountain to climb. They weren’t deterred, with the impressive McDermott going over after a string of messy scrums right on the All Blacks tryline to reduce the deficit to six points.

The battle to influence referee Brendon Pickerill was almost as fierce as the actual contest.

Sam Whitelock complained to Pickerall of the Wallabies claiming territory and Michael Hooper said “I want a yellow card” for persistent defensive infringements. Hooper got his wish when Savea was binned shortly after, but they couldn’t cash in.

Quick thinking from Aaron Smith - one of the best afield - released Codie Taylor to score and the All Blacks didn’t look back. Sevu Reece claimed Matt To’ouma’s pass for a second intercept runaway try, and soon enough, the contest was over.

Taylor claimed a double and Will Jordan continued his fine try-scoring form as New Zealand hit 50 points. Kellaway’s consolation did little to spare Australian blushes, as Havili ran in to complete the rout.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Form lines from sprint handicaps the length of the country converge in the Great St Wilfrid Handicap at Ripon on Saturday, including the well-run Scottish Stewards’ Cup at Hamilton in July won by the subsequent Stewards’ Cup winner, Commanche Falls.

Music Society, Mr Wagyu and Staxton – who were second, third and fourth respectively there – all line up, with Staxton, the winner 12 months ago off a 4lb lower mark, a few pounds better off at the revised weights.

He was able to grab the stands’ rail from a high draw last year, however, and failed to land a blow in the Stewards’ Cup last time.

Mr Wagyu (3.45), by contrast, went on to record the latest of several career-bests this season when storming to success in the Stewards’ Sprint at Goodwood. His winning time there suggested he is still thriving and he is a fair price at around 7-1 to continue his remarkable progress this year.

Newbury 1.45 A ready winner on debut over this track and trip in July, Bayside Boy could improve past Masekela, a runner-up at Group Two level last time.

Newmarket 2.00 Georgia Dobie and Quenelle D’Or may get a soft lead here and Hugo Palmer’s filly is proven at the trip. A price around 8-1 could look big if they are allowed their own way in front.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KL Rahul stood in the deep, with champagne corks arced around him like a shower of meteorites. India’s centurion did not look impressed. He had owned this ground on Thursday. But this was Saturday, when the crowd tends to treat the outfield as an extension of its picnic area. Seeing how far one can spray one’s Piper-Heidsieck has become a sport in its own right.

It is the posho equivalent of throwing coins from the stands and ought by rights to earn a swift fine or an Asbo. But the Saturday of the Lord’s Test has its own rituals and its own mythology.

It still clings to the idea that it is a date in The Season, even if there is a marked absence of royalty, and the few folk here who can explain the Henley regatta or “have a team” in the Boat Race are safely contained within the pavilion.

Still, there is a way things are done, a gala style to live up to. The pork pies for the picnic basket are bought specially from M&S; the panama is rescued from the back of the cupboard and checked for nesting creatures.

On Friday the ground had gleamed RedforRuth: a day later it returned to its familiar pastel palette, the summer tones of pinks and blues giving the stands a watercolour wash.

Even the weather seemed to understand its duty: gone were the low clouds of the first two days, dropping their sudden deposits of drizzle like stealth bombs. The sun emerged just as Mohammed Shami bowled his first ball from the Nursery End and grew more generous with every over.

The seven days of this series have been great fun but they had not yet developed the aura of a classic contest. As Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow began the day as they meant to go on – heads down and hustling for busy singles and determined twos – there was a nodding presentiment that this was going to be a golden day’s cricket.

There was an ooh of delight for Root’s first square drive, even though it got no further than the fielder stationed precisely for it. People talk about the hum here but really it is the nuanced range of expression these cultured onlookers are capable of that is truly unique – from the warm bubbling of approval when Root reached his 50 to the appreciative murmur as he squeezed the ball through the barely-there gap between the slip cordon and gully. When Bairstow straight-drove a ball that bounced down the square like a greyhound released from the traps, they groaned with pleasure.

Who could begrudge the faithful their moments of ecstasy? This was a day of cricket that lived up to any measure of fantasy. A stunning captain’s innings, plus a half-century for his devoted retainer. A flurry of late-in-the-day wickets to shake them from their post-picnic slumber. An England team that seemed on its last legs going toe to toe with a touring team as compelling as any India side to visit these shores.

Even when they are not taking wickets – and the morning session was the only time they have not – there is something irresistible about India in the field. Their captivating bowling attack and their team culture, not to mention their shared commitment to male grooming, make them a seriously glamorous outfit.

Virat Kohli’s charisma exerts a gravitational pull that earns him a spot alongside Keith Miller, Viv Richards and Imran Khan. And Denis Compton, the Brylcreem Boy, would raise an approving salute to Mohammed Siraj, whose most recent Instagram post reveals the secret of his shiny, healthy beard.

Where Kohli was the centre of attention the last time India were here two years ago, Siraj is now stealing the limelight. After their tussle at Trent Bridge the fast bowler resumed his battle with Bairstow, thundering down bouncers that cannoned off the Yorkshireman’s shoulder as if meeting a brick wall, and following through so far that the England batter had to shimmy past him as he ran.

He got his man eventually, and thought he had Root, too, in the evening session. But after two misjudged referrals against the England captain on Friday, Kohli ignored his appeals for DRS, even when Siraj walked all the way to slip to plead with him.

The bowler remained bent over, head in hands, as the rest of the players returned to their fielding positions. As poses go it was theatrical – and just what the crowd wanted. They would have given him full marks for style.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@My Olympics gone by, I miss it so. And despite the Kafkaesque bureaucracy, the hard quarantine, the endless spitting into test tubes and the constant fear of being pinged and forced to self-isolate for 14 days, I wouldn’t have wanted to be anywhere but Tokyo during these past few weeks.

In some ways it felt like being present at a vast and implausible heist – 16 months of delays, doubts and dangling uncertainties, being spirited away by 16 days of astonishing sport and extraordinary stories.

Some questioned whether journalists should have been at these Games, especially in the teeth of a pandemic, with spectators banned and swathes of the Japanese public apathetic. I always disagreed. The Olympics is the biggest sporting event in the world. It always required boots on the ground to report on the good, the bad, the ugly. Without fear or prejudice. How else would our readers know what was really going on, or be able to support our ongoing work in this area (something which you can do here, FYI)?

For me, though, these Games were also personal. In 1939 my grandfather, Jimmy Ingle, became the first Irishman to win a European amateur boxing title. In normal times, the Olympics would have been a logical next step. And where were the 1940 Games initially due to be staged? Tokyo.

But when the second world war broke out, the possibility of fighting in the Olympics – as well as offers to turn professional in London or the US – went up in smoke. As my grandfather later wrote in his autobiography: “The outbreak of World War II shattered my dreams … Looking back now, it is possible to put things in perspective. They were but the shattered dreams of a teenager at a time when millions of other young men across Europe were destined for a far worse fate.”

During my time in Japan, I often thought about how his life – and mine – might have turned out if the cards had been shuffled slightly differently. The moments he never got to experience. The memories he was never able to have. My grandfather, the eldest of 15 kids born into a working-class Dublin family, could have been at a Tokyo Games more than 80 years before me. Instead he lifted and sawed wet logs for eight and a half hours a day in a Dublin sawmill before training two hours every evening.

Mostly, though, there was no time to think. I am often asked what it is like to cover an Olympics. It is both an intense privilege, and incredibly intense. You get to sit in great seats writing about the greatest sports stars of our age. And then you do it again. And again. Often in a different venue on the same day. It is a hell of a buzz, although the lack of sleep can lead to an almighty crash … until the next wave of adrenaline scoops you up and makes you ready to go again.

My busiest day in Tokyo started just after 4am with an email to check if the women’s triathlon would start at 6.30am after a heavy storm. It ended at 2.30am the following day. In between I wrote about Flora Duffy winning Bermuda’s first gold medal, Team GB’s best start at an Olympics and helped Greg Rutherford with his Guardian column on Magic Monday. Then, to top it off, I reported on the US gymnast Simone Biles pulling out of the all-around women’s competition that evening, which made for a very late night. Nessun Dorma really could have been written about the Olympics.

However, being in Japan also allowed me to break the news that Tokyo 2020 had banned pictures of athletes taking the knee on its social media channels, something that led to a rapid U-turn after the Guardian published its story. It also meant I could ask Biles whether she felt speaking out about her mental issues might ultimately have a bigger impact than winning yet more medals, and the 400m hurdler Karsten Warholm what he made of Nike’s super spikes (“Bullshit,” he replied, before explaining why he felt they were unethical).

More importantly, it enabled our team of nine to produce the broadest and most diverse coverage of any English-language publication – with in-depth coverage that went far beyond Team GB’s many successes. They included Andy Bull’s piece on Dallas Oberholzer, the 46-year-old Olympic skateboarder who fended off a jaguar. Barney Ronay’s powerful reporting on the Refugee Team’s Kimia Alizadeh nearly winning a brilliant taekwondo bronze, and Tumaini Carayol documenting the woes and wonderful comeback of Biles with deep understanding and skill.

Being there also allowed the Guardian to better probe and interrogate the rights and wrongs of Tokyo 2020. As it has done since Owen Gibson first revealed that Tokyo had won the right to stage the Games following a secret €1.3m “payment” to buy votes.

The best sports journalism isn’t just dazzled by performances from the world’s finest athletes. It also gets its hands dirty. To do that takes contacts, time, and trust from people who know that their story will be handled carefully and considerately if they come to you. Such journalism is vital – but it also takes significant resources.

Meanwhile the wheels of Big Sport never stop turning. The Paralympics will be upon us soon, and there’s the Ryder Cup, the Ashes and the World Cup in Qatar. And once again the Guardian will need people on the ground to cover them properly. So if you’d like to support our journalism, from as little as £1, you can do so here. Thanks for reading – and thanks for making a difference.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the defining images of Tokyo 2020 was 21-year-old Kye Whyte holding his team-mate Bethany Shriever in his arms on the BMX track. Minutes earlier, Whyte had become the first British rider to win a medal in BMX racing, charging through to claim silver in the men’s event. Shriever then followed him home, claiming a thrilling gold. Their embrace was tender, but spoke only of a decade-long shared history of overcoming adversity – injuries, lack of funding, near-misses – on the road to a very strange Olympics. There’s no rest for Whyte, the “Prince of Peckham” - he competes in the BMX world championships next weekend.

What was going on in your mind when you picked up Beth Shriever?

It was just that we had kind of made history and she was too tired to celebrate, so I had to pick her up and help her celebrate her win. Because she gave it her all out on the track and she didn’t have the legs to even walk. It’s been a rocky ride for both of us, but we both made it.

Tokyo 2020 was an unusual Olympics. Did that contribute to the emotion?

The only downside is that we didn’t get to see Japan, obviously. But it was still super-super-crazy going into the dining hall and you’d see like 10,000 athletes at any time of the day or the night. It was all different foods and they had the best ice-cream I’ve ever tasted. It was like a strawberry Magnum, but a Japanese brand. I was eating that non-stop!

How did you feel after winning silver?

I had about eight emotions when I finished. The first one was excitement, then shock. Then I calmed down and I got tired and was like, “Oh my God, I could have won.” Because I was winning that race and I made a mistake. So I got a bit angry. But I brought myself back to the reality that it was still good.

Everyone loved the races. Liam Gallagher tweeted: “BMX racing at the Olympics is blowing my mind.”

Yeah, but he didn’t mention me! That’s what we’ve been trying to do for years. As a team, we always talk about how we can get more fans involved. But it’s all based on money and BMX doesn’t really get that much money in. So this was super big for us, for it to be blown out of proportion like that.

BMX is a really dangerous sport: when you were 13, you were knocked out and couldn’t race for more than a year.

Yeah, I had a bleed on the brain and they put me in an induced coma for five days. Just waiting for me to wake up. When I woke up and I was able to go to the toilet by myself, I could leave. On my first try, I actually fell down. That’s all I remember. To be fair, I don’t know why I still do it, but it’s obviously worked out now.

You started riding at Peckham BMX club. The head coach there Michael Pusey (aka DJ CK Flash) is vocal about how sport can keep kids out of gangs. Was that a choice you faced?

Not for me. I started BMX at the age of three, so that’s the only thing I knew. Anything outside of BMX was just not normal to me, if that makes sense. But yeah, I grew up in Peckham and I have friends in gangs. But even if I wasn’t doing BMX, I wouldn’t be in a gang anyway because I’m pretty screwed on and my dad was quite strict when me and my brothers were younger.

So you were lucky to find something you loved doing?

I don’t even love it that much, because I hate training! I love racing, the adrenaline, but if I could not train and still race and keep up with everyone that would be a dream.

Tom Daley has knitting. What’s life for you outside BMX racing?

I don’t have a life outside of BMX racing! We’re training sometimes from 10am until 5pm and you come home and you’re just dead. So I’ll just play Xbox with friends. I’ve got a dog – he’s a little French bulldog. He’s a whiner, barker, he snores very loud. Farts non-stop. If I was on FaceTime, I could show you how annoying he is right now.

The world championships are coming up next weekend in the Netherlands. Do you look at that as a chance to avenge the Olympics?

I wouldn’t say avenge, but yeah, for me, it’s a point to prove. I know I could have won [the Olympics] – also the guy who won [Niek Kimmann], the world championships are at his home track. So if I was to win at his home track that would be even more mental.

Your former coach, CK, likes to tell young riders: “It’s not about the money, cars or how big your house is, it’s about how many lives you can save and change.” Would you agree with that?

I’m not sure, because I need a new car! And I need a house out of this because I’m not riding and training for nothing. But yes, obviously if this can help kids come off the streets and get into BMX, no matter where they’re from, then I’m happy that happens.

Adam Peaty has called for a return of the TV show Superstars, which pitted athletes from different sports against each other. Would you be up for that?

One hundred per cent. I feel like I’m pretty fast at running. I can swim, but I don’t know if I’m fast or not. I can’t do press-ups, because my wrist doesn’t even bend more than halfway, but I’d say I’m pretty strong. So I feel like that needs to be a show.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It gets to Sunday evening. You’ve done your chores. You’ve had your dinner.

You’re tired. You have work on Monday. You just want something to stick on the telly while you flick through the papers or doze on the sofa. These days you have choices. Next Sunday, for instance, if you have a comprehensive satellite package, you could watch Levante against Real Madrid, Roma against Fiorentina or Nice against Marseille. Which are you going to choose?

Perhaps you think Real Madrid, under pressure and having signed only David Alaba this summer, might slip up in the second of three away league games they face at the beginning of Carlo Ancelotti’s reign, so decide to watch La Liga. Perhaps José Mourinho’s first Serie A game in charge of Roma sounds fun, particularly given the combustible nature of some of his pre-season friendlies.

On this occasion, unless you have a particular love of football on the Côte d’Azur, the Ligue 1 offering probably won’t draw too many viewers. But when Paris Saint-Germain are playing it will. Leaving aside everything else – and that is, admittedly, leaving aside a lot – there is a great appeal in seeing just what happens when Lionel Messi links up with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé.

Which game floating punters prefer to watch may sound trivial, but it in fact reaches towards something fundamental. What is football for? What is it about? The probability is that Messi, Neymar and Mbappé will score dozens of goals this season. PSG may have been beaten to the title last season by Lille, but they surely won’t be again. There will, almost certainly, be some brilliant goals – dribbles, moments of interplay, outrageous individual skill – that will be cooed over in context-free 30-second clips on social media.

In that sense the profile of the league will increase. Certainly more people will be interested in watching PSG this season than in the recent past. The scrum at the airport and the queues outside the club shop to buy a Messi shirt are ample evidence of the enthusiasm he has generated (although the club’s suggestions that he will pay for himself should be taken with a pinch of salt).

But is that really what football is now about? Perhaps it is. There is certainly a strain of elite-level marketing departments that sees clubs as content producers. The CEO of Real Madrid, José Ángel Sánchez, has said Disney is the model, while at least one super-club is seriously considering the production of a semi-fictionalised soap opera based on dressing-room and boardroom drama.

We want to see how Messi and Neymar will link up and so we tune in. Some will revel in the beauty of the football and won’t care that scoring a hat-trick against OSC Patisserie may not be the highest level of sport (particularly not after OSC Patisserie were forced to sell their best players following the collapse of the Mediapro TV deal), as though football were like gymnastics or diving, to be marked against an imagined ideal, rather than about beating an opponent. There will be a short-term sugar rush but, however appealing macarons or financiers may be, you cannot live on patisserie alone.

The real footballing test will come in the Champions League. Are PSG better equipped to win it this season than they were last? Possibly, given the investment at the back, particularly the arrival of Achraf Hakimi in the full-back area, which had been an issue. But Messi presents a problem.

PSG already struggled in the biggest games because of the lack of protection Neymar and Mbappé gave the midfield and Messi is not going to resolve that. But that’s a detail to worry about next March.

More significant is what it says about modern football that PSG were one of two, perhaps three, sides in the world who could afford Messi (and yes, it would be nice if he had paused to consider whether he wanted to join a project that in effect exists to promote a state with a questionable human rights record).

England still has a semblance of competitiveness, with Chelsea likely to push Manchester City hard while Manchester United and Liverpool have the potential to challenge, but elsewhere the picture is bleak. PSG and Bayern Munich look all but certain to win their titles. Internazionale did end Juventus’s winning streak last season but are €600m in debt and have already lost their manager, their centre-forward and an accomplished attacking full-back. Juve aren’t such overwhelming favourites as PSG or Bayern (and in fact are a slightly longer price than City in the Premier League), but they are still odds-on to retain their title.

If Spain looks slightly more open, it is only because of the chaos at Real Madrid and Barcelona, both of whom are hundreds of millions of euros in debt and have been forced to alter transfer spending accordingly. But then the terms of the agreement reached on Thursday with the private equity fund CVC, to which Real Madrid and Barcelona (and Athletic Bilbao and an unnamed Segunda División club) have an opt-out, in effect giving up 11% of broadcast rights over the next 50 years in return for €2.1bn now suggests just how desperate the league as a whole is for immediate investment.

Maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe a modern audience does just want to consume content, brief clips of spectacular moves whatever the context. Because if competition is anything like a priority, European football has failed. The economic issues that prompted the attempted Super League breakaway have not gone away just because that project was spectacularly bungled. The financial structures of the game led to the unhealthy perpetuation of an elite, into which system came three clubs whose wealth is not dependent on football and whose domination is perhaps only just beginning.

Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.

That was always the irony of Super League project: the plotters had identified the right issue, but their solution was wretched. It may be the only solution now is the financial collapse of the sport. And in the meantime, we’ll tune in to Ligue 1 and, ignoring what a broken structure it took for them to play together, marvel at Messi, Neymar and Mbappé turning their tricks. Ligue 1 is winning, celebrity culture is winning; football, perhaps, is not.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Perhaps Thomas Tuchel was merely trying to create the illusion of competitive tension when he screamed at Christian Pulisic after a slack piece of play from the American winger midway through the first half. To be honest, it felt a bit unnecessary from Chelsea’s manager. After all, consider the context: the sun was shining on a packed Stamford Bridge, Chelsea were a goal to the good and it was already clear they were far too strong for a mediocre Crystal Palace.

Yet Tuchel has high standards. He does not hide his feelings when he spots lethargy from his players and he knows that his team must become more ruthless if they are to loosen Manchester City’s grip on the Premier League title.

“I see ourselves as the No 4 [team],” he said, refusing to talk up his side as title favourites after their comfortable win. “We are in the role of the hunters. We have to close the gap.”

This is the challenge for Chelsea. Although they are the European champions, they finished fourth last season and often infuriated Tuchel with their carelessness in the final third. They still have room for improvement in attack and while Chelsea played with plenty of style as they eased past Palace, it was not hard to work out why they have spent £97.5m on bringing Romelu Lukaku back to west London.

It is not that they struggled without him. Chelsea cruised despite the absence of the former Internazionale striker, who should be ready to feature against Arsenal next Sunday. They looked formidable at times, even with Hakim Ziyech and N’Golo Kante unavailable and Kai Havertz coming on in the 82nd minute after running himself into the ground during last Wednesday’s victory over Villarreal on penalties in the Super Cup, and they could have won by more.

All the same Tuchel acknowledged that Chelsea can still become sharper in their attacking play.

Perhaps he was thinking of Timo Werner, who produced yet another uneven display up front. As usual Werner was full of running, often twisting away from Palace’s new centre-back Marc Guéhi, who endured a difficult debut against his old club. The only problem was that the German striker remained erratic in front of goal, twice spurning presentable chances with scruffy finishes.

Nonetheless, Chelsea were too strong. There was a special free-kick from Marcos Alonso to open the scoring and the game was over as a contest when Pulisic, responding to Tuchel’s tongue-lashing, made it 2-0 five minutes before half-time.

It quickly became an ordeal for Palace, who will need time to adjust to Vieira’s focus on possession. They are in transition after parting company with Roy Hodgson and offered few signs of a change in style.

Their defenders looked uncomfortable when they tried to bring the ball out from the back and their prosaic midfield proved no match for Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic. As for Wilfried Zaha, he could get barely get on the ball.

Quick Guide New-boys watch: Chelsea v Crystal Palace Show Trevoh Chalobah will not forget his Premier League debut in a hurry. The 22-year-old academy graduate, who has had loan spells at Ipswich, Huddersfield and Lorient, started on the right of Chelsea’s back three and sank to the turf in disbelief after scoring from 25 yards during his team’s 3-0 win over Crystal Palace. “He is a very humble guy,” Thomas Tuchel said. “You could see everybody was very happy for him.” The occasion was less memorable for Palace, though. Marc Guéhi struggled in central defence against his old club and Joachim Andersen came on too late to make an impact. Jacob Steinberg Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

“We need to work hard to bring in a couple of players,” Vieira said. “We are short on numbers. The young players on the bench did well but they are not ready to play at that level.”

At least Palace succeeded in keeping Chelsea at arm’s length for a while, restricting them to hopeful efforts from Mount and Pulisic. Yet the breakthrough always felt inevitable. Mount was a busy presence, always probing and dropping into clever positions, and the goal arrived when Tyrick Mitchell fouled the Chelsea midfielder in the 27th minute, offering Alonso the chance to bend a glorious left-footed free-kick past Vicente Guiata.

Chelsea soon doubled their lead. Mount was involved again, combining with César Azpilicueta and sending a low cross into the six-yard box, where Guiata messily pushed the ball to Pulisic for an easy finish.

Chelsea were in control and although Palace briefly stirred at the start of the second half, Zaha denied by Antonio Rüdiger’s challenge, the pattern remained the same. Alonso almost scored another spectacular goal and there was a moment for the home fans to cherish when Trevoh Chalobah stepped out of the back three before smashing a low drive past Guiata from 25 yards.

It was a lovely moment for Chalobah on his Premier League debut. The 22-year-old academy graduate, who spent last season on loan at Lorient in Ligue 1, has forced his way into Tuchel’s thoughts after an impressive pre-season and he showed his delight by dropping to his knees before kissing the turf.

“It is a perfect afternoon ... it was a very good game from us,” Tuchel said.

Tammy Abraham, meanwhile, is expected in Rome today to complete a €40m plus add-ons move to José Mourinho’s Roma. The 23-year-old has played a bit-part role for Chelsea since Tuchel’s appointment as head coach in late January. The deal is understood to include a buy-back clause.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Brighton made a winning start to their Premier League campaign with late goals from Neal Maupay and Alexis Mac Allister. Burnley took the lead via a second-minute James Tarkowski header, which stood following a VAR check after Brighton claims that the defender had fouled Maupay, and the hosts went on to rattle the woodwork twice before half-time, Johann Berg Gudmundsson hitting the post and Ben Mee the bar.

The visitors subsequently capitalised on those near-misses after the break as two players helped them turn things around shortly after entering the fray. Jakub Moder teed up Maupay’s equaliser in the 73rd minute with Mac Allister netting the winner five minutes later.

“The substitutes absolutely played their part,” Graham Potter told the Brighton website. “It was a fantastic team performance, especially in the second half considering we got off to the worst possible start. Burnley made it difficult for us and we rode our luck a bit in the first half.”

The first competitive match at the ground with no restriction on attendance since March 2020 saw plenty of noise generated by the crowd as kick-off approached - including some boos as players took the knee, as well as applause.

Then Burnley fans were cheering within moments of the contest getting under way after Tarkowski sent Ashley Westwood’s corner past Robert Sánchez. Brighton protested that Tarkowski had fouled Maupay before heading in, the pair having collided as the Burnley defender moved towards the goal and Maupay ended up on the turf, but the effort was allowed to stand following a VAR check.

The hosts subsequently picked up two bookings in quick succession, with yellow cards being shown to Gudmundsson for a challenge on Yves Bissouma, and Tarkowski after another clash with Maupay, which resulted in a free-kick that Solly March sent into Nick Pope’s arms.

Gudmundsson then almost made it 2-0 in the 19th minute when his low strike come back off the post. Another Tarkowski-Maupay challenge led to a booking for the Brighton striker, before Jay Rodriguez’s shot brought a save out of Sánchez.

Burnley went close to doubling their lead again in the 36th minute as skipper Mee headed against the bar and the ball bounced down on the line, with Tarkowski firing the followup over. At the other end, Shane Duffy headed over and Pope had little trouble catching an acrobatic attempt by Maupay.

The opening stages of the second half saw a Maupay shot deflect off target and Gudmundsson curl a free-kick wide. Rodriguez going down in the box under the attentions of Duffy sparked penalty calls from Burnley that were waved away by referee David Coote, and Leandro Trossard lofted an attempt wide of Pope’s goal just prior to the hour mark.

After Chris Wood saw a shot deflect behind, Potter made a change by bringing on Moder for Steven Alzate – and the substitute had a near immediate impact, sending a cross in from the right that the sliding Maupay converted to draw things level.

Moments later, Potter saw another substitution swiftly pay off as his side grabbed the lead, with Mac Allister, sent on for Trossard soon after the equaliser, slotting past Pope from Pascal Gross’s delivery.

“In the second half we controlled the game well and you have to do that here,” said Potter. “It’s a fantastic performance on the back of a challenging pre-season. I am really pleased for the boys.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Not everything changes with the seasons. Leicester’s biggest signing this summer is a potential replacement for Jamie Vardy but the veteran striker proved he is unwilling to surrender his throne just yet. While the new arrival, Patson Daka, watched from the bench the 34-year-old led the line for the home side with a ferocity that sometimes seemed to have faded in the second half of last season and – surprise, surprise – he produced a wonderful finish to give his team a winning start to the campaign.

Vardy was grateful to Ricardo Pereira for creating the chance in the 41st minute, as the Portuguese burst between two opponents on the right before curling a cross to the near post. Displaying the instincts of a supreme predator, he beat Conor Coady to the ball and stabbed it first time into the far corner.

“It was a brilliant finish, sublime,” said the Leicester manager, Brendan Rodgers, who believes there is still plenty of more to come from Vardy. “He’s in great condition, he looks after his body. We had a good chat over pre-season. He’s got two years left on his contract and it’s up to both of us to manage him and make him as explosive and electric as he can be. When he’s in that form with that hunger, he’s very difficult to play against.”

Vardy was bright from the start of a match in which most of Leicester’s other forwards struggled. He was the first to force either of the goalkeepers into a save, as José Sá flung himself to his left to block the striker’s shot in the 10th minute after a deft pass from the mostly disappointing Ayoze Pérez. Coady charged down another Vardy effort five minutes later after Pereira’s first attempt at supplying the striker, and Sá had to intervene again in the 22nd minute to stop Vardy’s rasping low drive from 20 yards.

None of those chances could be described as gaping, however, and Wolves generally kept the hosts at bay. Bruno Lage has been hired to cultivate a vibrant attacking style but the new manager had the good sense not to change too much too quickly. Although usually an advocate of a back four, Lage elected to send Wolves out with three central defenders, the formation favoured by his predecessor, Nuno Espírito Santo. But there were palpable tweaks to Wolves’ play, chiefly more tempo to everything they did, from pressing to passing, and, although their defensive line was higher than before, their use of the offside trap frequently caught Leicester out.

Quick Guide New-boys watch: Leicester v Wolves Show José Sá bore no blame for Leicester’s goal and did his part in keeping the score down by making several saves, though none of them were particularly difficult. The goalkeeper also showed encouraging proactiveness, rushing off his line several times to help out his defence. Francisco Trincão was far less influential on the right wing. For Leicester, Jannik Vestergaard was busy after being introduced for the last half hour and found himself overpowered on a couple of notable occassions by Adama Traoré, Boubakary Soumaré was mostly tidy in midfield after coming on, learning quickly not to swell on the ball. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Wolves should have taken the lead minutes before falling behind but Adama Traoré steered his shot wide after racing clear of the defence. That was a mighty relief to Daniel Amartey, whose sloppy pass had allowed João Moutinho to set up the chance.

Wolves did not trouble the home defence as much as Lage would have wished. Raúl Jiménez worked valiantly on his first competitive outing since fracturing his skull nine months ago and showed no signs of skittishness as he challenged for every ball. But the service to him was underwhelming.

Francisco Trincão made little impact on the right wing until early in the second half, when Caglar Soyuncu did well to deflect his shot wide after clever interplay with Jiménez. As the threat from Wolves grew Rodgers changed his system, introducing the new signing Jannik Vestergaard as a third central defender and casting on another debutant, Boubakary Soumaré, into central midfield as Harvey Barnes joined Vardy in a front two.

The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.

Barnes twice chose the wrong option when given chances to increase Leicester’s lead. Then Traoré fired straight at Kasper Schmeichel after a counterattack by the increasingly dangerous Wolves.

Vardy should have secured victory in the 77th minute after neat service by Tielemans – who was as classy as ever – but slashed wide from 15 yards. Wolves threw everything at the hosts in the closing minutes but could not break through, Schmeichel foiling their best chance by saving a close-range header from Max Kilman.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Karim Benzema picked up where he left off last season by scoring twice to fire Real Madrid to a 4-1 win away to Alavés in their opening game of the La Liga campaign.



Real had an uninspiring first half in Carlo Ancelotti’s first league game since taking charge of the club for a second time but Benzema settled their nerves by blasting the ball into the net in the 48th minute after being teed up by Eden Hazard.



Defender Nacho added to Real’s lead eight minutes later, sliding in to stab a Luka Modric through ball into the net from close range. Benzema scored a scrappy second goal in the 62nd but moments later Alavés pulled one back when striker Joselu slotted in a penalty after a foul by goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Substitute Vinicius Jr added a final goal for the visitors in stoppage time, netting with a diving header as he met a cross from debutant David Alaba.

The night’s three other La Liga fixtures all ended in draws, with Osasuna and Espanyol playing out a goalless stalemate in Pamplona. Cádiz and newly-promoted Mallorca were both held to 1-1 home draws by Levante and Real Betis respectively.



Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland scored twice and set up another three goals as the hosts steamrolled past Eintracht Frankfurt 5-2 on Saturday to put down a marker in their Bundesliga opener.

It was captain Marco Reus who put new coach Marco Rose’s team in the driving seat in the 23rd minute, scoring from a Haaland assist, with Dortmund fans returning in limited numbers to the 81,000-capacity stadium.

A Felix Passlack own goal four minutes later did nothing to slow them down as Thorgan Hazard rifled them back into the lead in the 32nd after Reus combined with the 21-year-old Haaland, who had scored a hat-trick in their German Cup first round win last week, for yet another counter attack.



The hosts, who face champions Bayern Munich in the German Super Cup on Tuesday, completed their first half goal rush with Haaland pouncing on a Stefan Ilsanker mistake to charge into the box and slot in for a two-goal lead in the 34th.



Gio Reyna added a fourth goal with a tap-in on the hour with Eintracht at the complete mercy of the bursting Dortmund runs that kept on coming. Another Haaland run earned him his second goal of the evening following a VAR review.

Fellow Norwegian Jens Petter Hauge scored late on his Bundesliga debut to somewhat improve the scoreline for Frankfurt.

Newly-promoted Bochum and Greuther Fürth both made losing starts to life in the top flight, losing 1-0 and 5-1 at Wolfsburg and Stuttgart respectively. Hoffenheim made a winning start, running out convincing 4-0 winners at Augsburg.

Bayer Leverkusen drew 1-1 at Union Berlin as visiting forward Moussa Diaby’s 12th-minute equaliser cancelled out Taiwo Awoniyi’s early opener, while Arminia Bielefeld were held to a goalless home draw by Freiburg.

In France, Lionel Messi watched on from the stands as Paris St Germain made hard work of beating Strasbourg 4-2 in Ligue 1 to continue their winning start to the new season.



Not yet fully fit, Messi, along with Neymar and fellow new recruits Gianluigi Donnarumma and Sergio Ramos, did not make the match squad, but saw his new club take an early lead through Mauro Icardi at Parc des Princes.

Kylian Mbappé then doubled PSG’s advantage in the 25th minute after his shot was deflected home, before the France international’s cross was turned in by Julian Draxler two minutes later to put the hosts 3-0 up.

Second-half goals from Kevin Gameiro and Ludovic Ajorque got the visitors back into the contest, with PSG looking uneasy in possession. Alexander Djiku’s dismissal for two bookable offences let PSG off the hook nine minutes from time, with substitute Pablo Sarabia tapping home at the back post in the 86th minute to make sure of the unconvincing victory for Mauricio Pochettino’s side.

Nice manager Christophe Galtier celebrated a winning return to his former club Lille , as they hammered the champions 4-0 for their first victory of the campaign.



Nice’s Danish forward Kasper Dolberg scored in either half, including a first-minute goal from close range, while midfielder Hicham Boudaoui’s early strike and the impressive Amine Gouiri’s first-half penalty completed the rout.



Dolberg’s second goal came shortly after the hour mark as he nodded in from a corner to mount the pressure on new Lille boss Jocelyn Gourvennec, whose side secured a last-gasp 3-3 draw at 10-man Metz in their opening game.

It was a well-deserved victory for Galtier, who joined Lille in 2017 after eight years at St Etienne and guided them to their first top-flight title since 2011 last season before leaving them shortly after.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fulham thumped Huddersfield to pick up their first win of the season despite Harry Wilson being sent off midway through the second half.

Huddersfield started brightly but were made to pay for some woeful first-half defending as Aleksandar Mitrovic opened the scoring in the ninth minute after errors from Ryan Schofield and Sorba Thomas.

Josh Onomah and Fabio Carvalho scored two more in the latter stages of the first half after further defensive blunders by the hosts.

Matty Pearson had given Huddersfield brief hope after heading home from a 41st-minute corner, halving Fulham’s lead only minites before their third goal.

Substitute Ivan Cavaleiro chipped Schofield to make it 4-1 with 12 minutes to go, before another cool Cavaleiro finish deep into stoppage time rounded off the scoring.

The visitors had played the last 18 minutes a man down after Wilson was sent off for kicking out at Levi Colwill following a late tackle.

Schofield tipped away Onomah’s long-range effort in the second minute during a frantic opening, before Paulo Gazzaniga kept out a Duane Holmes shot after a flowing move by Huddersfield.

Pearson had a goal ruled out after he smashed a loose ball home from the resulting corner, but Fulham hit the front four minutes later through Mitrovic.

Schofield was unable to control a misjudged back pass by Thomas and could only watch on as his clearance rebounded off Mitrovic and into the goal.

Mitrovic had a header ruled out for offside after 31 minutes, before Wilson scuffed a shot wide with the goal begging soon after.

The pressure paid off when Onomah bundled home from close range after Huddersfield failed to react to Bobby Decordova-Reid’s corner in the 37th minute.

Pearson pulled a goal back after he rose brilliantly to head home a Thomas corner. But it was to no avail after Fulham restored their two-goal cushion through Carvalho before the break as the home side again failed to clear their lines.

Schofield palmed away a curling Wilson effort in stoppage time, before Josh Koroma fired straight at the goalkeeper from 20 yards just before the hour mark.

The Huddersfield keeper then failed to hold a Carvalho shot, before Wilson hit the crossbar from the rebound and followed up with an effort that was struck straight at Schofield as Fulham pegged Huddersfield back inside their own half.

But the Liverpool loanee Wilson was shown a red card in the 72nd minute for lashing out at Colwill following a late tackle on the touchline.

It did not prevent Fulham from extending their lead further, however, with Cavaleiro chipping over Schofield after a perfect pass by Decordova-Reid in the 78th minute and then adding another five minutes into stoppage time after good holdup play by Mitrovic.

“We were the better team and deserved the three points,” said Marco Silva. “We didn’t get what we deserved last week, but we did this week.

“The first goal was a lucky one but we had clear chances after that to score more and more.”

Carlos Corberán, the Huddersfield manager, said: “We didn’t compete in too many moments and when you are not competitive you can suffer this type of defeat.”

“The team looked nervous and didn’t show the confidence we have seen. It is really disappointing. We were competitive from the start but we did not keep the level that we needed.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sergi Canós has said he was nervous before Brentford’s Premier League opener against Arsenal on Friday and was in disbelief when his shot give the promoted side the lead.

Brentford christened their new ground, a year after it opened in lockdown, as a full house roared them to a 2-0 victory. The former Liverpool youngster scored their first goal in the Premier League and Christian Nørgaard headed the second on a memorable evening in west London.

“It was a fantastic night and the fans deserve it so much after the year we’ve had with the pandemic. We all deserve this,” Canós told the club’s website.

It was the 24-year-old’s second top-flight appearance, five years after coming on as a substitute in Liverpool’s final game of the 2015-16 season. “I felt nervous, I’m not going to lie,” he said. “It was the first game in the Premier League for a lot of players.

“We were playing Arsenal and we have so much respect for them. But we showed we are here in the Premier League because we deserve it.

“It was a tough game. They are a great team and they pushed in the second half. But the second goal made us a little calm.

“I hope this is going to be our fortress this season. I hope the fans do this every week because we need them. We are all one as a club. It’s going to be a hard league so we need their support.”

Brentford’s last match in the top flight was also against Arsenal, a 1-0 home defeat in May 1947. The spotlight is already on the visitors, for whom Ben White, the £50m signing from Brighton, endured a difficult debut, while his fellow defender Pablo Marí put in an error-strewn display.

Arsenal were missing their captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and his fellow striker Alexandre Lacazette through illness. With Chelsea and Manchester City next up in the league, though, they could well find themselves bottom come the first international break.

Arteta said: “My focus is with the players that we have to try to make them play as best as possible, to get the best out of the team and try to find a way to win football matches. It’s the same with the next one.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If this was a portent for life after Jack Grealish, then Aston Villa could be in for a very long season. A scintillating first-half performance from Ismaïla Sarr on the day that tributes were paid by both clubs to Graham Taylor provided the perfect start to life in the Premier League for Watford’s manager, Xisco Muñoz, and a sense of foreboding for his opposite number, Dean Smith.

A mural depicting the man who managed both these sides so successfully had been unveiled outside Vicarage Road 24 hours before kick-off, with members of his family watching on from the stand that now proudly bears his name. Yet while it was the club that Taylor led to runners-up in his final season before succeeding Bobby Robson with England who came into this opening-day encounter as the clear favourites, it was Watford who rose to the occasion. In particular Sarr - who was the subject of a failed loan bid from Manchester United in January - seemed in a hurry to make up for lost time after starring in Watford’s promotion campaign.

Having been mercilessly mocked by the Villa fans behind the goal when his volley sailed way off target inside the opening two minutes, the Senegal forward soon had his revenge when his cross picked out Emmanuel Dennis inside the area. His shot was initially blocked by Ezri Konsa but the striker who joined from Club Brugge in the summer made no mistake with the rebound, with no one looking happier than Muñoz as he cavorted down the touchline in celebration.

Villa’s summer of change in the wake of Grealish’s record-breaking £100m departure to Manchester City meant debuts for Danny Ings, Emiliano Buendía and a return for Ashley Young against his former club after winning Serie A with Internazionale last season. In the absence of the injured Ollie Watkins after he failed a late fitness test, Smith’s side looked disjointed in attack but it was perhaps more surprising to see how they struggled to contain Sarr with the same personnel in a defence that was such a strong point last season.

It took a cruel deflection to take Sarr’s shot from a tight angle past the despairing dive of Emiliano Martínez just before the break, although it was no less than he and Watford deserved. “We lacked intensity - it was almost like we were playing a friendly game in the first half and Premier League games are not friendlies,” admitted Smith. “We gave ourselves a real mountain to climb.”

Quick Guide New-boys watch: Watford v Aston Villa Show Watford's trio of Peter Etebo, Emmanuel Dennis and Juraj Kucka could not have wished for a better start having each played their part in an impressive opening day victory, with Stoke loanee Etebo and Kucka – a Slovakian signed from Parma - dominating in midfield. The same could not be said for Emiliano Buendia or Danny Ings, who both struggled to fill the void left by Jack Grealish following their big-money arrivals from Norwich and Southampton respectively. At least Leon Bailey provided some spark by setting up John McGinn's consolation goal, although Ashley Young also had a return to Vicarage Road to forget. Ed Aarons Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Matt Targett was withdrawn at half-time, no doubt feeling dizzy from dealing with Sarr as Young was handed the unenviable task of stopping his marauding runs. With half an hour to play, Smith threw on the former Bayer Leverkusen winger Leon Bailey in the hope of dragging his side back into the game but could only watch on as another substitute stole the show. The Colombian Cucho Hernández first joined Watford in 2017 and had yet to play a single minute for the club having spent the last three seasons on loan in Spain. But it took him less than a minute to announce himself after coming off the bench with a brilliant curling effort that went in off a post after beating Buendía to the ball.

“It was an amazing performance, the team was very hungry,” said a delighted Muñoz. “The new players have had a quick adaptation to our squad and that helps us make a strong start.” John McGinn’s excellent half-volley from Bailey’s cross soon after at least kept Villa in with a sniff of a comeback but an injury-time penalty from Ings after Bertrand Traoré had been fouled was far too little, too late.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Roger Federer is going to miss the US Open and be sidelined for what he said will be “many months” because he needs a third operation on his right knee. The Swiss said the procedure will leave him with “a glimmer of hope” that he can return to competition.

Federer announced the news on Sunday on Instagram. He said he will be “out of the game for many months”.

“I’ve been doing a lot of checks with the doctors, as well, on my knee, getting all the information as I hurt myself further during the grass-court season and Wimbledon,” Federer said. “Unfortunately they told me for the medium- to long-term, to feel better, I will need surgery, so I decided to do it. I will be on crutches for many weeks and then also out of the game for many months.”

Federer, 40, who has 20 grand slam singles titles to share the men’s record with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, acknowledged there was a chance his playing career could be over, but he said he would rehab the knee with the goal of making another comeback.

“I want to be healthy. I want to be running around later, as well, again, and I want to give myself a glimmer of hope, also, to return to the tour in some shape or form,” Federer said. “I am realistic, don’t get me wrong. I know how difficult it is at this age right now to do another surgery and try it.”

Federer missed more than a year of action after first having his knee repaired shortly after the 2020 Australian Open in February of that year. He had a follow-up procedure that June.

He returned to grand slam action at the French Open in late May and then pulled out of the tournament after three victories. His most recent match was a loss in the Wimbledon quarter-finals last month, and he cited the knee injury in withdrawing from the Tokyo Olympics.

The US Open is the season’s last grand slam tournament, and it starts on 30 August in New York. Nadal is dealing with a foot injury, and Djokovic pulled out of tune-up tournaments, saying he needed to rest and recuperate following the Olympics, where he failed to win a medal.

Federer won 16 of his grand slam titles between 2003 and 2010 but remained near the top of the sport into his late 30s. He won the Australian Open and Wimbledon during a resurgent 2017 and defended his title at Melbourne Park in 2018, his most recent grand slam championship. In 2019 he lost a five-set classic to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Reaching the esteemed position of a plus-three handicap is arduous enough without the challenges that have come the way of Kipp Popert. Multiple surgeries to make day-to-day life a little easier – never mind by way of assistance with the fulfilment of sporting aspirations – mean Popert has been denied a standard amateur career.

Having been born 10 weeks premature, Popert was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy that affects his lower body. Throughout his teenage years a successful summer on the golf course would be followed by another operation – the lengthening of compacted muscles and foot reconstruction among them – plus protracted recuperation time as routine. No wonder Popert doffs his cap to the NHS.

“The free health care in this country means I have been able to undergo procedures that, in other countries, I wouldn’t have been able to go in for,” he says. “It would have been easier if I didn’t want to go into professional sport but I wanted a chance to be able to use my feet as best I could. There were times when I missed a whole year of golf.”

Now 23, a graduate and with what appears a clear fairway in front of him, Popert has eyes on prime events – the Amateur Championship and Lytham Trophy among them – in 2022. Yet one domain continues to preclude disabled golfers from participating. Despite the Olympic Games having a golf element since 2016, the Paralympics will begin on Tuesday week without the same. That looks as incongruous as it is disappointing. “I am a player, I just do that part,” Popert says. “Hopefully it will happen and I will be ready. As golfers we play for ourselves a lot of the time. The biggest honour is to represent your country. I watched cerebral palsy football at London 2012 and was blown away.”

It must be recognised that the International Golf Federation, which has overseen the sport’s Olympic return, is desperate for Paralympic inclusion. “The IGF has made a number of unsuccessful bids to be admitted to the Paralympic Games, with the latest being for Paris 2024,” said the IGF’s executive director, Anthony Scanlon. “We are currently working towards making another application for the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympic Games.

“The IGF strongly believes that golf would be a tremendous addition to the sports programme and is no less dedicated to making that happen. We are confident that golf’s inclusion in the Paralympic Games would be as great a success as golf’s return to the Olympic Games was. Similarly it would generate tremendous worldwide interest and inspire a new generation of athletes with impairments to participate in sport.”

For now the articulate and driven Popert is excelling in the environments available to him. He recently reached the summit of the world rankings for golfers with a disability. Popert has been a prominent performer and a winner as the European Tour maintains an alliance with the continent’s Disabled Golf Association via 36-hole tournaments. The standard therein is high; Popert shot a closing-round 66 to prevail at St Andrews last weekend. In November Dubai will stage the EDGA and European Tour’s grand finale.

“I want to continue to push disability golf and the EDGA,” Popert says. “My ultimate ambition is higher than anyone would say, so I’ll keep that to myself, but I want to achieve my potential. That definitely includes playing on the European Tour. When the timing is right I will turn professional and give it my best shot. If I can set a high bar and people look up to me, that would be a great honour.”

Popert has no cause to underplay the hurdles before him. Golf is a game of physical rotation and, especially in the modern era, power. The Kent player’s limitations in that respect seem obvious. “My disability is not progressive, so it will not get worse other than the things that happen to your muscles as you get older anyway,” Popert says. “That has always helped me mentally; I know that, if I work hard, I can improve my condition and ability to live with it. I do everything I can to be able to do as much as I can.

“I have added club head speed over the last year and think I can add more. The beautiful thing about golf and what gives me a chance is that 70% of shots are hit from 120 yards and in. An elite player from 120 yards in will score well. The modern game is going a certain way because of distance but I can still work extremely hard at the other parts of my game. It’s in my nature to keep pressing on because of all the setbacks and operations I have had from a young age.”

Plus, unfortunately, the dismissive glances. “Oh yeah, throughout school,” Popert recalls. “When you are 14 or 15, telling people you are going to play at the highest level of golf as you struggle to walk into a gym class? I remember being in a buggy at a golf club because my feet were particularly bad that day and an older member asked, ‘What are you doing in that?’

“I don’t mind people asking me about my condition, I have lived with it, so it is part of who I am. If I had it a lot easier growing up, I wouldn’t be as resilient as I am now.” The Paralympics, for now at least, is missing a putt from tap-in range.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Willie Poching has been promised an open audition to convince the Wakefield Trinity hierarchy he is the right man to succeed Chris Chester as the club’s head coach. This was about as impressive an opening gambit as he could have hoped for, even if there was a late reminder of how much of a challenge this job is.

Anything other than a Wakefield win here would have been unfair on the hosts, who dominated large periods of the contest against a Warrington side who were, in their own coach’s words, “unacceptable” in the first half.

But as indifferent as Warrington were before a late flurry of tries threatened the grandest of comebacks in the final quarter, credit must go to Wakefield too. They parted company with Chester last week after five years in charge, with the club keen to move in a new direction looking ahead to 2022.

With Leigh still yet to win a game this season, it is almost certain Wakefield will be in Super League next year. In truth their safety is now practically assured following this win. Leading 12-0 at half-time thanks to tries from Tom Johnstone and David Fifita, moving 20-0 ahead shortly after the restart, Wakefield looked set to give Poching a comfortable first match in charge.

“I don’t know whether we felt comfortable at that point,” Poching said. George Williams and Lee Kershaw exchanged tries before three Warrington scores in five minutes turned a 26-6 deficit into 26-22 with 10 minutes still to play. Suddenly, Wakefield’s mettle was being tested and usually, in positions such as these, they crumble.

But the spirit and fight they showed to keep Warrington at bay in the final minutes as they bombarded the Wakefield line underlined that Poching may well be the man to take Trinity forward. “We had enough about us to finish the job,” Poching said. “They showed what they can do for each other by turning up.”

Quick Guide Leeds Rhinos retain the Wheelchair Challenge Cup Show Leeds Rhinos retained the Wheelchair Challenge Cup with a comprehensive 60-28 victory against the Kent Argonauts in Sheffield.

England international Tom Halliwell was the star of the final, crossing for five tries as Leeds successfully defended the title they won two years ago. Last year's competition was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Leeds' long-serving captain, James Simpson, also crossed for two tries himself on an afternoon when the wheelchair game took centre-stage. The tournament has made great strides in recent years, and the Rhinos continue to be the game's dominant force. The Argonauts put up a commendable resistance until the final 15 minutes, when the Rhinos pulled away and underlined their superiority in the wheelchair game. Their attention will now turn to completing a domestic double by winning the Super League later this season. Aaron Bower Photograph: Ed Sykes/Rex Features Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

His opposite number was far more frustrated. Warrington missed the opportunity to close the gap on second-placed St Helens with a win here, and had a dismal first half to blame. “That first half was totally unacceptable,” Steve Price said.

Johnstone’s interception try, followed by Fifita’s barge over from close range, made it 12-0 at the break. Mason Lino then finished a wonderful Wakefield team move, before converting and then adding a penalty to put Wakefield 20 points ahead.

Kershaw followed Johnstone with a magnificent interception of his own, and even when Williams and Austin crossed, they felt like consolation tries. But when Jake Mamo and Josh Charnley scored in the minutes afterwards, we had a grandstand finish on our hands. Wakefield, as Poching knows, are notorious for buckling when the chips are down. The fact they didn’t here will have done his chances of getting the job no harm.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Belgian rider Jasper Philipsen won stage two of the Vuelta a España on Sunday by edging the bunch sprint at the end of the flat 166km stage from Caleruega to Burgos as Primoz Roglic maintained his overall lead.

The Alpecin-Fenix rider timed his surge to the finish line perfectly to pass the UAE Emirates rider Juan Sebastián Molano, who went too early and was easily caught before finishing fourth. The Dutchman Fabio Jakobsen was second with the Australian Michael Matthews third, all crossing the line in 3hr 58min 57sec.

Philipsen’s victory completed a hat-trick of opening sprint wins in all three grand tours this season for Alpecin-Fenix while the Belgian collected his second Vuelta stage win after taking his first last year.

“It’s incredible,” he said of the team’s third successive triumph. “Yesterday someone put it in our team group chat and for sure it was a dream but I didn’t want to think about it because the chance is always less high than it would be true.

“It just shows how everyone from team is really motivated. It was a team effort and we can be really proud. It was amazing to see all my teammates there and everyone on the frontline. I had a lot of support and this is how we can win sprints.”

The race enters the mountains for the first time on Monday with a 202km ride from Santo Domingo de Silos to Espinosa de los Monteros and will be a big day for general classification hopefuls such as Egan Bernal and Adam Yates in their bid to challenge Roglic for the title.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The seven-times Olympic gold medallist Jason Kenny has praised the “massively positive” announcement of funding for the Paris Games in 2024.

Athletes aiming to compete for Team GB at the 2024 Olympics will benefit from a total of £232m in UK government support. The announcement came on Sunday as the returning Olympians from the Tokyo Games convened at Wembley Arena for the national lottery’s Team GB homecoming event.

Team GB won 65 medals in Japan, with the cyclist Kenny adding another gold and a silver to his haul to become the nation’s most-decorated Olympian. “Without the funding you are relying on extraordinary people who would win anyway – but they are few and far between,” he said.

“I think what the funding does, it gives anyone with a bit of talent a chance to go and perform and as we have seen it has moved us up the medal table massively since we started getting the funding. I think it is a massively positive thing, I would say that because I’m on the receiving end of it but the Olympics are really special and it is really nice to see Team GB up at the sharp end and competing in lots of different sports.”

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, was in attendance for the homecoming concert as fans lined the streets to welcome the medal winners into the venue.

“Team GB showed us the very best of this country in Tokyo – demonstrating sportsmanship, hard work and record-breaking performances,” Johnson said in the press release announcing the latest round of funding. “This increased funding will support Team GB to deliver their best possible performances in three years’ time in Paris.”

Artists including KSI, Anne-Marie, Rag’n’Bone Man and Bastille were among those performing in front of the Olympians – which involved Kenny, his gold medal-winning wife Laura Kenny, as well as the likes of Tom Daley, Tom Dean and Adam Peaty. Dean returned with two golds from the pool in Tokyo and was in no doubt the impact funding had on his success.

Dean said: “The funding has supported myself and my family. In a sport where you don’t earn much money until you reach the top level then it is really great at building a solid base. It allows people to commit the time and energy they need for the sport and I do owe it [winning double gold] to the funding I have had over the years.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rishabh Pant is the next man in. Everyone knows Rishabh Pant is the next man in. Even when he’s not batting, the India No 6 still manages to impose himself. The commentators warn in menaced tones about the “dangerous Pant”.

The cameras try to pick him out on the India balcony. And right at this moment, with the second Test agonisingly poised and Lord’s a hive of tension, the next man in is reclining across a bench, watching the game from a horizontal position.

Yes: who doesn’t love Pant? Pretty much everyone at Lord’s wants him to come in as soon as possible: all the England fans, all the neutrals, and a pretty sizeable proportion of the Indians too. Pant is the sort of player you look forward to seeing when you scan your ticket and walk through the gates in the morning. Pant is the sort of player for whom you put the television on.

Cheteshwar Pujara is none of these things. Of course, he knows this as well as anyone. He’s long since accustomed himself to the begrudging comments from the opposition, the slow groans and ironic cheers from the stands. It was during the tour of Australia in 2018-19 when an exasperated Nathan Lyon grumbled: “Aren’t you bored yet?” And yet somehow in the past few months, it is the murmurs of discontent from within India that have begun to swell.

It’s 33 innings since his last Test century. The statistics say he has mysteriously lost the ability to score against full-length deliveries. The fans clamour for the young blood of Prithvi Shaw or the swinging blade of Suryakumar Yadav. The pundits complain that Pujara’s stonewalling is all very well in Australia, where batting gets easier over time, but here you will inevitably encounter a ball with your name on it. He comes into this innings averaging 26 in England. Fifty minutes later, he still does.

Let’s take a moment to examine the scene that Pujara enters. Joe Root, fresh from his 180 on Saturday, was having one of those mornings when everything he touched turned to pure milk chocolate. He took off Ollie Robinson after two perfectly acceptable overs on a hunch, and replaced him with Mark Wood; Wood responded by cleaning out KL Rahul. He moved Moeen Ali 10 yards to his right at deep square leg; the very next ball, Rohit Sharma hooked the ball straight to him. It was a pure, crisp Sunday morning, and Lord’s was heaving and swaying to Root’s gospel.

The natural instinct of the fan in these situations is to counterattack: to recoil and retaliate, and reclaim the narrative. Arguably this is particularly true of the modern Indian cricket fan, reared on a diet of IPL, raised on an unprecedented era of success and a brilliant generation of batting talents. So naturally, when your team are effectively none for two on a slow pitch, the situation demands only one approach: the Pant doctrine.

What it gets, instead, is Pujara, and an innings that almost from its very first stirrings begins to take on an epic, orchestral, heroic quality. Wood has first crack, dishing out some hostile rib music. Jimmy Anderson comes on and wobbles wicked inswingers into his pads with a short leg. Sam Curran bends the ball in from around the wicket. Five balls becomes 10, and then 15 and 20. Pujara has still not scored a run.

England scent weakness. Jonny Bairstow installs himself at silly mid-on and leads the chirping. The crowd begins to stir a little. An inside edge to square leg brings an aborted single. Then a square drive, cut off by a scrambling Haseeb Hameed. Finally, at 12.34pm, to rapturous cheers, Pujara pushes Curran to midwicket and gratefully jogs what has become the longest 22 yards of his life.

Slow starts are nothing new to Pujara. This wasn’t even his longest drought: at Johannesburg a few years back, he faced 53 balls before scoring his first run. But then denial has always been second nature to him. As a young batsman, his obsessively detailed father, Arvind, prevented him from playing gully cricket because he reckoned facing a tennis ball would get him into bad habits. He had to stay indoors during festivals in case he got injured by firecrackers or dandiya sticks. In a way, his entire existence has been built around self‑denial: from days off, from external displays of emotion, from rubbing his bruises or fiddling outside off-stump, from a culture that demands ever greater aggression, ever greater expression, an ever more perfectly realised Pant-ness.

Now, on India’s independence day, Pujara was embodying the Gandhian doctrine of nonviolent resistance. That first run was really just the phoney war: the real battle would come over the following hours, as Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane slowly carved out a lead. His first four came off his 118th ball. His first real shot in anger came off his 205th, a startling pull behind square. And then it was all over: a horrible lifter from Wood that Pujara could only glove to slip. As Lord’s finally rose in reluctant appreciation, Pujara looked distraught, wishing he had let the ball thud him in the chest instead.

The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.

Often people describe innings like Pujara’s as “proper Test batting”, which always feels like a curiously uncharitable sentiment. Garfield Sobers was a proper Test batsman. So was AB de Villiers. The point, surely, is that Test cricket has room for them all: lightning blitzes, spectacular blowouts and long boring afternoons at less than two an over.

It’s all Test cricket, or none of it is. And perhaps the real lesson here is that ultimately you just have to play the hand you’ve been dealt: by conditions, by the situation, by the unique cocktail of talents fate has handed you. Pujara made 45 off 206 balls, and the best part is that we still don’t know whether he’s a match‑winning hero or a game‑killing villain. Like the very best things in life, we’ll just have to wait a little longer.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Frankie Dettori and Palace Pier just held on to win a pulsating battle with Poetic Flare and land the Group One Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville for the second year running on Sunday.

The Italian jockey brought his mount, the 5-6 favourite, from the back and wide for a late challenge with half a furlong to go. He got the better of the long-time leader, Order Of Australia, but had to hold off a strong challenge from the runner-up.

The odds-on winner remains unbeaten this season following victories at Sandown, Newbury and Royal Ascot after holding on by a neck with a length and a half back to Order Of Australia. The horse’s victories in the Lockinge Stakes and Queen Anne kept the winner on top of the European miling division this campaign but this was the acid test against arguably the best three-year-old at eight furlongs and Palace Pier came through it even though he had a recent setback and was reportedly only “80% ready”.

A rematch between the first two could be on the cards in the QEII Stakes at Ascot on Champions Day in October but John Gosden, Palace Pier’s joint-trainer, suggested afterwards that he will have a long look at the Champion Stakes over 10 furlongs on the same card.

Gosden said: “I thought it was a very clean race. They went a pretty sensible pace, with Order Of Australia controlling it and he’s finished third, so it was not a race to be sitting out the back. We were second-last and they quickened and quickened. To that extent it was a bit of a test of speed.

“He’s done it well. I’ve made no secret of the fact he was ill with a blood disorder and missed the Sussex [Stakes at Glorious Goodwood]. I’ve come here on the absolute minimum of work – he’s probably come here at 80%. As Frankie said, his class got him through but he’s having a pretty strong blow. I was 10 days short for this race but they weren’t going to move the Jacques le Marois!”

Paddy Power cut Palace Pier to 7-4 from 2-1 for Ascot’s Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, a race in which he finished third last year. Gosden confirmed his charge will head straight for Champions Day in October but raised the Champion Stakes as a potential alternative to the QEII.

He added: “He’s a gorgeous horse and a lovely horse to be around. He’s got this amazing cruising speed and acceleration [but] I wouldn’t be frightened of stepping him up to a mile and a quarter.

“I think we’ll wait for Champions Day. When you run a horse like this, don’t come back too quick, so we’ll wait for Champions Day and possibly run over a mile or even a mile and a quarter.”

When asked if Palace Pier could run in the Breeders’ Cup Mile in November, Gosden said: “That’s a long way off. Del Mar is a track I’m very fond of. I’ve had a lot of success there and a lot of good friends there, but that’s a long way down the road at the moment.”

Dettori said: “I love the horse – he’s the best miler I’ve rode. He’s beautiful and he’s got everything – pace, a turn of foot and goes on any ground. We were rushing to get him here today. He’s missed a bunch of work and we got him here on 80%. He’s just so good and got away with it.”

He added: “I kept an eye on Kevin [Manning, on Poetic Flare] and, when he kicked, I went after him. I basically raced on my own for the last 200 metres and passed him good, but Kevin came back and fought back. Like I said [Palace Pier] is so good and just keeps on doing it.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Whatever happens, we’ll give it absolutely everything.” That was the message in a tweet posted from Tottenham’s official account before their game against Manchester City, and there was no need to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what it was getting at. The elephant in the room, the transfer saga of the summer – the England captain who may or may not have gone on strike.

As it turned out the “whatever happens” was what most people expected – Harry Kane being left out of Spurs’ matchday squad. Nuno Espírito Santo, before his first game in charge, put it down to a lack of fitness on the striker’s part, given he had taken part in only two training sessions following an extended (strike-related) holiday and a period of quarantine.

But he knew what everyone else did – Kane was as much mentally as he was physically incapable of facing the team for whom he truly wants to play.

The uncertainty surrounding Kane’s future is a cloud that will not pass over Spurs, certainly not while the transfer window remains open. But in a new era comes a chance for new heroes to emerge, or indeed existing ones to take on greater prominence, and in that regard it is worth going back to that pre-game tweet. Because underneath the message of defiance was an illustration containing three players – Hugo Lloris, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Son Heung-min – all important figures for Tottenham and, in the case of the latter, someone who, should Kane join City, would arguably become their most vital.

Because having for some time been the Robin to Kane’s Batman, Son would, in an instant, become Spurs’ leading attacker and someone the supporters can fully buy into, given his show of commitment to the club via the four-year contract extension he signed last month. “I’m so happy to be here,” the South Korean said at the time and it was clear he meant it.

It is six years since Tottenham signed Son from Bayer Leverkusen for £22m, a figure which back then felt somewhat excessive but which now looks a steal. The 29-year-old was a revelation during Mauricio Pochettino’s time in charge and continued to excel even during the toxic tenure of José Mourinho. Indeed last season was his best in terms of goals and assists – 22 and 17 respectively, with only three players having been involved in more Premier League goals since February 2020: Mohamed Salah, Kane and Bruno Fernandes.

Quite simply Son is a superstar and the early indications are that Nuno plans to build his attack around him should he lose Kane. The Portuguese deployed the player as a central striker in a 4-3-3 formation during pre‑season and, having seen him score three times, repeated the trick against City. And boy, did it work.

Another goal and it was one for which the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium erupted on a day that the return of spectators swept into this part of north London. Up against Nathan Aké on the left-hand edge of City’s area on 55 minutes, Son performed a couple of step-overs before drifting inside the defender and sending a sweeping shot into the far corner of the net. It was a stunning finish and reward for the team’s display of togetherness, aggression and intent against opponents who started brilliantly before becoming increasingly loose and lacklustre.

The nature of the goal was also notable, coming as it did via a counter-attack involving Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn, the wide men in Spurs’ three-man attack and who, it is clear, have the responsibility of providing the team with thrust, especially on the break. They were at it throughout, regularly getting Tottenham up the pitch and, in the process, providing Son with the platform to provide the killer touch. It came together magnificently with what proved the winning goal.

For all that, there were times, in the first half especially, when the attack malfunctioned, often due to a tentativeness from Son to truly hurt City or from his inability to compete in the air, and in those moments there was no getting away from the feeling that Spurs really could have done with having you-know-who in their starting XI. But then Son scored, threatened to do so a couple of times afterwards through his combination of quick and clever movement and ultimately showed he can be Spurs’ central man in more ways than one.

His was a striking display among many others in white, with no one impressing more for the hosts than Japhet Tanganga. The 22-year-old was excellent at right‑back, all but muscling Raheem Sterling out of the contest and rightly earning a standing ovation on his substitution on 83 minutes.

The fans were on their feet again at the final whistle to cheer an almighty season-opening win, and while for them there remains the dread of losing Kane, despite the manager’s insistence that the 28-year-old is staying put after the final whistle, there was enough here for them to believe that, ultimately, all will be OK under Nuno – a team willing to fight and thrive for the new manager and as part of which the Son will continue to shine.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Comparisons are odious and nearly always absurdly reductive but here we go anyway. In 2012 Lionel Messi set a new record for goals scored in a calendar year. Let’s not try too hard to be iconoclastic: his tally of 91 for Barcelona and Argentina in 2012 was one of football’s monumental achievements, a jaw-dropping effort over the long haul, even if the only silverware it earned him that year was the Copa del Rey. Poor Leo did not get too much bang for his buck there.

The previous mark had been set by Gerd Müller. In 1972 the man they called Kleines dickes Müller – Short Fat Müller, even though he was anything but, a man of average height and build – scored 85 times for Bayern Munich and West Germany. While Messi took 69 games to rack up his 91, at a rate of 1.31 goals a game, Müller needed only 60 for his grand total, rattling them in at a furious 1.41 a match. Müller’s reward for his annus mirabilis? Victory in the Bundesliga and at Euro 72, a tournament he arguably won single-handedly, having given Bobby Moore the runaround at Wembley in the quarters before scoring a brace in both semi-final and final.

Compare and contrast, then … though none of this is an attempt to denigrate the magical Messi, rather to illustrate the unique brilliance of Müller, who has made his final dart towards the great six-yard box in the sky. While Messi’s artistry guarantees him a place in the pantheon alongside the Pelés and Maradonas, your Cruyffs and Beckenbauers, Müller’s legacy is unjustly stuck on the reputational mezzanine below, clearly world class yet too often forgotten when the big conversation turns to the greatest ever.

Genius manifests itself in different forms, and Müller’s style was utilitarian for the most part. He traded under another, more well-known, nickname – Der Bomber – though it was something of a misnomer. His finishes were rarely crash-bang affairs: most of his goals were trundled, steered, poked, sniffed out or bundled home from close range. At first glance much of his work appears signally underwhelming, approaching unimpressive … until you realise he was doing it every single week, season after season, and wasn’t just some scruffy hack enjoying an abnormal run of blind luck.

A case in point can be found in footage of Müller strutting his forensic stuff at Bayern Munich’s old Grünwalder Strasse ground during the early 1970s. A cross loops from the right. Standing in the penalty area, Müller meets the ball as it drops, planting a header into the right-hand corner – a decent finish although, in and of itself, the goal is hardly worthy of comment. Certainly not the kind of strike worth rooting around YouTube for, nearly five decades after it was scored.

But let the clip spool on. Seconds later that cross is looping in again. It has to be an action replay: the ball is sailing at the same speed along the same parabola and Müller is standing in exactly the same position. Except no, it is not an action replay. The striker meets the ball with his head again but this time he sticks it away bottom left. Each time the keeper goes after the ball; each time he has no earthly hope of reaching it. In eight seconds of footage the genius of Müller – if not statistically the greatest goalscorer of all time, then the player who distilled the art of striking into a pure tincture – is perfectly illustrated. Unspectacular, unpredictable and utterly unstoppable.

Müller’s uncertain place in the pantheon makes a little more sense when one considers the single moment that defines his career: the winning goal in the 1974 World Cup final. On first viewing, it is all function over form, an act of close-range opportunism. But look again at that balance as he traps, swivels and threads elegantly into the far corner. What first appears scruffy reveals itself as a moment of pure balletic grace. Most players would have simply fallen backwards, clunk, on their arse. Not bad for a short fat man. Perhaps the greatest winner in any World Cup final.

Müller scored another in the second half, only for the flag to preposterously pop up for offside. The Germans had a good penalty shout turned down, too, and in truth, the legend of the 1974 World Cup final, in which the Dutch deserved to win, is an absurd fiction straight out of the Liberty Valance playbook. West Germany were the best side on the day, and in any case, Johan Cruyff’s romantic image is much better served by this near miss while the World Cup would be seriously devalued as an existential concept had Müller never got his hands on the trophy. And that’s before we get to Franz Beckenbauer.

As big-game players go, few have delivered more than Müller – winners in World Cup, European Championship and European Cup finals – while the sheer weight of numbers tells its own tale: 401 goals in 459 league matches, 35 goals in 35 European Cup ties, 14 goals at World Cups, 68 goals in 62 appearances for his country.

One of the all-time greats, then, no question … though, if you are somehow still not convinced, have a quick browse for his two-goal contribution to Bayern’s 1974 European Cup final replay win over Atlético Madrid: a right-footed lash from a tight angle, followed by an improvised lob over the keeper, smoothly wedging a ball that had been dropping behind him. Two sensational finishes – dare we say Messi-esque? – by the greatest goalscorer of all time. Clinical and classy, Der Bomber really was the bomb.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Harry Maguire believes Raphaël Varane will provide Manchester United with the winning mentality they need as they attempt to end their four-year wait for a trophy.

The World Cup winner completed his £41m move from Real Madrid on Saturday and was unveiled before United kicked off their season with a 5-1 demolition of Leeds. The United captain – yet to win a trophy in his career – is poised to form a centre-back partnership with Varane, who has claimed 19, including four Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles.

“You’ve seen what he’s won over his career,” said Maguire. “He’s played in some of the top teams about – the French squad and Real Madrid – and he’s won absolutely everything. I think he’ll bring that winning mentality and his footballing ability to the club. To bring in players of his calibre is really, really exciting.”

Victor Lindelöf, who has been a regular alongside Maguire since the latter’s 2019 move from Leicester, appears likely to make way for the new signing, though the Englishman was keen to acclaim United’s depth of resources in the position, with Eric Bailly also in contention.

“It boosts our defensive options,” Maguire said. “We’ve got an amazing number of centre-backs now, all internationals who are all proven in the Premier League.”

On Lindelöf, who set up Bruno Fernandes’s third goal against Leeds with a defence-splitting pass, Maguire said: “You’ve seen again how well Victor played. He’s an excellent footballer so to have this number of top centre-backs is great. At one of the biggest clubs in the world you don’t expect to have an easy ride and have no competition for places. Bringing in players is great, we thrive off it.”

United’s other major summer signing, Jadon Sancho, made his debut as a substitute on Saturday. “He’s an exceptional talent,” said Maguire. “I think you’ve seen in little glimpses the talent, the skills, goals, assists. He’s still young but he’s done a lot in the game. He brings that winning mentality as well. We know at this club we need to challenge for titles and challenge for trophies. That’s the aim.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“We can’t live in the past; we have to live today and tomorrow,” Ronald Koeman said and so they did. It may have been a single night, there might have been just 20,384 supporters here, and most important of all there was no sign of Lionel Messi – not on the pitch, at least – but it was the first time any of them had been in the Camp Nou for 526 days and, for all the depression, they came determined to enjoy the return, departing happy as a new era opened with a 4-2 victory over Real Sociedad.

On a hot, sticky and noisy evening the melancholy was momentarily gone, a cautious optimism taking its place. It has been 17 years, and it is not easy to let go, but for most of the 90 minutes here Barcelona’s fans did, driven by a kind of collective desire for closure and the performance of their “other” players, two goals from Martin Braithwaite and one each from Sergi Roberto and Gerard Piqué taking them to victory.

It hadn’t always seemed likely. There were only 15,280 requests for the 29,803 tickets Barcelona made available to members, most of the shirts in the stands still had Messi on the back, and banners hung around the ground blaming the president Joan Laporta for his departure. And yet if Messi was still present, his name chanted on ten minutes, there were others too and ultimately the fans would enjoy their company. Pedri was lauded as a new icon for a new age. Piqué is a decisive off the pitch as on it. Frenkie de Jong impressed. Braithwaite, resisting attempts to nudge him towards the exit door, scored two goals and provided a superb assist.

And then there were the new men, Memphis Depay specially showing the talent and personality to embrace this opportunity. After a long wait and the uncertainty that didn’t just last until the eve of the game but beyond, there was a place in the starting XI for him and for Eric García. Barcelona’s new signings were finally registered on the morning of the match thanks to Piqué taking what a club statement described as a “significant” pay cut.

Like so much of Piqué does in life, it worked out nicely. When Barcelona took the lead on 18 minutes, it had to be him heading into the net. Just as it had to be Depay, the man he had allowed to play, who delivered the perfect curling free kick from which he scored. Barcelona had the lead; more than a lead, there was life. The importance of the strike, the release, could be seen in Piqué’s reaction.

He kissed the badge on his shirt, held his arms wide open, embracing everyone here, and then lowered his head. For a while, he rested it on the advertising board, as if lost in thought and in the moment. Gratitude came from around the ground. Before the game, he had been cheered loudest. In the third minute, they had chanted his name. Now they did so again, lauding the man who one day really might be president – and probably better than the last one.

The goal delivered justice. This had been some start. Braithwaite had fired off the first shot on just 23 seconds, Antoine Griezmann had bent the second past the far post on 79, and Depay had drawn a collective in-take of breath with a superb flick on 175. There was intensity, the ball moved at speed, a point to be made. When the fans chanted Messi’s name on ten minutes, they had only just finished letting out a “huy” as Griezmann’s overhead kick flew wide. As they finished, he headed against the bar.

Seemingly liberated, tactically and emotionally, the Frenchman was hyperactive, as as many slide-tackles as skill. Around him, there was noise, appreciation, and Barcelona kept coming – although in the heat, the place would slow.

De Jong, Braithwaite, and Depay combined to carve out a chance that Alex Remiro had to block but the second didn’t arrive until the end of the half. De Jong made it with a deep cross to the far post, where Braithwaite thudded a header into the roof of the net.

That lead might have been extended early in the second half, Griezmann ruled offside when he had the ball in the net and Jordi Alba sent clean through, only to hit the post. When fans chanted Messi’s name again in the tenth minute of the second half, there were some whistles – not so much in repudiation of their departed deity as in response to the melancholy – and chants of “Barca! Barca!” instead, followed momentarily by “fuck PSG!”. Then came the goal.

Depay made it, and superbly. Alba continued it, zooming away. Braithwaite finished it, slamming the ball into the net. At the other end, Neto dived to push away Real Sociedad’s first shot on target and pessimism suddenly returned when Real Sociedad scored twice in three minutes, from Julen Lobete and Mikel Oyarzabal’s superb free-kick, but with time running out Braithwaite found Sergi Roberto to end an enjoyable, noisy first night. It had been fun, after all.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mainz, who had around a dozen players in Covid-19 quarantine, struck early to stun last season’s Bundesliga runners-up RB Leipzig 1-0 and spoil the first league match in charge for their new coach, Jesse Marsch.

The game had been in doubt after several Mainz players and coaching staff tested positive and 11 players and three staff were sent into isolation.

Mainz’s Moussa Niakhaté tapped in at the far post in the 13th minute, however, after a disastrous Leipzig attempt to clear the ball sent it into his path.

“It wasn’t how we were hoping to start the season,” said Marsch, the American who succeeded Julian Nagelsmann as Leipzig coach.

“Mainz sat back and defended after their goal and fought for every ball. That didn’t leave much space for us. It definitely wasn’t our best game, but we will continue to work. In total not our best day. It is OK that when we have the first tough result we are still a work in progress.”

Atlético Madrid began their title defence with a 2-1 win away against Celta Vigo on Sunday thanks to two strikes from the Argentinian forward Ángel Correa although the game ended with a mass brawl and a player from each side was sent off.

Luis Suárez began the game on the bench and Correa took full responsibility for the team’s attacking duties, firing Atlético ahead midway through the first half after a marauding run from Thomas Lemar.

Celta levelled in the 59th minute with a penalty from their captain, Iago Aspas, but Atlético soon restored their lead when Correa arrowed his finish into the bottom corner after a superb diagonal ball from Saúl Ñíguez

The game ended in chaos as the Celta captain, Hugo Mallo, and the Atlético defender Mario Hermoso were shown red cards in added time for clashing off the ball while players all over the pitch could be seen confronting each other. Atlético were fortunate not to concede an equaliser when Aspas rounded the keeper Jan Oblak but the striker somehow missed.

The Rayo Vallecano goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of Zinedine Zidane, was sent off in the 16th minute after fouling a Sevilla player, leading to a penalty kick and an eventual 3-0 defeat. Youssef En-Nesyri converted the penalty and the new signing Erik Lamela later scored twice.

Bordeaux fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Marseille on Sunday after Angers made it two wins from two with a 3-0 victory against Lyon.

Bordeaux’s match at Marseille got off to a worrying start when the visiting striker Samuel Kalu collapsed on the pitch in the early stages of the match at Stade Velodrome although the 23-year old Nigerian got up as medics rushed on. He briefly resumed playing before being substituted in the 14th minute, clearly looking groggy.

Marseille took a 2-0 lead into the break with goals from Cengiz Under and a solo effort by Dimitri Payet before the half-time substitute Timothee Tembele pulled one back and Remy Oudin, who replaced Kalu, levelled with a first-time shot in the 57th minute.

Marseille had the central defender Leonardo Balerdi sent off in the 89th minute for a studs-up challenge shortly after the home team’s winger Nemanja Radonjic had a goal ruled out for offside.

Goals from Randal Kolo Muani and Ludovic Blas gave Nantes a 2-0 victory against visiting Metz on Sunday.

Promoted Clermont Foot also made it two wins out of two as they beat Troyes 2-0 at home, Brest salvaged a last-gasp 1-1 draw against Rennes with a stoppage-time equaliser, while Reims and Montpellier shared the spoils in a thrilling 3-3 draw.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nuno Espírito Santo said he expects Harry Kane to “get ready and help the team” after the Tottenham striker sat out their victory against Manchester City.

Kane, strongly admired by the Premier League champions, was left out of the Spurs squad after returning to group training only on Friday and in his absence Son Heung-min struck a fine winner, leading Nuno to praise his killer instincts on an afternoon when Pep Guardiola bemoaned his side’s profligacy.

City are thought to be ready to pay €150m (£127m) for Kane if they believe Tottenham are open to a deal. Spurs maintain Kane is not for sale despite the striker’s desire to depart and have already turned down a £100m offer from City.

Kane trained at Spurs on Sunday morning and was reportedly in attendance at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the game. The Spurs manager said he expected the England captain to join his squad when ready.

“Harry is one of the best players in the world, so we are very lucky to have him,” Nuno said. “He has to get ready and help the team. We still have to go to Portugal [to play Pacos Ferreira in the Europa League on Thursday] and then we think about Wolves [on Sunday]. Harry worked this morning, is preparing himself and when he is ready he will join the group and help the team.”

Son arrowed in the only goal of the game after 55 minutes and City departed empty-handed despite 18 shots, four on target. Victory for Spurs brought another triumph for Nuno against Guardiola, with the former Wolves manager earning his third league victory against his City team, the joint-most of any coach. Asked whether City’s toothless display intensified the need to buy a striker, Guardiola replied: “We have the same people [squad] as last season. Sergio [Agüero] has gone – unfortunately, last season we could not use him much – and then came Jack [Grealish]. We are the same people. We won the Premier League and we made very good things. It is the same people as last season and we scored lots of goals. We arrive in the final third many times but we could not be clinical enough. We have now a long week to prepare for Norwich and hopefully the players can come back step by step.”

The Tottenham academy graduates Japhet Tanganga and Oliver Skipp, who spent last season on loan at Norwich, impressed defensively and, without Kane, Son starred centrally in attack for Spurs.

“Sonny and the talent that he has is amazing,” said Nuno. “I truly believe that he is versatile enough to play and develop the tasks in all of the positions up front. He is dynamic, he has speed and he knows the game. Sonny can find the gaps, the spaces and he is a killer. I believe he will do better in the future.”

Ilkay Gündogan sustained a shoulder injury late on, which Guardiola said City would assess on Monday. Only one club in Premier League history have lost their opening game of a season and gone on to win the title – Manchester United on three occasions (1992-93, 1995-96 and 2012‑13) – but Guardiola refused to be too downbeat and admitted Grealish’s full debut was a major positive.

“His personality, influence – he got three fouls in the first minute –and immediately he woke up and showed [his quality],” Guardiola said. “He is a player that is so dangerous close to the box. He made an incredible game and had an incredible debut. I congratulated him for the personality to play and to try and try until the end.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tammy Abraham has arrived in Italy to complete his move to Roma after the England striker agreed to join José Mourinho’s side from Chelsea for an initial €40m (£34m).

The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract worth around £3m per season after tax having fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Thomas Tuchel in January. Abraham made only 12 Premier League starts last season having been a regular under Frank Lampard but Chelsea have inserted a buy-back clause worth €80m that starts from June 2023.

Tuchel suggested last week that it would be Abraham’s decision whether to stay and battle for a starting place at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Romelu Lukaku for a club record £97.5m. But despite reported interest from Arsenal, he will now join former the Tottenham manager Mourinho in Serie A.

Meanwhile, academy graduate Trevoh Chalobah is determined to remain in Chelsea’s team after being left in tears by a stunning goal on his Premier League debut. The 22-year-old, who has been with the club since the age of eight, sealed Saturday’s resounding 3-0 success over Crystal Palace with a fine second-half strike from distance.

Chalobah was an eye-catching inclusion in Tuchel’s starting XI for the top-flight opener, retaining his place ahead of a host of international stars after impressing in the midweek Uefa Super Cup triumph over Villarreal.

“When I first started pre-season my aim was to impress the manager, day in, day out,” he told Chelsea’s website.

“He said I did well in the pre-season, but I was a bit surprised to start the Super Cup, but it shows my work has paid off. He has given me the opportunity and I have taken it with both hands. It’s important in football to stay consistent, stay grounded, stay hungry and always want more. It’s been a long-held dream to play for this club.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Legendary German striker Gerd Müller has died aged 75. The forward scored 68 goals in 62 appearances for West Germany, including the winning goal in the 1974 World Cup final


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The boos rang around Lord’s at 6.03pm on the fourth evening as Joe Root moved to bring on a fast bowler and take the second new ball, only for the umpires, Richard Illingworth and Michael Gough, to deem the light too poor and call stumps.

Eight lost overs made for a frustrating end to proceedings – not least with the floodlights in operation – but the match situation presents a fifth day that is both pregnant with possibilities and could well witness a bumper “People’s Monday” crowd if folks take advantage of tickets priced at £20 for adults and a tenner for kids.

With the forecast dry they will see India resume their second innings on 181 for six with the potentially electric Rishabh Pant at the crease on 14 but Ishant Sharma, the first of four candidates for No 11, alongside him. India lead by 154 runs and, whatever the final target, England face a tense run chase on a dozy pitch that still occasionally bursts into life.

This was the case during the final session of the fourth day. An afternoon of dead-batted defiance from Cheteshwar Pujara, 45 from 206 balls, and Ajinkya Rahane, 61 from 146, was followed by a three-wicket intervention that keeps England in the hunt to reward Root’s masterful 180 on the third day with a 1-0 series lead.

Mark Wood was the instigator here before a late tumble in the deep ended his day with a potential shoulder injury. Having earlier knocked over both openers, Wood had returned with the ragged old ball in the 76th over and got one to rear spitefully off the surface, catch Pujara’s glove and offer a simple catch to Root at slip.

Though Pujara had shut out some of the swirling questions over his place, delivering the type of innings on which recent series wins in Australia have been built, a dogged 50-over stand worth 100 runs had been broken. And when Moeen Ali followed this up with the wickets of Rahane and Ravindra Jadeja, suddenly the draw had drifted.

The Pujara-Rahane vigil had begun on the stroke of lunch, Sam Curran delivering his first contribution of the match after his wicketless first innings and a golden duck on day three. It was the scalp of Virat Kohli, no less, leaving the tourists 55 for three and only 28 runs ahead, with these two previously out-of-sorts batsmen forced to rebuild.

This was a bit of a throwback to the pair’s duel during the 2018 series too, Curran’s left-arm angle creating indecision with first a tight lbw shout – declined on height and leading to Root’s first burnt review – and Kohli then pushing out to a wide first ball of his following over and feathering to Jos Buttler behind the stumps.

As the peroxide-blond Curran hared off for a lap of the outfield a fine session for England’s support cast had been capped, Wood earlier taking the hard new Dukes ball off Ollie Robinson’s hands after only three overs – the Sussex man sent down only 10 in total – and striking twice before India had taken the lead.

Pace accounted for both incisions, too. The first-innings centurion KL Rahul fiddled at a 93.7mph ball in the channel for an edge behind on five and Rohit Sharma fell victim to a fine diving catch from Moeen at deep square-leg on 21 when looking to repeat the handsome six he had heaved into the Grand Stand three balls earlier.

India’s morning had begun with a flag ceremony at the team hotel to mark the country’s Independence Day and in the afternoon Rahane and Pujara matched this stirring show of national pride with a session of resolute defence and 49 runs. Bairstow’s drop off Rahane on 31, when a rare long-hop from Moeen was cut to point, was the one chance missed while Root’s desperation also led to a second failed review.

The England captain had tried plenty on a day when his banker, Jimmy Anderson, sent down 18 immaculate if unrewarded overs. Wood operated as the enforcer to various legside traps and Moeen fleetingly extracted some turn out of the footmarks Wood had created outside off-stump. Curran, despite being a left-armer, appears too light-footed to assist the off-spinner here but his own switches between over and around asked questions.

Chiefly this was two hours high on tension and low on drama for the spectators who had cheered Pujara’s first run from the 35th delivery he faced – even breaking out into chants of his name – and offered similar ironic ovations for landmarks such as double figures, 100 balls faced (when he was 11 not out) and then the big 200.

Needless to say, none of these matched the eruption that met Wood’s removal of Pujara in the evening, nor Moeen’s patience being rewarded when Rahane edged behind poking at an arm-ball, and the left-handed Jadeja was bowled neck and crop for three by a beauty that pitched on middle and off.

India had batted diligently without taking the game away and the question now, with Pant unbeaten but the tail long, is what England’s target will be on the final day. Having eschewed a chase of 273 in 75 overs against New Zealand here in June, it will be interesting to see if they actually go for it this time.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@England will aim to restrict India to a lead of less than 220 on the pivotal fifth day of the second Test, according to the all-rounder Moeen Ali. An enthralling Sunday at Lord’s ended with India on 181 for six, a lead of 154, and with uneven bounce and turn threatening to play an ever-greater role Moeen warned that anything above a modest target would be tough to chase.

“Anything over 220-230 is going to be quite difficult, but not impossible,” he said, whose two key wickets in the evening session helped to wrest back the initiative. “We’re all going to have to play well but, when it goes above 230-240, it gets a bit harder. The new ball for both teams tomorrow is crucial. It’s going to be a brilliant game.”

For England it has been an encouraging three days after India threatened to bat them out of the match on Thursday. Changing the momentum of games in their favour has been an achilles heel of the England men’s Test side in recent months and Moeen admitted that it was a trait that they needed to sustain.

“It’s been a great fightback after their openers played fantastically well in the first innings. But you’ve got to keep believing in Test cricket. That’s the most difficult thing. For us to get better as a team, we need to show more of that fight for longer periods.”

There was a slight injury concern towards the end of the day when Mark Wood was revealed to be feeling the effects of a minor shoulder problem. Wood had been the pick of England’s bowlers with three for 40 and Moeen said: “The way he bowled today was fantastic. He was telling me in the first innings that he doesn’t get the wickets he would like. But these things can happen. The wicket of Pujara, the way he banged it in with a soft ball on a dead wicket, was fantastic.”

With the game beautifully poised, tickets are still available for the fifth day from the Lord’s website, priced at £20 for adults and £10 for under-16s.
