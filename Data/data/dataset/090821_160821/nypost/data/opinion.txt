Why did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez run for Congress against a liberal Democrat, Joseph Crowley? Well, as she told CNN’s Dana Bash in an hour-long interview (!) last night on CNN, AOC lives in an imaginary world where people have to choose between eating and filling their prescriptions. (Has she been to the Bronx? The average woman weighs 191 pounds there.)

Never mind that for the last half-century, poor people have gotten their grub on the house (food stamps) and their meds taken care of (Medicaid). She believes her presence in Congress was the crucial difference-maker in these nonexistent people’s lives. Hence her nuking of Crowley, who … would have voted the same way she has voted on everything.

Now AOC apparently has her eye on another fellow Democrat who votes exactly the same way she would on everything: Chuck Schumer. He’s up for re-election next year. Would she run against him in the Democratic primary? Bash asked. AOC laughed heartily, threw out heaps of meaningless words (“I do not look at things and I do not set my course positionally … I make decisions based on what I think our people need or what our community needs … I really do not attempt to make these kinds of decisions out of a sense of personal ambition”) before wrapping up with, “So yeah, I don’t know, it’s no comment on it.”

Bash had previously noted that AOC Is “a target of scorn and criticism, even within her own party.” Well, if you don’t want that, maybe don’t threaten to knock out your own party’s lead senator?

AOC must be the only member of Congress whom CNN considers worthy of an entire hour in prime time. Don’t hold your breath waiting for an hour in prime time with Steny Hoyer. But then again, she’s the only one (apparently) who has inspired a sub-sub-sub-genre of TikTok teens lip-synching to one of her speeches while putting on lipstick.

Bash and AOC spent quite a bit of time on AOC’s makeup routine, which was refreshing, in a way; not for her the baggy Hillary Clinton pantsuits. She’s a woman and she doesn’t hide it. (For the interview she wore a black sheath dress that showed off her legs, although to be fair to Hillary Clinton, if Madame Cankles did that, it would probably cause sudden-onset mass blindness.)

As always with CNN programming, there was a lot of discussion of what’s on Fox News, and Bash said, “Let’s just talk turkey — how much do you think is that you are an attractive young woman?” Wait, that’s talking turkey? I thought AOC being an admitted socialist was talking turkey. Are her beliefs not fair game?

But, no, both Bash and AOC pretended Fox has a problem with pretty women. (Have they looked at Fox? Pretty women seem to do okay there.) AOC at first tried to sound like a Womxn’s Studies seminar leader (“I think that it’s really fascinating … it reveals a lot about the subconscious of the folks that are crafting these narratives … about women or about people of color”) but then dropped all the wouldn’t-this-be-an-interesting-thesis talk and basically accused Fox of trying to get her killed. She said that during the January 6 riot, when she was convinced she was going to be raped and murdered, she noted “how direct the through line is between right-wing targeting on TV and how much that is a driver of very real, serious threats.”

Apparently everything Fox says about her is just a matter of them not understanding all the far-left stuff she says. “I think the thing that is more impactful is not necessarily about being hated but about being misunderstood,” she said, adding that Fox “just churns out intentional misperception to generate that hate.” And what are those misperceptions? “Just thinking that I’m rash, unintelligent, and that I intend to do harm.”

Well, AOC is a fan of the world’s worst extant idea, socialism, and a proponent of crackpot Modern Monetary Theory, which essentially says that if the government wants to fund stuff, it should just print more money, without limit. Even fellow far-left economics major Paul Krugman has said this theory “seems just obviously indefensible,” notes that it would “lead to hyperinflation” (which gave us Nazism) and said its “claims that fundamental principles of logic lead to a worldview that only fools would fail to understand has a sort of eerie resemblance to John Galt’s speech in ‘Atlas Shrugged.’”

If you know Paul Krugman, that’s basically the sickest burn he could possibly lob in AOC’s general direction. It’s the Nobel laureate’s version of the boss from “The Devil Wears Prada” accusing you of wearing a sweater from the Gap.

One admission, though, I really enjoyed. “I think that femininity has a tremendous amount of power and influence,” Ocasio-Cortez noted. “I think that there is as much power in femininity as there is in masculinity.”

No kidding. Sorry about your dream of appearing on the cover of Vogue, Steny Hoyer. I thank the congresswoman for admitting that she leverages femininity to the max. Now can we stop pretending young women are helpless victims of The Patriarchy and are well aware of how to play the game to their own advantage?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A trillion dollars used to be a lot of money, even in Washington.

Now, a trillion-dollar spending bill is a trifle barely worth arguing over and the stuff of bipartisan consensus.

Oscar Wilde famously said that nothing succeeds like excess, but even he might blanch at the shameless profligacy that is America’s new normal. In their wisdom, Senate Republicans decided to help President Biden pass a portion of his blow-out fiscal agenda, a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that is a prelude to an even bigger, vastly more consequential $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.

The infrastructure bill itself is, as fiscal analyst Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute notes, “one of the largest non-emergency spending bills of the past 50 years.”

Republicans told themselves that only about half, $550 billion, is new spending, and that by going along they can take the heat off of Democratic moderates Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin who are being constantly pressured to ditch the filibuster. Perhaps, but there’s no doubt that the GOP has blessed, and lent a bipartisan imprimatur, to a portion of the president’s hoped-for historic spending spree.

Republicans will have much less influence, and perhaps none, on the next spate of spending. Under the reconciliation process, tax and spending bills bypass the filibuster in the Senate, so Democrats can pass whatever they want so long as they hold all 50 of their senators.

The sheer numbers here are jaw dropping. Including the $1.9 trillion so-called COVID relief bill from earlier this year, Biden wants to spend nearly $6 trillion in three measures passed within months of each other. In 2019, by point of comparison, the entire federal budget was $4.4 trillion.

The tide of new spending will add to already extraordinary levels of red ink. The White House projects that the US debt will reach 109.7 percent of GDP this year, higher than at the end of World War II, when we had understandably abandoned all fiscal restraint to win an existential struggle against two expansionistic totalitarian empires.

The Senate instructions for the reconciliation bill say that only half of it has to be paid for. Democrats will claim a dog’s breakfast of purported savings and painless revenue increases, but the bulk of the new dollars will have to come from a tax increase that easily could rank as one of the biggest ever.

The parameters of the reconciliation bill were crafted by the socialist chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Bernie Sanders, and it shows. The priorities read like crib notes from his old presidential campaigns. The bill would add new government programs for the young and the old, from universal pre-K, to tuition-free community college, to family and medical leave, to expansions of Obamacare and Medicare. It would make a big nod to the Green New Deal with a slew of new clean energy initiatives, including “smart agriculture” and “environmental justice,” and the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps, a climate alarmist homage to FDR.

It is a sign of the insane ambition of the Biden’s Democrats that they also hope to a include a sweeping amnesty for illegal immigrants in the bill, a measure that is sure to the struck by the Senate parliamentarian on procedural grounds.

Relatively moderate Democrats in the Senate and the House, where the party also has little margin for error, have grumbled about the size of the reconciliation bill. It will be up to them to decide whether the party steps back from the precipice, or goes all-in on Biden-Sanders fiscal radicalism.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One week after state Attorney General Tish James landed her bombshell report on Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s alleged sexual misconduct, New Yorkers learn that the state Assembly is going to try to get to passing articles of impeachment . . . by the end of August.

Figures: Speaker Carl Heastie greeted James’ report by saying it meant Cuomo “has lost the confidence of the Assembly Democratic majority” and “can no longer remain in office” — then gave the gov a week to submit his rebuttal to the Assembly Judiciary Committee.

And that committee’s chairman, Charles Lavine (D-LI), said Monday, “Later this month we will discuss the evidence of this investigation in an open and transparent manner.”

Not “later this week” but “later this month.” Any bets on them missing Heastie’s Aug. 31 deadline?

This, when lawmakers have more than enough to easily justify impeachment on the gov’s coverup of COVID-related nursing-home deaths (that James report landed in January), a coverup that plainly benefited him personally by enabling his $5 million book deal.

Perhaps the speaker just hopes Cuomo will quit first so Assembly members don’t have to do all the work of impeachment. Or is he giving the gov more time to shore up his defense?

Lawmakers have reportedly already rejected Team Cuomo feelers of a deal for no impeachment if the gov drops plans to seek a fourth term next year — but delay can only give the governor hope that such a bargain is still possible.

And more delays are likely: The state Senate is reportedly only now in talks to hire lawyers with impeachment experience to help navigate the process.

Meanwhile, basic work doesn’t get done: The executive branch’s flops on delivering federal rent relief is only the most flagrant failing as the gov devotes all his energies to holding onto office.

Heastie & Co. need to quit stalling on impeachment and move ahead at full speed. Cuomo needs to know that resignation now is his best hope of avoiding worse.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Stars’ salutations to arms

Killing citizens in New York, shooting innocents in Chicago, mass murders by firearms in California. And Hollywood keeps triggering movies that star guns.

“Django Unchained,” “Rambo,” “Brawl in Cell Block 99,” “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” Nice. “Evil Dead” was 2013. One massacre — which maybe got released on a Valentine’s Day — centered on killing missionaries. “Kill Bill” featured Uma Thurman beaten, shot, stabbed, accosted, buried alive. The p.r. team probably publicized this as a musical.

1961 Pacino arrested for carrying a concealed weapon . . . Tom Jones carries . . . Angelina Jolie, after playing Lara Croft in “Tomb Raider,” kept her character’s shooters . . . Word is Mel Gibson’s arsenal of revolvers and rifles have zip to do with reviewers of his films . . . Liz Hurley once went shooting at the Beverly Hills Gun Club.

Spielberg has a firearm collection. Learning to shoot from his father, he still pumps off rounds now and then at a private club . . . Ice-T plays a cop on “Law & Order.” Off TV he has the real equipment.

NRA spokesman Chuck Norris: “We don’t call 911” . . . Vince Vaughn supports carrying in public, not just keeping the “piece” — as pros call it — at home. Says it’s “resistance to a tyrannical state” . . . Bruce Willis, who doesn’t make films about singing and dancing, loves our Constitution’s Second Amendment . . . Tom Selleck, earning big as a law abider on “Magnum, P.I.,” was a one-time NRA board member . . . Brad Pitt of such lullabies as “Killing Them Softly”: “I feel better having a gun somewhere. I don’t feel safe if I don’t.”

And there’s accidentals. Like Kate Beckinsale in a no-pets rental and robbed by a night burglar in London’s Shepherd’s Bush section. When she was starting out, she heard a burglar. Thinking her landlady’s snooping to see if Kate housed animals, she feigned sleep. Her jewelry got stolen. “If I hadn’t worried about my cats, I’d have screamed from terror and probably got shot. There’d been break-ins in the area and people were hurt.”

Wyclef Jean, in martial arts since he’s a kid, supplemented early days driving a cab. “People tried things but I always had my gun with me. I just turned around and said, ‘Give me my money or I’ll kill you.’ ” He got his money.

Films sell kills & thrills

Early ’70s. Aidan Quinn, 15, a hippie with long hair and a fluorescent backpack, was nearly murdered by a street gang. A friendly driver on the expressway saved him. “Years later,” he says, “before my big break opposite Madonna in ‘Desperately Seeking Susan,’ my area was a war zone.”

Meanwhile, our entertainment industry rolls on. Nov. 29 comes the Gotham Awards for indies. Let’s have a 21-gun salute for our friendly movie industry: It’s psychological horror in “I Saw the Devil.” Forget any Viennese waltz in Marvel’s “Avengers: Infinity War.” How’s torture and terrifying nightmarish stuff in “The Suicide Squad.” “Cry Macho” has Clint Eastwood still punching and crunching. Chris Hemsworth stars in extremely violent/out-of-control/blood-pumping “Extraction.” Want “Total Recall” with Schwarzenegger? The governor’s total recall is not moon, spoon and June. It’s goon.

Charlize Theron leading assassins in “The Old Guard.” “Copshop” with Gerard Butler as a professional hit man. Brie Larson in backstabbing “Free Fire.” “Olympus Has Fallen” with then-unfallen Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett.

Let’s all meet up at the popcorn stand.

But may locals always know: When feeling hostile toward a burglar, be aware that he’s the last man in this town who still makes house calls.

Only in New York, kids, only in New York.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just released its latest climate report, and reactions from politicians and media pundits could not have been more predictable.

Fitting the apocalyptic narrative many have spun lately, the always-breathless Guardian literally summarized this scientific report as finding mankind “guilty as hell” of “climate crimes of humanity.” (Needless to say, the report never says any such things.)

UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the findings a “code red for humanity,” saying we can only avert catastrophe by acting in the next couple of months. Of course, the United Nations has a long history of claiming catastrophe is right around the corner: The first UN environment director claimed half a century ago that we had just 10 years left, and the then-head of the IPCC insisted in 2007 that we had just five years left.

In contrast to the hyperventilating media, the report is actually serious and sensible (and very, very long). It doesn’t surprise, since it is a summary of already-published studies, yet it reconfirms that global warming indeed is real and a problem.

But it also highlights how much one-sided thinking takes place in the climate conversation. Since the heat dome in June, there has been a lot of writing about more heat deaths. And the IPCC confirms that climate change indeed has increased heatwaves. However, the report equally firmly, if virtually unacknowledged, tells us that global warming means “the frequency and intensity of cold extremes have decreased.”

This matters because globally, many more people die from cold than from heat. A new study in the highly respected journal Lancet shows that about half a million people die from heat per year, but 4.5 million people die from cold.

Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres called the report a “code red for humanity.” John Thys/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo

As temperatures have increased over the past two decades, that has caused an extra 116,000 heat deaths each year. This, of course, fits the narrative and is what we have heard over and over again. But it turns out that because global warming has also reduced cold waves, we now see 283,000 fewer cold deaths.

You don’t hear this, but so far climate change saves 166,000 lives each year.

Likewise, we have heard a lot about flooding in Germany and elsewhere being caused by climate change. But the new UN report tells us it has “low confidence in the human influence on the changes in high river flows on the global scale” — and low confidence in attributing “changes in the probability or magnitude of flood events.” The report tells us that the evidence isn’t there to say floods are caused or driven by climate change.

It also mentions climate upsides like the fact that more CO₂ in the atmosphere has acted as a fertilizer and created a profound global greening of the planet. One NASA study found that over a period of 35 years, climate change has added an area of green equivalent to twice the size of the continental United States. But don’t expect to read about this in any of the breathless articles on climate impact.

The UN report only deals with the physical impact of climate change, but of course, much of what really matters is how humans handle this. Often the real problem of rising sea levels is converted into a catastrophe by arguing that nobody will adapt and everyone will drown or be displaced. Remember when news reports told us that rising seas will displace an astonishing 187 million people, potentially “drowning” entire cities like Miami in 80 years?

In reality, humans adapt, as Holland has shown. That’s why many models show that adaptation will reduce the number of flooded people 12,000-fold. As in the past, rising prosperity will continue to reduce flood impacts, and climate change will merely slow down this reduction slightly.

Ultimately, this is why the scare stories on climate impacts are vastly overblown and not supported by this new climate report. One of the clearest ways to see this is through climate economics. Because of climate change, the average person worldwide will be “only” 436 percent as well off in 2100 as they are now, instead of 450 percent.

This is not the apocalypse but a problem we should fix smartly.

Bjorn Lomborg’s latest book is “False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The $1 trillion “infrastructure” plan poised to pass the Senate is a bad bill; the only possible excuse its Republican backers have is the claim that it may help stop a truly terrible one — the $3.5 trillion social-spendapalooza Democrats will introduce next.

Contra the hype, the 2,700-page “bad” bill won’t pay for itself, and only a tenth of its spending ($110 billion) is for roads, bridges and other major infrastructure projects. (And even that includes plenty of waste, since as the White House notes most of it “will be subject to Davis-Bacon requirements,” meaning union-friendly prevailing-wage rules that vastly boost costs.)

Meanwhile, the bill drops plenty on Dem wish-list projects: $65 billion to expand broadband Internet access, including a new federal entitlement for low-income households, $73 billion for clean-energy transmission and $7.5 billion for an electric-vehicle-charging network.

The “pays for itself” claim is bunk: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says it’ll add $256 billion to the deficit over the next decade. (That rises to $350 billion when you add in $90 billion in new contract-authority spending, notes the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s Marc Goldwein.) Notably, it pretends that using leftover COVID-relief funds and unemployment benefits will save $263 billion; the CBO says it’d be more like $22 billion.

Worse: Once the Senate passes this mess, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says, it will then take up the $3.5 trillion package — a horror aiming to turn America into the welfare state of Bernie Sanders’ dreams. It would hike taxes on business and the wealthy to create multiple new entitlements: universal preschool, free community college, paid family and medical leave. It would expand Medicare benefits while reducing the program’s eligibility age, dump more cash on “green energy” subsidies — and even offer immigrants green cards, though the plan Schumer unveiled Monday doesn’t give details on exactly which immigrants would get them.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is backing the infrastructure bill, with the calculation that it will give a win to Dem moderates like Joe Manchin (D-WVa.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and encourage them to hold the line against the bigger bill. Schumer plans to ram through the larger package using reconciliation and can’t afford to lose one Democrat vote. But that’s a huge risk.

One nice wrinkle: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she won’t introduce the $1 trillion bill in the House unless the $3.5 trillion bill also passes the Senate. So pray first that the terrible bill dies — and that Pelosi then sticks to her guns.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@You’d think they would’ve learned the first time: Power-hungry teachers unions are once again setting the stage to make children and their families miserable. Though the president of the nation’s second-largest teachers union, Randi Weingarten, just signaled support for mandatory vaccinations for teachers, she won’t commit to keeping public schools open. Many teachers unions are also pushing to force all children in public schools to wear masks for another year.

The demands for mask mandates are unleashing renewed calls for school choice. Unions have put themselves into a Catch-22: They want to mandate masks but also want to keep students enrolled in schools they control.

Ten states have now required all public schools to force students to wear masks each day. All are run by Democratic governors, and most are controlled by some of the strongest teachers unions in the nation. Six — California, Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and New Jersey — are ranked in the top 10, according to Fordham Institute’s ranking of teachers union strength.

Meanwhile, eight states — including Florida, Texas and Arizona — have prohibited school districts from forcing kids to wear masks this year, and about one in four public-school enrollees resides in one of these states. Teachers unions oppose letting families choose whether to mask their children, and a growing number of districts in these states have announced they will mandate masks anyway.

Four districts in Florida are keeping mask mandates in place with the support of the state’s teachers union, despite Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order to allow families to decide. This is where the teachers unions stepped in it: Last Friday, the Florida Board of Education unanimously approved allowing all families to take their children’s education dollars elsewhere if they disagree with their public school’s masking rules.

Families will be able to access their children’s state-funded education dollars to attend a private school through the existing Hope Scholarship Program, which had a maximum value of $7,169 per student last year. And eligibility will work both ways — whether the family disagrees with a mask mandate or a ban.

Other states are already considering similar proposals. Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Matt Salmon just called for a special session to allow families to take their children’s education dollars elsewhere if they disagree with their public school’s mask mandate. Last week, Tennessee’s speaker of the House supported the idea, and Arkansas legislators filed a bill that would empower families to choose.

This would be a win-win scenario for families. The main problem with the school-masking debate is that most families are stuck in a one-size-fits-all system. Funding students directly would empower families to choose education providers that fit with their own preferences, risk assessments and values. This is the only way forward without forcing one-size-fits-all mandates or bans on other people’s children.

Families should be able to take their children’s education funds elsewhere regardless of their school’s masking decision. The mask rule is just one of many reasons a child’s residentially assigned government-run school might not be the right fit. But these proposals would still be a step in the right direction.

The school mask mandates have drive some families away from public schools. Education Images/Universal Image

These moves put the teachers unions in a dilemma. Teachers unions despise mask-mandate bans. But they despise anything that threatens their monopoly even more. It’s a lose-lose scenario for the unions: They don’t want students to be stuck in schools that do not force them to wear masks. But they don’t want to let them out either.

The unions overplayed their hand by showing their true colors and holding children’s educations hostage for over a year. Their selfish desires already fueled momentum for 17 states to enact or expand programs to fund students rather than school systems this year — and support for school choice is at an all-time high. If unions keep it up, they might just destroy their own empire.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Issue: Former President Barack Obama’s birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard over the weekend.

Former President Barack Obama’s birthday party was a hat trick of hypocrisy (“O, no, he didn’t!” Aug. 9).

First, there were no COVID protocols, even as the Democrats push for more restrictions on individuals and businesses.

Second, the pollution. Guests were flying in on private jets from across the globe — climate change be damned.

Third, think of the millions of dollars wasted just to stroke the former president’s ego. Millions of dollars that could have been used to build a park or buy laptops for underprivileged students or help the unemployed put food on their table. Totally disgraceful.

Peter Boeko, Manorville

Congratulations to Obama on his 60th birthday.

Only those in the Democratic Party are allowed to throw a virus-superspreader party and not be condemned. And if any of the guests later tests positive, I’m sure that information will not be forthcoming.

The 2022 and 2024 elections cannot come fast enough — and hopefully the voters will make sure that we once again have a two-party leadership. S. Kane

Brooklyn

We peasants wait daily to hear whether schools will open, whether and where we’ll again be forced to wear masks and whether we’ll be forced out of stores, restaurants and entertainment venues unless we show vax passports.

But the so-called “elites” attend an ex-president’s birthday party, which would be described, if one of us were able to host it, as a superspreader event.

Wake up: Write, phone, and e-mail the people who represent you in local, state and federal government.

When two sets of rules are so blatantly flaunted in our faces, one set for the privileged few and another for the teeming masses, it’s un-American and unacceptable. Tell them. Michelle Graham

Oceanside

Former President Obama celebrated his birthday at a Martha’s Vineyard estate with A-list guests, including many from the Hollywood elite.

So much for egalitarian and humbling demonstrations of sentiment to reflect the traumatic medical and economic disasters we’ve all suffered over this last year and a half.

Maybe some of the party favors at Obama’s celebration can be donated to others who are less fortunate, so they, too, can celebrate our retired president’s birthday.

Ray Starman

Albany

The Post recently pointed out the hypocrisy of Obama’s Martha’s Vineyard event.

I think the list of Obama perks — such as a large gathering during the pandemic, a $12 million mansion and a deal with Netflix — while we hear nothing from his camp as to what he is actually doing for the Afro-American community shows that his hypocrisy runs much deeper than just one celebratory birthday party.

Jackie Biaggi

Come on, man. Did anyone really think elitist Obama and his crew of elitist friends would really scale down a party?

It’s more proof that our elected officials and their wealthy friends are above us common Americans.

Joann Mirone

Old Greenwich, Conn.

One of the reasons COVID is spreading is because there are so many mixed messages.

On one hand, officials tell us that the virus is spreading. Yet Obama threw a big birthday party. Even if everyone who attended was vaccinated, many people who read about the party will think that the crisis is behind us.

Gov. Cuomo issued an executive order requiring all local governments to meet live in their municipal buildings. If the virus is spreading, shouldn’t elected officials hold remote meetings again — rather than create the impression that everything is safe?

I went to a function last week. A few hundred people attended; only three wore masks. If we want to win the war against COVID, we all need to be more careful.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pandemic journal: It’s Not Really About Masks

“Why are fully vaccinated people treated the same as the unvaccinated?” wonders Peter Van Buren at The American Conservative. E.g.: All air travelers must mask. “The answer is at the heart of whether public policy in America will shift and allow us to crawl back into our lives.” Because it “was never just a mask, it has always been a way of thinking.” Every state and business has different rules, a “leadership void” into which “enters superstition, pseudoscience, politics, voodoo, and most of all, fear.” The idea “You can’t be too careful” only works if “COVID restrictions have no secondary or tertiary effects.” But they do: “Economies have been devastated. Education has disappeared for large numbers of kids.” And with teen suicides up, we’re “killing children to save them.”

Media watch: Times in ‘Echo Chamber’ Again

Jackson Richman at Mediaite slams a New York Times “news” story that claims “both sides have much to lose” if the United States and Iran don’t restore the 2015 nuclear deal and notes getting it “back on track is a top goal” for President Biden, “in hopes of containing, once more, a nuclear program that has resumed with a vengeance three years after [President Donald] Trump withdrew from it.” Yet Iran’s nuke program “hasn’t ‘resumed with a vengeance,’ ” as the deal never stopped it: It’s continuing its “mission to produce a bomb.” Worse, the piece only quotes those who back the 2015 accord. “Reported articles should strive for objectivity, balance and . . . truth. The Times failed in each category, falling once again victim to the Iran echo chamber.”

Conservative: Superspreader Event That Wasn’t

Despite predictions it would surely be a coronavirus “superspreader,” more than 380,000 attended Chicago’s four-day Lollapalooza festival through Aug. 1, notes National Review’s Jim Geraghty. Eight days later, the city has seen “no surge in hospitalizations . . . and no surge in deaths.” “The upshot is that gatherings of vaccinated people and those with a recent negative COVID test are relatively safe,” though “many people feel as if they ought to denounce large gatherings.” Singer Demi Lovato even fumed about the Chicago fest . . . then went on stage Sunday “in Anaheim, Calif., before an audience of 9,000 people, at a concert festival that did not require proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID test.”

Politics beat: Dem Leaders Appease Squad

“If Biden Democrats run Washington, why are Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer (literally) embracing one of the party’s most outspoken advocates for defunding the police?” asks National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar of party leaders’ kow-tow to Squad member Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) on extending the national ban on evictions. Bush then “returned the favor by telling CBS News that she needs private security for her own safety but doesn’t support funding the police to protect less-advantaged Americans.” Moderates are routinely beating progressives from the Bush-AOC wing in primaries this year, so “the Squad’s message isn’t just fodder for Republicans; it’s out of sync with a majority of Democratic voters.” But leaders appease the radicals for fear “their own base won’t show up otherwise for next year’s midterm elections.”

Law prof: Joe’s Extraconstitutional ‘Leadership’

President Biden last year “told voters that the choice between him and Donald Trump was between the lawful and the lawless,” recalls law prof Jonathan Turley at The Hill. Yet now, “Biden is openly flouting the Constitution with a knowingly invalid extension of the eviction moratorium.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are claiming “breathtaking authority” in issuing the ban after the Supreme Court recently ruled only Congress could extend it. Biden himself “acknowledged the obvious” but went ahead anyway. The left “hailed” the prez for his “extraconstitutional commitment to social justice”; one liberal declared that “with one small action, Biden reveals himself as a better leader than Trump.” “That ‘small action’ was violating the Constitution — the document he swore to uphold.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It seems justice is finally going to be served to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. State Attorney General Letitia James’ report detailing Cuomo’s record as a serial sex-harasser delivered what may be the death blow to his time in office, forcing the desperate Love Gov to resign or suffer the indignity of impeachment.

Yes, it’s great to watch a man whose thuggish character was apparent throughout his tenure finally being called to account. But there’s something troubling about the way Cuomo is being hustled out of office: Obscured amid the details about his gross behavior and the way his aides and liberal feminist enablers tried to discredit the victims is the fact that Cuomo remains responsible for the deaths of perhaps thousands of elderly New Yorkers during the early months of the pandemic — and for his administration’s ongoing, illegal coverup of the numbers highlighting that fact.

Even as critics like Fox News meteorologist Janice Dean courageously spoke out about the issue, the governor spent most of 2020 as a national idol, venerated by the mainstream media for what President Joe Biden called the “gold standard” for coronavirus crisis management. The nation was riveted by his daily press briefings; he actually won a special Emmy for them.

It was not until James issued a report in January stating Cuomo underestimated the number of nursing-home deaths by as much as 50 percent that he began to feel any real heat. His problems worsened when an aide admitted his staff had deliberately hidden the true number of deaths to shield Team Cuomo from scrutiny. And, as The Post noted last week, the coverup hasn’t even ended yet, as the state continues to stall on releasing documents about his COVID record.

Does it matter which issue applies the coup de grâce, so long as the story ends with Cuomo being sent packing in disgrace?

It does. As awful as his treatment of the 11 accusers may be, the needless additional deaths of hundreds or thousands in nursing homes must be considered an even worse crime. If the governor is allowed to skate for his infamous March 25, 2020, order forcing nursing homes to take in COVID patients, and his subsequent coverup, then no one should pretend justice is being done. The families of those who died as a result of his arrogant stupidity and willful ignorance deserve closure for what happened to their loved ones.

But also consider: The mainstream press’ willingness throughout 2020 to give Cuomo a pass for his nursing-home massacre was no accident. That his former media cheering section and fellow Democrats are prepared to use the sexual-harassment charges as the sole reason for ousting him has a truly terrible stink.

Truth is, elevating Cuomo as a COVID hero was part of an effort to contrast his supposed brilliance with former President Donald Trump’s alleged incompetence. The deaths of tens of thousands of nursing-home patients in states like New York, New Jersey and Michigan as a result of decisions by Democratic governors helped create the sense of panic and establish the narrative that Trump was responsible for a national disaster.

Correcting that record, even after Trump’s defeat in November, is problematic for liberals since it not only makes clear that (despite the ex-prez’s terrible messaging about the virus and other missteps) what happened a year ago was not primarily Trump’s fault. Dems would love to shove Cuomo’s responsibility for this catastrophe down an Orwellian memory hole, even as he is himself dispatched, now that his survival no longer serves his party’s political interests.

Indeed, doing so lets the left continue to blame pandemic deaths on Republicans, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who might have made mistakes too but at least protected the elderly in his state’s nursing homes — as Cuomo should have.

New York mustn’t allow Cuomo to evade accountability for his nursing-home fiasco by focusing exclusively on the sexual-harassment charges. That’s a partisan strategy meant not only to bury an injustice but to help Democrats hold power — even as a despicable governor loses his grip on it.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fresh proof that New York’s “no bail” reforms aren’t about justice at all: A serial bank robber was released without bail on attempted robbery charges — only to go right back out and hit up two more banks.

Per cops and prosecutors, Jonathan Desir, 26, was picked up Tuesday after cops said he walked into a Midtown TD Bank on Ninth Avenue and handed the teller a note reading “Give me $50,000” and “Hurry up.” But cue the bail-reform revolving door.

On Wednesday, he was back at it, walking into another Midtown TD Bank on Eighth Avenue and slipping the teller another note demanding $50,000. He made off with just $1,100, so 10 minutes later he strode into a Citibank two blocks away and tried again, getting arrested after the teller set off a silent alarm.

This time, he got put away, on heavier charges of third-degree robbery and fourth-degree grand larceny as well as a new third-degree attempted robbery charge. Sent to Rikers, he’s being held on $25,000 cash bail or a $50,000 bond.

A criminal-justice system running on sane rules wouldn’t give such perps the chance for do-overs. Instead, as Seth Barron noted recently in these pages, the city’s crime rate is soaring while the incarcerated population has sunk to its lowest level since 1946.

How much more madness will it take before the Legislature rethinks the law that hands out get-out-of-jail-free cards to all but a handful of criminals?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For someone who prides himself on optics, Barack Obama just gave us quite an ugly spectacle.

As the rest of America struggles with uncertain employment status and school reopenings, shifting mask mandates, anxiety over vaccinations and variants, the health of the economy and the citizenry at large, Obama had to go and throw himself a huge, epic, three-day birthday bash on Martha’s Vineyard.

You would think a former president — one who clearly considers himself more intelligent and sensitive than most — would exercise some restraint.

Or at least understand that this was a supremely bad look.

Here were a host of left-leaning eco-warrior celebs, all Obama’s “close friends,” of course, descending on an already understaffed and emotionally depleted Vineyard.

“His birthday party is insane,” one of Obama’s caterers told The Post last week. “What is he thinking?”

Clearly, Obama thought to do whatever he damn well pleased — even after such backlash caused him to effectively cancel his party.

“This outdoor event was planned months ago in accordance with all public health guidelines and with COVID safeguards in place,” Obama spokesperson Hannah Hankins told the press last week. “Due to the new spread of the delta variant over the past week, the President and Mrs. Obama have decided to significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends.”

That, we now know, was a lie.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests, all free to go unmasked, while their 200 servers were reportedly forced to mask up. The tiny island’s residents, meanwhile, endured “a s—t-show” of traffic and sudden road closures enforced by the Secret Service.

Is there a more disgusting display of elitist “Rules for thee, not for me” than this?

Famously close friend David Axelrod — who sat for a hagiographic, three-part HBO Obama doc that premiered last week, who just called Obama an “apostle of hope” in the Washington Post, and the adviser most responsible for getting Obama elected in the first place — was, according to the New York Times, cut from the guest list.

Yes, David Axelrod was uninvited at the last minute so “close friends” such as H.E.R., former “Real Housewife of Atlanta” Kim Fields, Bradley Cooper and Stephen Colbert — to name but a few — could attend.

That is some cold stuff.

The uninvited, according to the Times, were “abruptly cut.” It tells you just where the Obamas’ post-presidential priorities are: Hollywood, podcasts, Netflix deals, and socializing with celebrities.

Musician H.E.R. was one of the guests at former President Barack Obama’s 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard. Instagram

There’s not much daylight here between the Obamas and the Markles. Who would have thought?

Consider that Jackie O, the most famous woman of her era, lived a very low-profile life on the Vineyard. Sure, she had an estate, but she did not move about ostentatiously.

Throw a lavish party filled with hundreds of A-listers while America remained gripped by a pandemic?

Jackie would never.

Barack, however, was playing 18 holes with Don Cheadle and getting serenaded by Alicia Keys. He was working it out on the dance floor with Erykah Badu while his guests drank top-shelf liquor and smoked cigars and dined from a menu curated by Questlove.

And the mainstream media cheers this on!

“Even Scaled Back, Barack Obama’s Birthday Bash is the Event of the Season,” said Vanity Fair.

“Danced All Night,” People mag said of Obama. “He Never Stopped Smiling.”

No wonder the vaccine is still politicized. No wonder there remains two Americas, despite Obama’s constant, self-aggrandizing promises to unite us.

On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci went on “Meet the Press” to warn that the Sturgis, SD, motorcycle rally (code for “MAGA crowd”) might be a superspreader event.

Then on Monday, a New York Times reporter went on CNN and quoted a Vineyard resident as saying the Obamas were fine because they invited “a sophisticated, vaccinated crowd.”

Nancy Pelosi said she didn’t go to former President Barack Obama’s birthday because she had “other parties” to go to. Maciel-Ngre-GLH / BACKGRID

That says it all. Even Twitter erupted.

“Of course viruses don’t attack sophisticated people, Muffy!” said one.

Perhaps Obama should have winnowed his list down to his close campaign strategists and loyal staffers — those who, according to the Times, were heartbroken to be thrown over for the likes of Chrissy Teigen, famous for little more than her marriage and her cyber-bullying.

These longtime loyalists, the Times said, “generally credit themselves with helping create the Obama legacy that has allowed the former president to settle in so comfortably with the A-list crowd” and all of them had “been looking forward to the reunion after an isolated year.”

Let them eat cake, indeed.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He’s “Wild N’ Out” with a bunch of women — and here’s why.

For Nick Cannon, having multiple babies with multiple girlfriends is the father of seven’s way of rebelling against the “Eurocentric” institution of marriage.

“That’s a Eurocentric concept … the idea that you’re supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life,” Cannon, 40, explained Monday on Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club.”

“The idea that a man should have one woman,” the host of “The Masked Singer” continued. “We shouldn’t have anything. I have no ownership over this person.”

Cannon — who welcomed his seventh child, the fourth within a year’s time, in June — said that fathering so many kids is not a decision he gets to make.

“Those women, and all women, are the ones that open themselves up and say, ‘I would like to allow this man into my world and I will birth this child,’ ” the California native insisted. “It ain’t my decision. I’m just following suit.”

The former Nickelodeon star welcomed 10-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with ex-wife and megastar Mariah Carey, 51, in 2011.

He has two children — son Golden, 4, and 8-month-old daughter Powerful Queen Cannon — with Miss Guam 2014 pageant winner Brittany Bell, 33.

On June 14, Cannon welcomed twin boys Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir with DJ Abby De La Rosa, 29.

Then, just nine days later, on June 23, he became the father of his fifth son, Zen, with model Alyssa Scott.

And now, Cannon says his aversion to monogamy is rooted in the European history of marriage.

“If we’re really talking about how we co-exist and how we populate, it’s about what exchange can we create together,” he said.

“I understand the institution of marriage, but if we go back to what that was about … [it] was to classify property,” he added, referring to the dowry system — the practice of trading a woman into marriage in exchange for money or property that was popularized in England between the 12th and 18th centuries.

The “Wild N’ Out” star said he doesn’t want “ownership” of any of the mothers of his children. The Breakfast Club

“One father gave another man his daughter for land,” Cannon said. “So when you really get to that concept, it’s like, we gotta change this up.”

Thus, his parade of paramours prevails.

“I don’t want ownership over anybody,” the “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” star said. “I don’t have ownership over any of the mothers. We create families in the sense that we created a beautiful entity.”

But it’s unclear whether the leading ladies of his love life are happy about Cannon’s staunch commitment to non-commitment.

“Every woman in my life that I deal with or [have] dealt with … they know how I feel,” he said.

“And it usually is a concept like, I’m not going around like, ‘Who am I gonna impregnate next?’ Nah,” Cannon continued.

“When you really look at how the family infrastructure is designed, the woman is the one that always leads and makes decisions,” he said.

Bell with her and Cannon’s son, Golden, at the park. Instagram

“Everyone is like, ‘How is he convincing these women?’ … But I’m not. I’m the one in the scenario who has to follow suit on what they decide.”

Cannon, who admittedly grew up in an “unorthodox” home in which both of his parents were absent at times, said he’s extremely active in all of his children’s lives.

“For every single one of my kids, I’m at every basketball game, I’m at every martial arts practice,” he said.

“People don’t understand how I do it, but my children are my priority.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo always painted himself as New York’s rock — the one guy who could keep the state together, the man holding off the lunacy of the far left, the leader who got us through the depths of COVID. It was largely bunk.

Yes, Cuomo in his first two years put New York on a steadier financial footing, mainly by junking the insane spending plans set out by his predecessors and instituting a cap on property-tax growth in most of the state. And he stepped on Mayor Bill de Blasio’s efforts to kneecap the city’s charter schools and to slap millionaires with yet another tax.

Yet ever since, he’s only led the retreat against the left. By his third term, the radicals had won an utter rout, as he signed on to criminal-justice “reforms” that fueled a monstrous rise in violent crime. New Yorkers are now paying the price with their lives.

He also jettisoned responsible budgeting, letting overall outlays grow 55 percent since taking office (more than twice inflation). Yes, some of that came from Washington (especially during the pandemic), but this year he let state-funded spending grow nearly 8 percent, socking taxpayers with $4 billion in new taxes, despite a $12.5 billion federal handout.

That ludicrous tax hike alone will accelerate New Yorkers’ already alarming rush to other states for years.

Along the way, he also supercharged his fundraising, in part by merchandizing state spending to benefit donors: He shelled out more than $1 billion on his disastrous SolarCity plant, now owned by Tesla (a k a the Buffalo Billion) — and more still on other AndyLand fiascos (e.g., his failed plan for moviemaking in Syracuse) — paving the way for corruption and other assorted debacles: A number of his allies involved in these schemes, including top aide Joe Percoco, wound up convicted of federal crimes.

When a corruption-fighting panel, the Moreland Commission, threatened to probe him, he closed it down.

His attacks on de Blasio came at the city’s expense. His suck-up to unions — pushing through a $15 statewide minimum wage, for example — hit businesses (and entry-level) workers hard.

His fracking ban deprived ordinary New Yorkers, especially those in the Southern Tier, of a vast economic hope.

He also managed to bungle the Amazon deal, another catalyst for jobs and business.

And he gave up on fighting for charters rather than face down the teacher-union-owned Legislature.

As for COVID: Yes, many found his press conferences reassuring. But his actual leadership — his pointless feuding with de Blasio, deadly kowtowing to hospital lobbyists with his nursing-home order, wildly irresponsible sowing of doubt about the vaccines to score points with Trump-haters — made everything worse.

No one will ever know exactly how many seniors died thanks to his order for nursing homes to accept COVID-infected patients, but some estimates put the figure at more than 1,000. Compounding that horror was his coverup of the numbers, a key part of the Legislature’s impeachment probe.

And all during the COVID nightmare, he actually had the cojones to write a book on “leadership,” earning him a sweet $5.1 million. Where’d he find the time? He used staff help, a clear theft of state resources — and another part of the impeachment probe.

All the while, he was out threatening to destroy those, like Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens), who opposed him — just as he had his team attack the women whose accusations have now brought him down.

It was those devastating sexual-harassment charges, confirmed by state Attorney General Letitia James last week, that broke the camel’s back. He still denies virtually all the allegations of inappropriate behavior, blaming them in his resignation speech on “a flawed political process” (his routine cop-out). But they’re just too numerous and outrageous — touching an aide’s breast and grabbing her behind! — to dismiss.

Cuomo’s denials are understandable: He’s facing criminal charges — and must also face his daughters and his mom. But given the harm he’s done not just to these women but to the state during his 11 years in office, his resignation marks a huge win for New York.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Faced with universal demands for him to step down and clearly unable to govern, Gov. Andrew Cuomo did the only sane thing: He tendered his resignation. Good riddance. Now Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will take over at a key moment for the state.

She’s largely unknown and untested — but good signs abound: The Buffalo native has called herself “an independent Democrat” and got her start in politics as an aide to Rep. John LaFalce and the late, great Sen. Pat Moynihan, both independent-minded liberals.

When then-Lt. Gov. David Paterson took over in 2008 after a prostitution scandal forced out Gov. Eliot Spitzer, he’d served in the state Senate for decades, including as minority leader. Hochul has years in local government, a term in Congress and seven years as Cuomo’s rarely consulted LG. (Ironically, she led the gov’s “Enough is Enough” sexual-assault-prevention initiative.)

“As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State’s 57th Governor,” she tweeted Tuesday. She’s also visited all 62 of the state’s counties every year as LG.

Yet she will preside over a state facing soaring crime and a post-COVID economy struggling to recover, with a disastrous rent-relief program and a leadership void at key agencies such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Enormous fiscal challenges lie just down the road, and next year’s race for governor will only add complexity.

Worst, she must face down radicalized lawmakers whose agenda — yet more anti-cop measures, raising taxes further and yet more irresponsible state spending and bank-busting programs like single-payer health care — would be disastrous.

Her first order of business, of course: Clean house at the Capitol’s Second Floor, removing Cuomo loyalists, especially those linked to his numerous scandals. But she’ll also need to assemble her own trusted team all across state government.

Paterson managed to see the state through the rocky recovery from the 2008 recession; Hochul may face an even heavier lift. New Yorkers should wish her well.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s rather confused masking advice is thinly supported by science. And by now, everyone who wants a COVID jab can get one. Yet elite shaming of ordinary people keeps ratcheting up. It’s, well, shameful.

Law professor Ann Althouse recently reproduced two memes she saw on Facebook. One read: “It took ‘click it or ticket’ to get people to wear a seatbelt. I wonder if ‘mask it or casket’ might work.” The other said: “It’s a face mask, not a Star of David or pink triangle, you whiny, privileged dolt. You’re not being shoved into a cattle car and taken to camp. You’re going to Walmart for twinkies and Diet Coke. Grow up.”

They’re both poor efforts at persuasion, of course: Generally, calling people names, threatening them and saying they’re stupid are ineffective ways of winning them over.

Yet we’re seeing more and more of this sort of thing. (And note the casual classism of invoking Walmart, Twinkies and Diet Coke. Poor white people aren’t, in fact, the least-vaccinated group — that would actually be blacks and Hispanics — but bashing working-class whites is considered perfectly decent, almost mandatory.)

Maybe the mask fanatics are just poor persuaders. But it seems just as likely that they are engaging in poor persuasion because they aren’t trying to persuade.

As with so much that goes on in today’s society, and especially on social media, this sort of thing isn’t aimed at convincing those who disagree, but rather at garnering high-fives from people who agree and, ultimately, creating an ideological veneer for unquestioned elite rule.

Much of it is aimed at elites and would-be elites themselves. Lots of people want to feel that they’re important, and that they make a bigger impact on the world than the average person. (Spoiler: On average, they don’t). And lots of people — especially a particular sort of upper-middle-class person who thinks of himself as educated — want to believe that they’re smarter than most other people.

Well, making a big impact on the world is hard. It generally requires special gifts and a lot of very hard work. Elon Musk makes a big impact on the world, but most people don’t want to work as hard as Musk.

Feeling like you’re making a big impact on the world is much easier. Posit some sort of social threat — it doesn’t really matter what it is, from climate change to the coronavirus — and then speak against it. Voila! Suddenly you’re doing something important. Or more accurately, suddenly you feel like you’re doing something important.

Likewise, being smarter than other people is hard, because it requires you to actually be smarter than other people. Being smarter and more knowledgeable than other people is harder still, since you have to combine both raw intelligence and actual learning, which takes effort.

But you can feel smarter than other people by simply reciting views you and your crowd have decided are smart. It doesn’t matter if you’re just parroting things you don’t actually understand: If you’re saying smart things, then you, too, must be smart. Or at least, you can feel that way. (Spoiler: The easier it is to convince yourself that parroting other people’s views without understanding them makes you smart, the less smart you probably are.)

At any rate, all the blaming and shaming on social media and elsewhere is less about persuasion than about the emotional needs of those doing the blaming and shaming. It makes them feel better about themselves, and in today’s society, feeling better about oneself is the greatest of achievements. It’s helpful if the feeling suffices to legitimate the right of laptop-class “meritocrats” to bully the oiks on things like masks and lockdowns — when their actual performance casts serious doubts on their merits.

It’s also easy for politicians to capitalize on. They thrive on division, and on passions that distract people from what they’re actually doing. But if you’re making the country worse to feel good about yourself, maybe you’re not such a good person after all. And if you’re falling for politicians’ tricks, maybe you’re not as smart as you think.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Watching Andrew Cuomo’s resignation speech Tuesday, it was impossible not to wonder what his father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, would have thought.

Mario was difficult and argumentative but smart and honorable. He was elected three times before losing in 1994 to George Pataki.

Mario died on New Year’s Day in 2015, as Andrew was being inaugurated for his second term in the same office. Now the family business comes to a crashing end because the second generation could not match the integrity of the first.

In his eulogy for his father, Andrew said Mario “was humbled to be in public service and had disdain for those who demeaned it, with scandals or corruption, or cheap public relation stunts.”

Yet here is that same son, demeaning public service with scandals and corruption and one dirty trick after another.

Later in the eulogy, Andrew said, “I loved winning the Governorship more for him than for myself. It was redemption for my father. Cuomo was elected governor — the first name was not all that relevant.”

Ah, it turns out the first name is not only relevant, it makes all the difference in the world. This apple fell very, very far from the tree.

Andrew Cuomo had his father’s pile-driving voice and an even greater ambition. He wanted to be president, but threw in the towel rather than face certain impeachment, falling short of his father’s record in office by 16 months.

He fancied himself a tough street fighter and brilliant tactician, but in the end surrendered like Richard Nixon. Cuomo, in an echo of the disgraced former president, found himself alone, abandoned even by his own party. He resigned rather than become the first governor to be impeached, convicted and removed in more than a century.

Cuomo’s comeuppance was inevitable because his high ambition was not matched by high character. Because character is indeed fate, Cuomo slinks out of Albany, having disgraced his family name.

Even in quitting, he couldn’t be honest. Rather than acknowledge he has zero allies and his public support is collapsing, he tried to paint himself as too good, too principled for the heated battle of the moment.

His ostensible ode to the people of New York in fighting COVID was an undisguised salute to himself. As such, he rubbed more salt into the wounds of the grieving families who lost loved ones because of his catastrophic policy of forcing infected patients into nursing homes. His posture of triumph reflects only heartlessness.

His plan to stay two more weeks is another reflection of his hollow vanity — and suspicious. Each minute he occupies the office is another stain on New York. Hasn’t he done enough?

There is no reason to believe his habit of abusing power to settle scores has been quenched. Also, the possibility he would destroy evidence in the continuing criminal investigations cannot be discounted.

And there is no reason taxpayers should be stuck for another minute with legal bills to defend him and the corrupt goons who protected him. Let him and them hire their own lawyers.

Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, his successor, doesn’t need his help. She and legislative leaders should jointly demand he leave immediately and freeze him out of any transition discussions.

From a distance, Cuomo’s collapse may be difficult to understand. How could Andrew, who was not without political talent, admire his father so much and then conduct himself as he did?

The answer is as old as the hills and simple to those who know him. A chip on his shoulder, perhaps an inferiority complex, turned into a hunger for power and eventually overwhelmed any other desire. The more power he got, the more he needed, and that need consumed him.

Unlike his honorable father, Gov. Andrew Cuomo grew more corrupt in his time at Albany. AP

The groping and sexual harassment of female staffers is one manifestation. He would show them they belonged to him. And while the courage of those women to come forward is what rightfully brought him down, the truth is that his administration lived on the edge for its entire existence. Other, earlier incidents might well have been the death knell.

Scandals were not just occasional interruptions. They were a running theme of his tenure.

A Ronan Farrow piece in the New Yorker online fills in gaps about an earlier close escape. When Preet Bharara was the Manhattan US attorney during the Obama administration, he probed why Cuomo shut down the Moreland Commission, an investigative body Cuomo appointed to root out corruption.

I had urged Cuomo to appoint the panel, and when he eventually did, asked if he was serious because I no longer trusted him. I had known him for nearly 30 years, but he increasingly lied to me, even in off-the-record conversations.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo was reportedly “ranting and raving” at then Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett after he closed the Moreland Commission in 2014. Getty Images for SXSW

Naturally, he lied again, saying he was “as serious as a heart attack” about cleaning up Albany with the commission.

But when the probers started sending subpoenas to some of his supporters, the governor throttled its leaders and soon disbanded it. And when Bharara started digging into what Cuomo was hiding, Cuomo called the Obama White House and told Valerie Jarrett that Bharara had to be stopped, Farrow reports.

The whole incident was typical of Cuomo. His talk of fighting corruption was a public relations tool that matched public demand, but he didn’t want the panel to go after all corruption, only that of his enemies and rivals.

Bharara’s team also probed Cuomo later in a separate case and while the governor was not charged, one of his closest aides, Joseph Percoco, was convicted of taking bribes from state contractors.

In his eulogy for Mario, Andrew had mentioned Percoco, calling him “my father’s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most.”

Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul has a tremendous task of cleaning up Andrew Cuomo’s mess and getting Albany back on track. Lev Radin/Pacific Press/Shutters

But when Percoco was busted, Cuomo played Sgt. Schultz and claimed to know nothing, nothing.

Not long after Mario’s death, Andrew admitted he had picked up a quirky new habit.

“Since he died, when I have a special or difficult day, I wear my father’s shoes: literally!” Cuomo wrote in his book on COVID.

He told Howard Stern he still felt a void from his father’s absence and was striving to be more like him, adding: “Putting on the shoes is almost my conscious affirmative of the void. In other words, I’m saying, yes, I feel that void and now he’s gone and I feel that void even more, and I’m aware of it. And I’m so aware of it that when I need to fill the void, I literally put on his shoes.”

He claimed he and Mario wore the same size, but that, too, must have been a lie.

There’s no way Andrew Cuomo could ever fill his father’s shoes.

Stage gets props



I DON’T understand this but I’m reporting it. Dori Berinstein and Sammi Cannold were in Korea. Why, not sure. They told me: “In pandemic’s darkest days Seoul kept alive nine major stage musicals.” So? “So in three months we made a documentary about saving theater over 500 dark days. We were our own crew.”

Monday at NYC’s Majestic Theatre, home of “Phantom,” longest running show in B’way history, they showed this doc, “The Show Must Go On.” And 1,500 people — shorts, flip-flops, bra straps, sandals, some unmasked — crowded in to scrunch against one another to see it. A tribute to Broadway. Or Korea.

Speaking of stagecraft, Thursday, Sept. 2, 8 p.m., Walter Kerr Theatre, “Hadestown” reopens. Following the performance, West 48th will host a carnival of dancing in the street.

An auc to grind



Auctioning today at Gotta Have Rock and Roll is Snoop Dogg’s Braun coffee grinder. The thing’s from August 1999. Snoop and Ivy Supersonic were at the Millennium Hotel shooting her hats. He slipped out and left what she thought was his coffee accouterment on the desk. She took it for him. Someone sniffed: “That’s Snoop’s marijuana grinder.” So, obviously, coffee beans and pot leaves share similarities — other than medicinal effects.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Andrew Cuomo is gone, resigning over his sex-abuse scandal. But will his departure lead to a reassessment of his draconian and irrational COVID-19 policies from a press that fawned over his performance? Don’t count on it.

The media coverage revealed that liberal America prefers the authoritarian style Cuomo presented. He knew better and wasn’t afraid to use his position to force others to comply. And the media ate it up. People who questioned the need for and effectiveness of restrictions and whether the government had authority to impose them were derided as right-wing reactionaries.

A New York Times headline blared: “Andrew Cuomo Is the Control Freak We Need Right Now.” Forbes praised Cuomo’s news conferences as “assertive and reassuring, calming and urgent” and gushed that Cuomo was “a truly inspiring leader who brings out the best in us.” The Washington Post, while acknowledging that Cuomo was and remains a power hungry “bully,” praised his assertive, supposedly truthful communications style. Rolling Stone’s cover approving proclaimed, “Andrew Cuomo Takes Charge.”

In what now seems eerily prescient and embarrassing, other papers reported on Cuomo’s sex appeal to women and a YouTuber coined the phrase “Cuomosexual.” Cuomo won a lucrative book contract and an Emmy.

Yet most of the mainstream media rarely questioned the substance of Cuomo’s policies. They barely raised a peep over his disastrous order that from March 25 to May 10, 2020, compelled nursing homes to readmit hospitalized COVID-19 patients without checking if they still had active infection. In fact, the facilities were instructed that they could not deny admission “based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19” and were “prohibited” from testing prospective admissions for COVID-19.

The Cuomo administration intentionally hid the cost of this blunder by falsifying Department of Health reports and stonewalling Freedom of Information Law requests for the number of nursing-home admissions and deaths that resulted from the policy for over eight months.

In a leaked recording from Feb. 10, 2021, former Cuomo consigliore Melissa DeRosa admitted to Democratic lawmakers that the administration hid the true numbers of nursing-home deaths for political reasons.

The true numbers only came out after a Jan. 28, 2021, report from state Attorney General Letitia James — whose recent sexual-harassment report led to Cuomo’s resignation — found that Cuomo’s DOH had underreported in-facility deaths by as much as 19 percent, and undercounted nursing-facility deaths by 50 percent.

Shortly afterward, in response to a court order to comply with FOIL requests, the DOH revealed that more than 9,000 COVID-19 patients had been admitted to nursing facilities pursuant to its March 25 directive — 43 percent higher than previously disclosed — and that about 15,000 nursing-home, assisted-living and other adult-care facility patients had died of Covid-19 — a 63 percent increase over previous DOH reports.

The press also rarely questioned Cuomo’s arbitrary, ever-changing policies that imposed some of the strictest reopening requirements in the country. Indeed, the press celebrated stay-at-home and business-closure orders that remained in place far longer than in other states.

Yet Empire state COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population (excluding New York City) are no lower that per-capita deaths in Florida and Texas, two states that Cuomo relentlessly criticized for lax lockdown policies, and New York City deaths are more than twice as high. Cuomo’s draconian policies destroyed small businesses statewide and wiped out New York City restaurants.

Throughout the pandemic, Cuo­mo, with the press’ enthusiastic endorsement, repeatedly criticized conservative governors and former President Donald Trump for their pandemic responses. But both he and the press were remarkably uncurious about Cuomo’s own failings. Cuomo was just doing what he has always done and what we now know he did to many women — acting like a tough guy who used intimidation and fear to get his way. But the press has no excuse.

At National Review, Charles C.W. Cooke reflects that MSNBC’s Dean Obeidallah has declared “Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is ‘more dangerous than Trump.’ ” For all the claims that Donald Trump was uniquely evil, such assertions were “inevitable from the moment Trump lost the 2020 presidential election.” Indeed, voters have heard “the same scary things about almost every Republican candidate since Eisenhower.” And no matter that Trump and DeSantis “could scarcely be less alike if they tried.” The nonsense charge is just “a signal that the focus of American politics has shifted,” and it’s time “for a swapping out of the villains.”

Pandemic journal: The Zero-COVID Delusion

“The notion that we could literally stop the spread of COVID by locking down and vaccinating it out of existence was always a fantasy,” observes Kat Rosenfield at Spectator World: Smallpox is the only human disease ever eradicated. “Every other virus, from Ebola to influenza to the ­bubonic plague, still exists among us; we’ve just learned to live with them and to control them as best we can.” But “all those months of being told to mask up, stay home and keep our distance have instilled in a fearful population the seductive illusion of control. . . . Suddenly, the only moral position is to do everything within your power to avoid illness, no matter how extreme.” Worse: “The flip-side” of the zero-COVID delusion is “the specter of the noncompliant villain who’s keeping us from getting there. Those who dissent . . . are ‘literally killing’ people.” This is “injecting a toxic, corrosive element into the heart of the social contract.”

Libertarian: Yes, COVID Is 99 Percent Survivable

“A viral post” claiming COVID is 99 percent survivable for most age groups is “likely true,” notes Robby Soave at Reason, yet social media flagged it as “misinformation,” and PolitiFact rated it “false.” In fact, “expert consensus” places “the death rate at below 1 percent” for most people. The post erred in comparing the vaccine’s efficacy rate, 94 percent, to the COVID survivability rate; vaccines don’t compete with natural immunity but “render COVID-19 even more mild and even more survivable.” Yet PolitiFact rated as false the very idea that COVID has a low ­infection fatality rate for most people. People can and should “improve their odds” by getting vaccinated — but “we don’t need to live in fear.”

From the right: Defund Police Means Feudalism

“When the law breaks down, and anarchy and violence reign, only the wealthy, powerful and corrupt thrive,” declares Jarrett Stepman at The National Interest. Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) inadvertently underscored this reality in a recent interview explaining why she needed $70,000 in private security — even as she championed #DefundPolice. “Bush has every right to defend herself if she feels threatened, but don’t regular people have that right, too? What about those who aren’t members of Congress and can’t go around with an armed detail of private security?” Defunding police “won’t further social justice”; it’ll produce “a kind of neo-feudalism, where the rich and powerful can evade its consequences while everyone else suffers.”

Foreign desk: Iran Nukes Hopes of a Deal

This week, The Wall Street Journal’s Walter Russell Mead finds, “the optimistic case for restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal died. Like so many other innocents, it died at the hands of Ebrahim Raisi, the hanging judge handpicked by Iran’s supreme leader” to face off against President Biden as Iran’s new president. Optimists believed the deal would create a “nonnuclear Iran” that “would become a stable, democratic force in the Middle East.” But “Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has no intention of ending up like Mikhail Gorbachev. By ruthlessly engineering the election of a hard-liner’s hard-liner,” the ayatollah “slammed the door on normalization and nailed it shut.” Khamenei knows a new deal “has zero chance of attracting the two-thirds majority of senators necessary for treaty ratification”; the most Tehran can hope for “is a Biden pinky-swear.” Why “pay any kind of price” for that?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Issue: Gov. Cuomo’s decision to resign, admitting he could no longer govern effectively.

There is only one reason Gov. Cuomo resigned (“Andrew Cuomo resigns as governor of New York,” Aug. 10).

He does not want the Assembly to start an impeachment process.

He also wants to keep his $5 million from his book deal — and maybe all the allegations coming from these women will just go away.

It’s pretty sad that the Democrats did not have the backbone to go after Cuomo on the nursing-home killings to get him out of office but had to use those poor women victims to do their so-called dirty work.

If he does not get impeached, he can also re-run for office one day.

It is time for all of the nursing-home victims’ families to get together and pressure all of their local representatives and the attorney general’s office to start an investigation. Do not let this criminal off of the hook.

Matthew Galcik

Montauk

Cuomo resigned, but that’s not good enough. He must be impeached by the Legislature, not just for the sexual harassment but the altered senior-death numbers, his book deal and his family getting preferential treatment in testing.

New Yorkers deserve answers and Cuomo must be held accountable. Dem­ocrats set the precedent when they impeached President Donald Trump as he was leaving office.

Robert Neglia

The Bronx

On the Cuomo resignation, here is what I heard him say: I am resigning to do the right thing for New York. I am guilty of none of these allegations. I’m simply a warm and cuddly guy who was misunderstood.

He was dishonest in all regards. His denials are emblematic of the hubris, guile and arrogance that are part of his persona.

The state Assembly needs to finish its duty in investigating his wrongful nursing-home decision that sent thousands to their deaths, his use of state resources to publish a book and his preferential treatment of family members ahead of others when it came to COVID.

And adding insult to injury, we the people will pay his legal fees.

Phil Serpico, Queens

If it weren’t for the shocking sexual allegations, would Cuomo be sailing toward re-election to a fourth term?

Would the senior deaths caused by his nursing-home orders ever be taken seriously enough to impeach him?

Schellie Hagan

Brooklyn

As Cuomo — once a champion of #MeToo — resigns over sexual assault allegations, it shows how the radical-progressive politicians of today are the family-values politicians of yesteryear — and both collapsed into hypocritical, sleazy farces.

The woke movement is adopting near-religious trappings. Just as conservative politicians who tried to co-opt puritanical Christianity came to grief, liberal politicians who have ridden the wave of puritanical wokery find themselves heading for disaster.

Politicians in the Democratic Party and elsewhere have imagined that they could preen with left-wing sanctimony and exploit virtue as an attack-dog against rivals — but the uncontrollable, foaming, rabid creature they reared is now turning back to bite them.

Robert Frazer

Lancashire, UK

People swooned over Cuomo’s daily COVID updates even as New York had one of the highest death tolls in the country.

He wrote a book about his greatness and would crush anyone that got in his way. The talking heads all fawned and proclaimed he should be president. Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

Frank Asprea

I would hate to think I share any beliefs with the cancel culture of today’s twisted society, but I do believe that the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge’s name should be changed back to the Tappan Zee Bridge.

Although Andrew Cuo­mo’s father never did anything wrong that we know of, the name Cuomo to me is synonymous with a women-abusing politician, and the name of the bridge should be changed immediately out of respect for all women.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I’ve always said it doesn’t matter what ultimately brings down Gov. Cuomo. In the end, it turned out to be a report on sexual harassment. The abuse, detailed in state Attorney General Letitia James’ report last week, was repulsive. Those of us who lost parents, grandparents and in-laws to Cuomo’s killer nursing-home order can’t begrudge his other victims their victory.

Still, it would be a tragedy of the downfall of Cuomo were to spell the end of the inquiry into his catastrophic nursing-home decision and the subsequent attempted cover-up. That would allow many Cuomo cronies and malefactors to carry on with their political and administrative careers without getting to the root of how the decision came to be made —and how the soon-to-be-former governor managed to hide its toll for months.

Tuesday’s damning report from James concluded that the governor — the same one who was being hailed as a presidential candidate last summer — sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and New York state law.

Listening to these women’s stories of being “terrified,” “demeaned” and being taken advantage of made me so angry. And not just because of the situations they were forced into, but because Cuomo almost got away with it.

This is just one of the many investigations into the governor’s conduct and behavior. Cuomo’s power-hungry reign over New York extended into a pandemic with the governor celebrating himself instead of actually helping the people he represents.

Sending COVID-positive patients into nursing homes for 46 days helped kill thousands of elderly, including my husband’s parents. But if you watched the news last spring, you probably would never have known.

He was riding high on his popularity: winning an Emmy award, creating and selling creepy posters of a conquered “COVID mountain” and signing a $5.1 million book deal. All the while, he covered up how his decisions led to seniors dying — by the thousands.

I can’t lie: I’m angry that the deaths of over 15,000 seniors didn’t bring headlines or get the scorn that it should have from our elected officials. To them, our greatest generation doesn’t seem to matter. President Biden’s Department of Justice civil investigation into the nursing-home tragedy in New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania was dropped just last week. Why?

This should be one of the biggest stories of the pandemic. Against all scientific evidence, governments ordered infected patients into the homes where our most vulnerable resided. That doesn’t deserve our attention? Shouldn’t we know the origins of the mandate? Or does the truth just get buried along with our precious family members?

My friend Assemblyman Ron Kim, who lost his uncle in a nursing home recently, assured me that he and his colleagues will continue the probe into nursing homes here in New York. But he says we have to get the governor out first. Once his power is gone, we can finally hold him accountable for the thousands of unnecessary deaths under his leadership.

So I will take comfort that Cuomo is resigning, and hold out hope for the truth.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s over. Faced with universal demands for him to step down and clearly unable to govern, Gov. Andrew Cuomo did the only sane thing: He tendered his resignation.

Good riddance, too. New York is far better off with him out of the picture.

It was only a matter of time, of course. No one wanted him around anymore. If he hadn’t quit voluntarily, the Legislature would’ve booted him.

Opposition to his continued tenure mushroomed not only because of the charges of sexual misconduct from numerous women, devastating as they were, or his deadly nursing home scandal — his efforts to damn his accusers and cover up the care home facts were added outrages.

No, animosity had grown, as John Podhoretz noted in The Post, even before his scandals broke. He’d racked up a lifetime of enemies, mostly through thuggishness, an attitude that also backfired on the last New York governor to step down, Eliot Spitzer.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo prepares to board a helicopter after announcing his resignation. AP

Cuomo’s departure leaves the state in the hands of his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, who’s largely unknown — and untested — at a key moment for the state. When then-Lt. Gov. David Paterson took over from Spitzer in 2008, following a prostitution scandal, he’d served in the state Senate for decades, including as minority leader.

Hochul will preside over a state facing soaring crime and a post-COVID economy struggling to recover. Enormous fiscal challenges lie just down the road, and next year’s race for governor will only add complexity.

Good riddance to former Gov. Cuomo, and best of luck to Kathy Hochul. AP

Worst, she’ll have to hold back radicalized lawmakers whose agenda — yet more anti-cop measures, raising taxes further and yet more irresponsible state spending and bank-busting programs like single-payer health care — would be disastrous.

Her first order of business, of course: Clean house at the Capitol’s Second Floor, removing Cuomo loyalists, especially those linked to his numerous scandals.

Paterson managed to see the state through, despite the rocky economy at the time; Hochul might face an even heavier lift. New Yorkers should wish her well.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thus departs Andrew Mark Cuomo, and New York’s third consecutive gubernatorial calamity comes to an end. There was an accident bookended by two sociopaths, and the obvious lesson is that the Empire State needs to take more care selecting its leaders.

There was Eliot Spitzer, a ravening lunatic with an appetite for hired women. Then there was David Paterson, a thoroughly decent fellow who was overmatched from Day One. And finally there was Cuomo, a bully with no moral compass, no strategic vision and no self-control.

The combination was lethal, and in 14 days he will be history.

So say hello to Kathy Hochul of Erie County; she’s a woman of no discernible personal flaws, but not a lot of relevant experience, either. She is, frankly, swimming in deep water surrounded by predators — so the drama is far from over.

Cuomo, of course, was about nothing if not drama. His thundering, anger-infused annual messages to the Legislature, along with his truculent public outbursts on controversial policy matters, made it clear that there was little room for compromise or accommodation in his governing style. Even mild dissent was marked as disloyalty, and treated as such.

In 2015, Gov. Andrew Cuomo was described by a biographer as “his father’s all-knowing, all-purpose henchman.” Shannon DeCelle for NY Post

There was “no place in New York” for principled conservatives, he once declared — a pro-life position, or respect for the Second Amendment, was “extremist,” he said. But progressive Democrats fared little better: Just ask the folks who opposed his Amazon initiative in Queens — or, more recently, countered his coronavirus nursing home dissembling with facts.

And while governors and New York City mayors have always been ex officio rivals, Cuomo’s treatment of Bill de Blasio simply has been sadistic (not that Hizzoner hasn’t earned a full ration of contempt, of course). Cuomo’s shoot-the-wounded approach to governance was apparent as early as 1983, when he arrived in Albany as his father Mario’s main muscle — and the resentments began to accumulate.

Biographer Michael Shnayerson in 2015 described the younger Cuomo as “his father’s all-knowing, all-purpose henchman … his father’s heavy,” adding: “He was a nasty piece of work … You do not want him mad at you. He takes no prisoners.”

But while Mario brought subtlety to governance, his son never even tried; instead, rancor ruled. So while Andrew never lacked for allies in New York’s thoroughly transactional political environment, he had few, if any, reliable friends.

Indeed, the fate of the one person who might have qualified as a friend, former family retainer Joseph Percoco, points straight to another prominent characteristic of the Andrew Cuomo year: a persistent odor of corruption.

Percoco, Andrew’s own all-purpose henchman, fell afoul of former US Attorney Preet Bharara’s multiple investigations of Cuomo administration economic development programs, and is doing time in federal prison after having been abandoned by his principal.

All in all, then, it’s no surprise that Cuomo’s good-will reservoir ran dry early on — which in turn helps explain the surprised enthusiasm that New Yorkers had for the governor’s upbeat, focused and sometimes humorous pandemic briefings. Could it be, after all, that there was an empathetic human being lurking behind that creased and glowering face?

Non-New Yorkers also found the presentations fascinating — as did an Emmy Award committee (although its judgment may have been influenced by the hundreds of millions of dollars in entertainment-industry tax credits engineered by Cuomo). Alas, in the end there was nothing there. Decades of accumulated enmity were pressing too heavily.

Thus when Attorney General Letitia James made it clear that his COVID briefings largely had been camouflage for disastrous pandemic policies — which in turn had degenerated into cover-up — the ball began to roll. And when James detailed how the 63-year-old governor routinely harassed 11 much younger women — including a state trooper assigned to his security detail — there was no buffering the impact.

Even President Biden called for his resignation. Bullying seemed no longer to work. Legislative leaders turned their backs. Institutional Albany repaid decades of gubernatorial strong-arming with silence.

Yes, he pledged loudly never to quit — always a sign that exit velocity is approaching — but he had no escape route.

Now he’s gone — a relatively young man, with plenty of time to ponder the dishonor he brought to his office. Will he ever understand that the problem was Andrew all along?

So the very best to Gov. Hochul. The challenge she faces is daunting — but New York has seen the movie before. Here’s hoping she can engineer a happier ending this time.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One down. One to go.

Now that Andrew Cuomo has resigned, his brother, Chris, must be next.

They are, after all, both guilty of gross ethics violations.

Before his “long-planned vacation” this week, it has been positively Orwellian to watch, night after night, CNN’s highest-rated primetime host blatantly ignore this huge, developing bombshell of a story, simply because he’d rather not — while informing upper management that he would continue to advise his brother, who also faces criminal charges and civil lawsuits.

I highly doubt Andrew’s resignation will impact Chris’ advisory status. His brother, after all, is still in crisis.

Chris “promised not to discuss Andrew Cuomo’s strategic response to the scandal with any government official besides the governor himself,” the New York Times reported.

What integrity. Think about this: Chris Cuomo, who curiously still derives power and status from his disgraced and deposed brother, still gets to make his own rules. What a farce. What a display of arrogance and entitlement. Not a shred of mortification or humility.

But hey, that’s the Cuomo brothers for you.

Not since the Kennedys has America been treated to such callous disregard by such a Democratic dynasty — to say nothing of the appalling treatment and dismissal of victimized women.

Chris Cuomo, as we learned in the AG’s report, gave his brother advice at the height of his sexual harassment scandal. He was also given confidential information he had no business having, and secretly made decisions that directly impacted state employees — yet has been held to no account.

He helped draft one of his brother’s denials. It’s all there in email form.

What does this say about Chris Cuomo’s view of women?

After all, as a right-thinking member of the liberal elite, shouldn’t Chris, too, believe all women? Or at least the multiple women who have come forward with incredibly similar stories, speaking of not just sexual harassment but bullying by the governor? Women who say they were terrified to come forward lest they become the focus of Andrew’s wrath, a pattern of behavior stretching over years, even post-Harvey Weinstein?

Isn’t it incumbent on Chris Cuomo to cover this story? Interesting that none of Chris’ female colleagues at CNN have said one word publicly. Tells you something about the corporate culture there, doesn’t it?

Only Jake Tapper felt comfortable enough to criticize Cuomo’s continued role there, and even he trod lightly, telling the New York Times in May that Chris “put us in a bad spot” in ignoring his brother’s scandal on-air.

“I cannot imagine a world in which anybody in journalism thinks that was appropriate,” Tapper added.

I suspect for someone like Jeff Zucker — a Chris Cuomo loyalist and living embodiment of the old boys-will-be-boys network — secretly slandering female victims of sexual harassment, even in the #MeToo era, just doesn’t rise to a firing offense.

Chris Cuomo and his brother, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, share a laugh on CNN.

Seriously, not since the Washington Post’s Ben Bradlee carried JFK’s filthy water has there been such a high-profile, pathetic display of servility to a Democratic dynasty — one that, like the Kennedys, is all a sham.

And there’s so much more cause to fire Chris Cuomo. Consider:

Secretly availing himself of gubernatorial privilege in getting tested and treated for COVID — information he did not share with his viewers, whom he still continues to lecture nightly about COVID.

CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker (left) with Chris Cuomo. WireImage

At the height of the pandemic in New York, Chris and Andrew laughed it up nightly on Chris’ show — despite Chris pledging long prior never to cover his brother in any capacity. As Andrew sent elderly nursing home patients back to their certain deaths, there was nary a word on Chris’ show.

Anyone who was in New York City while this was happening knew the outcome — that these elderly people were all going to spread and die of COVID. You didn’t have to be a virologist or a public health official to know Andrew considered the elderly expendable.

For Chris Cuomo to obfuscate such human carnage is inexcusable. To make his brother the monster palatable — huggable, even — to mainstream America is egregious. Teasing Andrew about “Cuomosexuals” and his dating life while knowing who his brother really was — you can’t tell me Chris had zero clue — is to be complicit in this entire travesty.

Is it any wonder so many Americans don’t trust the mainstream media?

Let’s not forget Chris faking his own emergence from quarantine on-air, despite The Post reporting his wanderings around the Hamptons, in one case picking a fight with a civilian who dared question why Chris would be outside, maskless, while infected.

“Who the hell are you?” Chris ranted at this peon. “I can do what I want!”

Easy to see why he feels that way. Chris makes $6 million a year doing and saying whatever he wants on CNN with zero repercussions — at least, for now.

His great protector Zucker is gone at the end of the year, a decision announced in February.

In the meantime, if there’s anyone at CNN with more common sense — let alone a commitment to actual journalism or saving the brand — let Chris make this easy on you. “I don’t like what I do professionally,” Chris said on his XM radio show last April, an epiphany he had — of course — post-COVID. “I don’t think it’s worth my time.”

Someone, anyone — help a brother out.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s not me. It’s you.

That was Andrew Cuomo’s self-serving, tone-deaf resignation Tuesday. New Yorkers have always known he was a hugger, a kisser. But “the lines have shifted” so suddenly you can’t do that anymore, he said with a “Mad Men”-esque expression of shock. What’s a little groping between a boss and his aide? You can’t do that anymore??

Cuomo finally did the right thing, saying he was going to be out of office in 14 days. But despite his pleas of “I accept full responsibility,” he accepted none at all. He blamed a “hot” political environment. He blamed his enemies. He blamed Twitter. He claimed holding men to account was “unsustainable for society.”

Then he mansplained how much he’s done for New York, skipping over the nursing home fiasco, the book he forced his staff to work on, the disastrous bills he didn’t block.

He said it was “in the best interest” of New York state that he serve, but it was going to cost too much money and take too much effort to impeach him. No, he didn’t do anything wrong. It’s that it would be too much of a distraction to try him for it.

“You know me,” Cuomo said.

Yes, we do. You’re the egocentric governor who never accepted any blame, never showed a shred of regret, but attacked all his enemies with rabid hatred.

No, Andrew. It’s not us. It was always you.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm on a rare illness that was previously only seen in tropical climates, particularly South Asia and northern Australia.

Now, two people are dead and two have recovered after being infected with melioidosis — a disease that had never before been detected on contiguous US soil. Melioidosis has now been seen in Georgia, Kansas, Texas and Minnesota, LiveScience reported. The only other known cases of melioidosis in the US were in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.

None of the four patients claimed to have traveled outside the country prior to becoming sick between March and July of this year.

The CDC “believes the most likely cause is an imported product (such as a food or drink, personal care or cleaning products or medicine) or an ingredient in one of those types of products,” according to the statement released Monday.

Investigators have taken more than 100 samples of soil, water and common products used in and around each patient’s home in order to discover a link between the four cases — but have found no common source thus far. However, genome sequencing of the bacteria has revealed that the four cases are likely somehow related, the CDC added.

About a dozen cases of melioidosis are seen each year in Americans, nearly all of which can be attributed to travel. This is the first time doctors are seeing the illness seemingly originate within the contiguous US.

Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, melioidosis can take several weeks to set in after exposure to the pathogen. Symptoms include cough and shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, intermittent fever and body rashes, the CDC wrote in a message to physicians on how to spot the illness.

Risk factors for developing the disease include diabetes, liver or kidney disease, chronic lung disease, cancer or another condition that weakens the immune system, the CDC warned.

One of the known cases of melioidosis — involving a 4-year-old girl — was recently publicized in Texas. Preschooler Lylah Baker had no known risk factors for the illness when she was sickened in May. Lylah spent a month in the intensive care unit of Children’s Medical Center Dallas, requiring a ventilator and eventually suffering brain damage, according to the Dallas Morning News.

“She was a healthy, typical little girl about to start pre-K in the fall — no underlying health issues previously. I mean just nothing,” Ashley Kennon, the child’s aunt, told the newspaper. “So it was definitely a major surprise to everybody not knowing where [the bacteria] came from.”

Lylah is convalescing at Our Children’s House Dallas.

The CDC is urging doctors to be aware of melioidosis symptoms regardless of their patients’ locations and travels.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Google has rolled out a new internal calculator to explain potential pay cuts to employees who choose to work remotely — and the early results suggests it will penalize its suburban staffers.

Screenshots obtained by Reuters show that Google employees who previously commuted an hour to Google’s Manhattan offices from nearby Stamford, Conn., for example, would see their salaries slashed by 15 percent if they choose to continue working from home.

By contrast, “Googlers” who live within NYC’s five boroughs and choose to work from home permanently would not see their pay slashed at all.

The screenshots also showed 5 percent and 10 percent differences for commuters living in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.

Google employees who move even farther away from the company’s offices have been warned they could face even harsher pay cuts. A worker who left San Francisco for Lake Tahoe, another expensive area of California, would have their pay cut by a whopping 25 percent.

That would mean an employee with a $150,000 salary would suddenly make less than $112,000 per year.

News of the Google tool comes amid a broader debate at tech companies about remote work and compensation.

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have all warned employees who plan to leave expensive cities like New York and San Francisco that their pay will be slashed — while smaller tech companies like Reddit and Zillow say they’ll pay the same regardless of where employees live.

Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination, said Google’s pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely, including families.

“What’s clear is that Google doesn’t have to do this,” Rosenfeld told Reuters. “Google has paid these workers at 100 percent of their prior wage, by definition. So it’s not like they can’t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.”

Google, which has about 140,000 employees worldwide, took in $61.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of this year alone.

The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Post and did not address the Stamford commuter issue in a statement to Reuters.

“Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marissa Rohan — the Los Angeles Dodgers ball girl — has been dubbed a “hero” after she tackled a fan who ran onto the field during Sunday’s 6-1 win over the rival Angels.

Rohan, who reps a No. 93 Dodgers jersey on the field, got the job done after a number of security personnel couldn’t catch the intruder. Rohan has worked for the team since 2019, but Sunday’s fan take-down is believed to be her first-ever viral field moment.

Rohan has been reposting messages and support from others to her Instagram Story. She even joked that Sunday was a “rough day at work.”

“Yeah I am not going to stop talking about this lol,” she captioned a news story about her play on Instagram.

The 24-year-old is a senior at Cal State Northridge, pursuing a degree in deaf studies. She is a proud member of Alpha Phi sorority.

Rohan is a former gymnast and softball player, according to past posts on her public Instagram account — where she documents her relationship with boyfriend Justin Fallon, a ticket operations supervisor with the Dodgers.

When she’s not saving the day at Dodger Stadium, Rohan is like any other college student. She enjoys snowboarding, partying in Vegas, snapping the occasional selfie, and hitting the beach with friends.

Bottom line: Don’t try to get past the Dodgers ball girl.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For all of my adult life I have identified as a progressive. To me, being a progressive meant that I believed in empowerment. In 2002, when I co-founded a labor-environmental coalition to advocate for renewable energy, the symbol we chose to represent us was of Rosie the Riveter, an image of a woman factory worker during World War II flexing her muscle beneath the words, “We Can Do It!” When Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, it seemed fitting to me that he chose the slogan, “Yes we can!”

But now, on all the major issues of the day, the message from progressives is “No, you can’t.”

No: poor nations like Bangladesh can’t adapt to climate change by becoming rich, insist progressives; rather, rich nations must become poor. No: we can’t prevent the staggering rise of drug deaths in the US, from 17,000 in 2000 to 93,000 in 2020, by helping people free themselves from addiction; rather, we must instead provide Safe Injection Sites and Safe Sleeping Sites, in downtown neighborhoods, where homeless addicts can use fentanyl, heroin, and meth safely.

Progressives insist they are offering hope. Many scientists and activists this week said that, while we have gone past the point of no return, when it comes to climate change, and that “No one is safe,” we can make the situation less bad by using solar panels, windmills, and electric cars, albeit at a very high cost to the economy.

And in California, progressive leaders say that we just need to stick with the progressive agenda of Safe Injection Sites and Safe Sleeping Sites until we can build enough single unit apartments for the state’s 116,000 unsheltered homeless, most of whom are either addicted to hard drugs, suffering from untreated mental illness, or both.

But progressives are talking out of both sides of their mouth. When I debated a British climate scientist named Richard Betts on television, pointing out that he and his colleagues had contributed to one out of four British children having nightmares about climate change, he insisted that he was all for optimism and that he agreed with me about nuclear power.

But just hours earlier he had told The Guardian that we were “hopelessly unprepared” for extreme weather events, even though deaths from natural disasters are at an all-time low and that, objectively speaking, humankind has never been more prepared than we are today.

Rosie the Riveter, an image of a woman factory worker during World War II flexing her muscle beneath the words, “We Can Do It!”

And on the drug deaths crisis, the consensus view among California Democrats in Sacramento is that “the problem is fundamentally unsolvable,” according to one of the Capitol’s leading lobbyists.

The reason progressives believe that “No one is safe,” when it comes to climate change, and that the drug-death “homelessness” crisis is unsolvable, is because they are in the grip of a victim ideology characterized by safetyism, learned helplessness, and disempowerment.

This isn’t really that new. Since the 1960s, the New Left has argued that we can’t solve any of our major problems until we overthrow our racist, sexist, and capitalistic system. But for most of my life, up through the election of Obama, there was still a New Deal, “Yes we can!” and “We can do it!” optimism that sat side-by-side with the New Left’s fundamentally disempowering critique of the ­system.

That’s all gone. On climate change, drug deaths, and cultural issues like racism, the message from progressives is that we are doomed unless we dismantle the institutions responsible for our oppressive, racist system. Those of us in Generation X who were raised to believe that racism was something we could overcome have been told in no uncertain terms that we were wrong. Racism is baked into our cultural DNA.

Even apparently positive progressive proposals are aimed at fundamentally dismantling institutions. The Democrats’ $1 trillion infrastructure bill, supported by many Republicans, and their $3.5 trillion budget proposal, contain measures that would finance the continuing degradation of our electrical grids by increasing reliance on unreliable, weather-dependent renewables, and establish racial incentives for industries including trucking, where there is already a shortage of drivers in large measure because not enough of them can pass drug tests.

And does anyone really believe that, if those bills pass, progressives will abandon their dark vision of the future and return to Rosie the Riveter?

Meanwhile, at the state and local level, progressive governments faced with worsening racial disparities in education and crime, are attempting to “solve” the problem by eliminating academic standards altogether, and advocating selective enforcement of laws based on who is committing them.

Such measures are profoundly cynical. Progressives are effectively giving up on addressing racial disparities by ignoring them. But such is the logical outcome of victim ideology, which holds that we can divide the world into victims and oppressors, that victims are morally superior and even spiritual, and no change is possible until the system that produces victims and oppressors is overthrown.

To some extent none of this is new. After World War II, it was progressives, not conservatives, who led the charge to replace mental hospitals with community-based care. After the community-based care system fell apart, and severely mentally ill people ended up living on the street, addicted to drugs and alcohol, progressives blamed Reagan and Republicans for cutting the budget.

But progressive California today spends more than any other state, per capita, on mental health, and yet the number of homeless, many of whom are mentally ill and suffering addiction, increased by 31 percent in California since 2010 even as they declined by 18 percent in the rest of the US.

Also after World War II, it was progressives, not conservatives, who insisted that the world was coming to an end because too many babies were being born, and because of nuclear energy. The “population bomb” meant that too many people would result in resource scarcity which would result in international conflicts and eventually nuclear war. We were helpless to prevent the situation through technological change and instead had to prevent people from having children and rid the world of nuclear weapons and energy.

It took the end of the Cold War, and the overwhelming evidence that parents in poor nations chose to have fewer children, as parents in rich nations had before them, where they no longer needed them to work on the farm, for the discourse to finally fade.

But the will-to-apocalypse only grew stronger. After it became clear that the planet was warming, not cooling, as many scientists had previously feared, opportunistic New Left progressives insisted that climate change would be world-ending. There was never much reason to believe this. A major report by the National Academies of Science in 1982 concluded that abundant natural gas, along with nuclear power, would substitute for coal, and prevent temperatures from rising high enough to threaten civilization.

But progressives responded by demonizing the authors of the study and insisting that anybody who disagreed that climate change was apocalyptic was secretly on the take from the fossil fuel industry.

Where there have been relatively straightforward fixes to societal problems, progressives have opposed them. Progressives have opposed the expanded use of natural gas and nuclear energy since the 1970s even though it was those two technologies that caused emissions to peak and decline in Germany, Britain and France during that decade.

Progressive climate activists over the last 15 years hotly opposed fracking even though it was the main reason emissions in the US declined 22 percent between 2005 and 2020, which is 5 percentage points more than President Obama proposed to reduce them as part of America’s Paris climate agreement.

The same was the case when it came to drug deaths, addiction, and homelessness. People are shocked when I explain to them that the reason California still lacks enough homeless shelters is because progressives have opposed building them.

Indeed, it was Gov. Gavin Newsom, when he was mayor of San Francisco, who led the charge opposing the construction of sufficient homeless shelters in favor of instead building single-unit apartments for anybody who said they wanted one. While there are financial motivations for such a policy, the main motivation was ideological. Newsom and other progressives believe that simply sheltering people is immoral. The good is the enemy of the perfect.

As a result, progressives have created the apocalypse they feared. In California, there are “homeless encampments,” open drug scenes, in the parks, along the highways, and on the sidewalks.

But the problem is no longer limited to San Francisco. A few days ago somebody posted a video and photo on Twitter of people in Philadelphia, high on some drug, looking exactly like Hollywood zombies. The obvious solution is to provide people with shelter, require them to use it, and mandate drug and psychiatric treatment, for people who break laws against camping, public drug use, public defecation, and other laws. But progressives insist the better solution is Safe Sleeping Sites and Safe Injection Sites.

Should we be surprised that an ideology that believes American civilization is fundamentally evil has resulted in the breakdown of that civilization? Most American progressives don’t hold such an extreme ideology. Most progressives want police for their neighborhoods. Most progressives want their own children, when suffering mental illness and addiction, to be mandated care. And most progressives want reliable electrical and water management systems for their ­neighborhoods.

But most progressives are also voting for candidates who are cutting the number of police for poor neighborhoods, insisting that psychiatric and drug treatment be optional, and that trillions be spent making electricity more expensive so we can harmonize with nature through solar panels made by enslaved Muslims in China, and through industrial wind projects built in the habitat of critically endangered whale species.

Does pointing all of this out make me a conservative? There are certainly things I support that many progressives view as conservative, including nuclear power, a ban on public camping, and mandating drug and psychiatric treatment for people who break the law.

But other things I support might be fairly viewed as rather liberal, or even progressive, including universal psychiatric care, shelter-for-all, and the reform of police departments with the aims of reducing homicides, police violence, and improving the treatment of people with behavioral health disorders, whether from addiction or mental illness.

If I had to find a word to describe the politics I am proposing it would be “heroic,” not liberal, conservative, or even moderate. We need a politics of heroism not a politics of victimhood.

Yes, Bangladesh can develop and save itself from sea-level rise, just as rich nations have; they are not doomed to hurricanes and flooding. Yes, people addicted to fentanyl and meth can recover from their addictions, with our help, and go on to live fulfilling and rewarding lives; they are not doomed to live in tents for the rest of their shortened lives.

And yes, we can create an America where people who disagree on many things can nonetheless find common ground on the very issues that most seem to polarize us, including energy, the environment, crime, and drugs.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo has delayed his exit for two weeks. Why? Because he wants to. The Assembly should take the opportunity to impeach him anyway, so the state Senate can vote him guilty.

It’s their duty to the people of New York to ensure Cuomo pays the full penalty for his gross misconduct.

It’s not just the violations of federal and New York law — including laws he signed himself! —outlined in state Attorney General Letitia James’s damning report on multiple counts of sexual harassment, nor even his plainly illegal use of state resources to malign his accusers.

No: His abuses in covering up the true death toll in state care homes, a body count clearly inflated by his orders that homes take in COVID-contagious patients, are an outrage in and of themselves, as is his refusal to rescind the main order for 46 days and another for months.

More: He personally profited from the coverup, as the truth could’ve stopped him from scoring a $5.1 million deal to write the now-laughable “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Clear evidence also shows he made illegal use of gubernatorial staff in cutting the deal as well as producing the book.

Yes, Cuomo faces a federal investigation over those issues, but that doesn’t remove lawmakers’ duty to act. (Plus, there’s no guarantee the Biden Justice Department will continue it, especially after President Joe Biden declared Cuomo’s downfall “a tragedy.”)

Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens), who says Cuomo personally threatened him against revealing part of the coverup, vows the Assembly inquiry into the nursing-home nightmare will continue and hopes impeachment does, too.

But the impeachment question is up to the Assembly as a whole, and Speaker Carl Heastie has long been reluctant to go after Cuomo, a longtime ally. He won’t be moved by the near-universal Republican support to make the gov pay and maybe not by similar calls from progressives like state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (Bx-W’chester).

But Biaggi is right: “Resignation is not accountability,” so “the Legislature has to continue to move forward with impeachment proceedings.” Indeed: “Just resignation means that he is permitted to run for office again, and we have to ensure that is not the case.”

Cuomo hopes to mount a comeback someday. Heck, he even hasn’t admitted any real wrongdoing, even when it comes to harassment. His legal team was still attacking his accusers minutes before he announced his resignation.

He clearly figures the public will forget the sorry details. It’s the Legislature’s duty to see that he suffers the full consequences for his actions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For the first time since Jimmy Carter’s presidency, inflation is back in a big way: 5.4% from July 2020 to July 2021. From February 2020 to June 2021, food prices went up 5.4%; energy prices increased 8.9%. You’ve probably noticed it at the pump and the grocery store.

Inflation bites household budgets unevenly, landing harder on older people with savings and fixed incomes. It feeds a vicious cycle, as workers demand more pay and their employers raise prices to cover the costs. It makes it harder to plan ahead, and uncertainty is always bad for investment. Hyperinflation, when inflation just takes off and runs away, has long destabilized societies and toppled governments.

Two things cause inflation. One is having more money in circulation chasing the same amount of goods. If you gave everybody in Monopoly an extra $1,000, they’d bid more for Boardwalk.

The other is more demand: the readier people are to spend what they have, the more businesses can afford to raise prices. (Businesses also need to raise prices when wages are rising, but they can only sustain that without losing sales if the demand is there.)

Demand has been running hot for months, as people resume travel, dining out, and other pent-up activities that were shut down for COVID. More people are back to work, too, with more money to spend. These are good things, but they raise the risk of inflation.

The government is spending $6 trillion already this year, which will rise even more if the $3.5 trillion bill passes. US debt stands at a whopping $23 trillion. NY Post Illustration

There are two things the government shouldn’t do in that situation. One is spend a ton more money, expanding the amount in circulation. The other is to drive up wages and demand.

Joe Biden and the Democrats are doing both. Businesses have to offer higher wages to compete with extended unemployment benefits. Senate Democrats passed a $3.5 trillion budget resolution Wednesday morning, a package stuffed with more benefits. This is on top of $1.9 trillion the Democrats spent in January. There’s also a bipartisan bill with $550 billion in new infrastructure spending.

This is the wildest peacetime spending spree in U.S. history. The $6 trillion price tag is over $46,000 for every household in the country. By comparison, the federal government spent $4.1 trillion, in current dollars, fighting World War II.

Big spending by Democrats in the 1960s on Great Society benefits and the Vietnam War helped usher in the high inflation of the 1970s. Nobody can predict whether we will see a repeat this time around. But Democrats are playing with fire with our money.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It was one year ago Wednesday that Kamala Harris was announced as Joe Biden’s running mate. That auspicious moment catapulted the stone-cold loser of the Democratic presidential contest into prime time, a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.

With the convenient defenestration of her main rival, handsy, outgoing Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the ambitious 56-year-old vice president is another step closer to the 2024 nomination — or 2028, if you believe Biden.

The problem for the Democrats is that she is unelectable. It’s the fake laughter, the handmaidenly comportment around Biden, the car-crash interviews and the complete inability to succeed at any of the tasks she has been handed, from immigration to vaccination.

Not for nothing was Harris billed the “most unpopular vice president in 50 years” by UK broadsheet the Daily Telegraph.

She’s so unpopular that Hillary Clinton staffers, of all people, reportedly have been consulted for likability lessons.

Naturally, they blamed “sexism” for Harris’ troubles.

The truth is, if she’s not annoying, Harris is boring. Someone tried to get “#VPAppreciationDay trending Wednesday, but, of 30 or so tweets posted, not one made it into triple figures for likes or ­retweets.

If you had a strong president, of course, none of this would matter outside a little Beltway gaggle of ladies who lunch.

But Biden isn’t getting any younger. When he showed up to work for the first time this week, after lunch Tuesday, he was filmed wandering across the White House lawn in search of the entrance to his office.

There may be an explanation for the odd behavior, but the point is that Biden often seems to be off with the pixies. The idea that in three years, at age 81, he would contest another election is fanciful. He is not young for his age, and he started his presidency already three months older than Ronald Reagan was at the end of his two terms.

Not even 2016 presidential election loser Hillary Clinton has garnered as much disdain from her staffers as Vice President Kamala Harris. AFP via Getty Images

Harris knows the top prize is just waiting to plop into her lap and she doesn’t have to try very hard to score the nomination because she has the big gorilla of identity politics at her service. Good luck to any Democratic challengers in 2024 who aren’t female and black. It’s all about the precedent.

One of the reasons Harris flamed out before the primaries was her singularly cringeworthy media performances. They are so woeful, they are almost endearing.

She could have stayed a stern prosecutor in California, and nobody would have been any the wiser. It’s when she pretends to be likable that everything goes wrong.

Possibly her worst performance was with radio host Charlamagne tha God on “The Breakfast Club” radio program. Something about that show draws Democratic candidates like moths to a flame, and invariably they get burned. Joe Biden did himself damage when he snapped at “tha God”: “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”

You could just hear the air leak out of his black outreach.

For Harris, it was more of a slow burn, punctuated by insane cackles. The interview got attention for her dubious claim that her favorite college rappers were “definitely Snoop, aha. Tupac, for sure, for sure.”

But there was another, less studied line that raised eyebrows closer to home.

When asked what she had to say to people who falsely believe she’s opposed to legalizing marijuana, she replied: “Half my family’s from Jamaica. Are you kidding me? Hahahahahahah.”

The comment drew a sharp rebuke from her Jamaican father.

Donald Harris, emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University, fired off a cranky missive to Jamaica Global Online, slamming her words as a “travesty.”

“My dear departed grandmothers … as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family’s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected … with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy-seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics,” he wrote.

Slap, young lady.

The point is that Harris was brought up better than it sometimes seems. In fact, she goes on in the interview to make sensible comments. She called for “research [into] the impact of weed on the developing brain” and pondered “how we’re going to measure impairment when somebody has been smoking weed, in terms of driving.”

As a former prosecutor, she knows the consequences of law-breaking because it was once her job to exact justice on behalf of victims.

It’s hard to square her former noble role with the “Defund the police” persona she adopted during her lackluster campaign.

This is her problem. She is probably not a bad person, but so desperate has she been to climb the greasy pole that she has jettisoned every value her disciplined immigrant family imbued in her and every lesson life as a prosecutor taught her.

The cognitive dissonance is etched across her face and betrayed by every tremble of her vocal cords. Unless you are a psychopath, you can’t stop the truth leaking out.

The fakery is what turns people off. If she wants to improve her image, try being the real Kamala.

Who knows, under the try-hard cool-aunt guise, there might be a social conservative waiting to break out, who would be wildly popular on both sides of the aisle.

It’s never too late to try authenticity.

Let’s mandate that Dr. Fauci respect Americans’ freedoms

Who made Dr. Anthony Fauci king?

Vaccines are great and masks have a place, but state coercion is not where America wants to go. We don’t have to sacrifice freedom for safety and it’s not his place to decide, anyway.

It is time for Fauci to hang up his microphone and go back to his day job handing out grants to sloppy bat researchers at the Wuhan lab. On second thought, he should probably just retire to Florida, where he might learn a thing or two about freedom in a state that defied all his wisdom and ended up in a better place. Too long in Washington, DC, is not good for anyone.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The infrastructure bill the Senate passed Tuesday discriminates against white people at every turn.

Americans are enthusiastic about spending money on physical infrastructure — bridges, roads, broadband. But this racist bill hands out jobs and contracts and locates projects based on race, not merit. Minority businesses and neighborhoods hold the inside track. If you’re white, you’re low-priority.

The bill includes grants to install solar or wind technologies and generate jobs in areas decimated by closing coal mines or coal-fired electric plants. Here’s the catch: When contractors bid, the bill says minority-owned businesses will get selected first. Bad news for small-time white contractors in depressed areas.

The same is true for the bill’s proposals to improve traffic patterns in cities. Contractors and subcontractors get priority only if they’re owned by minorities or women. White male business owners can take a hike.

Americans should be outraged — but not surprised. After all, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act, passed in March, also put into place an ugly system of discrimination against whites. It offered debt relief to black farmers, but not white farmers. Another provision offered billions in aid to minority-owned and women-owned restaurants, but told struggling restaurants owners who happened to be white men that they had to go to the back of the line.

The injustice was obvious. White male farmers and restaurant owners sued, claiming the anti-white provisions are unconstitutional. So far, these challengers are winning. In every case, federal judges have halted the race-based programs in the American Rescue Plan Act until the challengers have their day in court. Politico reported last week that Biden’s Justice Department may fold without a fight on the black-farmer debt relief cases, because the law isn’t on the administration’s side.

The infrastructure hides discriminatory policies behind popular public works projects. EPA/JUSTIN LANE

You would think Democrats and the Biden White House would get the message. Instead, they’re doubling down on rigging legislation and divvying up taxpayer dollars to benefit minorities and shortchange whites.

Chances are high the infrastructure bill’s hodgepodge of anti-white discrimination will be struck down by federal courts. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution bars government from trying to even the score by discriminating against whites and in favor of minorities. The justices warned against creating “a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations” to correct past injustices. That’s precisely what this infrastructure bill does.

The bill’s backers would have you believe that obsolete airports, dilapidated public works and deteriorating roads and public spaces are evidence of racial injustice. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY) rails that “our infrastructure is racist” and calls on the Congress to pass a bill that “puts the needs of underserved and disadvantaged communities at the fore.”

That’s code for minority communities. But the truth is, there are plenty of poor white people in this country, too, and poor, predominantly white communities that could benefit from a bold federal infrastructure initiative. Race and ethnicity should have nothing to do with it. Locate the projects and put the funds where the economic need is greatest, regardless of race.

West Virginia has the lowest average income in the nation and ranks 46th in internet connectivity. Maine ranks 36th out of 50 states for income, and 34th in broadband connectivity. People in these states could really benefit from federal broadband assistance. Here’s the hitch: The infrastructure bill tilts the grant scale in favor of states with high minority and non-English-speaking populations, instead of considering only economic need and existing broadband capacity. Because Maine and West Virginia are 94 percent white, they’ll get less.

Polls show that Americans favor fixing roads, bridges, tunnels and airports. They know that good infrastructure promotes economic growth. But they’ve been kept in the dark about the fine print in the bill. Under the guise of upgrading the nation, the bill unfairly treats whites like second-class citizens.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Most media are giving ample coverage to Texas’ COVID woes, as the Delta variant has hospitals running out of ICU beds. But few reports note how President Joe Biden’s border disaster is helping drive the crisis.

US border agents encountered nearly 189,000 migrants in June alone, the latest in a string of record-setting months. And the Biden administration is releasing many of these illegal entrants into the interior.

Plus, that surge surely means a similarly huge rise in migrants who never get caught. Especially since Team Biden won’t let Texas authorities do any immigration enforcement of their own.

More than 80 percent of migrants are unvaccinated, per Immigration and Customs Enforcement data. As Betsy McCaughey noted in these pages, “The vaccination rates in Honduras and Guatemala, the countries of origin for most border crossers, are less than 1 percent.”

Biden took office vowing to beat the virus, but he’s clearly more concerned with sticking to his refusal to secure the border.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fresh data show that half of all 32 New York City school districts have lost at least 10 percent of their enrollment these past five years, even as charter-school enrollment is up 31 percent, from 105,065 in 2017 to 138,648 last year. Families are clearly voting with their feet — as far as state law, which badly restricts charters’ growth, will allow.

State lawmakers need to do right by parents and lift the cap that prevents new city charters from opening.

Department of Education apologists blame random factors for the flight, including the pandemic. But the fact is that the DOE badly bungled the COVID challenge, driving families that could afford it to Catholic and private schools as well as to charters. (DOE rules meant charters couldn’t offer much in-person instruction, either, but they did far better at making remote classes work.)

For the last school year alone, public charter schools saw enrollment boom by nearly 10,000 even as DOE enrollment fell 4 percent — roughly 43,000 kids.

Mayor Bill de Blasio’s misrule has played a role, too: His administration’s heavy-handed reworking of admission rules for middle schools in Brooklyn’s District 15, previously one of the city’s academically strongest districts, has led to mass flight: Total enrollment is down 5.4 percent since 2017, while the kindergarten rolls plummeted 18 percent.

As Eric Adams and Kathy Hochul look to take over as mayor and governor, muscling the Legislature to lift the cap to let charters handle the full outflow from DOE schools may be the only way to save public education in the city.

The National Security Agency’s inspector general announced a probe into allegations that the NSA wrongly intercepted the communications of Fox News host Tucker Carlson — which, argues Glenn Greenwald at his Substack, shows that Carlson’s claim is far from “frivolous.” IG Robert P. Storch “is a long-time ­executive-branch functionary” and “a widely ­respected bureaucrat in Washington” who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations, including a stint as the Justice Department’s deputy IG in the Obama era. When Carlson first aired his concerns, “corporate media outlets largely sided with the NSA, mocking Carlson for being conspiratorial and even accusing him of fabricating a story.” But the IG probe gives good reason to worry that NSA operatives unlawfully targeted him and sought to “weaponize the intelligence against him.”

Libertarian: GOP Joins in Sham Spending Bills

“The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill is a sham” that only “sets up a much bigger round of explicitly partisan spending later,” roars Peter Suderman at Reason, noting sarcastically that it includes “essential infrastructure provisions like, er, requiring unproven new drunk-driving-prevention technology” and “reporting requirements for cryptocurrency.” Yet 19 Republicans voted for it anyway, claiming the bill will be deficit-neutral, though the Congressional Budget Office puts the net cost as at least $256 billion. They say it will restrain Democrats’ bid to shell out $3.5 trillion on another “big government, progressive-agenda spending bill,” but it does “no such thing.” In fact, Republicans are backing a “two-bill deal.” Why? To show that “Congress can get things done” — but they’re “big, terrible things.”

Eco desk: Greens’ Apocalypse Porn

“The green movement is a doomsday cult,” declares Spiked’s Brendan O’Neill. “Apocalypse porn is everywhere,” with “images of fire and floods” meant to raise awareness “about man’s self-made apocalypse”: “Change your ways or people will die.” It lets lawmakers off the hook: “Treating every disparate natural event as proof of the existence of an all-seeing, all-punishing global monster called ‘climate change’ absolves local politicians of responsibility for tackling natural crises.” Worse, this worldview “explicitly demotes what ought to be the great, galvanizing goal of ­humankind — the liberation of every human being from poverty — in favor of insisting that progress has gone too far, economic growth must be ­reversed, and we must all settle for less.” Those who believe this “when 3 billion people still live in extreme poverty” scare “me far more than any wildfire.”

From the right: Lightfoot’s Unequal Indignation

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot “can occasionally if inconsistently work herself up into a lather over COVID protocols, but she is far more reserved in her public comments about Chicago’s violence problem,” points out Jack Dunphy at PJ Media. She was “somber and measured in her remarks about the death of Chicago Police Officer Ella French,” calling out “the common enemy” of “gangs and guns.” But her remarks lacked “the moral indignation she brought when she excoriated people who were so depraved as to throw parties last summer,” whom she threatened with citation or arrest. These “hollow words from the mayor” confirm for Chicago cops that when “confrontations go awry, as some always will, Mayor Lightfoot and the media and the racial-grievance industry will rush in to demonize” police.

Media watch: Journalism’s Cuomo Problem

“Collateral damage in” Gov. Cuomo’s “political implosion” includes “the reputation of his brother, Chris Cuomo, the CNN host — and the integrity of the industry in which he works,” warns LZ Granderson in the Los ­Angeles Times, slamming “last year’s love-fest between the two, in which Chris repeatedly interviewed Andrew on CNN.” With Andrew “a high-profile face of the government response” to the pandemic, having his brother interview him “was a completely avoidable, self-inflicted wound that has come back to haunt all involved.” Public trust in the media is ­“impossible if we cross clear lines with stunts like presenting the Brothers Cuomo as a news segment.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Issue: President Biden’s criticism of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ refusal to implement vaccine passports.

I agree with Karol Markowicz on President Biden’s attack on Gov. Ron DeSantis, but I think it is for more immediate reasons than that the governor is a threat in 2024 (“Why Joe Hates DeSantis,” PostOpinion, Aug. 9).

The real reason is that DeSantis directly linked the COVID outbreak in Florida to the infected illegals Biden is shipping across the country.

The link matters because it means Biden is quite literally killing Americans with his policy disaster on the border. This is a preemptive strike by Biden out of pure panic, since the public making a direct link between Biden’s border disaster and COVID will collapse his weak public support.

James Barends

Wayne, Pa.

DeSantis’ arrogance is criminal. His attitude regarding the safety of schoolchildren, and in fact all Florida’s citizens, is in violation of his responsibility as governor.

The coronavirus is airborne, so the proper use of a mask can block its transmission. DeSantis’ refusal to allow local school boards to mandate masking puts the children and their families at risk.

Claiming that it should be the parents’ choice whether or not to mask their children denies his responsibility for public safety.

His opposition to vaccine passports further illustrates his reckless disregard for public safety.

Irving A. Gelb

North Bergen, NJ

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know why Biden is verbally jabbing DeSantis.

For those who haven’t noticed, DeSantis poses a threat to Democrats in 2024.

As a progressive governor and strong leader, DeSantis will not allow Biden to destroy him. Florida is the “stand your ground” state. And De­Santis is standing his ground over mask mandates.

The most immediate threat to our nation is Biden’s open-border policy, allowing migrants from Latin American countries, many with variants of COVID-19, pour across the border in unprecedented numbers and re-infect our nation — all of which is counterproductive to the health, safety and welfare of America.

JoAnn Lee Frank

Clearwater, Fla.

The situation in Florida with the continued spread of the Delta variant has really gotten out of control.

Hospitals and medical personnel across the state are overwhelmed with sick, mostly unvaccinated patients, and the numbers continue growing each day.

Vaccinations are the only way that the pandemic in Florida, as well as the rest of the country, will finally be brought under control.

These vaccines are safe, effective and have very few side effects. The time has come for politics to be pushed aside and let medicine take over here.

Also, the flow of illegal immigrants into Florida and other sections of the country must be stopped at once.

To all Americans: Get yourselves and your families vaccinated as soon as possible.

John Amato

Fresh Meadows

Biden has the audacity to attack DeSantis on his common-sense COVID policies for Florida, just because he intends to let children and adults live free with precaution.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration opens the border wider every day, letting in the unvaccinated, criminals, drug dealers, rapists and sex traffickers.

The Biden administration is failing to protect America from foreign and domestic terror.

Hands off DeSantis, Joe. Finish the wall. Stop taking orders from the looney-left radicals in your party and protect and defend America now.

JR Cummings

Manhattan

Why all the media attention on Florida?

Areas of New York and New Jersey also have high rates of COVID-19 transmission that fall within the CDC guidelines for indoor masking of vaccinated people, but New York and New Jersey have also not issued any mandates for universal indoor masking.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The psalmist warned us: “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of a man, in whom there is no help.”

This bit of immortal wisdom from three millennia ago might be of help today as we seek to understand the fall of Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

The psalm uses the word “princes” to refer to the human authority figures who serve as our earthly leaders. We are advised not to put our faith in them, because it is foolish to put your faith in anything but the divine — “the God of Jacob . . . who keeps faith forever.”

A prince’s time, the psalmist tells us, is just as temporary as ours: “When his breath departs, he returns to his earth. On that very day, his plans perish.” As we have seen this week, the prince’s plans may perish owing to his departure from the governor’s mansion, as well.

Cuomo became one of the “princes” people had chosen not only to trust, but to place on a pedestal. This, despite a nearly four-decade career during which he’d made it surpassingly clear that he was about as trustworthy as the scorpion who convinces the frog to give him a ride across the pond.

His record as the state’s chief executive is undeniably mixed. For he succeeded in breaking through the paralytic status quo in the Empire State and getting the new Tappan Zee Bridge and the new LaGuardia Airport built. The same can be said of the Second Avenue Subway and the Moynihan Train Hall.

But there was also the corruption he winked at or implicitly oversaw. Recall that his right-hand man Joseph Percoco is still in prison for taking bribes, and we have yet to fully understand the maneuverings that led to the bizarre waste of an astonishing amount of taxpayer money in the so-called Buffalo Billion scandal. And he brazenly shut down the very investigation into Albany’s dirty politics he himself had ordered when investigators started sniffing too close to his dogpile.

It isn’t just the mortality of princes that should make us wary of putting them on pedestal. It is the fact as mortal men, they are prone to deep human weaknesses: greed, vanity, lust, including the lust for domination.

And yet we can’t help ourselves. We want to believe that the people we elect — or even, as in the case of the psalmist’s time and much of the planet even now, the strongmen who rule through force alone — are made of better stuff. And so we often impute to them moral strengths they don’t have, simply because we are so hungry to have someone to believe in.

That was where Cuomo came in. COVID was terrifying, and he gave good news conferences, where he talked about everything that was being done in New York to address the pandemic.

The fact that many of the policies he trumpeted turned out to be unnecessary or foolish or wrong — we didn’t need tens of thousands of ventilators, and we didn’t need the Javits Center or Central Park as field hospitals — didn’t matter.

An adoring press ignored, too, the barbarous horrors of the policies he put in place but didn’t trumpet: sending elderly COVID patients back to nursing homes, where the virus spread and killed by the thousands.

He was a hero, because liberals needed a hero. And they especially needed a hero, because they were so caught up in their own wrought-up melodrama in which COVID seemed to be an emanation spreading from the Orange Monster of their nightmares in the Oval Office.

They elevated Cuomo because they needed an anti-Trump. The liberal scorn for the hero-worship of President Donald Trump on the right was and remains all-consuming. But it didn’t prevent liberals from falling prey to exactly the same idolatrous condition.

Remember the elevation of Robert Mueller, the supposed Trump-slayer. Remember the deranged enthusiasm for porn-actress shyster-defender Michael Avenatti, thought maybe to be presidential caliber for 2020, now on his way to prison for extortion.

Leaders disappoint. They always do. Even the greatest have clay feet. The psalmist’s counsel is eternal. And our inability to follow it is also eternal, alas.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After a year of start-and-stop public-health measures, more often guided by intuition than by science, studies are confirming what economists long suspected: The COVID-19 lockdowns were an expensive, unnecessary failure — because they failed to account for individual responses to the pandemic.

Epidemiologists viewed lockdowns as the logical response to a new virus to which humans lacked immunity and that could overwhelm hospitals and cause many deaths. Yet health economists have long understood that people respond to incentives and alter their behaviors to avoid the risks and costs of infectious diseases. Epidemiologists failed to account for these voluntary changes in assessing what would happen without a lockdown.

The influential Imperial College of London model was typical. In March 2020, it predicted an exponential growth of cases that would overwhelm ICU bed capacity by April and cause 2.2 million US deaths by July. The authors recommended prolonged lockdowns until vaccines became available.

The model grossly overpredicted deaths because of critical errors, including an unrealistically high infection-fatality rate. Most important, its predictions were based on the “unlikely” scenario that there would be no changes in individual behavior.

The model used a reproduction number, or Rt, the average number of secondary infections that each infected person produces in a susceptible population, that was too high and, contrary to standard epidemiological practice, didn’t vary over time. In fact, Rt declines as people voluntarily avoid contact with others and as the number of recovered people no longer susceptible to infection grows.

The Imperial College model also assumed that hospital and ICU capacity was fixed and unchangeable. But hospitals voluntarily adapted to increasing COVID hospitalizations by limiting their elective procedures and redirecting assets. Instances of US hospitals reaching, let alone exceeding, capacity were rare.

Other businesses also made adjustments. Employers had incentives to limit workplace infections to reduce absenteeism, lower insurance costs and enhance their reputation as safe places to work and shop. University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan found that private companies voluntarily implemented infection-prevention measures that lowered workplace transmission to levels below household rates.

Failing to account for voluntary actions overstated the risks of the pandemic, creating a counterfactual that would never occur. Plus, it overstated the benefits of a lockdown, attributing entirely to mandates the improvements caused by a combination of voluntary responses and mandates.

Changes in individual behaviors generally precede government actions and can have a more significant impact. An early study of mobility data found that people had already started to reduce time outside their homes before the government implemented restrictions. In another study, the growth rate in COVID deaths across 23 countries and all US states fell from a wide range of initially high levels to nearly zero in 20 to 30 days in each region, regardless of differences in the type or degree of lockdown imposed.

In fact, there is little correlation between deaths and the imposition or severity of lockdowns, whether in US states or abroad. Sweden, criticized for its light restrictions, saw fewer cumulative deaths per million population (1,443) than did the European Union (1,648), the US (1,812) and Britain (1,888).

President Joe Biden referred to Texas’ early easing of restrictions as “neanderthal thinking.” REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein

Florida, condemned for fully lifting restrictions too early (September 2020), and Texas, accused of “Neanderthal thinking” for fully lifting restrictions in March 2021, have registered lower deaths per 100,000 than states with stringent, long-term restrictions like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan and Illinois.

People responded to the degree of risk they faced. COVID-19 fatality rates are closely connected to age: low for young people, rising dramatically for those aged 60 and older. Many people reduced their consumer spending in response to the pandemic, but older consumers reduced theirs by more than younger consumers.

Another study, using cell-phone location data of customer visits to millions of businesses, found that declines in traffic preceded lockdowns and that nearly all the overall decrease was explained by choices to stay home, which were highly influenced by the number of local COVID-19 deaths; government-imposed restrictions had little impact.

Lockdowns are an indiscriminate tool that can undermine more effective, particularized, private responses. Government mandates affect everyone, from high-risk individuals who would have taken precautions anyway to low-risk individuals who might not need the same level of protection.

In short, changes in behavior are more important than mandates. Most people don’t ignore risks, and they can react more quickly than governments. Even now, as the Delta variant spreads in some regions, and officials debate new lockdowns and other mandates, people are reacting to greater risk by altering their own actions, including getting vaccinated at improved rates.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@American Express, which made a $2.3 billion profit last quarter, invited the great-grandson of the Nation of Islam’s founder to tell its employees that capitalism is evil.

It was part of the credit card giant’s critical race theory training program, which asks workers to deconstruct their racial and sexual identities, then rank themselves on a hierarchy of “privilege.”

According to a trove of documents I’ve reviewed, AmEx executives created an internal “Anti-Racism Initiative” after George Floyd’s death last year, subjecting employees to a training program based on the core CRT tenets, including intersectionality, which reduces individuals to a tangle of racial, gender and sexual identities that determine whether he is an “oppressor” or “oppressed” in a given situation.

In a foundational session, the outside consulting firm Paradigm trained AmEx employees to deconstruct their own intersectional identities, mapping their “race, sexual orientation, body type, religion, disability status, age, gender identity [and] citizenship” onto an official company worksheet.

Employees could then determine whether they have “privilege” or are members of a “marginalized group”: White males presumably end up in the oppressor position, while racial and sexual minorities are considered oppressed.

In a related session, trainers instruct employees how to change their behavior in the office based on their relative position on the hierarchy. The trainers provide a blue flowchart with specific rules for interacting with black, female and LGBT employees: If members of a subordinate group are present, workers should practice “intersectional allyship” and defer to them before speaking.

In another handout, the instructions for white employees are even more explicit: “identify the privileges or advantages you have”; “don’t speak over members of the black and African-American community”; “it’s not about your intent, it’s about the impact you have on your colleague.”

Even common phrases are subjected to race-based regulation: White employees are told not to utter phrases such as “I don’t see color,” “We are all human beings” and “Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough” — all categorized as “microaggressions.”

At one high-profile “anti-racism” event, AmEx execs invited Khalil Muhammad — great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad — to lecture on “race in corporate America.” He argued that the system of capitalism was founded on racism and that “racist logics and forms of domination” have shaped Western society from the Industrial Revolution to the present.

“American Express has to do its own digging about how it sits in relationship to this history of racial capitalism,” Muhammad said. “You are complicit in giving privileges in one community against the other, under the pretext that we live in a meritocratic system where the market judges everyone the same.”

Muhammad then encouraged executives to begin “the deep ­redistributive and reparative work” and to “lobby [the government] for the kinds of social policies that reflect your values.”

More, Muhammad argued, the company should reduce standards for black customers and sacrifice profits in the interest of race-based reparations.

“If American Express cares about racial justice in the world, it can’t simply say the market’s going to define how we price certain customers, who happen to come from low-income communities,” he said. “If you want to do good, then you’re going to have to set up products and [product] lines that don’t maximize profit.”

Finally, in the flagship Anti-Racism Initiative training module, AmEx recommends a series of resources for employees to, quoting Ibram Kendi, “learn about covert white supremacy” and dedicate themselves “to the lifelong task of overcoming our country’s racist heritage.”

Employees are encouraged to listen to the “Beyond Prisons” podcast, which advocates for “prison abolition,” a movement committed to “eliminating imprisonment, policing and surveillance” altogether. Workers are also ­directed toward a series of articles that promises to “force white people to see and understand how white supremacy permeates their lives,” demonstrate that white children become racist before they can speak and persuade employees that Congress should pass legislation for race-based reparations.

Last October, AmEx announced a $1 billion “action plan” to increase diversity, invest in more minority-owned businesses and donate to nonprofits that promote “social justice.”

Whether the company will forgo profits or abandon capitalism, as it encourages its employees to do, remains to be seen.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She gave them a false sense of immunity.

A German nurse is being investigated for allegedly injecting thousands of people with a placebo instead of the coronavirus vaccine.

Based on witness testimony, police investigator Peter Beer said there was “a reasonable suspicion” that the rogue medical professional had administered shots of saline solution to up to 8,600 patients who were slated to receive the COVID jab, Reuters reported.

“I am totally shocked by this episode,” Sven Ambrosy, a local councilor, said of the alarming switcheroo, which reportedly occurred in March and April in Friesland in northern Germany.

It’s unknown why the shot-blocker — reportedly a Red Cross nurse — had injected people with blanks; however, she had reportedly broadcast anti-vax views on social media, investigators reported.

And while the faux jab was harmless, it may have disproportionately affected elderly people, who are at a greater risk of contracting the virus.

In order to prevent casualties from the fake shots, authorities are imploring thousands of people to get a second jab.

“The district of Friesland will do everything possible to ensure that the affected people receive their vaccination protection as soon as possible,” Ambrosy wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post.

Unfortunately, the nurse isn’t the first medical practitioner to express anti-vax views. In June, a Texas hospital suspended 178 employees for two weeks without pay for refusing to get the coronavirus vaccine.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Where America got Afghanistan wrong is “nation-building.” That’s a myth. Nations don’t build nations. Nations rebuild themselves. President Biden, predictably, learned the wrong lesson. The opposite of nation-building is not running away. It is being realistic.

After World War II, Japan rebuilt Japan. West Germany rebuilt West Germany. Sure, America helped, but you can’t help a people that aren’t willing or able to help themselves. These countries cleared the rubble and got to it. They also had an advantage. They were not being invaded while they were trying to rebuild. Not so Afghanistan.

Who can argue with the decision to oust the Taliban, the bastards that hosted the evildoers responsible for 9/11?

But after that we entered into a long period of trial and error — mostly error.

Afghanistan could never be rebuilt like Germany or Japan as long as the Taliban could continually cross over from Pakistan and threaten a comeback. There were few good options. President George W. Bush wanted to surge and seal the border. He left office before trying. President Barack Obama came in and made a half-hearted effort so he wouldn’t look weak. His heart wasn’t in it. He gave the military half the time and half the troops they needed.

Obama would have preferred to walk away like he did with other problems like Iraq, Syria and Libya. But with ISIS overrunning Iraq and Benghazi, he couldn’t afford to just pull the rug and see what happened. He happily handed the mess off to President Donald Trump.

Trump recognized nation-building in Afghanistan was nonsense. He also accepted the US had important interests. We didn’t want the country to turn into a terrorist Disneyland again that might attack us. Nor did we want the troubles of Afghanistan to destabilize South Asia. Nor did we want to look like a loser to the Taliban. These would just create another set of serious problems.

Trump scoped forces down to the minimum to deter the Taliban and protect US interests and started outcome-based negotiations with the Taliban, where our next steps would be based on them fulfilling their promises. Troop numbers were minimal.

We should have kept it this way — a small peacekeeping contingent to back up ­diplomacy.

Former President Donald Trump would have prevented the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan and protected America’s allies in the Middle East. AP

Biden evidently forgot the failures of foreign policy under Obama and immediately went back to the old playbook of walking away and seeing what happens. He probably suspected Afghanistan would collapse, as the military warned him. No doubt he thought the Taliban would wait until the US was gone. Of course, they didn’t.

Why would they pass up the opportunity to humiliate ­America?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On Monday, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ordered a “code red,” releasing a “landmark” report warning that global warming was an existential threat to humanity, “unequivocally” blaming humans and demanding rapid action to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.

“What the IPCC told us is what President Biden has believed all along,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki noted Tuesday. “Climate change is an urgent threat that requires bold action.”

The very next day, the Biden administration released a statement imploring the OPEC cartel to increase production of oil to help lower worldwide gas prices.

“Higher gasoline costs,” the White House said, “if left unchecked, risk harming the ongoing global recovery.” The White House wants OPEC to go above the 400,000-barrels-per-day increase it already promised to implement, which doesn’t seem to jibe with the notion that we are on the precipice of the apocalypse.

As an economic matter, of course, the request makes total sense: By pressuring exporters to pump more oil, a fungible commodity, we lower costs worldwide. Even though technology continues to create efficiencies that lower emissions, modernity relies heavily on affordable and reliable energy. Economies would collapse without it.

And for emerging nations, affordable fossil fuel remains a prerequisite for lifting billions of people out of poverty.

As a political matter, it might seem odd, to say the least, that Biden is imploring foreign nations to increase supply. Firstly, such a position runs contrary to virtually every “green” plan in existence — almost all of which intentionally, through mandates or bans or taxes or contrived “markets,” exist to make fossil fuels more expensive and reduce use.

Clean-energy advocates, including the president, argue that, in the aggregate, going green would be an economic plus. But if slightly higher prices threaten the world’s economic health, what would complete weaning from fossil fuels do to the economy? Biden has promised a “100 percent clean-energy economy” with “net-zero emissions” in only a few decades. Without some technological miracle, this is a fantastical, not to mention suicidal, goal.

The reality is that Biden couldn’t go a year in office without pleading with oilocracies to hike production. In his defense, one assumes, people will point out that COVID-19 presents a historically unique situation. As far as the economics of recovery go, not really. In fact, this man-made downturn should be easier to mend than most.

Though it’s probably an unpopular position, I’d be content importing cheap oil, or allowing others to flood the market, while saving our own supply for when new drilling becomes more economically feasible. But the hypocrisy of all this is that Biden works to restrict energy trade only in North America.

Earlier this year, the president rescinded oil- and gas-lease sales from most of the nation’s massive state-owned lands and waters, citing climate change. He then shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, revoking a permit that was needed to build a 1,200-mile project that would have carried around 830,000 barrels per day of Alberta oil-sands crude into the United States — probably more than enough to avoid begging OPEC for oil — again citing climate change.

At the same time, Biden lifted sanctions that would’ve blocked completion of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline that will transport fuel from Russia to Germany, which, like us, is a signee of the Paris agreement.

Americans, despite what they tell pollsters about climate change, demand affordable gas. You might recall that, despite his best efforts to undermine US energy production, former President Barack Obama took credit for the domestic oil-and-gas boom.

“That was me, people,” he told a crowd in 2018. Political pressure is also why the White House made sure its OPEC statement on gas prices was for public consumption, rather than simply making those requests of OPEC through diplomatic channels. The Green New Deal, whatever iteration of the plan you care to support, is unfeasible. Biden’s request is just another reminder.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This week, Gov. Cuomo was forced to resign after years of bullying, abuse, harassment, and predatory sexual behavior, all of which was corroborated in the attorney general’s report.

He disgraced himself and his family name, which is exactly why we need to rename the bridge which is adorned with his father’s name.

In 2017, Andrew Cuomo made a behind-closed-doors effort to put his family name on the Tappan Zee Bridge, erasing the Native American and Dutch history of the region, in an ego-driven deal made in the dead of night, made without any local input.

The simple truth is Gov. Cuomo viewed the new bridge as one of his greatest accomplishments. If he could have, he would have named it the Andrew M. Cuomo Bridge. He couldn’t, so instead he settled for his late father, Mario M. Cuomo. It was wrong then and it is wrong today.

That’s why I’ve introduced Bill A.6594, which would change the name of the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge back to its rightful name, the Tappan Zee Bridge.

I urge each and every one of my colleagues in the Assembly to back this piece of legislation, so that we can remove the stain of the Cuomo name and turn the page on Andrew Cuomo.

No one, especially survivors of sexual harassment and assault, should have to travel over the Cuomo Bridge and be reminded of Andrew’s horrible, perverted, predatory actions.

Let’s do the right thing, recognize the Native American and Dutch history of the Hudson Valley region, and restore decency and a neutral name to one of our state’s most iconic bridges.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Break out the egg creams and the Brooklyn ale! The Big Apple’s population grew by a humongous 629,057 souls — or 7 percent — from 2010-April 2021, according to the US census. Weren’t we told time and again that people were leaving town by the zillions?

But even as we pop the corks, bear in mind the data’s sneaky April Fools’ factor. The count reflected New York City’s population only as of April 1, 2020, before an undetermined number of people left town as the pandemic took hold, though also before some others moved in.

But the 10-year growth to a total 8.8 million stories in the naked city is wonderful news despite the caveats. It makes mush out of claims that residents rich, poor and in-between were fleeing town.

New York-haters blamed the now-debunked mass exodus model on “rising crime” long before it actually rose, and on high taxes that were all too real then and now.

Chest-thumping Mayor de Blasio on Friday ridiculously attributed the population bump in part to his “prekindergarten programs.” Hardly.

What the numbers prove beyond debate is the city’s undiminished appeal even in down times. Bad mayors, bad laws, even 9/11 . . . New York City still looms large in the American landscape. If you can make it here . . .

The latest residency rise came as no surprise to those of us who live here and get around a bit. How could we be shrinking when neighborhoods from the north Bronx to southern Queens sprouted new buildings that filled up as soon as they went on the market? And when streets and parks were so impassable that the temporary COVID-reduced density almost felt welcome?

Of course, we aren’t remotely out of the woods. The Delta strain gave the not-quite-banished virus a second wind that hopefully won’t last long.

Apartment sales and rentals rebounded after last year’s season of despair. But the commercial future grows darker the longer employees work from home. It’s a mortal threat to the office market and to the city’s revenue base if it goes on indefinitely.

Even a “hybrid” return will reduce companies’ space needs and leave landlords who pay the bulk of city and state taxes in a pickle. Meanwhile, store vacancies — which were soaring before anyone heard of COVID-19 — mushroom by the month.

But Gotham’s irrepressible life force surges on in ways great and small. Companies like Empire Health and Chubb are signing or negotiating huge new leases in Midtown. Meanwhile, multiplying Guyanese restaurants in Richmond Hill, Queens, affirm immigrant neighborhoods’ faith in the lit-up skyline’s promise.

NYC is still on the road to a full recovery, writes Steve Cuozzo. Ted Shaffrey/AP

One day COVID will be contained or banished. Until then, our swelling population promises that, to borrow from Yogi Berra, we ain’t over till we’re over — and we ain’t over yet.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Issue: The Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan after President Biden began to pull out American troops.

As much as I do not agree with anything President Biden does, I do not blame him for what is happening in Afghanistan (“Biden’s Saigon,” Aug. 13).

Former President Donald Trump wanted to do the same thing, and if you remember, the Democrats restricted his decision to remove our troops.

How many years are we supposed to be there? How many years of training does Afghanistan’s military need to learn how to defend itself? It was time to go. In fact, it was time years ago.

Rick Millman

Key West, Fla.

We begin to pull out after 20 years in Afghanistan and as soon as we do, the Taliban takes over.

The Taliban was in control 20 years ago, before we came in. So what did we do there? What was the point of it all if we changed nothing? How much life was lost for seemingly no change?

Does this set the stage for a return in 20 years, leaving Afghanistan in shambles, no better than it was when we entered?

We either need to step in and do what’s right, or butt out. We do no one any favors by half-doing things.

Let’s not put all the blame on Sleepy Joe, the commander-in-chief, as he heads to Camp David for the weekend to avoid the press.

The names of all those from US intelligence and the American military members who thought that the war in Afghanistan was going to end up any differently should be published. The fact that many of them still have jobs is criminal.

I watched video of the mooks from Afghan Security Forces marching around over 15 years ago and could’ve told you their heart wasn’t in it.

They couldn’t defend themselves, and they didn’t want to. The Afghan women, who finally got a taste of freedom because of America, should have been armed. They would have fared better.

Jake McNicholas

I feel that this administration lacks common sense.

Now we watch as the people who have helped us are slaughtered or raped. Find the Taliban and wipe them out with extreme prejudice.

Rob Spieler, Montrose

Vietnam, Iraq and now Afghanistan — does anyone else see a familiar pattern here?

We fight a war with insurgents, and the enemy waits patiently for us to grow weary of expending blood and money. They know if they hold out, we will quit and go home.

We need to stop nation-building in tribal countries that live a millennium in the past. When we pulled out of Iraq too early, the ISIS “JV team” morphed into first-string all pros.

Taliban terrorists can’t be negotiated with or bribed. By this Sept. 11, we will likely see the last chopper lifting off from the roof of our former Kabul embassy.

The horror we will see afterward will be on us for persuading these people to be our friends and promising to help defend them.

If Trump were still in office during the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, he would have returned with guns blazing for such aggression.

Instead, the Taliban, being well-aware that Biden would be a weak president, waited like a pack of jackals for Trump to leave office.

Biden has once again shown a lack of courage and intelligence and will attempt to buy his way out of this bloodbath, rather than standing up to the Taliban.

He has already washed his hands of any responsibility and, in effect, abandoned not only the women and children of Afghanistan, but the many young Americans who sacrificed their lives defending freedom.

I think Biden needs to keep in mind what the philosopher George Santayana once said: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

I hope that the evacuation in Afghanistan is not foreshadowing another lousy deal with Iran.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The slogan above The Washington Post’s banner captures the Left’s view of the allegedly authoritarian Donald J. Trump’s presidency: “Democracy dies in darkness.” It’s now time for a new credo, given the recent actions of President Joe Biden and his party: “Democracy dies in broad daylight.”

The Democratic Party’s handling of the renters’ eviction moratorium reveals its utter contempt for the separation of powers, the rule of law, private-property rights and the US Constitution itself. And they are not shy about this at all.

Five Supreme Court justices frowned on the Biden administration’s post-Jan. 31 extension of a moratorium that prevented landlords from booting tenants who could not pay their rent due to COVID-19-related economic woes. While the original legislation adopted in March 2020 applied only to federally subsidized residences, Team Biden also unilaterally and lawlessly included all rental properties.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote on June 29 that the Biden administration “exceeded its existing statutory authority by issuing a nationwide eviction moratorium.” He added, “In my view, clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation) would be necessary for the CDC to extend the moratorium past July 31.”

The court, in essence, gave Congress a month to pass a new law that, as much as it likely aggravated landlords, at least would have codified these protections for renters after open debate and public votes by elected representatives — as traditionally occurs in this constitutional republic.

While the Senate voted during 20 days in July, the House convened just 10 days last month and relaxed for 21. While Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her comrades savored hot dogs, sunshine, and sandy beaches, they also blew off their opportunity to write this lapsed moratorium into law.

“Congress has had plenty of time to consider the matter,” UC Berkeley law professor John Yoo and Claremont Institute scholar Robert J. Delahunty observed at National Review. “It simply has chosen not to use its authority.”

Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. AP

So, having failed to rally Congress from sloth into action, Biden could have issued an executive order from the White House (troublesome) or a regulation via the Department of Housing and Urban Development (legally baseless, but at least from a germane authority). Instead, Biden did something completely different: He ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to concoct a new moratorium, all by itself.

The CDC, in essence, turned itself into the Centers for Disease and Rent Control.

Huh?

The folks in charge of federal epidemiology now conduct housing policy? Will HUD now approve vaccines? Maybe the IRS can send astronauts to the International Space Station, and tax audits could be performed by the National Park Service.

“I went ahead and did it,” Biden said of the CDC’s brand-new eviction ban. “I can’t guarantee you the court won’t rule if we don’t have that authority, but at least we’ll have the ability, if we have to appeal, to keep this going for a month at least. I hope longer than that.”

Bidenese-to-English translation: Let’s defy the Supreme Court and molest the Constitution for as long as we can get away with it.

Also, bafflingly, Congress previously approved $46 billion in emergency rent relief. So far, only $3.3 billion have been paid out.

Why doesn’t Team Biden assure that the other 93.5 percent of the money already allocated for this purpose is distributed — for better or worse – before manhandling America’s political institutions and practices?

This executive fiat is being perpetrated by the same people who moaned that President Trump attacked American norms, assaulted the Constitution and acted “worse than Hitler,” as Refuse Fascism organizer Sunsara Taylor bizarrely told Tucker Carlson on Feb. 21, 2017 — just one month into Trump’s term.

In fact, Biden & Co. managed rent relief with insufficient competence or urgency. And then, after the Pelosi-Schumer Congress snored, they stomped on the Constitution with hiking boots.

This is reason No. 583 why friends should not let friends vote Democratic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This week brought the 20th anniversary of the Sbarro pizza-shop bombing in Jerusalem. Over those two decades, the Palestinian Authority’s “pay to slay” program has paid the seven terrorists who helped orchestrate the atrocity nearly $2 million. Meanwhile, Interpol has dropped its red notice warrant for terror attack mastermind Ahlam Tamimi, who remains at large.

On Aug. 9, 2001, suicide bomber Izz al-Din al-Masri nonchalantly ate a slice of pizza before blowing himself up, murdering 15 people — seven of them children, including US citizen Malki Roth — and wounding about 130 others. In the decades since, the PA has paid more than $53,000 to his family. The bomb maker, Abdullah Barghouti, has pocketed more than $213,000, while Tamimi has taken in $52,000.

Tamimi has been living in Jordan since Israel freed her in a 2011 prisoner swap, despite a US warrant (which the Jordanians refuse to honor) and a $5 million bounty on her head.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has been OKing new funding for the Palestinian territories, effectively subsidizing the PA’s pay-to-slay program. That’s the true face of the “peace process.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Snopes.com describes itself as the “definitive fact-checking site,” yet turns out to be a big source of misinformation: Its cofounder has written dozens of plagiarized pieces — many of them attacks on Republican politicos.

It’s just the latest example of “fact-checking” serving as a cover for partisan, left-wing opinion.

A BuzzFeed investigation found that Snopes’ David Mikkelson has “been lying to the site’s tens of millions of readers.” Snopes, which has served as a Facebook fact-checker, confirmed that Mikkelson published at least 54 plagiarized articles under various bylines.

His fake alter-ego, Jeff Zarronandia, claimed to be a Pulitzer Prize winner and had bylines “on at least 23 Snopes articles on topics like Donald Trump’s financial woes and false rumors about Hillary Clinton.”

Snopes has suspended Mikkelson from editorial duties pending “a comprehensive internal investigation.” But he’s still a company officer and 50 percent shareholder.

And Snopes has other problems. A Thursday piece complained, “Facebook Fails To Stem COVID Denialism Even as Delta Variant Surges,” and insisted that a post “misleadingly claimed: ‘Delta is a distraction! Get your eyes back on the border!’ . . . undermined the severity of the Delta variant surge.” That’s a fact check, for someone to suggest one news story is worth more attention than another?

Other “fact-checkers” play propagandist, too: PolitiFact, an actual Pulitzer Prize winner, this week rated “False” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s statement that there is “clear, legal authority” for arrest of those fugitive Texas lawmakers — when the state’s Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they could be arrested. The site claims, “While the language uses the word ‘arrest,’ there’s uncertainty about how this term is to be interpreted.” What does that even mean? Cruz was clearly right; PolitiFact was just mad about it.

This kind of bias is nothing new. Back in 2011, Mark Hemingway noted in The Weekly Standard that “the media seem oblivious to the distinction between verifying facts and passing judgment on opinions they personally find disagreeable.” He cited a university study that found of the 98 statements PolitiFact rated false in a year, 74 were made by Republicans.

Ten years later, media continue to tout PolitiFact, Snopes and countless other “fact-checkers” as gospel. Will Snopes’ downfall teach them a lesson they’ve failed to learn over a decade? We rate that “Unlikely.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For proof that Mayor Bill de Blasio’s talk of “equity” in education was always hollow, consider the city’s humiliating settlement this month resolving a 2017 lawsuit over the Department of Education’s failure to provide federally mandated services to special-needs Bronx kids.

The class-action lawsuit exposed the emptiness of the DOE’s voucher system for services such as occupational and speech therapy, since getting a voucher required parents to navigate a byzantine system — and didn’t remotely guarantee that they could find a vendor to actually provide the help. The settlement requires the DOE to make good on both fronts and to get kids who couldn’t access the services (often for years) a real chance to make up the lost ground.

The Bronx case is just the tip of the iceberg of the DOE’s citywide failures here. Two years ago, The City’s Yoav Gonen flagged bureaucratic bungling that left some students with disabilities going as many as four years without mandated services. Another analysis showed that kids in low-income minority areas are the least likely to be referred for evaluation to qualify for early intervention services to address issues such as autism.

Back in May 2018, the state found the city out of compliance (for the 13th straight year) with federal law on providing special-ed services.

Then-Chancellor Richard Carranza spent his tenure haranguing white and Asian parents about “implicit bias” and privilege while his DOE was ignoring the needs of vulnerable black and Hispanic children he claimed to be protecting.

Sadly, the court didn’t put a special monitor in charge of ensuring the DOE makes good on its latest promises, so it’s a fair bet that parents will soon have to sue again to get fair treatment for their kids.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@From the right: Dems Headed for a Shellacking

Democrats’ control of the House is “in serious jeopardy,” declares David Bossie at The Washington Times. “Not only is history working against them” — a new president’s party almost always loses seats in its first midterm — but Dems can afford to lose only four votes. And because of the left’s “radical agenda,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi may not be able to stop “sizable Republican gains.” Fact is, Democratic control of the White House and both houses of Congress has been “an unmitigated disaster”: Americans aren’t feeling much relief from COVID, crime is “on the rise,” the White House is ignoring inflation and spending trillions, and parents are fuming over critical race theory in schools. The midterms are just 15 months away, and Democrats “have nothing to show for it.”

Ex-cop: End the Left’s War on Cops

Americans are mourning after a Chicago cop was killed and another critically wounded last weekend, but “if decent Americans” don’t “change the narrative,” such attacks “may increase,” warns former Chicago officer Maurice Richards at The Hill. Police separate “civilization from chaos,” but they’re “under attack,” with more than 185 officers shot nationwide and 35 killed just this year. “Anti-police activists, progressive Democrats and some in left-leaning media organizations have put forth the myth that American policing is ‘systemically racist,’ ” yet “dehumanizing hate results in violence” against cops. The left’s “diabolical strategy” also includes a “takeover of state attorneys’ offices by ‘progressive’ prosecutors” who refuse to prosecute. Americans must connect their “prayers with action” — and “defeat the left’s pro-criminal policies and anti-police propaganda.”

Statistician: No Science Shows Masks Work

As much of the nation re-institutes mask mandates, Jeffrey H. Anderson at City Journal dives into what science actually says. The reality: Public-health authorities’ pre-March 2020 guidance — that masks aren’t effective in stopping COVID’s spread — “was much more consistent with the best medical research.” Though “randomized controlled trials” are seen as “the gold standard” in medical research, “the CDC basically ignores them.” Its favorite study “focused on two COVID-positive hairstylists at a beauty salon in Missouri” that lacked a control group. And of 14 RCTs that tested masks’ effectiveness against respiratory viruses, none showed “statistically significant evidence” of any benefit. “The best available scientific evidence” suggests Americans, “credulously trusting” public-health officials, have been masking “without blocking the transmission” of the coronavirus.

Faith beat: California Defaces Its Saintly Cofounder

Paul Kengor recently visited Ventura, Calif., and noticed that something was “palpably different,” he recalls at the National Catholic Register: The monument of Saint Junípero Serra had been removed — “erased by the mobs of the cancel culture.” The 18th-century Spanish Franciscan, a “cofounder” of the state, was canonized in 2015 by Pope Francis, who celebrated him for defending “the dignity of the native community.” Yet sadly, “such is not the view” of the “woke,” who falsely frame him as a génocidaire and forced the removal of the statue last summer. “One wonders why authorities” couldn’t arrest those “hellbent on destroying public property. . . . But lawlessly yanking down a massive monument is apparently an action not to be stopped in modern America.”

Conservative: Brace for Another School Closure

“Your child’s school will inevitably get shut down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” predicts The Federalist’s Jordan Davidson. The only question is when. “CDC guidance appears to suggest a full return to in-person learning” by fall, “with the disclaimers that masks must be worn by all students” and that those “eligible for the COVID-19 shot should receive it.” Yet the growing and ever-more arbitrary power of health bureaucrats means the guidance can shift on a dime: “All of a sudden, anything the health officials deem unsafe and not a priority could warrant widespread school closures in the CDC’s eyes. It wouldn’t be hard for them to change their minds. After all, they’ve flip-flopped on masks, lockdowns and other recommendations for more than a year.”

Lively posed poolside in a floral thong bikini for the saucy shot, quipping in her caption, “Go see @freeguymovie this weekend or you’ll be bummed.”

Reynolds, 44, promptly reposted the photo to his own Instagram Story.

Lively also supported her hubby at the “Free Guy” premiere last Wednesday, clad in a backless pink sequin gown by Prabal Gurung featuring sexy cutouts that framed her famous curves.

“What a huge night for #FreeGuy. And what a huge night for @blakelively because this means we’re Instagram official,” the “Deadpool” actor joked on Instagram after the event. “I know how important that was to her.”

Despite the New York City premiere marking the couple’s first red carpet outing in a year and a half, Lively and Reynolds have been keeping fans in the loop about their life at home during the pandemic.

The pair share three daughters: James, 6, Inez, 4, and Betty, 1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was not the kind of green light hitters want to see.

With the Mets and Dodgers tied in the top of the ninth inning Friday in front of a season-high 38,395 at Citi Field, a green light flashed onto Max Muncy’s face, halting play for a few minutes.

Muncy, batting with a runner on second and two out, collected himself before an 0-2 pitch against Edwin Diaz, but before he stepped into the box, his face turned green.

“Come on, jeez,” Ron Darling said on PIX11. “That’s just awful.”

Muncy immediately pointed left and the umpires conferred for several moments. There was no resolution, so Muncy stepped back into the box, and Diaz struck him out to end the inning. The light was not seen again.

“We don’t want that happening in a baseball game. Player safety — everyone’s safety — is always our priority,” said Mets manager Luis Rojas, who was not sure after his team’s 6-5, 10-inning loss if the culprit had been found. “I thought it might have been the best crowd of the season, so for that to happen, it’s just something that you don’t want to see.”

The scene was similar to an incident during a July game at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Red Sox, when a red light began flashing. An MLB investigation found no evidence of a rules violation by either team.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“American Idol” star Syesha Mercado is raising her voice against the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office after they seized her 10-day-old baby daughter in a harrowing moment captured in a now-viral video.

This is the second child that authorities have “forcefully and legally kidnapped” — as she describes it — under unclear circumstances in the past five months from the 34-year-old Sarasota, Florida native, who finished in the top three during the seventh season of TV’s long-running singing competition.

Deputies surrounded an SUV that Mercado, her newborn baby and her partner, Tyron Deener, were driving in Wednesday morning to conduct a surprise roadside welfare check, as captured in disturbing footage with more than 2.1 million views as of Saturday afternoon. Police then took custody of the infant to bring her to a hospital for a physical, presumably due to prior — still hotly disputed — allegations of malnutrition concerning the couple’s then 13-month-old son.

Mercado and Deener, 36, posted the incident on Instagram with the caption, “THEY TOOK OUR BABY AGAIN!.” The hour-long video shows multiple police vehicles flashing lights while two male deputies serve the couple with a court order to turn over their baby.

“Do you not feel anything? You guys, I’m human. This is my baby. My babies is days old — and you’re taking my baby away from me,” a crying Mercado can be heard saying in the chilling clip before starting to sob as four female child protective services caseworkers stand their ground.

The singer-actress — who starred in Broadway’s “The Book of Mormon” in 2014 — and Deener attempt to explain to authorities that they are “compliant and following every law,” adding that their daughter had already been seen by physicians just a day prior.

“You are traumatizing my baby. How could you guys do this?,” a distraught Mercado screams as her daughter is taken from her arms and placed alone in the back seat of a city vehicle. “… You have no heart. This is so wrong. I have the key to this city … I’ll hold it together. I’m strong.”

Mercado was indeed presented a key to the city of Sarasota during her “American Idol” hometown visit on May 9, 2008, which was proclaimed “Syesha Mercado Day” by local officials. She eventually finished third behind David Archuleta and that season’s winner, David Cook, on the show. She went on to headline the 2009-2010 national tour of “Dreamgirls,” which launched at Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater, opposite future 2021 Tony nominee Adrienne Warren, who stars as Tina Turner in “Tina” on Broadway.

A decade later, Mercado had to breastfeed her crying baby and provide authorities with a bottle of breast milk on the shoulder of a busy road, The Root reported.

The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office and Florida Department of Children and Families have not responded to The Post’s repeated requests for comment. The last listed professional representative for Mercado said “she’s not really working right now” but expressed concern about her situation. Attempts to contact her directly have been unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, her infant is still in protective custody, according to activist Donisha Prendergast, 36, founder of the We Have the Right to be Right social justice organization, who is advocating for the couple.

Five months earlier, Mercado and Deener’s 1-year-old son, Amen’Ra, also was placed into the system after Mercado’s breast milk supply started to run dry, and the boy would not accept other fluids, FOX Tampa Bay reported at the time. They took Amen’Ra to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg on Feb. 26 for help.

While there, Prendergast’s organization alleges that the little boy was examined by Dr. Sally Smith, the controversial subject of a 2020 USA Today Network investigation after she was accused of being “too quick to diagnose child abuse,” which Smith has denied. Investigators reviewed hundreds of Smith’s cases and found more than a dozen instances where charges were later dropped — but the caregivers names were left irreparably smeared forever.

Dr. Smith did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Almost two weeks after Amen’Ra was admitted, CPS and armed Pinellas County Police officers reportedly ordered Mercado and Deener out of the hospital amid allegations of “trespassing” and “severe malnutrition.” Their son was discharged in late March and immediately transferred by CPS into foster care.

During the ongoing fight to get their son back, the couple asked that all caseworker interactions be facilitated through their lawyer, said Deener, a youth service professional who works in the foster care system. When CPS investigators showed up at their home upon learning Mercado gave birth to her daughter without alerting them, they were refused entry and referred to said attorney. That’s when the agency reportedly received approval to conduct a welfare investigation and remove their newborn.

“My baby is healthy and happy,” a desperate Mercado is heard telling them during the roadside seizure. “All you had to do was call the attorney. We have all the paperwork.”

Prior to this week’s events, the parents had launched a GoFundMe — titled “The Legalized Kidnapping of Black Babies Through CPS” — and more than $327,000 has been raised as of Saturday, surpassing their posted $200,000 goal to cover legal bills.

“I am a pregnant, breastfeeding mama who went to the hospital with the intention to get my [son], Amen’Ra, some fluids while transitioning from extended breastfeeding to being bottle-fed,” Mercado’s crowd-sourcing campaign pitch reads. “On March 11 … Amen’Ra was forcefully and legally kidnapped from us by CPS, who claim we refused a B-12 shot that was a matter of life and death, which is an absolute lie.”

However, authorities did tell local media outlets that medical staff reported Mercado and Deener for turning down a B-12 intramuscular shot, as recommended by hospital doctors, a claim that Mercado adamantly denies.

“We never refused a B-12 shot, and at no point was he on the verge of death,” she said before her second child was taken into custody. “Our [son] has since been placed with a white foster family without interviewing qualified relatives or friends of our family for placement while they investigate. We are given limited information and presently only have weekly zoom visitation for an hour with … no court order stating these visitation limitations.”

Mercado has vowed to keep fighting.

During her time on “AI,” The Post took note of her survival skills: “In the ‘Idol’ dictionary under ‘drama’ lies Syesha’s week in Hollywood. The uber-talented singer spent the whole week on vocal rest to overcome a strained throat, cold and myriad of other complications. But when time came to fight for her spot in the competition, one of the most determined contestants in show history knocked it out the box.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Groper is almost gone and Mayor Putz is moving toward the exit. Who says there’s no good news?

Andrew Cuomo’s resignation and the term-limited end of Mayor de Blasio give New York state and city much-needed chances for fresh starts. While the slate isn’t wiped clean, the unusual near-simultaneous changes at the top create an opening to clean up the mess the two men helped create and reverse the sharp decline of recent years.

Put it this way: Kathy Hochul in Albany and, presumably, Eric Adams in City Hall can’t screw up more than Cuomo and de Blasio.

Over the last eight years, their performance confirmed them as the worst team of governor and mayor in modern times.

Successful teamwork doesn’t require the top officials to like each other, and most don’t. Oddly, the screeching is loudest when they hail from the same party.

Democrats Mario Cuomo and Ed Koch were born to battle, and Republicans George Pataki and Rudy Giuliani had a blood feud that wouldn’t quit.

Yet they and nearly all other combinations over the last 50 years understood they had to work together toward common goals. They realized, in broad terms, that what is good for the five boroughs is good for the whole state, and vice versa.

Cuomo and de Blasio didn’t see it that way. They were former friends who became bitter enemies and let their personal hatred interfere with their public duties. They rarely spoke.

Most of the blame falls on Cuomo, whose dark mind and towering ego led him to spend more effort trying to one-up de Blasio than helping the city.

During the COVID crisis, for example, there were times when de Blasio proposed an idea, only to have Cuomo ridicule it one day and adopt it the next day, as if he thought of it.

The more the city suffered from crime, education rot and the virus, the more petty Cuomo became. He acted as if his only job was to criticize de Blasio as incompetent.

Eric Adams is likely to be the next mayor of NYC. Gabriella Bass

He was right, and you can add corrupt and lazy, too. But de Blasio’s failings are an argument for why Cuomo should have gone the extra mile to help. A governor who cared about the population and economic center of the state would have done something besides throw bombs from the sidelines.

Had Gov. Hugh Carey behaved that way when Mayor Abe Beame flopped during the ’70s fiscal crisis, the city would have gone belly up and might not have recovered. Instead, Carey engineered solutions and city and state both benefitted.

Cuomo, on the other hand, actually hurt the city in three critical areas over recent years.

First, although de Blasio is anti-police, Cuomo embraced an equally bad idea by signing the so-called bail-reform law that turned courthouses into revolving doors.

Second, de Blasio is upfront about his virulent opposition to charter schools and turned the Department of Education over to the rapacious unions.

Cuomo claimed to be for charters but stabbed the organizers and the poor families who count on them in the back. The governor once fought for increasing the number of charters and vowed to be the students’ lobbyist. But in recent years, he surrendered to the teachers unions on raising the number of available charter slots, with the result that no more schools can open in the city.

Third, on taxes, de Blasio believes the more the merrier and never said otherwise. Cuomo took office in 2011 saying New York had no future as the nation’s tax capital, but 11 years later, it retains that destructive distinction.

Fortunately, the city’s limit of two terms saved Gotham from the prospect of more de Blasio. But Albany has no term limits and had he not been pushed to resign after the attorney general’s finding that he sexually harassed 11 women, Cuomo would have been in office for another year and might have won a fourth term in 2022.

His bullying and obsession with revenge had become a drag on New York long before the groping scandal ended his toxic tenure. But never to be forgotten is his lethal order sending infected COVID patients to nursing homes and his corrupt attempts to hide the truth.

Against that grim record, Hochul will benefit just from not being him. Her pledge to rid the government of anyone who behaved unethically during the harassment saga sets the right tone, as did her first press conference where she took more questions than Cuomo did in several months.

Her reputation for common-sense initiatives will be tested by the radical, spendthrift Legislature, but a public sick of Cuomo will give her a honeymoon.

Her top order of business must be to align with Adams, whose focus on fighting crime will increasingly take center stage as the general election nears. Her support for his agenda would be a powerful symbol and bring practical results in Albany that could be replicated in upstate cities also facing crime waves.

And imagine the impact if they combined forces to press for an increase in the charter cap.

Another key area is rebuilding the MTA leadership, which Cuomo destroyed. The subways are especially critical to the city’s recovery, but the MTA is a state agency, so teamwork is vital.

In these and other ways, seeing the new leaders working together to make New York safe and vibrant again would create a much-needed spirit of public optimism across the Empire State. Their cooperation would also be the perfect antidote to the long nightmare of Cuomo and de Blasio.

Covering all bases

Reader Gene Zonis, noting the Cleveland Indians are now the Cleveland Guardians, raises a question: “Is the US government going to change the name of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Bureau of Guardian Affairs?”

As Bam foretold: Biden is effing up

“Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to f- -k things up.”

That’s what Barack Obama said about his former vice president, Joe Biden, last year. Events are proving Obama was on to something.

Biden has set in motion two humanitarian disasters, and both could have been avoided. The debacle of the southern border being flooded with illegal crossers, many of them COVID-infected, and the Taliban atrocities in Afghanistan are the direct result of decisions he made.

On the border, he dismantled the web of agreements and rules put in place by Donald Trump that cut the migrant flow to a trickle. Now, new arrival records are set every month, and the White House seems paralyzed.

Trump called for an end to our military presence in Afghanistan and made a bad deal with the Taliban, but Biden is the one who decided to remove the troops suddenly and without coordinating with Afghan forces.

As military historian Fred Kagan writes in The New York Times: “A responsible withdrawal needed more time and better preparation. History will record Mr. Biden, a supposed master of foreign policy for decades, as having failed in this most critical assignment.”

F- -k-ups don’t get much bigger.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This is progress?

New York got its first female governor this week, and with it came the reflexive hosannas, online and in the mainstream media: How wonderful, how momentous, what another great stride for women.

I wish I felt the same.

Instead, what I see is what we so often see post-#MeToo: a powerful man toppled by allegations of sexual harassment and misogyny, such behavior often an open secret, replaced — either by circumstance, design, or a combination of the two — by a woman.

Most times, these women are as qualified as their male counterparts — if not more so, because they tend to bring along a work ethic devoid of bullying, harassing or violent behavior.

Think about it. When Matt Lauer was finally fired from the “Today” show — his sexual predation an open secret for years — NBC promoted Hoda Kotb to co-anchor with Savannah Guthrie. They became the first female co-anchors in “Today” show history.

Progress? Sure, to a point. It was also a cynical, cosmetic overture by NBC brass, who were simultaneously trying to explain why they killed an exposé of Harvey Weinstein later published in The New Yorker.

It felt like tokenism, NBC getting these two likable women on the cover of People magazine, touting the “Today” show as still one big happy family, NBC’s male-dominated brass hiding behind their skirts, having them be emotional — “Our Hearts Were Broken” read the headline — rather than tough, smart, pragmatic and yes, outraged.

You know, things powerful men are allowed to be but women still are not.

At the height of #MeToo, half of the 201 men taken down were replaced by women, according to The New York Times. A few examples: Amazon head Roy Price replaced by Jennifer Salke, “House of Cards” lead Kevin Spacey replaced by Robin Wright, Charlie Rose by Christiane Amanpour, Sen. Al Franken by Tina Smith.

The question remains: Is this really what it takes for true gender parity in the workplace? Are women still only rising to power positions as mea culpas? Why are women, as a talent pool, still so often relegated to Number Two status when so many powerful men are revealed to be mediocrities, incompetents, abusers or corrupt?

Kathy Hochul seems like she will be a good governor, maybe even a great one. Her elegance this week comes hard-earned: Appointed Erie County Clerk in 2007 by then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer, later known as Client No. 9, she rose to Congress in 2011 after her male predecessor, Rep. Chris Lee, was caught up in a sex scandal.

She lost that seat in her next election to Chris Collins, who is now serving two years in federal prison for fraud.

This is what it took for us to get our first female governor — smart, capable, well-liked, scandal-free. Her first term will always be tagged with an asterisk — not duly elected. She had to spend her first presser last week distancing herself from Cuomo. What should have been a victory lap was sullied by his shadow.

Yet as Cuomo recedes from public life (unless he faces criminal charges for the nursing home scandal and his sexual harassment charges, as he should), hopefully Hochul breaks this particular glass ceiling for good. She has already said she will seek election to a full term as governor. She will likely face off against state Attorney General Letitia James, who rose to power after Eric Schneiderman was credibly accused of abusing women and who, in a feat of poetic symmetry, brought Cuomo down.

Now that would be a fight to see.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Joe Biden and Democrats keep telling Americans not to worry about inflation, that it’s only temporary. Yet the record price hikes keep getting worse.

On Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yet another jump, a full 1 percent, in the producer price index (which measures prices before they reach consumers) for the month of July. Wholesale prices are now up 7.8 percent over the past year, the fastest annual surge since such recordkeeping began in 2010.

On Wednesday, the BLS reported consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in July, or 5.4 percent over the past year — maintaining June’s yearly pace, the largest in 13 years.

Biden actually bragged that it wasn’t even higher, yet wages are up only 4 percent from a year ago, so Americans have lost ground.

And the prez is clearly worried: “There are going to be ups and down,” he rationalized Wednesday, announcing several (useless) steps to curb the spike, like “bringing together” port operators to encourage speedier operations and boost supplies and begging the Arab oil cartel to up production.

Meanwhile, he’s rushing to shell out trillions more in federal cash — via a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package and $3.5 trillion in social spending, just months after his nearly $2 trillion COVID relief package followed $4 trillion in COVID spending last year. (What’s a few trillion, here and there, right?)

Trouble is, all the new cash pumped into the economy — particularly the hundreds of billions funded with debt — is only fueling already pent-up demand, even as supplies remain bottlenecked.

Average Americans are fretting, too: A whopping 86 percent say they’re concerned about inflation, a Fox News poll showed Wednesday, and 79 percent blame at least part of it on Biden policies.

Those at the bottom suffer most: Prices are up for housing, food, energy, new vehicles and other goods. About 75 percent of those with incomes under $50,000 cite rising grocery and gas prices for their financial woes.

“The degree to which lower-income households are feeling the squeeze on food and fuel . . . highlights the risk that inflation could push families on the brink over the financial edge,” warns Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, one of the poll’s directors.

Washington clearly needs to hit the brakes. Emergency relief was needed in the depths of the pandemic, but Democrats’ continued drive to spend is only spreading misery.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If Gary Gensler sounds a lot like Elizabeth Warren, it’s not by accident but by design. He needs the powerful progressive senator in his corner to fulfill his ultimate, career-fulfilling goal, which, according to sources, is having his signature on the dollar bill as treasury secretary.

Gensler just took the job as Securities and Exchange Commission chief. But people who have seen him in action for years as he served in various Treasury posts and as a commodities regulator in the Obama administration say his bureaucratic ambition knows no bounds. He’s thinking bigger than being the guy who runs what is essentially an investor-protection agency.

That’s where the firebrand Massachusetts senator comes in.

Gensler is fully aware of the enormous power Warren wields in the Democratic economic policy circles, and he has been making inroads with her since his time in the Obama administration, if not earlier.

Warren’s star first rose during the 2008 financial crisis when she went on an anti-bank crusade.

Since then, she has spread her anti-business venom beyond banks to just about every aspect of corporate America. As much as the socialist Bernie Sanders called the shots on the Biden’s administration’s latest $3.5 trillion welfare state-expanding spending blow-out, anyone vying for a top economic job in this White House must pass the Warren litmus test.

When she says jump, the answer is how high.

Gensler has been jumping high for Warren from the minute he took over at the SEC, so high in fact that it’s easy to forget his formative years as a Goldman partner earning gazillions on the fruits of capitalism and deal ­making.

Warren wants more diversity on corporate boards, and Gensler suddenly pushed for a board-diversity disclosure mandate for public companies.

Warren said nefarious traders might be gaming something called payment for order flow (where discount brokers sell their client orders to Wall Street firms so they can offer cheap or no-commission trades). Presto, Gensler says he will begin to scrutinize the obscure and harmless practice.

Most recently, Warren started railing about swindles in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency business, and, you guessed it, Gensler announced a sweeping crackdown on digital-coin fraud even though the SEC does not really have the statutory authority to do so.

People who worked in the Obama administration’s Treasury tell me Gensler was among a couple of candidates at the top of the list to run the department if Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump in 2016. Missing out for the job by a few thousand votes in a handful of states only fueled Gensler’s ambition to reclaim it at his next available opportunity, these people say.

When the SEC post came open with Biden’s election, the uber-ambitious Gensler saw his opening to make it to the Treasury. Biden had selected the former Fed chair Janet Yellen to run Treasury, but at 75 years of age, she will not be there forever given the job’s high burnout rate.

Replacing Yellen at Treasury won’t occur overnight, of course. Gensler needs some lefty policy victories on his résumé for him to push for the job, which he’s busy compiling. More importantly, he needs Warren in his corner, which he’s busy jumping for.

Fat cats shed no tears for Cuomo

The resignation of Andrew Cuomo was supposed to be a blow to the New York business community, including its biggest players in banking and real estate. The soon-to-be former governor billed himself as the last line of defense of big business here. With him gone, the AOC-types in Albany would eat them alive with taxes, regulations and a lot more.

For a time, Cuomo’s pitch made business leaders here rationalize his blind spots, i.e., his temper and egomaniacal nature (they say they had no idea about the groping), his bullying and his uneven policies that included harsh business closures during COVID that nearly destroyed the state’s economy.

But when Cuomo finally resigned, that time had run out. Business leaders said he burned them far too many times in recent years, including the tax increases in Cuomo’s last budget, a total cave to the left that will expedite the flight of high earners and companies from the state. Putting up with his awful presence just wasn’t worth it any longer.

Were they cheering Cuomo’s exit? Not really, because the AOC-types are sure to try and flex their muscles. But the fat cats are hardly shedding tears either. As one business-group leader told me, Cuomo became so toxic to deal with, he didn’t just harass those 11 women cited in the AG’s report, “he harassed ­everyone.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@With the Delta variant continuing to surge, President Joe Biden claims, “We are still on a wartime footing, and every American who is eligible should take immediate steps to get vaccinated right away.”

But his Food and Drug Administration is already back in peacetime, dragging its feet on giving final OK to the vaccines that have gone into 165 million American arms. More, it has stopped giving new emergency approvals for anti-COVID treatments and technology, and is even rescinding some it made over the last year and a half.

Biden needs to take a page from his predecessor and kick the agency out of its normal plodding pace.

Yet he doesn’t seem to have a clue: Seven months in office amid the pandemic, he hasn’t even nominated a permanent FDA head. That’s pretty “peacetime.”

A day after his “wartime footing” brag, Biden told reporters, “God willing, the FDA is going to be coming out in a reasonable time frame to say this vaccine is totally safe.

God willing? It’s your will that’s lacking here, sir.

Biden’s top medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, says the absence of permanent approval is just a “technicality” and Americans should act as if it’s real.

Should, sure, but such talk won’t persuade the vax-hesitant. Three in 10 unvaccinated adults say they’d be more likely to get jabbed if a vaccine got full approval, the Kaiser Family Foundation found. That rises to half in the “wait and see” unvaxxed group.

It’s the No. 1 thing that would move vax hesitancy — even $100 payments only move the needle for 15 percent, Kaiser determined.

Yet all signs are that the FDA won’t give full approval to Pfizer’s jab (the first of three to get emergency-use OK last year) before September.

Heck, it seems to be actively stalling: “They required two extra months of safety data after the clinical trial was done, which is not really normal either,” notes University of South Florida Health virologist Michael Teng.

And FDA leaders have delegated the approval — as per “peacetime” practice — to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Office for Vaccines Research and Review, the Office of Biostatistics and the Office of Compliance. How many levels of bureaucracy do we need “on a wartime footing”?

Meanwhile, White House officials say Biden may take weeks to even pick a successor to Janet Woodcock, the acting commissioner. The prez said recently, “We’re working on that very hard to make sure we can get it passed,” implying his team can’t find a nominee it thinks will get Senate confirmation. It should be easy enough, if you pick someone nonpolitical.

Yes, the FDA gave emergency-use authorization to monoclonal antibody treatment REGEN-COV last month, but that’s an exception. Meanwhile, it rescinded the OK for investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, in April and last month barred providers from using unapproved respirators or reusing disinfected respirators, deciding the supply of N95 masks was enough.

“It’s very similar to a recall,” Marcus Schabacker of health-care safety group ECRI told Modern Healthcare, noting that providers constantly need to track what the FDA still allows.

It’s lunacy to handcuff frontline health professionals working to stave off the surge and madness to simply pray for FDA action on the jabs.

Biden is in charge of the FDA. He should start acting like it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@China syndrome

It is amazing how the almighty dollar, greed and financial recklessness can create strange bedfellows (“China’s US Data Threat,” Aug. 10).



Many technological and other goods in the United States and Europe are imported from Communist China, a persecutor and suppressor of freedom and human rights, and also the greatest enemy and hostile threat that we face.



We can thank ourselves for creating and continuing to empower this huge monster. US manufacturing and industrialization was one of the major components that made our country the great economic and military power that we are today.



Concern for the environment is often cited as a major reason for the loss of much US manufacturing, which has greatly contributed to huge unemployment, the decline of the middle class and the blight of our once-beautiful cities.



Isn’t it hypocrisy on our part that now China is ruining the environment to a degree that the United States and other nations could never even fathom?

Biden’s oil idiocy

Gasoline prices at the pump here in the United States are up, so our president is calling the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pleading with the organization to increase oil production to help bring down prices (“Biden demands OPEC boost oil production amid rising gas prices,” Aug. 11).



Just seven short months ago, President Biden destroyed the energy independence that had taken us decades to achieve.



He killed the Keystone XL pipeline and wiped away oil exploration and fracking on federal lands. Now we are once again dependent on foreign oil.



Then, in a public address, this man tells our nation that he is going to now “investigate big oil companies” to make sure they are not price-gauging.



Yet most Americans are completely unaware that in the Bakken Fields in the Dakotas, we are sitting on untapped proven oil reserves. The Biden policies continues to puzzle me.

Failing NYC’s kids

Yet another failure by the city’s Administration for Children’s Services (“ ‘Sibling’ Horror,” Aug. 12).



Another innocent child was left to die while the same platitudes are being said, such as: “Our top priority is protecting the safety and well-being of all children in New York City.”



Tell that to Julissia Batties. Her brief time on this Earth and the tale of her home life brought me to tears.



It begs the question — where is the father or fathers of these seven children to a 35-year-old mother?



Her family, including her grandmother, failed her. I am a grandmother, and I’ll be damned if any grandchild of mine is left in a violent and dysfunctional home, no matter what.



When will men take care of the children they make, and when will mothers stop being so irresponsible? Rest in peace, Julissia. Heaven is a far better place for you.

Google pay snub

It seems to me that if Google is saving resources on office space because employees are opting to telecommute, those savings should be passed on to those employees (“Google burn$ burbs,” Aug. 11).



Not to mention that telecommuting can improve productivity. Google is not rewarding that, and now it is penalizing employees for where they live. It is an indication of bias and potential discrimination. The value of work accomplished should be the only determinant of pay.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For decades, Joe Biden has touted himself as a foreign policy genius. As a United States senator, he never had to make a decision or bear responsibility for running off at the mouth. As vice-president, he was given backwaters such as Ukraine that he reportedly turned into a family piggy bank.

But now he is president. He owns the utter disaster that Afghanistan has become; and the sudden about-face of the Pentagon to send 3,000 fully-armed combat troops back into the fray shows that even the woke military bosses Biden installed can wake up and smell the coffee.

Would Donald Trump have done this differently?

Remember that Trump fired Ambassador John Bolton as national security advisor when Bolton openly rebelled against Trump’s decision to negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban.

Trump’s deal set a firm withdrawal date for U.S. combat troops — May 1, 2021.

But that’s where the similarities with Biden end. As Trump recounted three weeks ago at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Phoenix, he bombed the Taliban to the negotiating table.

After warning Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada that he would “come back and hit you harder than any country has ever been hit” if he welched on the deal, Trump made good on his threat and launched punishing airstrikes the first time the Taliban violated the agreement.

Since then, not a single U.S. soldier has died in combat in Afghanistan.

Trump also maintained U.S. fighter jets and armed drones at Bagram airbase and used them to keep the Taliban in check. Biden ordered the midnight evacuation of the airbase on July 5 without even notifying the Afghan military. Not surprisingly, within hours the Taliban had looted the base and today our remaining troops have no U.S. air cover.

The Pentagon is desperate to avoid a rout that is broadcast live on prime time. They want no helicopters taking off from the roof of the U.S. embassy with desperate Afghans clinging to the skids, as happened in Saigon in 1975. They want no Blackhawk downs, or civilian contractors hung from bridges, all of which could have happened if they had allowed Biden’s retreat to continue as planned.

“All those lives lost, and we didn’t resolve anything,” said Bill Craun, a former private military contractor in Afghanistan and Iraq who has authored a new book, Working the Kill Zone. “Now the Taliban is going to kill everyone who had anything to do with us.”

The Pentagon estimated on Friday that the Taliban will sweep into Kabul in thirty days. I would treat that prediction like last night’s beer. My bet is, the Taliban will arrive the day after U.S. troops complete the evacuation from the capital. And then the real killing will begin.

Biden owns this, personally. And every Gold Star family should remind him of that fact.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Amy Cooper is possibly the internet’s most famous “Karen” — the pejorative used for a demanding, entitled white woman.

In a video that went instantly viral last year, the Central Park dog walker summoned law enforcement to protect her from a black birdwatcher, whose race she mentions three times in a matter of moments: “I’m going to tell them there’s an African-American man threatening my life.”

The video flooded social media alongside a second one filmed that same day: the horrifying footage of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of a man named George Floyd. The conflation of these two stories in the public imagination began almost immediately — and not without cause. The Central Park video looked really bad.

The New York Times ran a dozen stories, letters, and Op-Eds in the first week alone. A rattled Gayle King said it felt like “open season” on black men. Trevor Noah said that Amy “blatantly knew how to use the power of her whiteness to threaten the life of another man and his blackness.”

By the next day, Amy Cooper had been doxxed, had lost her job, and had surrendered her dog, issuing a half-hearted defense and then an abject apology. Birdwatcher Christian Cooper (no relation) would go on to become a minor celebrity, heralded across the media and even by Joe Biden, who declared, “You made an incredible contribution at a very important moment.”

Though I know neither of the Coopers, this scenario felt uncomfortably familiar to me. I was born and raised in a culture of public judgment: the Westboro Baptist Church, also known as the “God Hates Fags” people. My grandfather founded the church, and I was among its most passionate evangelists.

More than 20,000 of my own tweets catalog my misdeeds — most egregiously, public celebrations of tragedy outside the funerals of American servicemen, victims of natural disasters, and anyone who spoke out against my church’s message. “God Is Your Enemy” and “You’re Going to Hell” were two of my favorite protest signs. I often held them while dancing atop an American flag.

I left the church nearly a decade ago, after becoming convinced that the religion I’d been taught from birth was destructive and cruel. Twenty-six years of loudly attacking the “sins” of others — only to realize that my own had often been worse — taught me that life was far, far more complicated than I’d been raised to believe.

So when I encounter viral moments like the one involving the Coopers — the angel and the villain so neatly laid out — my first instinct is to ask: What context am I missing here?

Here the answer was: an awful lot.

For starters, there was the Facebook post Christian shared when he uploaded the original video, which his sister posted on Twitter hours after the encounter. In his post, Christian recorded his contemporaneous account of what happened in the moments before the camera started rolling. “Look, if you’re going to do what you want, I’m going to do what I want, but you’re not going to like it,” Christian recounted himself saying to Amy. He also shared that he’d pulled out “the dog treats I carry for just for [sic] such intransigence.”

He threatened her, I thought, stunned. He says himself that he approached her — a woman alone in a wooded area. He tried to lure away her dog. How was this the first time I was reading these details? Had I just missed them in the other stories I’d read?

A Washington Post article summarized the conflict this way: Christian Cooper “approached the dog’s owner early on Monday with a request: Could she leash up the canine, as the park rules required? Amy Cooper said she would be calling the police instead.” And even though the article included a link to Christian’s Facebook post, the text of the article failed to mention the threat at all.

Then I read a 2,500-word report from the New York Times purporting to be “the inside story.” Its opening paragraphs offered a detailed account of the conflict — until it came to Christian’s threat. Instead of quoting him, they summarized with: “They exchanged words.” I wondered if they were even aware of what Christian Cooper had said. Then I found it buried in the story’s closing paragraphs, long after most readers would have moved on.

Kmele Foster, co-host of The Fifth Column podcast, has spent the past several months reporting this story and uncovered important context, including a May 2020 testimony provided by Jerome Lockett, a black man who said Christian had “aggressively” threatened him in the park. Among the details: “If I wasn’t who I was, I would of [sic] called the police on that guy too.” Lockett also said: “My two fellow dog owners have had similar situations with this man, but don’t feel comfortable coming forward because they’re white. They think they’ll be seen as some ‘Karen’ or whatever.”

At first blush, reexamining this conflict seems like a meaningless hill to die on. Amy Cooper, at least in that video, seems an easy figure to revile. (And attacking Christian, who later said of Amy, “I don’t know if her life needed to be torn apart,” isn’t my purpose here.)

Rather, to tell this story is to expose a different set of problems — hallmarks of my Westboro past.

Among them: our collective intoxication with public shaming. The assumption, based on a scrap of video, that we understand an entire narrative without knowing all the facts. And the mercilessness shown to those at the center of these storms, often leaving them suicidal and broken.

Finally and most importantly, the media’s complicity in perpetuating public judgments. This break in my faith — in this case, with the media organizations I’d trusted most — is what returns me most powerfully to Westboro. America’s distrust in the media is a massive and growing problem. Yet unlike my former church, the press isn’t a small, relatively powerless community from which we can simply walk away.

This piece originally appeared on bariweiss.substack.com
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Between 1980 and 2017, the share of adults with at least a four-year college degree doubled, from 17 percent to 34 percent. The Great Recession intensified the trend; from 2010 to 2019, the percentage of people 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher increased by 6 percentage points, to 36 percent, where it sits today.

At the same time, the college degree is declining in status. It’s not just metaphorical to say that a master’s degree is the new bachelor’s degree: about 13 percent of people aged 25 and older have a master’s, about the same proportion that had a bachelor’s in 1960.

A graduate degree is enticing for various reasons. Not only does it give the recipient bragging rights, it helps find stable employment, gives more of a boost into higher-level positions and, most decisively, leads to a fatter paycheck. While workers holding a bachelor’s degree can no longer expect higher earnings as much as they once did, master’s graduates have been happily watching their salaries rise. As a result, more graduates with a BA have crowded the high-end labor market, causing even more students to pursue a master’s or Ph.D.

This paper chase has put young people and their parents in a demoralizing, self-perpetuating arms race. Postgraduate degrees are expensive, which usually means student loans. Though graduate students are only 19 percent of student borrowers, they account for 40 percent of student debt.

But for American society as a whole, this hyper-credentialism is a slow-motion disaster, with the biggest losers at the bottom of the labor market. Many jobs that used to be available to high school grads only a decade or two ago now demand at least a four-year degree, bringing more despair in working-class communities and more polarization in the country. According to The Wall Street Journal, more than 40 percent of manufacturing workers now have a college degree, up from 22 percent in 1991.

Degree inflation also widens the nation’s class divide. The prospect of debt deters low-income students from pursuing degrees that could lead to a lucrative career, according to a 2020 paper, “Inequality and Opportunity in a Perfect Storm of Graduate Student Debt.”

Universities are the prime culprit in driving this hyperactive credentialism. Over the past decades, many colleges have struggled to balance their books amid state cuts, regulatory requirements and a customer base resistant to hikes in already obscene tuitions. Graduate programs are their solution to the cash shortage: Graduate students can borrow considerably more federal money than undergrads can.

Both young people and their parents yearn for alternatives to college, such as apprenticeship programs. Shutterstock

Meanwhile, employers, universities and students seem to have convinced themselves that credentials are a proxy for skills. But as the Urban Institute’s Robert Lerman observes, an academic’s idea of “skills” doesn’t really provide trade workers — or, say, occupational therapists — what they need in order to do their jobs well.

The next generation is desperate for alternatives to higher education, such as technical training and apprenticeships, and parents want these options, too. Gallup found that 46 percent of moms and dads prefer other secondary options to college for their kids “even if there were no barriers to their child earning a bachelor’s degree.” In other words, even if parents easily could afford a college degree, almost half would prefer their children to take a different educational route.

And yet, Annelies Goger of the Brookings Institution found that federal funding for public colleges and universities was $385 billion in 2017–18, compared with $14 billion for employment services and training.

Like so much else with higher education, the math just doesn’t make sense.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In my favorite episode of “South Park,” two sleazy salesmen sell shoddy condos in the glitzy ski town of “Asspen” to the lower middle-class residents of South Park. Their pitch is intoxicatingly simple: “Try saying it. ‘I’ve got a nice little place in Asspen.’ Rolls off the tongue nicely doesn’t it?” Eventually, the residents open up their checkbooks and buy the scam.

This is exactly what happened when recruiters from Goldman Sachs showed up at Harvard in 2006. As a 20-year-old, I fell for the trick: I joined Goldman that summer as an intern. By July, I had learned many of the firm’s unspoken traditions, like how, instead of wearing Rolexes, the managing directors sported cheap digital watches with black rubber wrist straps, prominently juxtaposed against their expensive tailor-made dress shirts.

The hallmark event at Goldman that summer wasn’t a poker tournament on a lavish boat cruise followed by a debauched night of clubbing, as it had been at Amaranth, the more edgy firm where I’d worked the prior year. Rather, it was “service day” — a day that involved dressing up in a T-shirt and shorts, and then serving the community. Back in 2006, that involved planting trees in a garden in Harlem. The co-head of my group was supposed to lead the way.

When we showed up at the park in Harlem, very few of my colleagues seemed interested in . . . well, planting trees. The full-time analysts shared office gossip with the interns. The vice presidents one-upped each other with war stories about investment deals. And the head of the group was nowhere to be found.

After an hour I noticed that very little service had actually been performed. As if on cue, the co-head of the group showed up an hour late —wearing a slim-fit suit and a pair of Gucci boots . . . and, of course, a cheap digital watch. The chatter amongst the rest of the team died down, as we awaited what he had to say.

Vivek Ramaswamy was attending Harvard when he was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 2006.

“All right, guys,” he said somberly, as though he were going to discipline the team. A moment of tension hung in the air. And then he broke the ice: “Let’s take some pictures and get out of here!” The entire group burst into laughter. Within minutes we had vacated the premises. No trees had been planted. Soon the entire group was seated comfortably at a nearby bar — pitchers of beer ready on the tables and all.

I turned to one of the younger associates sitting next to me. I quipped that if we wanted to have a “social day,” then we should’ve just called it that instead of “service day.”

He laughed and demurred: “Look, just do what the boss says.” Then he quipped back: “You ever heard of the Golden Rule?”

“Treat others like you want to be treated?” I asked.

“Wrong,” he said. “He who has the gold makes the rules.”

They want to make sure any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board, but are okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s private jet. A critic blasting Goldman Sachs’ double standards, quoted in “Woke, Inc.”

I called it “the Goldman Rule.” I learned something valuable that summer after all.

Over a decade later, the Goldman Rule had only grown in importance. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last year, Goldman CEO David Solomon declared that it would refuse to take companies public unless they had at least one “diverse” member on their board.

Put the “diversity” debate to one side: The bigger problem is that Goldman’s edict wasn’t about diversity at all. It was about corporate opportunism: seizing an already popular social value and prominently emblazoning it with the Goldman Sachs logo. It was like planting trees in Harlem all over again.

The timing of Goldman’s announcement was revealing. In the prior year, approximately half the open board seats at S&P 500 companies went to women. In July 2019, the last remaining all-male board in the S&P 500 appointed a woman. In other words, every single company in the S&P 500 was already abiding by Goldman’s diversity standard long before Goldman issued its own proclamation. Goldman’s announcement was an ideal way to attract praise without taking any real risk: another great risk-adjusted return for Goldman Sachs.

Goldman’s timing was also impeccable in another way. Its diversity quota proclamation stole the headlines from a much less flattering event: Goldman had just agreed to pay $5 billion in fines to governments around the world for its role in a scheme stealing billions from the Malaysian people. Goldman reportedly turned a willfully blind eye as corrupt Malaysian officials immediately turned the fund into their own private piggy bank. Ironically, some of that money literally ended up funding Martin Scorsese’s 2013 movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

As one Redditor on the now-infamous forum WallStreetBets observed, “They want to make sure that any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board of the company they are IPOing, but are perfectly okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s jewelry collection and private jet.” Well, yes. Welcome to the woke-industrial complex.

Woke capitalism is really just crony capitalism 2.0. Here’s how it works: Big business uses progressive-friendly values to deflect attention from their own monolithic pursuit of profit and power.

Now that the Democratic Party is leaning ever leftward under Sens. Elizabeth Warren (left) and Bernie Sanders (right), Goldman and other businesses are trying to please them with woke virtue-signaling. Getty Images (2)

Crony capitalism 1.0 was simple by comparison: Banks simply had to make campaign contributions and hire lobbyists. In return, they get favorable regulations that codify their status as gatekeepers who enjoy oligopoly status in taking companies public. Championship-level players of this game like Goldman Sachs often top it off with a flourish, by lending their executives to serve as US treasury secretaries — Steve Mnuchin under President Donald Trump, Hank Paulson under President George W. Bush, and so on. And it pays off in the end: Winners like Goldman Sachs get bailouts in tough times like 2008, while less adroit competitors like Lehman Brothers get hung out to dry by the likes of Hank Paulson. That much is straightforward.

Woke, Inc will be published on Tuesday.

But crony capitalism 2.0 is far trickier. Goldman’s diversity edict at Davos last year came at a time when Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of the biggest critics of the US government’s 2008 bailout of Goldman Sachs, were presidential front-runners. Having supplicated to business-friendly Republicans and centrist Democrats for decades, the moment had arrived for Goldman Sachs to begin placating the identity-politics-obsessed Far Left, just as that wing of the Democratic Party had begun to accrue greater political power. Their new CEO is woker than woke, and he’s a DJ on the side too. That’s how the 2020 edition of crony capitalism looks: Hank Paulson is outmoded by comparison.

Once the American public becomes “woke” to this new trend of self-interest masquerading as morality, our citizenry can see through the charade of corporate virtue-signaling. When Amazon issues a public challenge to Walmart to pay workers $15 per hour, we can simply chuckle to ourselves that Jeff Bezos is just doing what he does best: undermining his competitors when they’re most vulnerable.

Most importantly, we can return the power to implement our social values back to American democracy where it belongs, rather than to corporate chieftains who use it to make an extra buck. As a society we should allow and even embrace the corporate pursuit of financial self-interest above all. The only thing we should ask in return is this: Keep it naked, instead of dressing it up as altruism. America might just be better off in the end if Goldman Sachs executives wear their Rolexes to work, instead of preaching about diversity and pretending to plant trees.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack looms, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum is crying poverty for the second year in a row. This time, it says it can’t afford to mount special exhibitions planned to mark the two-decade milestone.

In 2020, the twin-beam “Tribute in Light” was canceled only to win a last-minute reprieve after soon-to-be-ex Gov. Cuomo pitched in state resources. But no such bailout appears in the offing this time.

In fact, this year, the museum is shamefully restricting the reading-of-the-names ceremony exclusively to the families of 9/11 victims. No hero firefighters, cops, first responders or emergency workers, who were normally welcome until the pandemic eliminated last year’s event, are invited.

It’s simply outrageous that the great museum — a “humanely crafted engine of catharsis,” as I wrote at its 2014 opening — plans to sit out the 20th anniversary with a diminished acknowledgement of America’s worst terrorist attack and more pleas to pay a visit with tickets starting at $28 each.

No one can blame COVID this time. The ceremony takes place in the open air, where even the Delta virus can’t spread easily. All participants will wear masks. Many or even most will be vaccinated.

Remember all the talk that if we didn’t rebuild after 9/11, the “terrorists would have won?” The museum has raised the white flag to the virus and there’s no turning back.

What a wrongheaded, defeatist message for these times. New York City lost 33,000 citizens to COVID-19. The pandemic-stricken Big Apple needs every affirmation it can get of its inherent valor and resilience, qualities that saved us on 9/11 and in the fraught years that followed.

The museum is a masterpiece not only of design but of moral clarity. Its unflinching focus trains our attention on a singular terror: an unprovoked sneak attack that instantly killed 2,996 innocent human beings, sickened countless others, destroyed 14 million square feet of Manhattan, and ravaged the Big Apple economy.

Long after, we watched the skies in fear of another attack, a different brand of dread than the fear of the virus but every bit as terrible and even more immediate.

Today, many younger and newly arrived New Yorkers have little idea what 9/11 meant. To treat the 20th anniversary as business as usual threatens to consign the memory to just another unpleasant hiccup of history such as the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn for Los Angeles or the 1965 power blackout.

To be fair, the museum alone is not to blame for this failure. The 20th anniversary date has been no secret — for twenty years. And yet Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio planned nothing to make the 2021 commemoration special. The attack’s toll has been lost in their hearts and minds to the politics and phony “science” of the current crisis.

Despite the museum’s very real budget crunch, the catastrophe’s 20th anniversary should not be allowed to become a shadow of its past commemorations.

Our finest minds in politics, philanthropy and the arts have less than a month to come up with something fresh. They need to get down to work — now.

Timing is everything in life.

Sandra Lee has gotten engaged to her boyfriend Ben Youcef, and the beaming couple hit the town in Paris to celebrate, with a besotted Lee showing off her dazzling new engagement ring, multiple sources sources told The Post.

Photos of the lovebirds reveal that Lee, the former girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and her hunky beau have made it official — as there was no mistaking the significance of a giant jewel on Lee’s left ring finger.

Youcef, an interfaith leader, actor and producer, sported a band on his wedding finger.

Lee was seen sporting the sizable new bling just days after Cuomo announced his resignation following a series of scandals — and a damning report by state Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of sexually harassing several women — that have plagued his third term as governor.

Lee and Youcef bolted to the City of Love after she was left devastated by the events of the past week, when Cuomo resigned as governor amid a sex harassment scandal, Lee’s friends said.

The two could be seen outside Parisian hotspot L’Avenue on Saturday night, sharing an embrace before heading in for dinner.

Lee, a 55-year-old lifestyle guru, wore a white summer dress while Youcef, 46, had on jeans, a leather jacket and a white T-shirt emblazoned with the logo “Fear of God.”

A source close to Youcef told The Post: “Ben really wanted to distract Sandra from all the news, so he whisked her away to Paris. He knows how hard this has been on her and he wants to make sure she feels loved and supported.”

The source added: “Ben is incredibly protective of Sandra. They’re soulmates and head over heels in love.”

The pair traveled to Paris after spending time in St. Tropez in the South of France.

Lee and Cuomo never got engaged during their 14 years together, although she was married previously to former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz from 2001 until 2005.

The source said their friends have been rooting for them since they met in the spring in Los Angeles.

As The Post reported, Lee has felt “betrayed” by Cuomo, most recently for what she claims was him taking credit for legalizing same-sex marriage in New York during his resignation speech when she was the one who urged him to push the legislation forward.

Cuomo’s cheating during their relationship, which he denied, was considered an “open secret,” former Cuomo staffers told The Post in April.

She met Youcef after moving to Malibu, Calif., and leaving behind the home she shared with Cuomo.

She solidified her move to the West Coast after selling her Mount Kisco home — named “Lily Pond” — for $1.85 million last October.

Youcef, a divorced dad of two, was discovered by Steven Spielberg and went on to appear in his 2005 movie “Munich.”

He has since appeared in a number of TV shows.

A rep for Lee declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Friday’s census numbers show that New York City’s population swelled to a record 8.8 million in 2020, up 7.7 percent from 2010. That’s proof of Gotham’s continued vitality, despite COVID — and reason to believe the best is yet to come as we escape not just the pandemic but the entire de Blasio-Cuomo era.

Consider: The city’s net gain of more than 629,000 people totaled more than the increase for Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles combined. (Brooklyn alone is now a match for the population of Chicago, the No. 2 US city, at 2.7 million.) That’s fundamental proof that New York remains a unique draw for those seeking a better life.

Yes, the city faces big challenges: No one knows how many office jobs will remain remote-only now that everyone knows that can work. And it’s vital to reverse the recent rise in crime: Restoring public safety was the fundamental reason for the renaissance of the last three decades.

But mayor-in-waiting Eric Adams won by vowing to confront crime and understands the overriding need to get commuters back. He’ll be beefing up the NYPD and going after the drivers of crime — career criminals and gun-toting street gangs — and pushing lawmakers to reverse recent pro-thug “reforms.” And now he can point to last decade’s growth as reason for businesses to bet on New York yet again.

Brooklynite Nick Ambro put it perfectly to The Post: “People are always going to come to New York. It’s not one of those cities that dies, you know.”

Darn right. Get ready for the city to reopen — and climb to even higher heights.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Only hours after Minnesota GOP operative Anton Lazarro posted online DNA evidence that allegedly shows Rep. Ilhan Omar was once married to her brother, the FBI busted him.

The test results stated there is a 99.999998 percent chance that Omar and her second husband, Ahmed Elmi, now her ex-husband, are siblings, according to an analysis by British company Endeavor DNA Laboratories. But before Lazarro could share the results with the media, he was arrested Thursday on underage sex-trafficking charges and jailed pending a court hearing Monday.

His website, IlhanOmarDNA.com, containing the DNA test results, was online briefly before it was taken down Wednesday.

Lazarro and a group of conservative donors had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on three continents hiring private investigators to track down Elmi Omar’s ex-husband in the UK and procure his DNA from a drinking straw. Omar’s DNA, Lazarro’s website claimed, was extracted from saliva on a cigarette butt she was photographed smoking.

Omar previously has denied Elmi is her brother, calling the claim “absolutely false,” “absurd” and “offensive.”

Special Agent Joy Hess, from the FBI’s Twin Cities field office, which investigated allegations that Omar married her brother Elmi to get around US immigration laws, says the “statute of limitations” had run out on the case. In a recorded conversation with an associate of Lazarro, posted on his website Wednesday, Hess also said the FBI could not pursue the case because Omar’s ex-husband Elmi had moved overseas.

“The statute of limitations is over,” she said. “According to the US Attorney’s office The Statute of Limitations is not something we can overcome in that matter … The individual in question left the country so there’s nothing to [do].”

Asked if the new DNA evidence would be considered, she said: “All I can just say is that according to the United States Attorney’s Office the Statute of Limitations limits what we can do in this matter.”

There is no statute of limitations for immigration fraud, but there also appears to be no appetite in Democrat-run Minneapolis to investigate the claim that has dogged Democratic “Squad” member Omar for years.

It is shoddy that private citizens felt compelled to do the FBI’s job. Why didn’t the FBI do its own DNA tests and clear up the cloud hanging over Omar’s head?

The FBI did not respond to questions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Get a load of this: 1199SEIU, the powerful hospital-workers union, is threatening a strike even as COVID remains a danger.

It’s demanding a 23 percent pay hike over three years, or more than 7 percent annually, hospital sources told The Post. Counting benefits, the added cost is $3.6 billion. The current three-year contract, which expires Sept. 30, brought pay increases of 3 percent a year.

It’s as if the union thinks a global health crisis gives it leverage for a ruthless shakedown, even though New York regional hospitals lost about $1 billion in 2020, even after accounting for $4 billion in federal aid.

Some 1199 members certainly have no qualms about leaving the public in the lurch: “Let the strike begin,” said one union activist at Montefiore Hospital.

Yes, health-care workers have gone above and beyond in their service to the community during the pandemic. But that doesn’t justify blackmail as the region struggles with Delta and the threat of Lambda.

A strike threat is, as one hospital executive worded it, “lunacy.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The scenes out of Afghanistan are infuriating and tragically predictable.

It shouldn’t really come as a surprise that President Biden and the geniuses surrounding him have made such an almighty hash of the withdrawal from that godforsaken country.

Look at everything else he has messed up.

His first act in office was to dismantle hard-won Trump-era border protection measures. The inevitable illegal migrant surge at the southern border has turned into an unchecked invasion, with national security and public health risks that will ricochet through history.

At this stage, we can confidently say that Joe Biden has the reverse Midas touch.

In Afghanistan, it didn’t have to be like this.

The humiliating scenes of Americans evacuating from Kabul’s airport were avoidable, as is the specter of American helicopters, planes, Humvees, weapons and ammunition in the hands of our enemies.

Taliban fighters patrol inside the city of Kandahar, southwest Afghanistan, Sunday, Aug. 15. AP

But Biden was caught unawares.

Then he had the gall on Saturday to blame President Donald Trump: “When I came to office, I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor.”

Since Secretary of State Antony Blinken doubled down over the weekend on this dishonest spin, it’s time for some home truths.

I asked Trump Sunday about the plan his administration had to get out of Afghanistan —which ultimately was obstructed by the same US generals who gave Biden a green light.

“We were going to not let people get slaughtered,” Trump said flatly. “I wanted to get out. But you have to get out safely and you have to get out with respect …

“We had all sorts of conditions … All civilians were going to come out before the military. Everyone should have been out before they took our military out …

“I was going to close this ridiculous embassy they spent a billion dollars on and move everybody out …

“I was going to blow up every military base [before we left]. I was going to take out every single piece of equipment. I said, ‘I don’t want anything left [apart from] leave each soldier a gun …’

“Plus, I had a relationship with the Taliban where they knew they weren’t allowed to do this. They understood they were going to get hit very hard … What I had was conversations with the [Taliban] leadership where I said, ‘If you do anything,’ we were going to hit them like they haven’t been hit before.”

Trump said the Taliban “no longer has fear or respect for America …

“It’s a terrible, terrible black eye for this country.

“We’re a laughingstock. The whole world can’t believe it.

“And there was no reason for it.”

Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who began negotiating with the Taliban in February 2020 to lay down conditions for a US withdrawal, has corroborated Trump’s version of events.

Pompeo was in the room when Trump warned the Taliban’s senior negotiator, Mullah Baradar, that if a single American was hurt or threatened, the entire wrath of American power would rain down on them.

“We never trusted the Taliban,” he told Fox News Sunday. “We made abundantly clear … we weren’t going to allow them to just walk away from any deal that they had struck. We were going to go crush them, we were going to impose real costs on them. We weren’t going to let them take these provincial capitals. They understood that American power was going to come to their village, to their community, to their friends and family.”

You can bet the Taliban believed Trump would make good on his threat.

Meanwhile, where was Biden while Kabul fell? Silent. Having another holiday at Camp David. The White House tweeted out a still photo of him taking notes while watching a video conference of his national security team. Very reassuring.

The American people wanted out of the 20-year war in Afghanistan, but they had a right to expect the exit would be managed competently.

CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Blinken on Sunday why the Biden administration didn’t evacuate people before withdrawing the military.

It’s a question, said Tapper, “of how poorly this was done. The idea that President Biden ordered 2,500 service members out and now is sending up to 5,000 service members back in [to evacuate people left behind], does that not on its face show that the exit was inadequately planned?”

Blinken simply had no answer. He kept trying either to blame Trump or pretend that the only alternative to this self-inflicted debacle was a forever war.

How inane Biden’s conceit looks now, when he was wandering around the G-7 in June telling anyone who would listen that “America is back” and that he had single-handedly restored America’s global leadership and credibility after Trump had ruined it.

He has just been busy making us less safe. He is wokifying the military, injecting the poison of critical race theory and transgender ideology to divide the troops, while launching a witch hunt to identify some mythical “enemy within.”

It seems like only yesterday that Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was barking at a Republican member of Congress about “white rage.”

This lawless, feckless administration has wreaked untold damage at warp speed in seven months. These aren’t mistakes that you can bounce back from. They will have ramifications well into the future.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The utterly nauseating and unnecessary abandonment of Afghanistan to its fate recalls a similar humiliation at the hands of Islamist radicals in the Jimmy Carter administration.

President Biden’s profligate spending policies are unleashing inflation that is sparking voter distrust so noticeable that even NPR is sounding the alarm.

He is begging OPEC to come up with more oil while interfering with US production. He announced barely a month ago, with great confidence, “The Taliban is not the South — the North Vietnamese army. They’re not — they’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability.

“There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy in the — of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.”

Our president comes across as weak, meek, ineffectual, incompetent and confused. (Momentarily confusing South and North Vietnam doesn’t even make the list of the top 100 senior moments we’ve seen this year from this near-octogenarian, despite the fact that his staff is keeping him hidden to a degree with little if any precedent in the past half-century.)

Biden is embarrassing the United States in real time, and I await with eagerness the Biden version of the blame-shifting Malaise Speech. Biden’s version, of course, will be the This Is All Trump’s Fault speech.

From The National Review
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Twenty years … and for what?

With the fall of Kabul, the war in Afghanistan comes to an ignominious end, the country exactly as it was when we invaded in 2001: in the grip of fanatical Islamists who rape and persecute women, practice medieval punishment and harbor terrorists who plot to destroy the Western world.

The families of the 2,312 American military personnel who died there, and the 20,066 who were wounded, have every right to feel bitterness and anger.

Yes, we killed Osama bin Laden (in Pakistan). But otherwise, over three administrations, we barely articulated a mission beyond the “defeat” of al Qaeda. The Taliban were never vanquished. The Afghan army crumbled. The democracy we helped build was ground into dust as its president fled the nation.

Afghanistan was the forgotten war from the start. The Bush administration quickly moved to Iraq. Obama didn’t care; Trump even less. Maybe it never would have worked, even with more resources, planning and leadership. If this century has taught America anything, it’s that democracy cannot be imposed on others. But it is a tragedy that the glimmer of hope provided — particularly to the young girls who could finally go to school — is now gone. What was the point?

President Biden says he “inherited” President Donald Trump’s withdrawal plans, but that is a lie. He could have taken more time, tried to at least secure the capital, and left a small peacekeeping force. Instead, we pulled out in the dead of night, so quickly that we had to send troops back just to make sure our embassy was safely evacuated. It’s as humiliating an end as the rooftop scramble in Saigon in 1975.

It is a travesty that Biden left behind allies, such as translators, to their doom, and we must continue to do everything we can to get them out. That Biden’s administration misjudged this entire situation, the readiness of the army and the speed of the Taliban, shows his State Department without judgment or sense, but we knew that from their insistence on returning to the Iran deal.

Afghanistan will go down in American history as a failure of a magnitude similar to Vietnam. Where this differs is in its legacy. We don’t know yet what new threats might rise from Afghanistan, what new 9/11s will be planned there.

The world is less safe today, President Biden. That’s on you.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In July 2020, following the ­George Floyd riots, Mayor Bill de Blasio disbanded the NYPD’s anti-crime unit, which led to a sharp rise in murders and shootings across Gotham. In response, Hizzoner called a news conference in Harlem in which he vowed to address crime’s “root causes.”

No one quite knew what he meant — until now. It turns out the solution is handing out cash to gun thugs.

Through an outfit called ­Advance Peace, the city will offer a stipend of $1,000 per month (“transformational opportunities”) to “young men ­involved in lethal firearm ­offenses,” at the same time pairing them with “neighborhood change agents” — “credible messengers, meaning they bring life experience, conflict mediation and mentorship skills to the target population.”

If giving a grand a month to violent teens — on the proviso that they receive “mentoring” from older ex-cons — sounds like a good use of money, well, you’re in luck. According to Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, investing in the Advance Peace model “isn’t only a moral obligation, it’s a governing imperative.”

Williams — who himself avoids street violence entirely by living within the secure confines of Brooklyn’s federally managed Fort Hamilton Army Garrison — and his associates claim that Advance Peace is “evidence-based” and has a demonstrated track record of success. But a look at the organization’s own reports indicates that the model’s record is, in the best cases, mixed.

In Sacramento, three neighborhoods were targeted for an 18-month Advance Peace intervention, which really only covered 2019. Those districts did see a decline in “gun homicides and gun assaults,” compared to the mean of the previous 36 months, though the comparison period is skewed by the sharp rise in the national murder rate caused by the “Ferguson Effect” in 2015. Murders across all of California, for example, rose steeply in 2015 and 2016, and then returned to pre-Ferguson levels.

The Advance Peace program in Stockton, Calif., on the other hand, was a disaster. Murders rose from 28 in 2019 to 45 in 2020, up 60 percent, much higher than the 37 percent ­increase nationwide.

The summary fact sheet for the Stockton program announces proudly that 71 percent of its 34 participants “are not a suspect in a new firearm-related crime.” Similarly, the Sacramento program boasts that 44 percent of its 50 members “had no new arrests.” Of course, that doesn’t account for the 17 original participants who dropped out or were arrested in the first six months.

If you are tasked with keeping a busload-size cohort of young men from getting arrested for a gun crime, and count it as a success when only a dozen or so get caught, maybe you need to ­reconsider your definition of achievement.

In New York City, agreements have been struck with community-based groups in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island to manage stipend-and-mentorship Advance Peace programs. The groups in question, ­including ManUp! in East New York and Street Corner Resources in Harlem, were selected because of their long experience in “violence interruption” — of course, their close political ties to local leaders.

But one has to ask, if these are the groups that have been working so hard to stop violence in the neighborhoods they are rooted in, why are their neighborhoods so violent? Not to blame ManUp! or Street Corner Resources, but it isn’t clear what they have been up to that deserves to be rewarded.

In a year when murders citywide are running about even with 2020, the Street Corner Resources neighborhood precinct has seen eight killings, up from three last year, with shootings, felony assaults and burglaries far outpacing the city as a whole.

In East New York, ManUp!, which for years has operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Charles and Inez Barron political machine, sits at the heart of one of Brooklyn’s most violent neighborhoods, which last year notched about 15 percent of the borough’s killings and 14 percent of its felony assaults. The two-year increase in murder so far is a staggering 63 percent.

Trusting these groups to ­administer the disbursement of $1,000 monthly stipends to gangster protégés of ex-con mentors is truly insane. But with de Blasio leaving office in a few months, what better way for him to establish the capstone of his depressing eight years in City Hall?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Since when does America give anything good to black people first?” Black Lives Matter leader Hawk Newsome, 44, told the New York Times in explaining his decision to go unvaxxed — ironically flipping Mayor Bill de Blasio’s determination to prioritize minority areas for the jabs into grounds for suspicion.

The paper was looking at why just 28 percent of black New Yorkers ages 18 to 44 have gotten jabbed. And Newsome stood for the many who feared “they could not trust the government with their health.”

That has some basis in history: The Tuskegee experiment, notably, involved the government intentionally not treating syphilis cases among 600 blacks in 1932 to observe the disease’s progress over the next four decades.

But it’s pretty sad that so many of our fellow citizens would worry that the feds could still behave that way — let alone get away with it. And BLM and its enablers have fed that paranoia by leaving Americans massively confused about how many blacks are shot by police across the country each year. (It’s several dozen, not the thousand or more that many of us now guesstimate.)

Then again, the Biden Food and Drug Administration also fed fear by briefly suspending approval of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (as we warned at the time): Since the one-shot J&J jab had been prioritized for distribution in pop-up clinics in predominantly black areas, the suspension boosted suspicions of Uncle Sam experimenting on African Americans again.

Of course, black communities are by no means the only ones rife with vax resistance. And all of them have their reasons — including, universally, the FDA’s unconscionable failure to give a final OK for the jabs.

Meanwhile, the cultural elite fixate on reluctance among Trump voters as if that were the main problem, perhaps because it’s easiest to blame the “deplorables” yet again. It’s so much easier to despise dissenters.

Resist the urge to hold the unvaxxed in contempt, and keep reasoning with them. What they need to hear are the clear facts: More than 60 percent of the country has had at least one jab, and over half is fully vaccinated. That’s 200 million Americans: If any side effects had shown up, the media would be blaring it. And the unjabbed make up 99-plus percent of serious COVID cases, even with Delta rampant.

Getting angry with the unvaxxed only gets in the way of letting reality sink in.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Will Gov. Gavin Newsom be the second Democratic governor of California to be recalled and removed from office in this (or the last) century? Polls suggest it’s possible.

It would be a startling result. We have just seen the second consecutive Democratic governor of New York ousted over sexual misconduct. It would be more politically significant for a second consecutive Democratic governor of California to get the boot for policy reasons.

Gray Davis, the governor recalled in 2003, had entered office determined to check the hyper-liberal legislature. But overspending got through anyway, and he backed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants; he was also hurt by blackouts caused by a botched deregulation scheme he had no part in creating.

Newsom’s problems have a similar ring. He was elected in 2018 with 62 percent of the vote, the strongest showing since Earl Warren won his third term with 65 percent in 1950. There was little appetite for a recall last spring. But the most recent three polls this summer show 46 percent favoring recall.

Why the shift? SurveyUSA polls showed Latinos, a quarter of the electorate, moving from opposing to backing recall. Berkeley polls show a similar trend among Latinos and Asians. The most recent Emerson poll shows Latinos favoring recall by 54 percent to 41 percent.

Subgroup analysis is risky, because of high margins of error. But as Auric Goldfinger told James Bond, “once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time is enemy action.” Similar trends in three different polls looks like something real.

This movement against liberal policies makes sense once you realize that even low-income voters are less interested in economic redistribution than in the maintenance of order. Newsom, in a testy interview with McClatchy newspapers, boasts of the state’s large earned-income tax credit, but his lockdown policies have kept California’s unemployment rate at 7.7 percent, higher than all but three other states.

The income and wealth gaps in California, much greater than in most other states, were symbolized when Newsom broke his own rules and dined maskless indoors with lobbyists at the three-Michelin-star restaurant French Laundry last November.

Against this background of the well-connected rich — Newsom’s core constituency is San Francisco Bay Area big contributors — consider other results of California’s liberal policies. Some have resulted in visible disasters, like wildfires and electricity blackouts, while others — high housing prices and utility rates — loom large for modest-income households while easily brushed off by the rich.

Homeless men by the thousands live under freeway overpasses or in stretches of Venice beachfront, ­despite (actually, because of) multimillion-dollar homeless programs. Thugs run through the aisles of chain drug stores filling their bags with goods they haul out, under security guards’ eyes, to waiting cars — the result of California voters’ lunatic approval of reclassifying thefts under $950 as misdemeanors, not felonies.

California hasn’t been immune either from the unprecedented — at least since statistics started being collected in 1960 — rise in homicides and other violent crimes. In response, Los Angeles partially defunded the police, and radical district attorneys elected in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties have declined to prosecute thousands of cases.

California’s Latinos, mostly the product of a 1982-2007 surge of ­migration from Mexico, may be ­responding to this disorder as California’s white homeowners, mostly the product of a 1940-1965 surge of migration from the Midwest, responded to the disorder of the Watts riots and Berkeley rebellions of the 1960s. The voters who had supported the liberal policies of Democratic Gov. Pat Brown switched in large numbers in 1966 to the conservative former Midwesterner Ronald Reagan.

There’s no Reagan on the scene, unless it’s radio talk host Larry Elder, who seems ahead in the race to succeed Newsom if he’s recalled. It’s entirely possible that Newsom will be able to rally enough Dems to stay in office. But his current ads attacking former President Donald Trump don’t seem more effective than 1966 attempts to claim Reagan was another Barry Goldwater.

Lesson: The first duty of government is to provide a stable order in which people can live their lives. California’s liberal Democrats seem to be flunking.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@American cities have ­resolved that compassion for the mentally ill people living on our streets means ignoring them. This is a betrayal of ­society as a whole — and a catastrophic failure to lend help to those of our fellow citizens who need it most.

Ed and Melissa (not their real names) have lived in Midtown since November. A homeless woman who camps out on their street corner defecates in the street and regularly berates passersby.

A month ago, Melissa was leaving their home with their baby when the woman approached her and began to scream obscenities in her face. Ed was luckily across the street, so Melissa ran in his ­direction. The woman gave chase and threw a bottle at them.

This isn’t the kind of story that makes the news. Thankfully, no one was hurt. Police officers told the couple there wasn’t anything they could do, since there was no physical contact. But Melissa is now afraid to leave her home.

“So what, big deal — you were screamed at”: So sneer liberals who otherwise insist that words are violence and hearing a wrong opinion can be so damaging and stressful as to require censorship.

Stories like Melissa’s happen ­every day. Who is helped by ­ignoring this woman? The neighbors are afraid to walk past her, and she sleeps rough even on the coldest winter nights, without getting the help she needs.

It’s no triumph of individual ­autonomy or of compassion to abandon people who are too mentally ill to recognize that they need involuntary inpatient care.

And what about society’s rights? We are just supposed to step in urine, suffer verbal and sometimes physical abuse, navigate whole makeshift villages on crosswalks and in parks and generally look the other way when a human is suffering?

Earlier this month, Upper West Side Together, a Facebook group dedicated to community safety, posted a call to action. “A median on the corner of 82/Broadway is currently housing a group of four-five males, one of whom required medical assistance yesterday. They are not new to the area and have been seen drinking, doing drugs, urinating, catcalling women and littering. Recently, they have started to accumulate items that block the space for pedestrians there.”

The accompanying photos showed office chairs and shopping carts, suitcases and lawn chairs. The men had turned the median into their living room. Why is this OK?

A few days ago, a homeless man stabbed another man on the Lower East Side. In Washington, DC, a homeless encampment has taken over Mount Vernon Park and brought a spike of crime to the area.

In Venice Beach, the homeless population has swelled to 2,000 people “housed” in a giant tent city. Soledad Ursúa, the chairwoman of the Venice Neighborhood Council’s Public Health and Safety Committee, said people aren’t going out at night; police have advised keeping home windows closed to prevent crime.

Where is the sanity to say none of this is normal or OK? Where is the honesty to say plainly that people sleeping in the streets is bad? This isn’t complicated.

And yet politicians rarely speak up. During New York’s Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Yang said something obvious and true . . . that he then had to recant. He said, “Yes, mentally ill people have rights, but you know who else have rights? We do! The people and families of the city.”

We behave as if we are preserving some alternative lifestyle for the people living in the streets. But it’s hurting us all. Great rewards of population spikes and rising revenue await the first city to say no to tent cities taking over parks, no to allowing mentally ill people to harass people on the streets, no to people turning sidewalks into bathrooms.

This is no way to live — for the sane and for the addicted and mentally ill.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Conservative: The End of Interventionism

Summing up her colleague Mollie Hemingway’s remarks on the ­Afghanistan withdrawal debacle, The Federalist’s Evita Duffy laments how “two decades of disastrous nation-building in Afghanistan that have resulted in strategic failure and a resurgence of the Taliban upon the United States’ exit from the country.” As Hemingway noted on Fox News’ “Special Report,” “This is the natural result of 20 years of failed strategy. We went from using our military to fight and win wars into the impossible task of nation-building. When we were attacked on 9/11, we needed to have a swift and serious response. We did that, but then-President Bush took his eyes off the ball. He and Cheney and Obama and Biden took on this task of nation-building in ­Afghanistan — the country historians call the ‘graveyard of empires.’ ”

Feminist: Why Cuomo Got #MeToo’d

“In the murky forest of American politics,” sighs Kat Rosenfield at ­UnHerd, “there’s only one weapon powerful enough” to take down liberal “werewolves” like Gov. Cuomo: “a good old #MeToo-ing by an army of brave women warriors.” The problem is that the allegations — some damning, some less so — obscured the governor’s bigger sin: “This was the man who mandated that COVID-infected patients be admitted to nursing homes without testing,” killing thousands and then trying to cover it up — crimes he got away with for months because the media class preferred him to “those science-denying yokels in, say, Florida, who wouldn’t even wear masks at the beach.” The lesson: “If the government and media would stop providing partisan cover for political werewolves, maybe desperate citizens wouldn’t feel the need to use #MeToo as a silver bullet.”

Culture critic: The Blight of Cuomo

With sexual-harassment claims dominating headlines, “far less has been said of” Gov. Cuomo’s “aesthetic abuse of New York. And Cuomo was a ­serial abuser, wantonly so and without remorse,” snarks James Panero at Spectator World. “From Albany, he dreamed of the glories of Rome. Regrettably, he was only looking as far as the City of Rome in Oneida County.” The Penn Station “debacle” was just one of “Dandy Andy’s many design ambitions.” He “had a chance to right a historic wrong by rebuilding Old Penn,” but “why fix a broken neighborhood when you can break even more?” He earlier “wasted $30 million” to replace some of the Midtown Tunnel’s white tiles with his favored blue and gold. “By the time he released his poster called ‘New York Tough,’ an art-brut collage of every flatten-the-curve cliché, our collective immunity to the Cuomo-esque was at its lowest point.”

Hunter watch: The Latest Biden Blackout

“The media blackout on Hunter Biden’s laptop remains in force” despite “a videotape that purportedly shows Biden claiming that one of his laptops was stolen by Russians for blackmail purposes,” fumes ­Jonathan Turley at his blog. Reported largely by foreign media, the tape features Hunter talking “after filming having sex with an alleged prostitute in a Las Vegas hotel,” telling her of the drug-fueled benders he went on with Russians “from penthouse suite to penthouse suite.” The president’s son “was receiving massive payments from dubious foreign figures from China to the Ukraine to Russia during these years,” claiming “they needed his guidance on issues like ­energy development and financial dealings.” Let’s be real: “Why would these sources be forking over millions to a self-admitted hopeless addict other than buying access and influence with his father?”

From the right: YouTube’s Mask Hypocrisy

“YouTube deserves every shred of scorn and ridicule we can still muster in these crazy, exhausting times,” rages The Washington Times’ Charles Hurt in response to the Google-owned video platform’s decision to ban Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). In a video, Paul, a physician as well as a lawmaker, had dismissed the “false sense of ­security that cloth, store-bought masks provide people who are concerned about COVID-19. Lobbying for mask mandates, Dr. Paul warned, could be ‘potentially deadly misinformation.’ ” Of course, national virus guru and elite darling Dr. Anthony Fauci has fulminated against masks even more adamantly before flip-flopping. The difference is that Paul “openly calls on American citizens to stand up for their constitutional liberties.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It could be worse, Britney

Other hidden custodianships are oozing out after the Britney Spears story.

Signs were England’s soul singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse spinning out of control. Addiction. Alcohol. Drugs. Demons. Downward trajectory. Grammy winner, her last months were spent away. Hidden. Quiet. Far from press. No spotlight. Outsiders never knew how bad things were. Age 27, she lies in Britain’s Edgwarebury Cemetery.

Amy’s father, Mitch, follows Britney’s father, Jamie. As familiar with a custodianship as Britney’s dad, Mitch allegedly researched custodianships for months before his daughter passed away. He learned, unfortunately, this is not allowed under UK law. Were it permitted, friends who know say Mitch Winehouse truly believes he’d have fought for custodianship. And Amy would still be alive.

He cautions being too quick to judge Brit’s dad. He says the public rarely knows the full story.

Women kick butt

OK, you know about movie hit man “John Wick” who’s played by Keanu Reeves. Its makers are now out with “The Protégé,” a female-type Wick. Samuel L. Jackson is her trainer: “Women as contract killers who kick ass are great and model/actress Maggie Q plays her as a woman who takes on this crazy, dark murderous world. I like to watch it. Beautiful, dangerous and lethal always has an appeal.” Another bad boy here is Michael Keaton, who agrees she’s a woman to avoid in a dark alley. “She beats the s - - t out of a couple guys. Young girls are going to really like this.”

It’s Showtime!

Basically, TV is alive because of documentaries. What else can you watch? In crime-ridden cities, it’s the 8,000th “Law & Order” or things light and frothy like “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Instead, it’s all docs. Like a fashion show with Mrs. Biden’s flower-printed dresses. Or a Lindsay Lohan acting lesson. So, starting Sunday the 22nd, Showtime’s playing one doc that runs four consecutive Sundays. It’s on me. If you don’t like me, maybe an alternative’s some Nat Geo six-parter on How to Make Sand.

A bright future

Zarah, Filipino-American TV personality who premiered in 2005, has worked with Beyoncé, Ashlee Simpson, Alanis Morissette, Goo Goo Dolls. Writer, producer, recording artist, she wrote a crime thriller, “Diamonds are for Cocktails.” Passion, crime, murder, deceit, which that chunk of the world can have on one’s mind set among cafes of the French Riviera. So pay attention. She’s hunting a publisher.

He loves NYC & Greece

John Catsimatidis. Born Greece. Arrived here age 5. Like crabgrass, he’s everywhere and everything. P.S. 192 in Harlem, Brooklyn Tech High, NYU. His mother got him a $1-an-hour supermarket job. He says: “The guy was too cheap to have a conveyor belt so, working till 1 a.m. daily, I’d schlep four cases of soda each time from the basement.” Paying $1,000 a month, he bought out the owner. Realizing landlords foreclose supermarket properties, he bought real estate. Then an airline. Then oil wells. Then WABC. Then 20 other things. He loves animals. He schlepped his bird — which had its own nanny — every weekend to the Hamptons. And he loves New York. Asked why, with so many rich Greek shipowners that country is suffering poverty, he says: “Not one ship’s in Greece. They’re kept in Panama. Legislators think rich people are dumb. Not dumb. They just pick up and go elsewhere. Bad taxes, bad laws, people and money move to friendlier areas. It’s what’s happening in New York.”

Speaking of New York, the union shop steward noticed their porter sharpening pencils. Said the union shop steward: “This is not allowed. That’s a job for the carpenter.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Issue: Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul taking over as governor after Gov. Cuomo’s resignation.

To anyone who believes that Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul did not know that Gov. Cuomo was sexually harassing women, I have a bridge to sell you (“Hochul ready to take reins,” Aug. 11).

Everyone who has worked in an office environment (especially at a senior level) hears things through the rumor mill.

It is hard to believe (and unlikely) that Hochul did not hear rumors that Cuomo harassed women. If she did hear the rumors and did nothing, she is complicit in his wrongdoing.

If she truly did not know about it, then she is sorely uninformed about what is happening in the state government, she is surrounding herself with the wrong people and she does not deserve to be governor of New York.

Joanna Hass

Manhattan

Hochul is an unproven quantity, who recently admitted that she spent very little time in Albany during the Cuomo years, and that she did not witness the toxic culture cited in Attorney General Letitia James’ report.

The Post seems to have high hopes for Hochul. Perhaps you are counting chickens before they hatch — or is it wishful thinking?

It will be just a matter of time before she, too, will disappoint. We’ve seen this movie many times before, when a new leader emerges to all kinds of fanfare and lofty expectations, only to fall flat on his or her face.

Hochul’s credentials are sketchy and nothing to rave about. She is a total stranger to most New Yorkers and those of us in the surrounding area.

J. J. Crovatto

Ramsey, NJ

Why were two more weeks necessary for Cuomo to leave? It certainly isn’t so he can work with the incoming Hochul, since he barely acknowledged her existence for the past six years.

Is he spending his time destroying evidence of his wretched behavior?

Robert DiNardo

Farmingdale

Although I have no horse in this race, I’m optimistic that once she assumes the position, Lt. Gov. Hochul will be the big breath of fresh air that New York politics desperately needs.

She, in tandem with the presumptive next mayor, Eric Adams, can hopefully work together to right many of the wrongs done to New York state and to the city over the past decade.

Above all else, everyone needs to take a step back and allow this woman the appropriate time to become situated, to get a full staff of her choosing in place, to see what has been swept under the carpet by previous administrations and to gradually effect positive, meaningful changes.

The Issue: The Senate’s passage of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.

The lunatics who run our government just passed a $1.2 trillion so-called “infrastructure bill” through the Senate that’s really just a socialist wish list (“Dems split on infra bill,” Aug. 14).

Sadly, these fools were helped out by the supposedly sane party in Washington — the Republicans.

Now the real fun begins: an even bigger $3.5 trill­ion bill is coming up soon, with no Republican votes needed for passage.

Who’s going to pay for all this new spending? Expect massive new taxes, and much of the fallout will be passed on to our kids and grandkids.

Steve Heitner

Middle Island

We keep seeing the cost for the so-called “infrastructure bill,” but as in the past, there are little “goodies” built into the bill to please some members of Congress.

When will these people pass a bill that does just what it’s supposed to do?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rams and Chargers fans commemorated their return to SoFi Stadium with a massive brawl on Saturday.

A viral video showed a male Rams fan in an Aaron Donald jersey being pummeled by at least four others in the stands of the stadium shared by the two Los Angeles teams.

The melee, which left the fan in the Donald jersey bloodied, lasted nearly a minute.

The beginning of the video showed the fan in the Donald jersey arguing with another Rams fan. An unidentified woman in the back then threw beer on the fan in the Donald jersey, leading him to throw what appeared to be the first punch.

It’s unclear what exactly sparked the altercation and whether there were any arrests.

The Week 1 preseason game, which the Chargers won 13-6, marked the return of NFL fans amid the pandemic.

There’s no crying in casting.

Oscar-nominated actress Debra Winger quit the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own” because Madonna was cast in the women’s baseball dramedy.

According to the Telegraph, Winger was starring in the role of Dottie, which was eventually taken over by Geena Davis.

Serious actress Winger even trained with the Chicago Cubs for three months, but when director Penny Marshall cast Madonna, Winger felt Marshall was making fluff — “an Elvis film.”

“The studio agreed with me because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract. In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court,” she told the Telegraph.

She added, “As entertaining as [the finished film] was, you don’t walk away going, ‘Wow, those women did that.’ You kind of go, ‘Is that true?’”

She said the other stars didn’t train as much as she did, but Davis “did OK.”

Tom Hanks and Rosie O’Donnell also starred in the hit movie. Columbia Pictures

“I certainly don’t begrudge any of them,” said Winger, 66.

As far as Madonna’s performance? “I think [her] acting career has spoken for itself,” Winger reportedly said.

Davis went on to get a Golden Globe nomination for the role, while Madonna picked up a nomination for Best Original Song. The film also stars Tom Hanks and Rosie O’Donnell.

Winger, most famous for her roles in “An Officer and a Gentleman” and “Terms of Endearment,” also spoke about quitting Hollywood back in 1995.

“I stopped because I ceased being challenged,” she said, adding that playing the supportive wife and mother got “pretty boring.”

Over the years, the actress has come back for various indie films like 2008’s “Rachel Getting Married.” Most recently, she acts in Apple TV+’s “Mr. Corman.”
