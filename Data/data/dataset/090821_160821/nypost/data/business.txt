Leon Black’s sexual assault accuser claims the billionaire former boss of Apollo Global Management once flew her to Florida to have sex with renown pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

In an amended lawsuit filed Monday, former Russian model Guzel Ganieva said that in 2008, while Epstein was serving a prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution, Black flew her in his private jet to Palm Beach to meet Epstein, whom he had had previously referred to as his “best friend.”

“Ms. Ganieva soon found herself alone with Black and Epstein in a room that appeared to be an office,” according to the Manhattan state court complaint.

At the time, Epstein was on a prison work release that allowed him to work in his private office 12 hours a day, six days a week. The financier committed suicide while in prison in 2019 for alleged sex trafficking.

According to the lawsuit, Black and Epstein were “in almost supine positions, as if they were waiting for her to get on top of them.” Black then “indicated with his eyes that he wanted Ms. Ganieva to come and lay in between him and Epstein.”

Ganieva says she refused to have sex with them despite Epstein’s assistant allegedly warning her that the men were “sex addicts” and that “there will be consequences” for displeasing them. A few hours later she and an angry Black flew back on Black’s private plane to Teterboro, NJ, she alleges.

Black’s attorney, Danya Perry of Perry Guha, on Monday called the claims “demonstrably and transparently false.”

The updated lawsuit “betrays her willingness to say anything and fabricate a story in the hope that something will stick,” Perry said. “This complaint is as frivolous and sanctionable as her June filing.”

This mudslinging kicked off after Ganieva in March alleged via tweet that Black had sexually assaulted her. He swung back claiming she had been extorting money from him, which led to her filing a defamation suit that didn’t initially include the Epstein claims.

Black has also sued Ganieva for defamation, saying in his recently filed countersuit that he paid Ganieva about $10 million since they broke up in 2015 under threat that she would go public about their affair.

Black’s ties to Epstein have raised questions in recent years, forcing Apollo to issue the results of an internal investigation that found Black paid Epstein $158 million between 2013 and 2017 for professional advice on tax audits, wealth management and estate planning.

Black, who stepped away from the firm a few months after the probe was made public, has denied any personal dealings with the convicted felon.

Ganieva on Monday questioned that assertion, however, saying “Epstein was introducing Black to single young women with whom Black then became involved in relationships.”

She never alleges that Black had sex with underage girls.

Wall Street’s legions of financiers, analysts and dealmakers — many of whom have already benefited from recent pay increases — can now expect double-digit bumps to their year-end bonuses, according to newly released data from compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates.

Bonuses for 2021 will be higher by as much as 35 percent in some cases with the biggest boost going to investment banking underwriters amid a surge in multi-billion-dollar deals, like Discovery and NBCUniversal, the data shows.

“When Wall Street does well, they pay well,” Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates explained. “And Wall Street has had their best year in a decade.”

Indeed, banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have posted record earnings as the economy comes roaring back to life.

A boom in deal-making, capital raising and IPOs have all helped to lift investment banking revenues, while the trillions the Federal Reserve has been pumping into markets has lifted many stocks to new highs.

Investment banking advisors and sales and trading professionals can expect their bonuses to increase as much as 25 percent as a result. Asset management professionals, including those managing hedge funds and private equity funds, will see a more modest bump – around 15 percent.

Still, for senior bankers a double-digit bonus increase can be worth hundreds of thousands — or even millions of dollars, Johnson tells The Post.

The bonus bonanza comes as Wall Street throws money at some staffers in an effort to retain talent. Jefferies Financial Group is the latest to bump base pay for junior bankers, the Wall Street Journal recently reported.

First-year analysts working for Richard Handler’s Jefferies will now make $110,000, up from $85,000, while third-year associates will earn $150,000, up from $125,000.

Last week, David Solomon’s Goldman Sachs also boosted base pay for junior bankers 30 percent, resulting in first-year associates earnings $110,000. Earlier this year JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley bumped pay for first-years up to $100,000 from $85,000.

Banks are doling out the beaucoup bucks to keep overworked talent from fleeing amid a dizzying workload thanks to the spike in deals.

In March, a leaked slideshow presentation compiled by 13 junior Goldman Sachs analysts detailed complaints about 100-hour workweeks. Some griped of shifts as long as 20 hours that left them little time to eat, sleep or shower, claiming that the grind damaged their physical and mental health.

The complaints led Goldman and JPMorgan to vow to hire more staff with the latter pledging to boost its headcount by 200. Private equity firm Apollo Global Management has reportedly offered some associates as much as $200,000 to stick around.

Elsewhere, Citibank CEO Jane Fraser told employees she was banning Zoom meetings on Fridays to address Zoom fatigue. Investment bank Jefferies even offered its junior staff the primo Peloton bike as a “thank you” for working long hours.

But with business booming, the sleep deprivation and job anxiety isn’t likely to go away, Johnson said.

“Banks aren’t going to turn business away — the stress and strain for workers will inevitably continue,” Johnson says.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shares of Moderna and BioNTech both skyrocketed on Monday amid growing enthusiasm over technology used in their coronavirus vaccines and its potential to help fight other ailments like cancer and malaria.

Monday’s rally came after BioNTech told investors on an earnings call that it’s pushing forward with plans for human trials for flu and malaria vaccines — as well as for cancer treatments.

The trials will rely on messenger RNA technology, or mRNA — a new type of vaccine used to protect against the coronavirus that may also have the potential to solve challenges in vaccine development for other infectious diseases and cancer.

Both BioNTech and Moderna currently use mRNA technology in their coronavirus vaccines.

Shares of Massachussetts-based Moderna soared 17 percent to end the day at $484.47, while Germany’s BioNTech closed 14.9 percent higher at $447.23.

BioNTech also reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results, posting $6.24 billion in second quarter sales compared to analysts expectations of $3.83, according to Investors Business Daily. The company expects to deliver a whopping 2.2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine this year.

The potential to cure ailments that kill millions of humans each year has left investors salivating. BioNTech stock has risen an eye-watering 422 percent since the beginning of 2021, while Moderna stock is up 333 percent, according to MarketWatch data.

The COVID-19 vaccines are the only marketed products commercially available from either company — but Moderna and BioNTech have said that mRNA technology has the potential to treat cancer, malaria and other diseases.

Pfizer, which developed a coronavirus vaccine alongside BioNTech, saw its shares climb a far more modest 1.5 percent on Monday and 24 percent since the beginning of the year. Pfizer is also far more diversified than its peers with a wide slate of commercially available drugs.

In a note shared with The Post, Jefferies managing director Michael Yee said Moderna “continues to trade like the ‘Tesla of Biotech’” — meaning the stock has a massive valuation based on high investor expectations about its future.

Moderna is “an innovation and disruption technology play,” Yee added, due to the company’s mRNA technology having the potential to supplant traditional medical treatments and create new vaccines.

Moderna was added to the S&P 500 index last month, helping to further boost the stock.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Apple on Monday said that iPhone users’ entire photo libraries will be checked for known child abuse images if they are stored in the online iCloud service.



The disclosure came in a series of media briefings in which Apple is seeking to dispel alarm over its announcement last week that it will scan users’ phones, tablets and computers for millions of illegal pictures.



While Google, Microsoft and other technology platforms check uploaded photos or e-mailed attachments against a database of identifiers provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other clearing houses, security experts faulted Apple’s plan as more invasive.



Some said they expected that governments would seek to force the iPhone maker to expand the system to peer into devices for other material.



In a posting to its Web site on Sunday, Apple said it would fight any such attempts, which can occur in secret courts.



“We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands,” Apple wrote. “We will continue to refuse them in the future.”



In the briefing on Monday, Apple officials said the company’s system, which will roll out this fall with the release of its iOS 15 operating system, will check existing files on a user’s device if users have those photos synched to the company’s storage servers.



Julie Cordua, chief executive of Thorn, a group that has developed technology to help law enforcement officials detect sex trafficking, said about half of child sexual abuse material is formatted as video.



Apple’s system does not check videos before they are uploaded to the company’s cloud, but the company said it plans to expand its system in unspecified ways in the future.

Apple has come under international pressure for the low numbers of its reports of abuse material compared with other providers. Some European jurisdictions are debating legislation to hold platforms more accountable for the spread of such material.



Company executives argued on Monday that on-device checks preserve privacy more than running checks on Apple’s cloud storage directly. Among other things, the architecture of the new system does not tell Apple anything about a user’s content unless a threshold number of images has been surpassed, which then triggers a human review.



The executives acknowledged that a user could be implicated by malicious actors who win control of a device and remotely install known child abuse material. But they said they expected any such attacks to be very rare and that in any case a review would then look for other signs of criminal hacking.

Oh, mon dieu!

There’s a champagne crisis in the Hamptons that’s forcing East End restaurateurs to fly in their own bubbly — or drink (gasp!) alternatives like cava.

The shortage is so bad that one of Zach Erdem’s billionaire customers plans to fly 15 cases of premium champagne on his private plane from France for his wife’s annual Hamptons birthday party.

Erdem, of 75 Main and Blu Mar, will then buy any leftovers to serve at the “unofficial after party” for Denise Rich’s 25th annual “Angel’s Ball,” which will be held in the Hamptons for the first time.

The unofficial after-party will be held at Erdem’s Buddha Lounge at Blue Mar.“

The Champagne plane won’t let us down,” Erdem said. “Not having champagne in the Hamptons is like Maine not having lobsters.”It’s not just the partygoers who are “suffering.”

“I have one Russian billionaire who comes to the Hamptons for one week every summer, after stops in Ibiza, St Tropez and Mykanos,” Erdem said. “He always drinks Cristal at breakfast. I had to tell him to bring his own or I’ll be serving him a $10 bottle of Prosecco instead.”

Blake Leonard, vice president of Stew Leonard’s Wines & Spirits of Farmingdale in Long Island and a certified sommelier, said they saw the shortages coming and bought 500 cases of champagne in June. It’s been paying off big time.

‘We’re now delivering to the Hamptons for the first time, and the No. 1 item is champagne,” she said. “We are trying to buy up whatever we can get our hands on, as prices will shoot up in September. In the last year, champagne houses sold more than in the last eight years combined. It’s supply and demand.”

Now that the restaurant industry is recovering from pandemic shutdowns, the champagne shortage is patrons’ No. 1 gripe, says Southampton restaurant owner Ian Duke.

“We may have to start rationing soon,” Leonard joked. “You can’t just put bubbles in a bottle. It takes time.”

Things are so bad that at the Capri Hotel’s Naia Restaurant, Michael Pitsinos’ weekend pool parties are offering cava, or Spanish sparkling wine, as a champagne substitute.“

The Hamptons isn’t going French this summer at Naia due to the champagne shortage, so we’re making an Ibiza-themed pool party with tapas poolside. The customers are loving the fiesta,” Pitsinos said.

Of course, “there’s a shortage of everything” and not just champagne, explained Lee Schrager, senior vice president of communications for the Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits of America, and founder of the New York City Wine and Food Festival.

“During the pandemic, the wine and spirits industry lost its hotel and restaurant accounts. When lockdown ended, the industry bounced back better and faster than expected,” he said.Still, it’s the champagne that wealthy Hamptonites are mourning, including Ian Duke’s Southampton Social Club.

“The most popular nightclub items — the high-end champagnes from Moet Chandon or Dom Perignon — can’t be found,” Duke said.

The preference for champagne, shown here, is so strong that one restaurateur is justifying serving cava — a Spanish sparkling wine — as a substitute by making it part of an Ibiza theme. AP

“They are out of stock, they come back, and then they disappear again,” said Duke, who explained that other nightclub staples, like a $900 Grey Goose magnum and a $1,942 magnum of Don Julio 1942, have also been in short supply.

Duke blames the crisis on a “perfect storm” of COVID-19 driving more people to the beach amid crippling supply chain woes and labor shortages that are hurting businesses everywhere. “We have more people out here than ever and we can’t get the food or liquor or staff to provide for all of them,” Duke said.﻿

“It all stems from COVID, which caused everyone to come out and buy houses, so no one who works here can afford to live here. Then there’s the entitlement factor and the fact that workers don’t want to work. They just want to stay home, and collect unemployment money,” Duke said. “Production then slowed when the restaurants and nightclubs shut down — and that came back to bite them in the rear.”

To handle the shortages, Duke says they promote what they have and “get by.”

“Although everyone is angry, upset and frustrated, they are still going out. This is just another way it has become more difficult for us to do our jobs, and we’ve had a rough go for 18 months. We could use a break somewhere along the line,” Duke said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@COPENHAGEN – Mineral exploration company KoBold Metals, backed by billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, has signed an agreement with London-listed Bluejay Mining to search in Greenland for critical materials used in electric vehicles.

KoBold, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to hunt for raw materials, will pay $15 million in exploration funding for the Disko-Nuussuaq project on Greenland’s west coast in exchange for a 51% stake in the project, Bluejay said in a statement.

Shares in BlueJay traded 26% higher on the news.

The license holds metals such as nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum and the funding will cover evaluation and initial drilling.

KoBold is owned by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.

Other KoBold investors include Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz and Norwegian state-controlled energy company Equinor.

BlueJay said previous studies found the area in western Greenland has similarities to the geology of Russia’s Norilsk region, a main producer of nickel and palladium.

“This agreement is transformative for Bluejay,” said the comany’s CEO Bo Steensgaard. “We are delighted to have a partner at the pinnacle of technical innovation for new exploration methods, backed by some of the most successful investors in the world.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment bank Jefferies Financial Group has markedly boosted salaries for its bankers, a source close to the matter said on Monday, mirroring a pay-scale trend by other Wall Street lenders.

The bank’s first-year analysts in the United States will now earn $110,000 annually, up from $85,000. Second-year analysts will make $125,000 per year, up from $90,000, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and asked for anonymity.

Salaries of associates were raised to $150,000 from $125,000, the source added.

The new pay scale, which was reported earlier in the day by the Wall Street Journal, has been in effect since July 1 and follows similar moves by major Wall Street firms to attract and retain top talent as dealmaking activity continues at an unprecedented pace.

Banks have also been introducing incentives to younger staff after a group of first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs Group complained of long hours and “unrealistic deadlines” in an internal survey in March.

Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, UBS Group AG , Lazard, and Morgan Stanley have also raised pay for their bankers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Domino’s Pizza is taking on food delivery apps that it says charge unexpected fees — by giving away $50 million worth of free food to random customers, the company announced Monday.

The Ann Arbor, Michigan-based pizza chain is calling it a “surprise frees” promotion in an effort to take on surprise fees that it says its rivals like DoorDash and UberEats charge.

“Unlike many third-party food delivery apps, Domino’s provides customers with one straightforward delivery fee, because we know that’s what customers want and deserve. There are no hidden city or service fees with Domino’s,” Domino’s COO and US president Russell Weiner said.

Anyone who orders Domino’s delivery online through Nov. 21 is eligible to get a giveaway item, like boneless chicken wings or a pizza, the company said.

Domino’s said customers will have just over a 7 percent chance of winning each time they order.

UberEats, DoorDash and other food delivery services have added fees in certain cities around the US as the result of government restrictions on how much third-party delivery services can charge restaurants.

DoorDash has added a roughly $1 to $2 delivery charge in cities including Chicago, Cleveland and Denver, CNN reported.

UberEats has charged a similar fee in Portland, Chicago, Minneapolis and Boston, the outlet added.

Domino’s, for its part, has long chosen to rely on its own delivery network rather than relying on third-party apps.

On the company’s second-quarter earnings call last week, Domino’s CEO Richard Allison said that while the company’s still a pizza company, he views third-party delivery platforms as the company’s “biggest competition.”

“We also believe that the fact that we use a single transparent delivery fee, we think over time, is an important competitive advantage,” Allison said.

“When I use a third-party delivery, I have to really get my calculator out to figure out what I’ve actually paid to have that food delivered, because maybe I got a discount on the delivery fee, but maybe I paid a service fee, maybe I paid a small order fee, maybe I have paid a fee because I happen to be in a city where they were charging an incremental city fee,” he added.

“We very much believe a single transparent delivery fee, over time, we think, will be important to customers.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Spending on airline travel slowed in July as the Delta variant spread, according to new data.

July consumer credit card data analyzed by JPMorgan Chase shows spending on air travel fell by a whopping 20 percent in late July as cases of COVID-19 rose around the world, including in the US.

“Airline spending has fallen almost 20 percent from a recent peak in mid-July, a larger decline than during the severe winter COVID wave, when spending was at much lower levels,” JPMorgan Chase economist Jesse Edgerton wrote in a research note.

That supports federal data showing that the number of people who passed through US airports was down 4 percent in the week of July 19 compared to the prior week — representing the first weekly percentage drop since April, according to the Transportation Security Administration.

Spending on restaurants also softened last month, albeit by a more modest 2.5 percent, according to JPMorgan’s report.

But Edgerton’s report also predicts that consumer spending will return to normal in a short period because the US appears to be mirroring the United Kingdom’s experience with the Delta variant, in which cases peak after three weeks and begin to subside.

“My guess is that the wave will end in a month or two … and this will end up looking like a short lived drag on spending and economic activity,” Edgerton said in an interview.

States that were first hit hard by the variant — Missouri, Arkansas and Nevada — are now seeing some of the slowest rates of new infections, and Louisiana, where the outbreak was worst, may already have peaked, according to Edgerton’s research.

The surge in airline travel kicked off in March as spring breakers took to the skies in droves. Travel ratcheted higher in the ensuing months as more Americans gained access to COVID-19 vaccinations.

But the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, which has reignited a debate about face masks, appears to have given some Americans pause about flying. Airline stocks took a beating in July on concerns about the Delta variant — and investors’ fears now appear to have been well-founded.

In July, Delta chief executive Ed Bastian told CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” “Demand has stalled as the virus has grown, particularly down here in the South, across the Sun Belt, coupled with the quarantine measures that are going in place in many of the Northern states. Those two factors are causing consumers to pause.”

Bank of America also chimed in, confirming that “the 2-year growth rate of air travel peaked four weeks ago and has taken a turn lower, potentially reflecting the risks from the Delta variant,” according to an Axios report.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@US job openings swelled to a record-high 10.1 million in June as companies continued to struggle to attract new employees amid an ongoing shortage of workers, the feds said Monday.

Openings reached 10.1 million by the end of June, up more than 6 percent from an upwardly revised 9.5 million in May, according to the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, data published Monday.

It’s the highest number of job openings ever recorded in the JOLTS data and the first time openings have shot past 10 million.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected to see 9.1 million openings for the month as they thought the labor market would round the corner of its choppy recovery in the month.

By sector, professional and business services saw the biggest rise of 227,000 new openings posted in June while retail trade saw 133,000 new jobs posted. Accommodation and food services added 121,000 new postings in June.

The number of people who quit their jobs increased to 3.9 million in the month and the quits rate increased to 2.7 percent, according to Monday’s data, while the layoffs and discharges rate was little changed.

That, along with data from last week’s jobs report that showed rising average wages, indicate an environment where workers have increasingly more options and bargaining power.

The labor market was thrown into turmoil this spring when demand for goods and services roared back from the depths of the pandemic and many companies found themselves understaffed to accommodate the surge in demand.

And as companies sought to hire, they had to compete for workers, many of whom appeared uninterested in taking the work that was available, largely retail, leisure and hospitality jobs.

Leisure and hospitality had one of the highest levels of job openings in June at more than 1.65 million, Monday’s data shows. Only trade and transportation, professional and business services and education and health care had more openings as of June, according to the data.

Monday’s JOLTS data show that the market for workers had not gotten much better by June, though last week’s jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that hiring accelerated in July.

Next month’s JOLTS report will show whether the acceleration in hiring outpaced the potential listing of more job openings in July.

Last week’s jobs report said there were about 9.5 million Americans looking for work in June, which means there were more job openings than there were people looking for work in that month.

In July, the number of Americans looking for work fell to 8.7 million.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Here we go again.

That’s the warning coming out of Goldman Sachs Group about China as the continued spread of the Delta variant threatens to slow the country’s economic growth yet again.

China has been locking down much of the country as the virus spreads and exports slow. But Goldman thinks the single-party nation will get the threat under control quickly, as it did in 2020.

“As of this writing, there are seven districts labeled high-risk and 191 districts labeled mid-risk. In the high-frequency data, the traffic congestion index based on 100 cities has begun to decline, which was not the case just a few days ago,” according to the report.

“Our forecasts assume the government brings the virus outbreak under control in about a month and the virus outbreak and related control measures mainly hit service activities. Industrial activities appeared less affected as of early August,” according to the memo.

Goldman economists slashed their growth estimates in the near term — cutting this quarter’s growth from 5.8 percent to 2.3 percent. But it predicted a rebound at the end of the year, saying fourth-quarter GDP growth will jump to 8.5 percent.

Overall, Goldman sees China’s lockdowns only slightly dampening growth over the entirety of 2021. It estimates GDP growth will drop to 8.3 percent this year from a previous estimate of 8.6 percent.

Still, the outbreaks have thrown China into crisis mode again. In recent days, the nation has sealed off an entire city to halt the spread of coronavirus and is gearing up to test all 11 million residents of Wuhan — the birthplace of the virus.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said Monday it has fired a manager who was accused of rape by another employee of the company.

In addition to the termination, two executives, Li Yonghe and Xu Kun, have also resigned, CEO Daniel Zhang said in a memo to employees.

The fallout comes after a female employee posted an 11-page account on Alibaba’s internal website saying her boss, Wang Chengwen, and a client sexually assaulted her.

The woman alleged that Wang pressured her to drink excessively, then kissed and groped her against her will.

She also claimed her superiors and human resources at the company failed to take the matter seriously in the five days since she reported it.

Zhang, Alibaba’s chief executive, said Wang “confessed that there were intimate acts with [her] while she was inebriated.”

“He will be fired and never be rehired. Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement,” he said.

The allegations and the woman’s 11-page essay were widely shared across social media sites in China and sparked sweeping discussion of workplace sexual harassment in the country.

While the #MeToo movement that shook the US and many Western countries has yet to take off in the same way in China, it has gained steam in recent months. Last month, for example, Beijing police detained Kris Wu, a Chinese Canadian rapper and former member of K-pop supergroup Exo, after a fan accused him of rape.

The recent allegations at Alibaba caught enough attention to draw the ire of China’s state media, which roundly criticized the company for its alleged delay in handling the allegations.

“Alibaba could not offer an answer that satisfies public opinion for this ham-handed inaction,” read an editorial in the Global Times tabloid published by the state-run People’s Daily.

Zhang noted in his memo that Alibaba’s chief people officer, Judy Tong, will also receive a demerit for the company’s poor handling of the allegations.

He outlined other steps, including company-wide anti-sexual harassment training, creating a dedicated channel for employee reports and establishing a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment.

“This incident is shameful for all Aliren,” Zhang said, using a term that refers to employees of the company. “We must rebuild, and we must change. Change is only possible if everyone takes individual action, but it must start at the top. It starts with me. Please wait and watch.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@DraftKings plans to buy online betting rival Golden Nugget Online Gaming for $1.56 billion, the companies said Monday — sending Golden Nugget’s stock soaring more than 50 percent.

Golden Nugget shares ended the day at $18.50, up an eye-watering 51 percent from the previous day. DraftKings shares ticked up 1.5 percent to $52.36.

If it closes, the all-stock acquisition will give DraftKings — which is primarily known for fantasy sports and sports betting — greater access to casino-style betting, the companies said in a release. Combining the businesses will bring DraftKings more than 5 million new customers and create in $300 million in synergies, the companies added.

The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.

As part of Monday’s deal, DraftKings will form a new holding company containing both DraftKings and Golden Nugget, which also owns the Landry’s Inc portfolio of restaurants.

Golden Nugget shareholders will receive 0.365 shares of New DraftKings’ stock for each share held under the terms of the deal.

Billionaire Tilman Fertitta, who controls 46 percent of Golden Nugget and also owns the Houston Rockets, will join the new firm’s board and has agreed to hold his shares for at least one year after the merger closes.

DraftKings and Golden Nugget have both benefitted from growing demand for online betting fueled by the pandemic and the loosening of gambling laws across the country.

However, a potential regulatory cloud is hanging over DraftKings’ head, with the announcement coming just days after the company revealed it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations that it is exposed to an international “black market” and organized crime.

The accusations were first made by short-seller Hindenburg Research, which issued a lengthy report in June on alleged misconduct centering around DraftKings’ 2020 merger with Bulgaria-based SBTech.

The tie-up exposed DraftKings to serious “black market” operations — including SBTech’s track record of operating lucrative illegal gambling businesses in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Iran, according to Hindenburg Research, which is also known for brutal takedowns of companies like Lordstown Motors, Nikola and Clover Health.

In a Friday earnings release, DraftKings told investors that it had received a subpoena from the SEC on July 9 “seeking documents concerning certain of the allegations raised in the Hindenburg Report.”

The Hindenburg report initially sent DraftKings shares plummeting 11 percent to $44.95, but the stock has since surpassed pre-report levels.

DraftKings has denied Hindenburg’s allegations, and the company played down the significance of the SEC subpoena in a statement to The Post.

“It is not uncommon for the SEC to investigate allegations in short-seller reports,” a DraftKings spokesperson said. “The SEC inquiry does not suggest any wrongdoing or agreement with the short-seller allegations, and we intend to cooperate with the SEC inquiry.”

Jessica Alba honestly looks like she’s having a relaxing holiday.

The actress-turned-business maven, 40, was snapped soaking up the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, along with her husband, Cash Warren, 42, preparing for a day of snorkeling. Both looked fit and tan carting their undersea equipment around the beach.

The pair met in 2004 on the “Fantastic Four” set and tied the knot in May 2008. They share three children: daughters Honor Marie, 13, and Haven Garner, 9, and son Hayes, 3 — none of whom appeared with them on the beach.

Perhaps the two needed some alone time. The “Dark Angel” star recently admitted on Katherine Schwarzenegger’s Instagram show “Before, During, and After Baby” that she has to work to keep the spark in her marriage with Warren alive, copping to feeling like a “roommate” to him.

“It’s all rosy for 2 1/2 years. But then after that, you become roommates,” she explained. “You’re just going through the motions. You have the responsibilities. It’s a lot of, like, checking the boxes, right?”

Alba said that initially the couple was diligent about weekly date nights with no talk about kids or responsibilities but “that stops, because of whatever.”

The Honest Company founder also confessed to sometimes taking Warren for granted.

“We have, like, obviously the friendship, the comfort of, like, ‘You’re not going anywhere,’ and so sometimes you don’t treat those people the best, right? You don’t consider their feelings in the way that you would consider other people’s feelings,” she said. “So that is something that I think is a constant one to work on.”

Alba acknowledged that she doesn’t have the answers to a happy marriage.

“If you’ve figured it out in your relationship, let me know,” she joked.

At least the pair’s social life is going strong: They partied all night in Miami in May to celebrate Honest Company’s billion-dollar valuation.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son is doubling down on his investments.

The billionaire investor behind tech companies like WeWork, Alibaba and Doordash plans to invest $2.6 billion of his own money for a 17 percent stake in SoftBank’s most recent venture capital play: Vision Fund 2, he said on Tuesday.

Son made the announcement during an earnings call with investors Tuesday — months after SoftBank announced it was tripling the size of the fund to $30 billion following months without any significant fundraising.

The company now says it has $40 billion of committed capital for its artificial intelligence focused fund, which boasts returns of 119 percent.

“Son is trying to create a culture of putting your money where your mouth is,” a person close to SoftBank tells The Post.

But Son’s commitment is also raising questions as business leaders are typically encouraged to avoid mixing their personal investments with their corporate responsibilities.

“Either he thinks the deals are good and he wants in or he’s trying to prop up the fund,” Jeff Stewart, co-founder and managing director of Global Public Offering Fund said.

Softbank’s Vision Fund 1 and 2 have become legendary for placing huge bets — and pouring massive sums — into startups including WeWork, Didi and DoorDash.

But the investment giant has also been going through a rough patch, starting in 2019 when WeWork took a major hit to its valuation.

The fund on Tuesday reported a net profit of $6.9 billion, a 39 percent drop over the prior year. The SoftBank vision fund reported a profit of $2.1 billion; the previous quarter Vision Fund profit was $58 billion.

Softbank faces a new challenge as China cracks down on tech companies there, including companies run by Alibaba’s Jack Ma.

Chinese companies make up 23 percent of the Vision Fund’s investments, with Alibaba makes up almost 50 percent of the company’s asset value SoftBank estimates.

Son also told investors on Tuesday that he would be cautious with Chinese investments moving forward given that country’s crackdown on all things tech.

“Until the situation is clearer we want to wait and see,” said Son, who has a 27 percent stake in Softbank, which declined comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Grubhub is doing away with a controversial phone ordering system that had restaurants across the nation paying the app commissions for orders that never took place, The Post has learned.

Starting Aug. 23, the food delivery and ordering company will be using call centers with actual customer service reps to facilitate orders from Grubhub-owned phone lines to restaurants, according to the Web site.

Previously, the Chicago company had relied on a computer algorithm to manage the phone lines it had set up to direct telephonic food orders to its restaurant clients.

But the algorithm, as The Post exclusively reported in 2019, had been unfairly charging restaurant owners between $4 and $9 for calls longer than 45 seconds — whether or not they resulted in an order.

Following The Post’s reporting, Grubhub soon faced mounting calls for refunds and pressure from legislators, including Sen. Chuck Schumer D-NY, who told Grubhub “to eat any fees they wrongfully charged restaurants or even customers.”

New York City Council members were also demanding that Grubhub refund all “erroneous phone order charges” to restaurants and threatened to “explore legislative solutions if the company fails to act.”

Last year the City Council followed up with a temporary law aimed at Grubhub’s practice for charging restaurants fees for telephone calls that never resulted in an order.

Grubhub alerted restaurant clients to the new system on Tuesday.

It said it will now give restaurant customers three choices when they call a Grubhub-generated telephone number assigned to a restaurant, including an option to speak directly with the restaurant for which there is no fee associated with the call.

It’s the second phone ordering system Grubhub has rolled out in less than two years.

In January 2020, the food delivery giant came up with a new phone system to address legislators’ concerns, but it still relied heavily on guesswork to determine whether and how much a restaurant should be charged.

Customers under last year’s system were prompted to press #1 to place an order or #2 for everything else. Grubhub said it would bill only for the “#1” calls that lasted longer than 45 seconds and didn’t charge restaurants if a customer had attempted to place an order when a restaurant was closed.

It had also agreed to not charge for calls placed by customers who had recently placed a food order with that restaurant. Under the original system, Grubhub had been charging restaurants for calls from customers checking up on or complaining about orders they had already made.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Movie theater chain and so-called meme stock AMC announced Monday that it’s working to let customers use bitcoin this year to buy tickets and concessions when purchased online.

CEO Adam Aron made the announcement on a conference call Monday evening with analysts to discuss the company’s second-quarter earnings report.

Aron said the movie theater chain will have the technology systems in place to accept the cryptocurrency as payment by the end of the year, as well as payment options such as Apple Pay and Google Pay.

“AMC is hereby formally announcing on this call that by year end, we will have the information technology systems in place to accept bitcoin as payment for movie tickets and concessions if purchased online at all of our US theaters,” he said.

“These new payment methodologies for us should also be implemented by year end,” he said.

In addition to Bitcoin, AMC will offer payment options such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. AP

Shares of AMC surged more than 7 percent in premarket trading Monday before leveling out later in the day.

The announcement marks an alliance of two of the most speculative assets of the year — cryptocurrencies and meme stocks. So-called meme stocks are usually struggling but well-known businesses that have seen their shares skyrocket thanks to interest by an army of retail traders that began playing the stock market during the pandemic on no-commission trading platforms like Robinhood.

Meme stock traders famously targeted GameStop earlier this year and have hit other stocks like Nokia and Bed, Bath and Beyond. Generally speaking, meme stocks are stocks that institutional investors like hedge funds have bet would decline in value.

Traders of AMC call themselves “apes” and have a huge and passionate base on social media, including Twitter and Reddit. They affectionally refer to AMC’s Aron as “silverback.”

Similar to meme stocks, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen wild price swings this year. In April, the price of bitcoin reached as high as nearly $65,000 per coin before tumbling down below $30,000 per coin last month.

Bitcoin was last seen trading at about $45,400 per coin, according to data from Coinbase.

Brock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, told The Post that the announcement “is mostly playing into the hype around Meme Stocks and its following in the reddit community.”

“That being said, it still is positive for the industry and, while it may not attract significant payments in Bitcoin, it should continue to put AMC back in people’s minds and attention, attracting people back into the crowds to attend in person,” he added.

“AMC has locations all over the country and it will benefit mainstream acceptance just by virtue of all movie goers seeing and hearing about the use of cryptocurrency for payments in their theaters.”

On top of AMC’s bitcoin announcement, the company also reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the quarter.

By the end of June, all of AMC’s theaters in the US and nearly all of its international theaters were open.

AMC saw 22 million guests in its theaters during the second quarter, the company said, up from 7 million in the prior quarter. But that’s way below the 97 million tickets it sold in the second quarter of 2019, before the pandemic.

“We are not taking a victory lap … We are still losing money; we are still burning cash,” Aron said Monday evening. “But we can see a light at the end of the tunnel.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Amazon customers can soon raise a stink directly with Amazon if they buy a faulty product from one of the company’s third party sellers.

The online giant has updated its complaint and returns policy to allow customers to complain directly to the Seattle retailer if they believe a product they bought on the site caused them property damage or that they have been harmed by it, according to a Tuesday blog post.

The change to its A-to-Z Guarantee, which become effective Sept. 1, are a shift from Amazon’s past practice of largely letting customers and third-party vendors hash out disputes between themselves.

Amazon is also agreeing to directly pay customers for property damage or injury claims below $1,000 — which it says account for 80 percent of claims — at no cost to sellers. It may also step in to pay for larger claims if the seller is unresponsive or rejects a claim that Amazon deems worthy.

The policy addresses a chorus of complaints against Amazon — which the company has been more aggressively confronting recently — that third party sellers are not adaquately policed, leading to sales of counterfeit and fake products.

The new policy states, “customers can contact Amazon Customer Service, and we will notify the seller and help them address the claim. If a seller does not respond to a claim, Amazon will step in to directly address the immediate customer concern, bear the cost ourselves, and separately pursue the seller.”

Shari Redstone is hitting pause on any potential partnership talks between her media company ViacomCBS and NBC owner Comcast in hopes of lining up more suitors, The Post has learned.

The billionaire heiress, who serves as chairman of ViacomCBS, has decided to hold off until next year before re-engaging in talks with Comcast’s Brian Roberts, according to two sources close to the situation.

This includes any talks of a merger or a joint domestic venture where Comcast and ViacomCBS could combine their respective streaming services, Peacock and Paramount Plus, according to a source.

Reps for ViacomCBS, Redstone and Comcast declined to comment.

Shari Redstone is hoping more suitors will approach ViacomCBS in the next year, sources said. FilmMagic

ViacomCBS’s directors had suggested to controlling shareholder Redstone that her business will likely attract multiple suitors if she waits to shop around, sources said. Redstone agreed with the board and the company is focusing on building out its business for the time being, these sources added.

“Board members are speaking to Shari and saying don’t panic,” a source said referring Hollywood’s consolidation frenzy.

It’s been widely reported that Comcast has been eyeing buying Viacom/CBS assets, which includes Nickelodeon and the Paramount Pictures movie studio, as industry consolidation heats up in an effort to compete for streaming subscribers.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts met with Redstone and ViacomCBS CEO and president Bob Bakish in late June in New York to discuss a potential streaming pact for international markets. Last week, ViacomCBS announced a distribution partnership in Europe between Paramount+ and Comcast’s Sky.

A June report from The Journal also that said Roberts was mulling a potential tie-up between his company and ViacomCBS. And in July, Roberts and Redstone were spotted at the Allen & Co. annual media conference, sparking further speculation about a deal.

Comcast’s Roberts has downplayed the idea of a merger, both publicly and behind the scenes. Speaking on CNBC after Comcast’s earnings report in late July he said: “We don’t feel we need to do M&A.”

But sources say that this may be because Roberts knows that a deal between Comcast and ViacomCBS might be easier to get past regulators if Redstone’s media company could first sell CBS.

Federal Communications Commission rules prohibit broadcasters from owning two of the major four networks, in this case NBC and CBS.

One potential buyer of CBS is the media entity that will emerge next year from AT&T’s planned sale of its WarnerMedia unit, behind HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN, and Discovery, which operates TLC, HGTV and Animal Planet.

But that new entity, to be run by Discovery CEO David Zaslav, cannot even think about any new deals until its own $43 billion merger is completed.

“Shari is hearing a lot of people could be interested in combining with ViacomCBS but not now,” a source said. That includes Zaslav, according to a person familiar with the media boss’s thinking.

Other people close to Redstone, however, insist that she’s not interested in selling CBS to anyone and that the most logical suitors at the moment are private equity firms.

Another source suggested that Redstone could also find a suitor in the tech world where companies like Amazon and Apple are scrapping for TV shows and movies to fill their streaming services.

“I think the hope is big tech comes in the picture,” the source said. “She can benefit from waiting.”

Amazon, which recently agreed to buy MGM, the movie studio behind the James Bond franchise, for $8.45 billion, may also be on the hunt for more film and TV shows once it closes that deal.

Sources close to Redstone also note another factor that may be drawing the media mogul to the sidelines— Bob Bakish, who she tapped to run ViacomCBS when the two formerly separate entities merged in 2019.

Bakish has only been running the business since December 2019 and is not interested in being replaced so soon, sources said.

“I don’t think Shari is ready to force Bob into doing a deal,” the source said.

Although he is close to Redstone, Backish was not at the Allen & Co. conference participating in the talks with Roberts, sources said.

On a ViacomCBS earnings call last week, in which he unveiled a massive $900 million deal for new episodes of “South Park,” Bakish said he will always evaluate every merger opportunity declining to elaborate further.

“We believe organic execution continues to be the right path,” he said, adding: “Of course, we will always evaluate any opportunities through a shareholder value creation lens.”

However, for the time being, the reality is ViacomCBS is simply not in play, sources close to the situation said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Citigroup is requiring its employees to get vaccinated against the coronavirus before stepping foot inside any of its major offices.

In a memo to its staff on Tuesday, the Big Apple bank run by CEO Jane Fraser told employees that they must be fully vaccinated before taking part in a return-to-office plan that will have employees back at their desks at least two days a week starting Sept. 13.

“Given the increased number of employees returning to these buildings, and the Delta variant in the US, we are taking this approach to ensure a safe workplace,” Citi’s head of human resources Sara Wechter wrote in the missive.

The mandate is a first for Wall Street as financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley do whatever it takes to get staffers back at their desks.

The rule applies to Citi’s major offices in NYC, Boston, Washington DC, Philadelphia and Chicago, but not to Citi bank branches.

Employees who don’t want to get vaccinated will have to make plans with their managers to work remotely, people with knowledge of the decision tell The Post.

There will be no carve-outs to the in-office rule for any reason — including religious and health exemptions.

Citi employees will still be expected to wear masks in the office, a policy the bank rolled out after the CDC recommended even vaccinated people mask indoors.

Earlier this summer, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies Financial also announced plans to require employees who wished to return to the office to get the COVID vaccine.

But they have not pulled the trigger yet — making Citi the first bank to do so.

Of course, the mandate could hinder Fraser’s return-to-office plans. The vaccine requirement comes about a month before employees are expected to return, but it can take up to six weeks to become fully vaccinated.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Saks Fifth Avenue’s owner is teaming up with co-working company WeWork to convert some of its retail space to office space as customers continue to do more of their shopping online.

The luxury department store will open the first SaksWorks spaces in September in the New York metro area, including its flagship store across from Rockefeller Center known for its elaborate Christmas displays.

According to a Wall Street Journal report, the companies will be setting up a shared office space in Saks’ former children’s store on the 10th floor of the building.

Another SaksWorks space will move into the shuttered men’s store in lower Manhattan and others will open in stores in Manhasset on Long Island, in Scarsdale in Westchester and in Greenwich, Conn., according to the report.

Employers or workers themselves rent space from WeWork facilities like this one in New York.

“The pandemic has changed so much about our lives, including how we

work and where we live. I’m thrilled to join SaksWorks in its efforts to serve the millions of Americans who now work remotely from their suburban homes or who find themselves as part-time commuters in this hybrid world,” SaksWorks President Amy Nelson said in a statement on Tuesday.

The move comes as the pandemic squeezes the already suffering business of bricks-and-mortar retail. Foot traffic has been down as consumers buy more things online. The pain is especially acute for stores in non-residential areas that rely heavily on tourists and office workers, like midtown Manhattan where Saks’ flagship store is located.

Saks Fifth Avenue is owned by Toronto-based Hudson’s Bay Co., which owns much of its real estate holdings, including some buildings where it operated the Lord & Taylor department store brand it sold a couple of years ago.

Some of the former Lord & Taylor stores will be converted to WeWork managed spaces, according to the report.

Most of the desks will be on wheels, so the layouts can change. The cost to workers will be $299 a month, according to the report.

WeWork will operate the spaces in return for a cut of revenue but won’t have to pay any rent, The Journal reports.

It’s not the first time WeWork and HBC have worked together. They struck a deal in 2019 when WeWork acquired the Lord & Taylor flagship building on Fifth Avenue for $850 million and had discussed a plan to open office sharing spaces in the 10-story department store.

“There is significant untapped potential for third-party usage of WeWork’s proprietary workplace management technology, which, for a decade, has powered how we operate, manage and sell our spaces with a member-focused mindset,” WeWork CEO Sandeep Mathrani said in a statement. “Today, with HBC, we take the first step toward expanding our technology platform.”

Dominion also filed a lawsuit making similar allegations against businessman Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of online retailer Overstock.com.

The lawsuits are the latest legal actions taken by Denver-based Dominion against Trump allies who amplified false theories about the firm.

In each of the three lawsuits filed on Monday, Dominion is seeking more than $1.6 billion in damages, citing lost profits and other harms.

In a statement, Newsmax said, “While Newsmax has not reviewed the Dominion filing, in its coverage of the 2020 Presidential elections, Newsmax simply reported on allegations made by well-known public figures, including the President, his advisors and members of Congress — Dominion’s action today is a clear attempt to squelch such reporting and undermine a free press.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Elon Musk’s SpaceX is buying a satellite internet startup in a move to bolster its own Starlink internet business, according to regulatory filings.

SpaceX company plans to buy Mountain View, Calif.-based Swarm Technologies, the companies said in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission on Friday.

Swarm’s business model centers around launching small, relatively cheap satellites into orbit that provide internet access to Earthbound customers. The company has 30 employees and has launched 120 satellites satellites so far, according to the Verge.

Musk’s SpaceX runs a similar satellite internet service called Starlink and has launched 1,700 satellites so far. It will absorb Swarm’s satellite and ground station FCC licenses, becoming a fully owned subsidiary of Musk’s company.

In the filing, the companies argued that the FCC should approve the deal because it would strengthen the companies’ “ability to provide innovative satellite services that reach unserved and underserved parts of the world.”

“Swarm’s services will benefit from the better capitalization and access to resources available to SpaceX, as well as the synergies associated with acquisition by a provider of satellite design, manufacture, and launch services,” SpaceX and Swarm said. “SpaceX will similarly benefit from access to the intellectual property and expertise developed by the Swarm team, as well as from adding this resourceful and effective team to SpaceX.”

The companies did not disclose the value or detailed terms of the deal in the filing and did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Swarm — which has raised $27 million from backers like Craft Ventures and Social Capital — was founded in 2016 by former engineers from Google, Apple and NASA.

The company drew the FCC’s condemnation and paid a $900,000 settlement in 2018 for launching four satellites without regulatory approval, SpaceNews reported.

Under the terms of the settlement, the company was subject to enhanced FCC oversight and agreed to give the regulator pre-launch notices for three years.

Other satellite companies feared at the time that Swarm’s move would lead to heightened regulation of the industry, the outlet reported.

For its part, SpaceX counts the US government among its largest clients. The company has several launch contracts with the Pentagon and last month was awarded a $178 million NASA contract to launch the agency’s first mission focusing on Jupiter’s icy moon Europa.

SpaceX and Swarm first agreed to merge on July 16, according to the filing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tesla CEO Elon Musk received almost $6.7 billion in compensation in 2020 — earning the tech entrepreneur over 11 times more than the country’s next highest-paid chief executive, a recent analysis found.

Musk’s massive pay came in the form of stock options that give him the right to purchase shares of Tesla at a pre-set price, as opposed to a salary or cash bonuses.

For Musk to receive the options, Tesla had to hit various business targets based on revenue growth, stock price and other figures that were spelled out in a 2018 pay package that was approved by shareholders at the time.

The electric carmaker’s stratospheric 740 percent rise in stock price in 2020 unlocked Musk’s ability to exercise his stock options — and cemented him at the top of Bloomberg’s annual Pay Index.

Those kinds of massive pay packages that are tied to the stock performance and other lofty business performance metrics are known as “moonshot packages” as they’re meant to incentivize executives to boost the value of the company they manage.

Bloomberg noted that these kinds of awards have become more common since Musk’s unusually massive one was approved in 2018.

At least 15 executives reportedly got awards worth $100 million or more last year, up three-fold from when Musk got his. Companies that have implemented similar award packages include Restoration Hardware, Paycom Software and JPMorgan, Bloomberg reported.

But Musk’s pay for the year was so uniquely gargantuan that the list includes a button that allows readers to “Scale without Elon Musk.”

Musk’s massive payday has now totaled him a cumulative $33 billion in on-paper gains so far — and has put him at the top of Bloomberg’s annual pay list for three consecutive years.

The second-highest-paid executive on Bloomberg’s list was Mike Pykosz, CEO of Oak Street Health, who received $568 million in a mix of salary, bonus, stock awards, option awards and perks.

All of the top ten highest-paid CEOs are men and most of them are white. Only five of the country’s 100 top-paid executives last year were women, according to Bloomberg.

Musk’s sky-high pay package and the rising popularity of so-called pay-for-performance packages comes as, by some measures, economic inequality between executives and rank-and-file workers reaches an all-time high.

According to Bloomberg, the median ratio between the pay for S&P 500 CEOs and their typical employees rose to 182 in 2020, up for the third year in a row. Some firms logged ratios in the thousands, Bloomberg noted.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Google has rolled out a new internal calculator to explain potential pay cuts to employees who choose to work remotely — and the early results suggests it will penalize its suburban staffers.

Screenshots obtained by Reuters show that Google employees who previously commuted an hour to Google’s Manhattan offices from nearby Stamford, Conn., for example, would see their salaries slashed by 15 percent if they choose to continue working from home.

By contrast, “Googlers” who live within NYC’s five boroughs and choose to work from home permanently would not see their pay slashed at all.

The screenshots also showed 5 percent and 10 percent differences for commuters living in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.

Google employees who move even farther away from the company’s offices have been warned they could face even harsher pay cuts. A worker who left San Francisco for Lake Tahoe, another expensive area of California, would have their pay cut by a whopping 25 percent.

That would mean an employee with a $150,000 salary would suddenly make less than $112,000 per year.

The calculator states it uses US Census Bureau metropolitan statistical areas, or CBSAs. Stamford, Conn., for example, is not in New York City’s CBSA, even though many people who live there work in New York.

News of the Google tool comes amid a broader debate at tech companies about remote work and compensation.

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have all warned employees who plan to leave expensive cities like New York and San Francisco that their pay will be slashed — while smaller tech companies like Reddit and Zillow say they’ll pay the same regardless of where employees live.

Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination, said Google’s pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely, including families.

“What’s clear is that Google doesn’t have to do this,” Rosenfeld told Reuters. “Google has paid these workers at 100 percent of their prior wage, by definition. So it’s not like they can’t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.”

Google, which has about 140,000 employees worldwide, took in $61.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of this year alone.

The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Post and did not address the Stamford commuter issue in a statement to Reuters.

“Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shake Shack is preparing to hike prices this year more than it usually does in an effort to fend off inflation and protect its bottom line.

The New York-based burger chain’s chief financial office Katherine Fogertey said on a conference call with analysts last week to discuss the company’s second-quarter earnings report that customers can expect to pay as much as 3 percent to 3.5 percent more for their food.

The price hike is planned for the fourth quarter of the year, Fogertey said, and will touch across a combination of various price tiers and digital pricing initiatives.

The planned price hikes are “higher than the approximately 2 percent menu price [increase] we have historically taken at the end of most calendar years, and we’ll be evaluating the need for further price increases that might go into effect in 2022, depending on how the cost landscape evolves through the rest of the year.”

Shake Shack has already raised prices three times in the past year, according to Eat This, Not That. In December, it hiked prices by 2 percent. In February, the company raised delivery prices through third-party delivery services by 5 percent, and then another 10 percent in the spring.

Katherine Fogertey is Shake Shacks’ chief financial officer. Shake Shack

The move comes as supply-chain hiccups, shortages and other costs ripple throughout the economy, squeezing companies’ abilities to eke out a profit. Along with higher costs of goods, companies, particularly restaurants, now have to pay their workers more in order to attract experienced employees.

Fogertey added on the call that “we expect wage inflation in the second half of 2021 to be in the high single-digit range.”

Several analysts on the call questioned why Shake Shack isn’t raising prices higher to improve the company’s profit margins even more.

Shake Shack’s CEO Randy Garutti said the company didn’t want to “go too far too fast.”

“We take our time and we do the right thing. We do not know yet whether inflationary pressures will be transitory, how long they will last, and there is just no reason to take too much at a time when there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world,” he said.

“I’m pretty woke on all that stuff,” the “Saturday Night Live” alum told Page Six. “I have a 14-year-old [son Gabe with wife Susan Yeagley]. In school, they really teach them well. So anytime I start going astray he says, ‘No, you’re kind of going in the wrong direction.'”

But the 67-year-old comedian allows that he’s never been one to push the envelope in his act.

“I wouldn’t want to offend anybody or insult anybody … My act has always been very appropriate,” he explained.

“I’ve never been a risk-taker as far as that was concerned. I’ve never been one of those edgy, ranting comics who just seemingly say what’s on their mind and sometimes get into trouble.”

Nealon began his career in stand-up, joined “SNL” in 1987 and stayed on for a then-record-breaking nine seasons, playing characters like Mr. Subliminal, the politically incorrect private investigator Frank Gannon and, of course, Franz (of weightlifting duo Hans and Franz) alongside Dana Carvey.

Since leaving “SNL,” Nealon has carved out a steady career in shows like “Weeds,” “Last Man Standing,” and a string of Adam Sandler movies. And in between stand-up appearance, he updates his YouTube series, “Hiking with Kevin,” in which he goes on hikes with various celebs.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s upcoming elevation to governor of New York has put her husband’s position at gambling and hospitality giant Delaware North in the spotlight, with government ethics experts calling it a conflict of interest.

Hochul is married to former federal prosecutor William Hochul, who now serves as general counsel and senior vice president at Buffalo, NY-based Delaware North, which owns and operates casinos across the country, manages government-contracted concession stands at venues like highway rest stops and state parks, among other operations.

In her role as governor, Hochul will be able to choose who leads the New York State Gaming Commission, which regulates sales and acquisitions of betting facilities in the state.

Hochul will also control the New York State Thruway Authority and New York’s Office of Parks and Recreation — both of which provide big business to her husband’s employer, the Daily Beast first reported.

The looming conflict of interest needs to be “top of the list” of matters that Kathy Hochul addresses on her first days in office, Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush told The Post.

“She’s got to have recusal,” Painter told The Post. “She has to stay out of anything having to do with gaming. Not only she, but she should make sure the governor’s office stays out of any issue that would affect this company.”

He added that Hochul should delegate any potentially relevant matters to her lieutenant governor. There’s no way around the fact that Hochul will have control over who’s appointed to the Gaming Commission, he added.

John Kaehny, executive director of the good-government group Reinvent Albany, told the Beast that Delaware North has spent $700,000 lobbying the state since 2019, largely trying to increase its position in the state’s gambling market.

“It’s unacceptable to have him as general counsel and her as governor,” he told the outlet. “The next governor should not be involved in enriching their spouse, it’s that simple.”

As governor, Hochul will also oversee airports and transit hubs in New York, as well as the expansion of the state’s new plan to license online sports gambling, an opportunity for which Delaware North has reportedly hired at least one powerful lobbyist in Albany.

Delaware North owns and operates the Finger Lakes Gaming & Racetrack in Farmington, NY, manages the Hamburg Gaming casino and just recently sold the Jake’s 58 casino on Long Island for a reported $120 million.

It also provides services at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and operates The Westin Buffalo hotel.

The company has raked in almost $50 million over the past 20 years in New York state contracts, including a $40 million award to service thruway travel plazas and over $10 million to operate concession stands and the gift store at Niagara Falls State Park.

A representative for Delaware North noted that its contract with the New York State Thruway ended in July.

“With her succession as Governor of New York State, Delaware North is implementing additional restrictions on Mr. Hochul’s interaction with the company’s business activities in New York State in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest that could be claimed to exist by virtue of the Governor’s private interests deriving from Mr. Hochul’s employment by Delaware North,” said Glen White, Delaware North’s spokesman.

“Effective immediately, Mr. Hochul will be precluded from involvement in matters relating to business conducted by Delaware North in New York State in which a New York State government official, department or agency is, or potentially could be, engaged,” White added.

Representatives for Kathy Hochul insisted to the Daily Beast that there’s “already a recusal process in place” to deal with any conflicts of interest, but the state executive’s office did not provide more information to The Post.“It is being evaluated with her new role as governor, and it will be completed before she takes office,” a spokesman told the Beast.

It’s unclear precisely how much Delaware North’s Hochul is paid, either in salary or a stake in the privately held company. Publicly released tax returns suggest he’s made well over $1 million before taxes over the past three years.

Reinvent Albany’s Kaehny also described the Hochuls as part of “the Buffalo oligarchy,” which controls nearly all of the city’s political and financial affairs. Kathy Hochul was born in Buffalo and represented a district that included Buffalo in Congress.

She also previously served as the clerk of Erie County, which includes Buffalo.

Kaehny noted that the family of the chairman of Delaware North, Jeremy Jacobs, who also owns the Boston Bruins, belongs to the same tight-knit group of Buffalo-born rulers.

“Buffalo is singular in how concentrated the power is, and how you really have a handful of people and companies that utterly dominate,” he said, noting that a local hospital and buildings at the state university sport the Jacobs name. “It’s based on mainly money, but also on political position.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Southwest Airlines said it expects a significant drop in revenue as Americans ditch travel plans amid rising COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant.

The company said Wednesday it saw a “deceleration in close-in bookings and an increase in close-in trip cancellations in August 2021, which are believed to be driven by the recent rise in COVID-19 cases associated with the Delta variant,” according to a filing with Securities and Exchange Commission.

Southwest said it expects August operating revenue to be down somewhere from 15 percent to 20 percent compared with the same month in 2019.

That’s a worse outlook than the one provided last month that predicted a 12 percent to 17 percent drop from pre-pandemic levels.

The company sees the concerns over the highly contagious strain carrying into September, too — adding that revenue for next month will likely be down 15 percent to 25 percent compared with 2019.

For the full third quarter, it expects revenue to be 15 percent to 20 percent lower than it was in the same period in 2019, the company said Wednesday.

The Dallas-based airline added that it was profitable in July, but said it might not break even in the third quarter.

Shares of Southwest traded slightly up Wednesday morning, which may have been driven by better-than-expected inflation data that showed the price of airfares is beginning to edge down after months of spikes.

It’s at least the second airline to warn that the Delta variant of the coronavirus is beginning to hurt business operations. Frontier Airlines said last week that the impact of the surge in cases is hard to predict, but added that it will likely not reach profitability.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This is one crash diet Oprah Winfrey won’t like.

Shares of Winfrey’s WW International, the diet company formerly known as Weight Watchers, plummeted by more than 25 percent on Wednesday after reporting a slowdown in the number of people signing up for the program.

Subscriptions for the quarter ending July 3 fell 1.9 percent to 4.9 million, while subscription and product sales fell 6.9 percent, the company reported late Tuesday.

The stock ended the day Wednesday lower 24.5 percent at $24.30 a share.

WW’s executives blamed seasonal shifts, saying summer is just not a good time for the diet industry.

“While people are acknowledging their need for re-committing to weight loss and wellness, our recent consumer research shows that at the moment they’re also asking for a pause to enjoy social reconnection,” WW CEO Mindy Grossman told investors during a conference call Tuesday.

It’s a sudden turnabout for the New York-based company, which had been riding high on a wave of consumers determined to shed pounds and get back into shape during the pandemic.

The stay-at-home trend had also been a boon for other diet companies, including Medifast and Noom.

“Subscriber trends in Q2 followed a more typical seasonal pattern than we expected, and our guidance reflects this trend,” WW’s CFO Amy O’Keefe said in a follow up statement Wednesday.

But Douglas Lane of Lane Research questioned whether people were indeed taking a break from dieting, noting that Medifast “is having a great year.”

“In 2020 they accelerated quicker than anyone expected and it’s been off to the races since,” he said of WW’s dieting rival.

Entertainment mogul Winfrey made a large personal investment in WW in October 2015 and continues to hold stock. She is also the company’s spokesperson through 2025.

Also dragging on the stock, WW provided guidance for revenue and profit growth that was lower than the analysts’ estimates, with revenues for the year expected to “approach” $1.3 billion. Analysts had estimated sales of $1.39 billion.

Earnings are projected to come in at $1.10 a share to $1.25 a share, compared with average estimate by analysts of $2.08 a share.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, including Apple and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota teamed up with Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. It would also prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system.

“I found this predatory abuse of Apple and Google so deeply offensive on so many levels,” Blumenthal said in an interview Wednesday. “Their power has reached a point where they are impacting the whole economy in stifling and strangling innovation.”

Blumenthal said he expected companion legislation in the House of Representatives “very soon.”

The stakes are high for Apple, whose App Store anchors its $53.8 billion services business as the smartphone market has matured.

Apple said its app store was “an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation, one that now supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states.”

Google declined to comment, but a spokeswoman cited previous company statements that Android devices often come preloaded with two or more app stores and that app sellers can allow downloads without using Google’s Play Store.

The bill won praise from Spotify, “Fortnite” creator Epic Games and Tile. Tile, which makes tags to find lost objects, complained earlier this year about Apple launching a rival product.

A similar law revision has been introduced in South Korea. Google said last year it would enforce certain in-app payment methods there and receive 30 percent commission fees from non-game digital co ntent.

Apple’s control over apps on its Store, and 15 percent to 30 percent commissions on digital sales have come under regulatory scrutiny. A federal judge is reviewing testimony to rule on an antitrust lawsuit by Epic Games.

Epic also sued Google for its app store practices, as have a big group of state attorneys general alleging that it unlawfully worked to maintain a monopoly for its app store for Android phones.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Flying taxi developer Archer Aviation is seeking $1 billion in damages from Wisk Aero, a rival backed by Boeing and Google co-founder Larry Page’s Kitty Hawk Corp., according to a court filing, raising the stakes in a heated legal dispute.

The two have been embroiled in litigation since earlier this year when Wisk accused Archer, whose investors include United Airlines, of stealing trade secrets involving electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

Archer countersued and said in a filing late Tuesday that it intends to “hold Wisk accountable for its false and malicious extra-judicial smear campaign that has caused substantial damage to Archer, likely to exceed $1 billion.”

A Wisk spokesperson said: “Archer’s counterclaim is ludicrous and its troubles are purely self-inflicted.”

Archer plans to commercially launch its first electric flying taxi “Maker” in 2024, one of an increasing number of investors and aviation companies piling into the competitive but yet-to-be-approved urban air mobility space.

“Filing a lawsuit does not give Wisk a free pass to make false and damaging statements outside of the judicial process, and yet that is exactly what Wisk has been doing,” an Archer spokesperson said.

He said Archer would continue to seek damages even if Wisk drops its claims.

Wisk, however, plans to pursue its case, its spokesperson said.

Wisk’s initial lawsuit was filed in April, two months after Archer announced plans to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp, led by investment banker Ken Moelis.

Last month, Archer and sponsor Atlas slashed the pro forma enterprise value of the startup by $1 billion to $1.7 billion in a revised deal between the two companies.

Its other investors include Stellantis and Mubadala Capital.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Comcast’s NBCUniversal is postponing its return to office, citing a rise in breakthrough cases of COVID-19.

NBC had been planning a large-scale return to the office after Labor Day, but it is now moving the date to Oct. 18 “at the earliest,” the company said Wednesday. And the company will require employees, when they return, to be vaccinated.

According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, Comcast chief administration officer Adam Miller broke the news to employees via an internal email.

“Recent developments, including the rise in regional positivity rates due to variants and breakthrough cases, and guidance from medical experts and authorities have led us to the conclusion that we need to alter our approach,” Miller wrote, adding that fully vaccinated employees can return to the office on a voluntary basis now.

When employees finally return in October, NBC will require its US employees to be fully vaccinated, Miller said. The company will also require those employees to provide details of their vaccination status.

Many other US companies have reassessed their office reopening plans amid spikes in the infection rate due to the Delta variant. Media companies like CNN and Discovery have delayed their return-to-work plans to October, while the New York Times has postponed its return “indefinitely.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Any woman can be a magazine cover girl these days — if she’s willing to pony up the dough.

Juliet Amelia, a 45-year-old licensed massage therapist from Florida, looked like the hottest model around when she suddenly appeared on eight Playboy international editions — including Playboy Sweden, Playboy South Africa and Playboy New Zealand — during a 12-month period from 2018 to 2019.



Amelia — who now sells copies of these covers as well as other “uncensored images” on her website — also was splashed on the front page of British men’s magazine FHM in South Africa and Australia during the same period.



“Not even Pamela Anderson was on as many covers,” said Johnny Kortis, former editor and publisher of Playboy Slovakia.



Kortis claims Amelia would have added Playboy Slovakia to her collection except for the fact that he turned down a $10,000 offer by a photographer.

Massage therapist Juliet Amelia has graced the covers of eight international editions of Playboy. Instagram

Playboy Slovakia is not for sale, said Kortis, who claims the practice was so rampant when he was running the magazine that he complained to headquarters, saying it was watering down the brand.



Playboy, which now only runs content online after dropping its print version last year, said it prohibits models from paying to appear in the magazine founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953.



“Playboy Enterprises does not condone the practice of charging models to be in our pages or those of our international editions,” said a Playboy spokeswoman. “This practice is counter to Playboy’s brand standards. We urge any model who has been approached to make us aware of the situation.”



Amelia didn’t return requests for comment.

Magazine covers are still jealously guarded terrain for editors of most US publications. But they are increasingly “for sale” in a shadowy overseas market where wannabe pinup girls are promised prime media real estate in exchange for a fee — often as much as $10,000, not including the cost of the wardrobe, makeup, shooting and editing, which is also paid for by the model.

Photographers often broker these transactions — collecting money from eager models and then shopping the glamor shots around to overseas versions of popular men’s magazines, sources said.

“Sometimes you pay the magazine these days and sometimes they do it for free depending on the girl, her social following, her looks and what’s going on in her life,” explained photographer Ryan Dwyer

If the model is the girlfriend of a famous athlete, “they will do it for free,” Dwyer said. “If she’s Lacy the stripper from Vegas, they want to get paid.”



The practice of models paying for placement has blossomed thanks in part to social media sites like Instagram, where all that matters is the appearance of success. A cyber “cover” can help aspiring influencers gain social media followers, which can then lead to forms of revenue, like brand sponsorships.

And with readership in sharp decline, some magazines can no longer afford to finance splashy shoots in exotic locales, or pay big bucks for the publishing rights of an undiscovered beauty.



“I used to get $7,500 for a cover, $3,500 for a spread for five or six pages,” Dwyer explained, referring to the good old days of magazine shoots.



“I used to work and see a random hot girl in a coffee shop. Back then, I’d supply clothes and makeup and hair and pay for it all and then sell it to the magazines. I wasn’t just picking up any girl. I knew I could sell it and that’s how I’d get paid,” he said.



As magazine “budgets started to dwindle,” Dwyer realized he could make more money churning out covers for women willing to pay for the privilege.

“Who doesn’t want to be on a cover of Maxim?” said Kaila Methven, who runs an LA-based lingerie company. DailyCeleb.com

“I went from shooting hot girls in London, UK and Rome to plastic-surgery chicks that wanted covers. I downgraded for sure quality-wise but financially [it] was the total opposite,” he said.

“Who doesn’t want to be on a cover of Maxim?” said Kaila Methven, who goes by the name Madame Methven and runs an LA-based lingerie company.



Cover girl for a “special travel edition” of Maxim South Africa in February 2018 and Playboy Mexico later that same year, Methven denies she ever paid for a cover. But the photographer behind her South Africa cover photo says the magazine didn’t hire him — Methven did.



“Her team reached out to me saying they wanted [me] to shoot her,” Irvin Rivera told The Post of Methven, who bills herself as a Kentucky Fried Chicken “heiress” since her family once owned a vast South African chicken farm that was a vendor to KFC.



At the end of the shoot, Methven paid for the photos she liked, including the one that landed her on the Maxim South Africa cover, he said.



Rivera said he wasn’t involved in getting the photo on the cover of the magazine. “She knows someone from there,” he said of Maxim South Africa.

Methven called the claims an attempt by Rivera “and his associates, to try and grab one last headline at my expense.”

“It is unfortunate that myself, and other hard-working women in the industry, are constantly criticized rather than celebrated for our accomplishments,” she said.

Another model who has graced the cover of Maxim South Africa ended up suing the parent publication, claiming she was duped into a pay-to-play scheme that resulted in her forking over thousands of dollars only to find out she was being placed on “fake” covers.



Russian-born Marina Pahomova, also known as Marina Pamo, claims she was lured into the alleged scheme by photographer Brian B. Hayes, who sold himself online as the exclusive photographer for Maxim Middle East and Maxim South Africa.



“Some magazines … will ONLY publish my photos on their covers,” he allegedly wrote on his Facebook page in 2016. “We are proud to provide FREE submissions for those models who book photoshoots with me.”



Hayes told Pahomova she would need to pay $2,000 for a photo session so he could present the right kind of photos to Maxim, the lawsuit said.

He then suggested a second photo session so Pahomova could have “other ‘looks’ for the other publications,” costing another $3,000.

After the second photo shoot was over, Hayes allegedly told Pahomova it would cost even more money to get her photos “on the cover and as a feature inside” Maxim magazine.

He directed her to wire $6,000 to his account and told her he was friends with the editor of Maxim South Africa, Dirk Steenekamp. He even sent her a screenshot of an allegedly pre-approved Maxim South Africa cover with Pahomova as the cover model, the lawsuit said.



Pahomova was able to buy print editions of her May 2016 Maxim South Africa magazine cover. But she claims she was also conned into paying her way onto a slew of “fake Maxims” that were allegedly being produced in Muslim countries that had banned the mag from appearing on newsstands.

In her lawsuit, she said she believes Hayes has duped “hundreds” of models over the years, and netted himself over $1.5 million.

“Maxim is defrauding the general public into spending money on purchases of fake Maxims along with defrauding models and commercial advertising that paid for placements in fake Maxims, resulting in damage in the amount of several million dollars,” the lawsuit said.

Maxim didn’t respond to requests for comment.

When The Post called Pahomova last year, she said the suit was settled and abruptly hung up the phone. Maxim appears to have never issued a formal response to the lawsuit, which was settled in February 2020, court records show.



Neither Steenekamp nor Hayes returned requests for comment about Pahomova’s claims. But in the settlement, Hayes also acknowledged that he charged her $6,000 for her Maxim cover and he gave her back the rights to the 2,000 photos he took of her.



Pahomova, meanwhile, was fined by the judge for not showing up to depositions, legal papers show.



Fitness model Paige Munroe took a “cover” image off her Instagram page when she learned the story behind it. Facebook



The practice of paying for covers is condemned by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which boasts members from the nation’s top glossy magazines.



“ASME’s position on covers for sale — on any content — is: Don’t deceive the reader,” said Sid Holt, CEO of the trade association.



Of course, many covers nowadays live only in the cyber world with no magazine pages — or readers — behind them. Models are often posing for nothing more than a digital mockup with the magazine’s logo, headline and model that they can post on social media, sources said.



Photographer Joel Alvarez outed this practice in 2019 when he railed on Facebook against a “mock cover” he claims he shot for Maxim France under then-owner Florent Carmin.



“Even though Maxim France never actually went into circulation it’s still nice to see my work on a mock cover,” Alvarez wrote. “But I’ve noticed a lot of [people] posting and even believing that Maxim France is an actual publication.”



Alvarez — known for his 2017 Black Tape Project, featuring beautiful women dressed in outfits made of skimpy, strategically placed strips of electrical tape — attached to his Facebook screed a Maxim France cover of fitness model Paige Munroe wearing a gold version of his electric-tape “bikinis.”



The bare-bones cover offers little more than a picture of Munroe, who boasts 102,000 Instagram followers, with a headline in French that translates roughly to: “The bombshell is the type to be respected.” The cover doesn’t even have a date.



Munroe told The Post she didn’t pay for her cover and was stunned when The Post informed her that there may have been no magazine pages behind it. She said she did the photo shoot in LA with Alvarez and Carmin, believing it was for a print edition of the mag.

“I’ve never paid for a publication in my life. If someone paid for something for me, I was not aware of that, nor would I ask them to do that,” Munroe said. The Maxim France “cover” was removed from Munroe’s Instagram page after The Post contacted her.

Carmin responded to Alvarez’s Facebook post by threatening legal action. “Kindly remove that post of [sic] your page,” he wrote, “or lawsuit will be filed.”

But when reached by The Post, Carmin said he is no longer in charge of Maxim France after getting heat from Maxim USA over the way he was running the business. He said his problems with the home office began shortly after The Post began contacting Maxim US with questions about his operation back in 2020.

In an interview, Carmin acknowledged that he did “very few” print editions of the magazine after landing the Maxim France license in 2018. He said he did lots of “digital covers,” often producing several “covers” in a single month.

Carmin also insisted he never took money directly from models to appear on his cyber covers. He only acknowledged being paid by “sponsors” of models.

In the case of Munroe, Carmin said he did the shoot as a “favor” to Alvarez, not in exchange for money.

In addition to the photos, Bella Baez shared her experiences with depression. Instagram



While the pay-for-play model of magazine covers can be exploitative, some women walk away feeling richer than ever — as was the case for Santa Monica-based fitness buff Bella Baez, who appeared on Maxim New Zealand’s cover in 2020.



The California native said she paid $12,000 to be featured on the cover and an inside spread that included an inspiring Q&A about “a broken heart,” and how it led her to get in the best shape of her life and compete in Miss Bikini competitions.



She said she paid $2,000 for the photo shoot with Hayes, the photographer named in the Pahomova suit. Another $10,000 was “for Maxim to get published and to get a page spread.”



Bella Baez partly financed her foray into Maxim by selling her valuable handbags.

And she doesn’t regret it for a second.

One reason is that it was cathartic. To pay for the cover and spread, Baez sold Chanel bags she got from the same ex-fiancé who sent her spiraling into depression after they broke up in 2016.

“It’s just materialistic things,” she said of the designer bags. “I wanted to share my story and I wanted to inspire people so that, to me, is worth more than a single bag.”

Maxim New Zealand didn’t return a request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Samsung is hoping cheaper but more durable versions of its foldable phones will broaden the appeal of a high-concept design that’s so far fizzled with consumers.

The electronics giant on Wednesday launched its effort to turn things around with two new products designed to function as both a phone and, when unfolded outward on a hinge, a tablet.

The larger Galaxy Fold3 boasts a 7.6-inch display when unfolded and will sell for $1,800, a 10% drop from last year’s model. The other device, the Galaxy Flip3, looks more like a flip phone, but can still be opened from its clamshell position into a 6.7-inch display. It will sell for $1,000, more than 25% below the price for last year’s original model.

Besides the new phones, Samsung unveiled its first smartwatches powered by software designed in tandem with Google as both companies try to catch up with Apple in that part of the wearable tech market.

Since releasing its first foldable phones in 2019, Samsung has been hyping the technology as a breakthrough that will spur more consumers to splurge on new phones instead of holding on to older devices until they wear out or upgrading to new models that have most of the same features.

But foldable phones have barely made a ripple in the smartphone market, with roughly 2 million of the devices shipped last year, according to the research firm International Data Corp. That’s a tiny fraction of the nearly 1.3 billion smartphones shipped worldwide last year, IDC said.

The larger Galaxy Fold3 will sell for $1,800, a 10 percent drop from last year’s model. The smaller Galaxy Flip3 will sell for $1,000, more than 25 percent below the price for last year’s original model. AP

“What has really been holding back the mass consumption of these foldable devices is the high price,” IDC analyst Nabila Popal said. “Most people really don’t see the need for it. At least nothing that justifies forking out an additional thousand dollars.”

Popal believes Samsung’s lower prices for its latest foldable phones are still too far above what most consumers are willing to pay for phones. That’s one reason IDC projects only a modest uptick in foldable phone shipments this year, to an estimated 6 million to 7 million devices.

Besides high prices, sales have been held back by doubts about whether the foldable devices can withstand the wear and tear that traditional smartphones typically endure. Those worries have shadowed Samsung’s foldable lineup since it delayed the release of first models in 2019 to fix problems with bulging screens and flickering displays.

Samsung’s new foldable phones are now compatible with its S Pen stylus. AP

Samsung has equipped its newest foldable phones with more durable glass and water resistance to reduce the chances of the devices being damaged. It has made the foldable phones compatible with its popular S Pen stylus for the first time to woo customers accustomed to using the digital writing tool on Samsung’s traditional Note and Galaxy phones.

In another sign of foldable phones’ progress, nearly 50 of the top 100 mobile apps are now available for its unique format, said Drew Blackard, the South Korean company’s vice president of product management.

Those improvements have emboldened Samsung to make the foldable phones its marquee products during the second half of the year, backed by a marketing campaign that will hail their advantages.

Samsung’s foldable phones haven’t ignited consumer interest thus far, and some analysts say the price cuts don’t go far enough to lure buyers. AP

Blackard likened the third generation of Samsung’s foldable phones to the third generation of the company’s Note phones that came out in 2013 and changed the perceptions of a product lineup that was initially mocked for introducing smartphones with 5-inch screens. Within the next year, Apple released the first model of its trendsetting iPhones with bigger screens that have now become a standard feature.

But Apple still hasn’t felt compelled to make an iPhone with a foldable screen yet.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AT&T is in talks to sell WarnerMedia’s popular celebrity gossip site TMZ to Fox, according to a report from The Information.

The move comes as AT&T has inked a $43 billion deal to spin off its WarnerMedia entertainment division to Discovery, owner of TLC, Animal Planet and HGTV.

Neither Fox nor AT&T/ WarnerMedia returned requests for comment.

Until that mega-deal closes — sometime in the middle of next year — the telecom giant is required to operate on a business-as-usual basis, the report said.

Over the course of the year, AT&T, led by CEO John Stankey, has focused on selling off non-core businesses to raise cash in order to pay down debt and make new investments in 5G technology.

Aside from the Discovery deal, this year alone, AT&T has sold its animé streaming business Crunchyroll to Sony for about $1 billion, and it spun off its DirectTV business, selling a 30 percent stake to private equity firm TPG.

In the case of TMZ, it isn’t clear if the gossip site was part of the Discovery deal and if there would be any adjustments in the deal terms as a result.

The bulk of the investment bank’s interns say they would like some work-from-home options when they enter the workforce full-time, according to an internal survey conducted by Morgan Stanley.

Some 71 percent of Morgan Stanley’s 120 Europe-based interns said this, compared to 66 percent of its 341 North America-based interns, the survey found.

The survey results come as Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman joins the growing chorus of Wall Street CEOs calling for their workforces get back to their desks.

Gorman has ordered his staffers to return to the office after Labor Day or suffer the consequences, saying: “If you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York, none of this ‘I’m in Colorado, working in New York and getting paid like I’m sitting in New York City.’”

Ironically, Gorman and others, including JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, have cited their interns as a prime reason for demanding staffers get back on the subway.

“Make no mistake about it. We do our work inside Morgan Stanley offices, and that’s where we teach, that’s where our interns learn, that’s how we develop people,” Gorman said at a U.S. Financials, Payments & CRE conference in June.

Last month he reiterated the position on an earnings call: “I fundamentally believe the way you and I develop our career is by being mentored and by watching and experiencing the professional skills of those who came before us,” the Wall Street mogul told analysts. “You can’t do that sitting at home by yourself, there’s a limit to Zoom technology.”

Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

At Goldman Sachs, most Big Apple staff were required to be back at their desks in June. JPMorgan Chase has brought back staff regardless of their vaccination status but is capping office capacity at 50 percent with a longer-term goal of keeping 10 percent of the company’s 225,000 workforce at home permanently.

Meanwhile, UBS — Switzerland’s largest bank — is striking a different tone than its American counterparts and is letting most employees permanently work from home at least some of the time. The bank is also holding off on setting a date for a return to the office.

Citi, run by CEO Jane Fraser, has cited child care issues as the reason she’s waiting to force staff back in. Citigroup is instead calling for workers to start coming in two days a week starting next month and they must be fully vaccinated to return.

One wrinkle in Morgan Stanley’s plan to bring all employees back is that the bank is prohibiting unvaccinated employees from returning. Still, Gorman is quick to point out the double standard of people who are out and about town but won’t return to their desks. “If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office,” Gorman said in June.

And junior staffers may ultimately get the flexibility they want — at least for a few more months. As the ultra-contagious Delta variant surges, some banks including Wells Fargo and BlackRock are pushing back their return to the office.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase rose 7 percent Wednesday morning after the company reported better-than-expected second quarter profits.

The digital coin exchange late Tuesday reported $1.6 billion in net profit for the quarter, representing earnings per share of $3.45. That eclipsed Wall Street’s expectations of $2.33 per share.

Coinbase trading volumes also surged 38 percent to $462 billion during the second quarter.

The company, whose success is tethered to risky digital assets like bitcoin, warned that it third quarter trading volumes will be lower than the second quarter.

Investors seemed to brush off the warning, however, sending the stock up 7 percent on Wednesday to $288.22. Coinbase shares have surged about 15.2 percent over the past month, but are remain far below it’s April stock debut price of $381.

Coinbase faces other potential performance pressures, including the growing prospect of government regulation, which could dampen profits for both individual traders and companies like Coinbase that rake in cash through transaction fees.

Securities and Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler said last week that crypto traders need more investor protections, calling the digital currency world “rife with fraud, scams and abuse.”

In Coinbase’s Tuesday earnings call Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas told investors the company is watching the SEC closely.

“We’re eager to understand the legal framework for the concerns that he has raised and how any of those may impact our product roadmap,” she said.

Even while acknowledging the threat of government regulation, analysts from Wedbush Securities set a 12 month price target of $300 for Coinbase shares, predicting “strong earnings power for the next 3 to 5 years.”

“On the other hand, the stock will likely continue to be volatile given multiple broad factors, mostly related to the regulatory environment,” Wedbush analysts Moshe Katri, Dan Ives and Ryan Campbell added.

Other analysts have raised concerns about Coinbase’s profits and stock price being too tied to the highly volatile price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency.

But the company’s second quarter results show Coinbase customers are increasingly investing in a wider variety of digital coins.

Bitcoin trades comprised 24 percent of Coinbase’s trading volumes for the quarter, down from 39 percent in the first quarter.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Inflation continued to surge in July, but appeared to settle close to the fastest pace in almost 13 years as the economy continues to emerge from the pandemic, the feds said Wednesday.

The Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index, which measures a basket of goods and services as well as energy and food costs, jumped 5.4 percent in July from a year earlier.

That’s the same as June’s 5.4 percent year-over-year rise in prices, which marked the biggest 12-month rise since August 2008, just before the financial crisis sent the US into the worst recession it had seen since the Great Depression.

Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent from the month prior, the Labor Department said.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected a 5.3 percent year-over-year spike in July and monthly increase of 0.5 percent.

The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 4.3 percent from a year ago, lower than the 4.5 percent year-over-year jump that the index saw in June, which marked the fastest acceleration since 1991.

“Last month’s deceleration in price growth is a welcome sight and supports the view that the recent spike will prove transitory,” said Curt Long, chief economist at The National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions.

Much of the price increases this spring have been from sectors that were hit particularly hard by the pandemic and subsequent shutdowns and have since snapped back to high demand, such as used car prices, airfares and fuel costs.

Those prices remained at the center of attention in July, but the new data suggests they’re beginning to come down as affected industries work their way through kinks in the supply chain and other short-term issues.

“Used car prices, which rose 7.3 percent in May and 10.5 percent in June, ticked up by just 0.2 percent in July,” Long noted. “Among the other categories most affected by the reopening, airfare also dropped dramatically, although hotel prices continued to advance at a rapid pace.”

Used car and truck prices jumped a modest 0.2 percent from June, down from the eye-popping 10.5 percent month-over-month spike seen in May.

From a year ago, used car and truck prices are still up 41.7 percent, according to the data.

Airline fares, another price point that’s seen massive increases in recent months, fell by 0.1 percent in July from June, offsetting some of the 2.7 percent month-over-month increase seen in May.

Airline fares are still up 19 percent from last July, when the pandemic had largely shuttered air travel.

Food prices continued to increase in July, up 0.7 percent from the prior month, according to the data, and 3.4 percent from a year ago.

Meats led the way higher in the food index, with frankfurters and various cuts of pork up 4.8 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, from a month prior. The price of eggs also rose 1.6 percent from the month prior.

The price of eating out rose 0.8 percent last month — a whopping pace not seen since February 1981, according to the data. A major reason was eateries paying more to staff up for an economic rebound and then passing along the costs.

Energy prices rose substantially, too, up 1.6 percent from a month prior and now almost 24 percent higher than a year ago. Gasoline specifically rose 2.4 percent from May and is now up almost 42 percent from a year ago.

The Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index jumped 5.4 percent in July from a year earlier.

Notably, housing and shelter prices continue to climb, bolstering the argument that inflation could stick around for longer than the summer. Shelter, which makes up nearly one-third of the overall price index, increased 0.4 percent for the month and 2.2 percent from 12 months ago.

In the New York-Newark-Jersey City area, consumer prices only rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier. And from June to July, prices actually edged 0.1 percent lower, according to the data.

According to consumer spending expert Chris Benabu, chief operating officer of Merchant Industry/Swipe4Free, a credit card processing company that services over 15,000 New York-Metro area businesses, there’s been an average 6 percent increase in average dollar amount per transaction.

The increase was led by increases in restaurant, bodegas and other retail establishments, he told The Post.

“We are observing an increase of around 6 percent per average payment, meaning that New Yorkers are paying that much more for their slice of pizza, their lunch, their groceries, or other everyday household items, according to our data,” he said.

“Businesses are being forced to raise costs just to make ends meet, which is difficult both for owners and everyday New Yorkers alike,” he added.

One driver of the massive annual gain in prices is very low inflation this time last year, when the pandemic gutted the economy and consumers were staying indoors and spending less.

That could distort year-over-year comparison as the economy reopens, but is expected to phase out closer to the winter, when prices of many goods began to rebound in 2020.

Year-over-year comparisons aside, prices are spiking throughout the economy for a variety of reasons, including supply-chain bottlenecks as the economy rapidly reopens from the pandemic.

A labor shortage that’s preventing many businesses from fully reopening as well as subsequent wage hikes to attract new workers is also driving up some costs.

Many companies are now passing those costs on to consumers, sending the price for new houses, food — and more — upward.

Anthony Minopoli, president and chief investment officer, at the Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors, noted that companies might use the cover of inflation “to raise prices as they have not had any real pricing power for some time.”

Federal Reserve officials have so far maintained their position that inflation is mostly temporary and will likely subside this year. They’ve cited this as a reason why they haven’t yet pulled back on their economic support measures like the bond-buying program.

Last week’s July jobs report showed that the country added a whopping 943,000 jobs in the month, more than expected, in a sign that the labor market recovery could finally be gaining steam.

Fed officials have said they will look for more confirmation of that in the next few jobs reports before a tapering of their financial support measures will be considered.

“I think this keeps taper talk on the table because inflation is staying relatively high and transitory may mean a little longer,” Minopoli said.

“If the supply chain kinks and businesses raising prices remains sustained, ‘transitory inflation’ might be a little less transitory than Fed Chair Powell will like and the hawks at the Fed may push a little harder on timing and speed of taper,” he added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A group of researchers has called on the Food and Drug Administration to pull certain popular sunscreen brands after they said they’ve found evidence of a potential cancer-causing chemical.

Craig Downs, executive director of the nonprofit Haereticus Environmental Laboratory (HEL), led researchers in a letter calling on the FDA to pull all sunscreens that contain the active ingredient octocrylene.

Downs and his team said they’ve discovered that the ingredient may degrade to benzophenone, a suspected carcinogen that can also interfere with key hormones like estrogen.

Nearly 2,400 products carrying the ingredient were on the market as of April, including well-known brands like Coppertone, Banana Boat and Neutrogena, Downs and his group said in their letter to the FDA.

The discovery of the risks of the ingredient also comes after another black mark for the sunscreen industry.

Last month, Johnson & Johnson recalled five of its Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens after the company found low levels of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, in some samples.

The concerns over the chemical were flagged in May by an independent lab, but the company, and others that were named in the independent report, took months to act.

J&J is now the target of a class-action lawsuit seeking damages over the matter.

In the latest development, Downs and his team of researchers cited data that suggested octocrylene stayed in the human body at concerning levels and could still be detected in blood for up to 10 days.

An industry trade group has called the research misleading, but Downs said a rebuttal to the industry’s defense will be published in the scientific journal Chemical Research in Toxicology on Wednesday.

The rebuttal will compare the defense tactics of the sunscreen industry to that of Big Tobacco as they defended the merits of smoking.

Courtney Rhodes, a spokeswoman for the FDA, told Bloomberg that the agency “takes seriously any safety concerns raised about products we regulate, including sunscreen,” adding that it “will continue to monitor the sunscreen marketplace to help ensure the availability of safe sunscreens for U.S. consumers” while it looks into the concerns raised by the researchers.

Imitation isn’t always the sincerest form of flattery — at least when it comes to the morning TV wars.

After news broke on Wednesday that “CBS This Morning” was replacing veteran journalist Anthony Mason with former football star and “Extra” correspondent Nate Burleson, several industry insiders told us the network is admitting they’re in trouble by copying rival “Good Morning America.”

And it doesn’t help that the CBS show also announced in May it’ll be filming from a new studio directly across the street from “GMA” in Times Square.

”They’re basically copying ‘GMA.’ They’re moving to Times Square, hiring a [Michael] Strahan. What’s next? Cooking segments? They’re clearly in trouble,” one industry source sniped.

Meanwhile, another source told us that “GMA” staffers are “all shook over why CBS is copying them. It’s all the talk this morning at ABC,” they said.

The move comes as ratings for NBC’s “Today” — once the top of the morning show heap — continue to lose ground to “GMA.” This season-to-date, “GMA” is reportedly the most-watched morning show for the 9th consecutive year, and has this year increased its lead over “Today” to its biggest in four years. (Though “Today” did add viewers during its Olympics broadcasts.)

“CBS This Morning” remains at the bottom.

An ABC insider admitted there was buzz around the news, but “‘shook’ is not the way to describe it,” the source said. “Look at the numbers. Do you think ‘GMA’ would be threatened by CBS?”

CBS’ Strahan-like hire is “taking a page from the playbook. It’s an interesting move for them,” they added.

Another person from a competing network scoffed, “This is the same show [that] put out a statement about not wanting to [have anchors] dress up for Halloween! They planted a stake on Halloween as opposed to having fun, and now a football player is at the table? ‘Real Sports’ wasn’t hiring? It’s insulting to journalists.”

Burleson’s hire comes after former president of ABC-owned television stations Wendy McMahon fled the network to become president and co-head of CBS News and TV stations earlier this year.

“It’s interesting that they’ve put an ABC person in place over there, and she’s running the show. I commend them for recognizing a winning playbook and stealing it, but it could be a recipe for disaster,” the ABC source said.

Another source familiar with Burleson’s hire told us “they were grooming him” to take over after he filled in while co-anchor Tony Dokoupil was away on paternity leave. “Hollywood and this business only find value in former NFL players right now. It’s the Strahan effect. It’s not even a subtle trend,” they said.

In addition to co-anchoring “CBS This Morning,” Burleson’s overall deal will include a role as an analyst at CBS Sports’ “The NFL Today” and regular appearances on Nickelodeon, according to Variety. He’ll join Gayle King and Dokoupil at the table in September.

Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations, described Burleson as the “perfect fit for mornings on CBS” in a press release.

“There is no doubt that Nate’s experiences and broader interests in news, sports and entertainment will be an exciting addition to the table with Gayle and Tony as we continue to evolve the format of the broadcast to double down on news, original reporting, great storytelling and a broad range of feature pieces that appeal to viewers across the country,” he said in an internal memo.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The second payment of the 2021 advance child tax credit hit bank accounts Friday.



The Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service said that more than $15.4 billion was paid out in this round.

It’s the second of six payments to go out every month for the remainder of the year as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which increased this year’s child tax credit from a maximum of $2,000 per child to up to $3,600 per child younger than 6.

For children between the ages of 6 and 17, the maximum is $3,000 per child for 2021.

That means monthly payments will total $300 per child under 6 and $250 for older children.

The Internal Revenue Service sent out the first payment on July 15 to an estimated 35 million families.

More than 36 million people received payments on Friday, with the payments covering an additional 1.6 million more people in the second round than did in the first, according to data from the feds.

In New York, more than 2,000 families got payments, covering almost 3,300 kids. The average payout in the state was $412.

The first half of the credit will be doled out each month through the end of the year. Six more monthly payments for the credit will start going out after eligible families file their 2021 income tax returns.

Six more monthly payments for the 2021 credit will start going out after eligible families file their 2021 income tax returns.

The credit is available for couples who earn $150,000 or less a year, heads of households who earn $112,500 or less and individuals who earn $75,000 or less.

The Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, which collected data before and after the first payment in July, found that it coincided with a significant drop in the percent of families with children reporting food insufficiency and trouble paying household expenses.

There was no similar drop reported in adult households without children.

The share of families with kids that earn less than $50,000 and didn’t have enough to eat fell drastically after the July payments went out, from 26 percent to 18.5 percent.

“This tax relief is having a real impact on the lives of America’s children,” the Treasury Department and the IRS said Friday in a joint announcement.

The “vast majority” of recipients this month got the payment through direct deposit, the feds said.

“Due to a technical issue expected to be resolved by the September payments, a small percentage of recipients — less than 15 percent — who received payments by direct deposit in July will be mailed paper checks for the August payment,” they added.

Recipients can check the status of the monthly payment at the IRS’ Child Tax Credit Update Portal.

If the portal says a payment is pending, it means the IRS is still reviewing your account to determine your eligibility.

President Biden and a handful of Democratic lawmakers have said they hope to continue the boosted payments next year, but there aren’t any plans to extend the program as of now.

To be sure, the payments haven’t been without controversy.

Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who helped draft President Bill Clinton’s 1996 welfare reform plan, said Biden’s plan “turns welfare reform on its head.”

“[P]art of the philosophy of welfare reform that we said we don’t want to pay people not to work, we want to incentivize work and we want to require work.

“What this very explicitly does is it turns welfare reform on its head” by removing the work requirement, he previously said.

The administration is “going back on the principle for the first time in 25 years of giving large cash grants, primarily to single mothers who do not work at all during the year,” Rector said.

He went on to say that Clinton was elected on “ending welfare as we know it, but this recreates welfare as we know it.”

“In fact, the value of this, which is for a mother with two kids who doesn’t work, is $6,000 to $7,000 per year,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Virgin Galactic founder Sir Richard Branson sold almost $300 million worth of his shares in the space tourism company this week as he continued to shave his stake in the company to fund his other ventures that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

Branson, through his Virgin Investments firm, dumped more than 10.4 million shares in Virgin Galactic — about 4 percent of the company — over three days this week for total proceeds of just under $300 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Shares of Virgin Galactic were last seen trading about 2 percent lower on the news of the sale.

It’s the third time Branson has sold shares in Virgin Galactic since it went public through a merger with a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, in 2019.

He sold nearly half a billion dollars worth of shares in the company in May of last year as the pandemic hammered his other ventures, which include a cruise line, airline and hotels.

Branson then sold an additional $150 million worth of Virgin Galactic stock in April.

The latest share sale comes just one month after Branson became the first billionaire to fly to space, beating world’s richest man Jeff Bezos by a week, in a space race that boosted shares of his space company.

Branson’s Virgin Investments is still one of the biggest shareholders of the space tourism company with a stake of about 18 percent, or 46.3 million shares worth roughly $1.2 billion as of the stock’s last closing price.

A representative for Virgin Group said in a statement that Branson’s parent company “intends to use the net proceeds from this sale to support its portfolio of global leisure, holiday and travel businesses that continue to be affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to supporting the development and growth of new and existing businesses.

“The Virgin Group continues to be the largest single shareholder in Virgin Galactic,” the statement added.

Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya sold his entire personal stake in the company for about $213 million in March.

Known for its eco-friendly and baby products, Honest Co. said sales of its diapers and wipes decreased by 2 percent to $47 million in the second quarter ended June 30 compared with a 19 percent increase a year ago.

Sales of its household and wellness products also declined by six percent to $2.9 million.

The stock recently traded down more than 26 percent to about $10 a share, or less than half of what the stock was worth when the “Dark Angel” actress took the 10-year-old company public in May at $21.22 a share.

Honest Co. is just the latest household goods business to report sales declines compared to 2020 when consumers were stockpiling goods in preparation for global coronavirus lockdowns.

“Household and Wellness sales have been softer than expected as consumer demand has decreased as more consumers have become vaccinated and retailers continue to manage heavy inventories of sanitization and disinfecting products in stores,” the company said in a statement.

The brief ruling from Charles Bullock, the chief administrative law judge of the U.S. International Trade Commission, did not explain why Google’s sale of the products violated a 1930 federal tariff law, commonly known as Smoot-Hawley, designed to prevent unfair competition.

Sonos has been trying to block Google from importing Home smart speakers, Pixel phones and other products from China.

Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sonos said it was pleased with the preliminary ruling, which it said “confirmed Google’s blatant infringement” and furthered its efforts to defend its technology against alleged misappropriation by larger rivals.

Friday’s ruling is subject to review by the full ITC, scheduled for Dec. 13 according to the commission’s website.

The ITC case is part of an array of litigation between the two companies, including cases in California, Texas, France, Germany and the Netherlands, according to regulatory filings.

Google has said Sonos repeatedly sought help during their years of partnership, and it eventually integrated Sonos products into its Play Music service and Google Assistant software.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Looks like Steve Cohen can add a $21.6 million ultra-luxurious Florida estate to his expanding portfolio.

The New York Mets owner now has a warm place to escape to as winter approaches up north in the coming months. On Aug. 9, the hedge funder and 97.2% team owner closed on the sale of a 31,000-square-foot mansion located in an unincorporated area of Palm Beach County near Boca Raton and west of Delray Beach.

The move comes nearly three years after he sold his last Florida property in 2017 for $6.4 million, property records show — a relatively modest home compared to his newly purchased Palm Beach abode.

Background on the buyer: In 2012, Cohen was initially a minor owner of the Mets with an 8% stake. But last year, in an agreement with fellow MLB owners and several negotiations, Cohen won majority control of the team, beating out bids from the likes of Alex Rodriguez, who was reportedly angry at losing out on the deal.

The former Yankee blamed J.P. Morgan and loudly griped that the process had been rigged.

“I don’t think it ended well with JPM,” one source previously told The Post, noting that J.P. Morgan “did everything for A-Rod in the Mets deal,” and that the bank didn’t appreciate being blamed for losing the MLB team to Cohen.

In January, Cohen found himself involved in the infamous GameStop controversy.

Point72, his $22 billion hedge fund, saw significant losses due to its investment in Melvin Capital. Melvin was nearly wiped out when it placed a large bet against the video game retailer after amateur traders on the WallStreetBets subreddit recognized that — because hedge funds like Melvin had so heavily “shorted” GameStop and other stocks — they were vulnerable to any kind of run on the stock.

After receiving backlash on social media from the fallout, Cohen temporarily deactivated his social media accounts — but it appears the GameStop frenzy was short-lived, and Cohen bounced back fairly quickly. And what better way to rebound than with a mega-mansion in the Sunshine State?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It was the best of times, it was the worst of times for zero-emission truck maker Nikola.

The company on Thursday said it has been awarded a $2 million grant by the Department of Energy — just weeks after Nikola founder Trevor Milton was criminally charged by for lying to investors about “nearly all aspects of the business.”

Milton stepped back from the company in September after a damning report from short-selling activist firm Hindenburg Research accusing Milton of deceiving investors with a video that made it look like one of Nikola’s trucks was driving when in fact the vehicle was simply rolling down a hill.

Nikola says Milton, who was criminally charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors on July 29. is no longer involved with the company. He still holds roughly 16 percent of the shares outstanding, however.

Nikola’s founder Trevor Milton is facing multiple criminal charges of fraud. AP

Nikola has not been charged, but has been subpoenaed by the SEC and the Department of Justice. It is also dealing with multiple shareholder lawsuits.

The grant comes as the Biden Administration looks to ramp up investment in clean energy. And Nikola — while it has yet to actually create any trucks since its founding in 2014 — has said it aims to manufacture up to 50 electric trucks by the end of the year.

Initially the company predicted it would create up to 100 trucks, but back-pedaled earlier this month, saying it does not have the necessary parts to create that many trucks.

The company has previously received a $1.7 million grant from the Energy Department. The most recent funding will be used for “research into autonomous refueling technologies for future hydrogen fueling station,” the company said.

“This funding is essential to advance key hydrogen fueling technologies that can improve the overall efficiency of fuel-cell commercial vehicles, while maintaining the safety and reliability standards required,” Nikola President Pablo Koziner said in a statement.

Nikola was awarded the grant on July 7th but waited to announce the news until Friday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The hackers who pulled off the largest cryptocurrency heist in history “for fun” have returned the money — and the company that they stole from wants to pay them for their service.

The decentralized finance platform that was hacked, called Poly Network, confirmed late Thursday that the hackers had returned all of the roughly $610 million worth of stolen Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, with the exception of $33 million worth of the “stablecoin” Tether that had been frozen by its creator.

Poly Network also offered the hackers a reward of $500,000 — or less than one percent of the stolen crypto — for exposing flaws in the platform’s security.

Earlier this week, the hackers stole the $610 million in crypto, then began gradually returning the money in installments.

In a blockchain-based question-and-answer session Thursday, the hackers explained in broken English that they had pulled off the heist “for fun” rather than profit.

“Ask yourself what to do had you facing so much fortune,” the hacker said. “Asking the project team politely so that they can fix it? Anyone could be the traitor given one billion!”

Some blockchain experts are skeptical of the Poly Network hackers’ claims to be “white hats” who expose vulnerabilities for the greater good. REUTERS

Asked about returning the money, the hacker said that was “always the plan.”

“I am _not_ very interested in money!” the hacker wrote. “I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn’t they learn something from those hacks?”

However, some blockchain experts have been skeptical of the hackers’ claims to be “white hats” who expose vulnerabilities for the greater good.

Hackers stole $610 million in crypto before returning it, but experts say they would have had a hard time converting the ill-gotten gains into usable cash in any case. REUTERS

Critics question whether the hackers returned the crytpo because they risk getting arrested if they turned the money into usable cash.

“Even if you can steal cryptoassets, laundering them and cashing out is extremely difficult, due to the transparency of the blockchain and the broad use of blockchain analytics by financial institutions,” Tom Robinson of UK blockchain analysis company Elliptic told Reuters.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Apple and Google’s lucrative app stores are under threat from bipartisan legislation introduced in Congress this week.

A bill introduced in the House on Friday would bar Apple and Google from blocking users from downloading apps from third-party app stores.

The bill, a companion to a Senate bill introduced earlier this week, would also stop the tech giants from requiring app developers to use Apple or Google’s payment systems — a major point of contention behind an ongoing legal battle between Fortnite developer Epic Games and Apple.

In the lawsuit, which has yet to be decided, Epic blasted the 30 percent commissions Apple charges larger developers, saying were only possible because the iPhone maker maintained an unlawful monopoly.

Apple has admitted it made “at least” $100 million from commissions on the popular Fortnite video game alone — and raked in $22 billion in overall App Store commissions last year.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have also slammed Apple’s App Store practices.

“Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right,” said a typically blunt Musk in reference to Fortnite developer’s lawsuit.

Google, unlike Apple, lets users download apps from outside app stores. However, developers who use the Google’s Play Store are required to use the company’s payments processor, which also charges fees of up to 30 percent.

Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado — who introduced the House bill alongside Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia — slammed both companies’ app store policies as squashing competition and hurting developers.

“For far too long, companies like Google and Apple have had a stranglehold on app developers who are forced to take whatever terms these monopolists set in order to reach their customers,” said Buck.

Buck and Johnson’s House bill follows the Senate bill introduced earlier this week by Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.

That bill would also allow developers to use third-party app stores and bar big app stores from requiring use of their payment systems.

Google and Apple did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Apple has previously defended its restrictive app store as “an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation” and claimed the store “supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states.”

“I found this predatory abuse of Apple and Google so deeply offensive on so many levels,” Blumenthal said earlier this week. “Their power has reached a point where they are impacting the whole economy in stifling and strangling innovation.”

In addition to the congressional bills, Google is fighting a lawsuit from a group of state attorneys general who also argue that the company’s sky-high app store fees constitute an unlawful monopoly.

The posts are increasingly in sectors, including software, marketing, sales and accounting, that have never before required vaccinations, according to job search company, Indeed.com.

As of Aug. 7, the number of job postings mandating vaccinations grew by 90 percent compared to a month ago.

“Employers are well aware that COVID-19, the fear of it and restrictions against it, dampen economic activity and some are not only encouraging vaccination among employees, but are now requiring it,” Indeed.com economist AnnElizabeth Konkel wrote in an Aug. 12 report.

The share of posts requiring a shot is small compared to the overall number of listings, but Konkel believes vaccination requirements in job postings “may rapidly change in coming months.”

Some postings simply state “vaccine required,” while others give more specific details or offer alternatives, such as frequent testing and mask-wearing.

Konkel told the Wall Street Journal there is no evidence that job searchers are looking for positions that either require or don’t require vaccinations. Some of the posts tout the vaccination status of existing staff or offer a bonus to workers willing to be vaccinated, according to the WSJ.

About 30 percent of adults in the US have not received a COVID-19 vaccine, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Taliban’s aggressive expansion across Afghanistan following the US withdrawal from the country could fuel a surge in the export of heroin and other drugs — including methamphetamine — as the radical Islamic militants seize critical international trade routes.

Opium poppy, which grows wildly in the Afghan countryside, is the country’s biggest cash crop, with an export value of somewhere between $1.5 billion and $3 billion per year, according to a report from the US Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

While the Taliban has decried the use and production of opium, most of the poppy-growing farmland over the past couple of decades has been under Taliban control, and the crop “continues to represent the most significant source of income for the Taliban,” according to a recent UNODC report.

Now, as US forces withdraw and the Taliban quickly captures major cities that provide access to critical international trade routes, the Taliban could massively expand the production and export of heroin and other drugs, Michael Kugelman, a South Asia scholar at the Wilson Center, told The Post.

“Drugs are a big part of the Taliban’s finances and indeed we’ve seen them be able to seize a number of border posts,” he said. “If you control the borders, it’s going to be easier to facilitate the flow of drugs.”

Kugelman added that most of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries are already in “some degree of a heroin crisis.” There will surely be “spillover effects” of the insurgency in Afghanistan across Central, South and East Asia, he noted.

It’s harder, he added, to predict the impact on the global export of drugs like heroin, but as the Taliban finds itself governing more of the country, it will likely turn to the drug trade to secure more financing.

“If you’re going to be in a position where you’re leading the government to an extent then you’re going to need even more finances, so I could envision in that context the Taliban trying to ramp up production, supply and even more to fund itself,” Kugelman said.

The Taliban have captured cities in recent weeks that give them unfettered access to neighbors Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Pakistan. FDD

“This is something that the Taliban’s perfectly comfortable doing.”

The Taliban now control some ten international crossing points, Jonathan Goodhand, a professor in conflict and development studies at the SOAS University of London, wrote in a piece for The Conversation, including Zaranj, which is near the border with Iran and has a history as a hub for the smuggling of fuel, drugs and people.

Other cities that the Taliban has captured in recent weeks have given it unfettered access to neighbors Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Pakistan, where goods can then be moved onward to Europe, Asia, Australia and elsewhere.The ongoing conflict and the Taliban’s need for continued funding will “unfortunately drive the global heroin market, as well as feeding the growing drug problem within Afghanistan and neighboring countries,” Goodhand concluded.

Also troubling Afghanistan analysts, the Taliban is reportedly diversifying into the cultivation of ephedra, another plant that grows wild across the country and is used to make methamphetamine.Foreign Policy reported last month that meth is much cheaper to produce than heroin and Taliban traffickers are now trying to ramp up the export of meth through its established heroin smuggling routes.

The Taliban’s capture of major cities that serve as trade hubs will only embolden the military group to export more illicit products, including heroin and drugs, the report said.

“Obviously, Afghanistan being a landlocked country, the ones who dominate these border passes have more effective control of international trade and taxation, and of course a way to neutralize the authorities and allow further exports of illicit products like drugs, and also incoming controlled substances like chemical precursors” used for refining drugs, said Cesar Guedes-Ferreyros, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s representative in Kabul, according to Foreign Policy. At least 85 percent of the world’s heroin is sourced from Afghanistan, he added.

And already in 2020, the number of drug seizures carried out by Afghan law enforcement had fallen by more than 50 percent compared with the prior year, according to a recent UNODC report.

At the same time, another UNODC report says, the share of Afghan land being used to grow poppy spiked 37 percent in 2020.“Afghan authorities have attributed this at least in part to the gradual expansion of Taliban-controlled territory in the country, particularly in key border provinces where transhipments occur,” the report reads.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul is set to host an in-person fundraising event next week in her hometown, Buffalo, as she prepares to take over as governor and eyes a 2022 bid to hold on to her new job.

The event is scheduled for Wednesday and will also be an early celebration of her 63rd birthday, CNBC reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Top tickets are expected to sell for between $2,500 and $5,000, the report said, and there will likely be a separate grassroots donor event on the same day.

It’s possible the fundraiser, which was set up before Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation earlier this week, could be postponed until after Hochul has settled into her new role, CNBC noted.

New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will host a fundraiser in her hometown, Buffalo, that was prepared before Cuomo’s resignation. AP

Interest in attending the fundraiser has swelled in recent days as Cuomo was consumed by a sexual harassment probe that culminated in his resignation, the report added.

The event was initially going to take place on Hochul’s own property in Buffalo, but had to be moved to a larger space to accommodate the outsize crowd seeking to secure influence in the incoming Hochul administration.

Many of those expected to attend the event are Hochul loyalists, CNBC reported.

“These are people that have been with her since the town board. They have been her supporters and friends for a long time,” a person with direct knowledge of the gathering told the outlet.

The event could be key to setting the fundraising tone for Hochul as she prepares to take on potential challengers in the 2022 gubernatorial race.

A representative for Hochul did not return The Post’s request for comment on the reported gathering.

Meanwhile, outgoing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has not ruled out a 2022 run for the state’s top job and Attorney General Letitia James, whose investigation into sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo led to his resignation, is also seen as a contender for the job.

On Tuesday, James is slated to hold her own fundraiser in Martha’s Vineyard that will be headlined by Spike Lee.



The invitation to the event says the fundraiser at the Academy Award winner’s residence is to “support the re-election” of James as attorney general, despite the speculation around her potential gubernatorial run.



The campaign event has an Olympics theme. Someone who donates or raises $20,000 is honored as a “gold host.” A contributor who donates or raises $10,000 is a silver host and a $5,000 contributor is a bronze host.

Following Andrew Cuomo’s resignation, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will plan her fundraiser in Buffalo, as she prepares for her 2022 run as governor of New York. AP

James also held a fundraiser in Southampton last Saturday.

A source close to James said the Martha’s Vineyard fundraiser was planned well before the release of the Cuomo report. She’s held fundraisers there in the past.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In my favorite episode of “South Park,” two sleazy salesmen sell shoddy condos in the glitzy ski town of “Asspen” to the lower middle-class residents of South Park. Their pitch is intoxicatingly simple: “Try saying it. ‘I’ve got a nice little place in Asspen.’ Rolls off the tongue nicely doesn’t it?” Eventually, the residents open up their checkbooks and buy the scam.

This is exactly what happened when recruiters from Goldman Sachs showed up at Harvard in 2006. As a 20-year-old, I fell for the trick: I joined Goldman that summer as an intern. By July, I had learned many of the firm’s unspoken traditions, like how, instead of wearing Rolexes, the managing directors sported cheap digital watches with black rubber wrist straps, prominently juxtaposed against their expensive tailor-made dress shirts.

The hallmark event at Goldman that summer wasn’t a poker tournament on a lavish boat cruise followed by a debauched night of clubbing, as it had been at Amaranth, the more edgy firm where I’d worked the prior year. Rather, it was “service day” — a day that involved dressing up in a T-shirt and shorts, and then serving the community. Back in 2006, that involved planting trees in a garden in Harlem. The co-head of my group was supposed to lead the way.

When we showed up at the park in Harlem, very few of my colleagues seemed interested in . . . well, planting trees. The full-time analysts shared office gossip with the interns. The vice presidents one-upped each other with war stories about investment deals. And the head of the group was nowhere to be found.

After an hour I noticed that very little service had actually been performed. As if on cue, the co-head of the group showed up an hour late —wearing a slim-fit suit and a pair of Gucci boots . . . and, of course, a cheap digital watch. The chatter amongst the rest of the team died down, as we awaited what he had to say.

Vivek Ramaswamy was attending Harvard when he was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 2006.

“All right, guys,” he said somberly, as though he were going to discipline the team. A moment of tension hung in the air. And then he broke the ice: “Let’s take some pictures and get out of here!” The entire group burst into laughter. Within minutes we had vacated the premises. No trees had been planted. Soon the entire group was seated comfortably at a nearby bar — pitchers of beer ready on the tables and all.

I turned to one of the younger associates sitting next to me. I quipped that if we wanted to have a “social day,” then we should’ve just called it that instead of “service day.”

He laughed and demurred: “Look, just do what the boss says.” Then he quipped back: “You ever heard of the Golden Rule?”

“Treat others like you want to be treated?” I asked.

“Wrong,” he said. “He who has the gold makes the rules.”

They want to make sure any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board, but are okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s private jet. A critic blasting Goldman Sachs’ double standards, quoted in “Woke, Inc.”

I called it “the Goldman Rule.” I learned something valuable that summer after all.

Over a decade later, the Goldman Rule had only grown in importance. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last year, Goldman CEO David Solomon declared that it would refuse to take companies public unless they had at least one “diverse” member on their board.

Put the “diversity” debate to one side: The bigger problem is that Goldman’s edict wasn’t about diversity at all. It was about corporate opportunism: seizing an already popular social value and prominently emblazoning it with the Goldman Sachs logo. It was like planting trees in Harlem all over again.

The timing of Goldman’s announcement was revealing. In the prior year, approximately half the open board seats at S&P 500 companies went to women. In July 2019, the last remaining all-male board in the S&P 500 appointed a woman. In other words, every single company in the S&P 500 was already abiding by Goldman’s diversity standard long before Goldman issued its own proclamation. Goldman’s announcement was an ideal way to attract praise without taking any real risk: another great risk-adjusted return for Goldman Sachs.

Goldman’s timing was also impeccable in another way. Its diversity quota proclamation stole the headlines from a much less flattering event: Goldman had just agreed to pay $5 billion in fines to governments around the world for its role in a scheme stealing billions from the Malaysian people. Goldman reportedly turned a willfully blind eye as corrupt Malaysian officials immediately turned the fund into their own private piggy bank. Ironically, some of that money literally ended up funding Martin Scorsese’s 2013 movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

As one Redditor on the now-infamous forum WallStreetBets observed, “They want to make sure that any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board of the company they are IPOing, but are perfectly okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s jewelry collection and private jet.” Well, yes. Welcome to the woke-industrial complex.

Woke capitalism is really just crony capitalism 2.0. Here’s how it works: Big business uses progressive-friendly values to deflect attention from their own monolithic pursuit of profit and power.

Crony capitalism 1.0 was simple by comparison: Banks simply had to make campaign contributions and hire lobbyists. In return, they get favorable regulations that codify their status as gatekeepers who enjoy oligopoly status in taking companies public. Championship-level players of this game like Goldman Sachs often top it off with a flourish, by lending their executives to serve as US treasury secretaries — Steve Mnuchin under President Donald Trump, Hank Paulson under President George W. Bush, and so on. And it pays off in the end: Winners like Goldman Sachs get bailouts in tough times like 2008, while less adroit competitors like Lehman Brothers get hung out to dry by the likes of Hank Paulson. That much is straightforward.

Woke, Inc will be published on Tuesday.

But crony capitalism 2.0 is far trickier. Goldman’s diversity edict at Davos last year came at a time when Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of the biggest critics of the US government’s 2008 bailout of Goldman Sachs, were presidential front-runners. Having supplicated to business-friendly Republicans and centrist Democrats for decades, the moment had arrived for Goldman Sachs to begin placating the identity-politics-obsessed Far Left, just as that wing of the Democratic Party had begun to accrue greater political power. Their new CEO is woker than woke, and he’s a DJ on the side too. That’s how the 2020 edition of crony capitalism looks: Hank Paulson is outmoded by comparison.

Once the American public becomes “woke” to this new trend of self-interest masquerading as morality, our citizenry can see through the charade of corporate virtue-signaling. When Amazon issues a public challenge to Walmart to pay workers $15 per hour, we can simply chuckle to ourselves that Jeff Bezos is just doing what he does best: undermining his competitors when they’re most vulnerable.

Most importantly, we can return the power to implement our social values back to American democracy where it belongs, rather than to corporate chieftains who use it to make an extra buck. As a society we should allow and even embrace the corporate pursuit of financial self-interest above all. The only thing we should ask in return is this: Keep it naked, instead of dressing it up as altruism. America might just be better off in the end if Goldman Sachs executives wear their Rolexes to work, instead of preaching about diversity and pretending to plant trees.

His cache of curios includes branded tote bags, polo shirts, ball caps and assorted tchotchkes, with some mementos fetching more than $100 apiece.

The hawker, who would only identify himself as Ricardo, told The Post he had the “opportunity” to load up directly from Lehman’s stash of promotional gimcracks soon after the firm’s ignominious collapse in 2008.

“I bought it all on a hunch thinking people would want a piece of history. Well, it worked out,” he said.

Got $155 to spare? A crystal sphere paperweight emblazoned with the Lehman name can be yours. Or maybe you’re in need of a Lehman’s weekender tote with a floral print for $255.

The cheapest item is a $14 set of Lehman Bros. gift bags, which Ricardo touts online as “an instant conversational piece of history.”

“Everything I sell is authentic,” he said. “I own the last of it.”

This bag is one of roughly 30 Lehman-branded products for sale. Ebay

Using the eBay handle rmp8907, Ricardo has listed 35 items for sale, though a few are not branded with the Lehman name. He’s been active on the site since 2002.

The peddler, who claimed he was retired, wouldn’t reveal what he did for a living or how much he’s made from his online offerings.

“Let’s say I made my investment back — and then some.”

Global law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo is moving its Manhattan headquarters to SL Green’s 919 Third Ave. The deal for 101,394 square feet is one of the city’s largest this year.

The 20-year commitment includes floors 37-39 and part of the concourse at the 47-story tower at East 55th Street, which is also home to Bloomberg and Schulte Roth. Iconic burger joint PJ Clarke’s is joined to the tower at the hip.

Although its new digs will be about the same size as Mintz, Levin currently has at 666 Third Ave., improved floor design will enable the firm to add “significantly more attorneys,” according to SL Green executive vice-president Steven Durels. The asking rent was $80 per square foot.

Durels called the lease “further confirmation of an improving market as tenants increasingly make long-term commitments in preparation for a return to office.”

Stephen J. Gulotta Jr., managing member of Mintz’s New York office, said the firm “is coming off six consecutive years of record revenues and profits. We are growing rapidly and we believe 919 Third is the perfect location for us to continue that growth.”

Mintz, Levin’s is the latest in a succession of counter-intuitively large office deals that have been completed this year despite howling, near-20 percent Manhattan availability — perhaps the worst ever.

The commitments are all the more remarkable for including tenants of many kinds at addresses from the Battery to within a few blocks of Central Park.

Downtown, law firm Fried, Frank renewed on 400,000 square feet at One New York Plaza overlooking the harbor. On the far West Side, Coinbase set up its first New York office at 55 Hudson Yards.

In Midtown South, spirits-maker Beam Suntory moved its headquarters from Chicago to nearly 100,000 square feet at landmarked 11 Madison Ave.

And in Midtown’s heart, pharmaceutical firm Schrodinger’s took 109,000 square feet at 1540 Broadway, Empire Health grabbed 70,000 square feet at 1 Penn, and private equity firm Hellman & Friedman signed at 425 Park Ave., the first new lease there in two years.

Meanwhile, as we reported last week, Chubb Group is in advanced talks for a quarter-million square feet at 550 Madison Ave. A deal could be finalized soon and several other leases are said to be in the works at the former Sony headquarters.

Newmark’s Moshe Sukenik, Eric Zemachson and Jason Perla represented Mintz at 919 Third Ave. SL Green was represented in-house.

Jewish community day-school Shefa is expanding and moving to the West Side, thanks to some interesting circumstances on West 60th Street.



Shefa, Hebrew for “abundance,” just purchased a 99-year ground lease for 75,000 square feet on the entire, long-vacant 11-story property from Extell. The institution for educationally challenged pupils in grades 1-8 will make 17 W. 60th St. its new home, growing from just 25,000 square feet at 40 E. 29th St.

Although terms were not released, city Finance Department records show the price as $49.5 million.

“This transaction enables Shefa School to pursue its mission in an ideal location steps from Central Park and the Columbus Circle transit hub,” said Ilana Ruskay-Kidd, the founder and head of school. “It will facilitate our effort to support our students’ strengths while helping them to overcome their challenges.”

Shefa was represented by a JLL team headed by Mitchell Konsker and Matthew Astrachan. Extell acted in-house.

But the move was only made possible when Extell abandoned a plan to raze 17 W. 60th for a new project that would include the home of the New York Institute of Technology at 1855 Broadway next door.

Extell signed a contract to buy 1885 Broadway for $90 million 2019, but NYIT — which had planned on moving to Queens — changed its mind. Extell sued and the case is now in court.

With a much smaller footprint on which to build, Extell decided to sell the 17 W. 60th leasehold to Shefa. The school is paying to build out the gutted building with the help of $60 million in mostly tax-exempt bonds through the city’s BuildNYC program to aid nonprofit institutions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What’s Thanksgiving without a juicy, fresh turkey? More Americans may soon find out.

Meat producers and distributors are sounding the alarm over a turkey shortage that has supermarkets and other food retailers scrambling to get ready for the holiday, The Post has learned.

The shortfall is expected to mainly affect fresh turkeys and birds under 16 pounds, which tend to be the most popular, sources said.

Extra large, frozen birds will be easier to find, sources explained. But they’re labor intensive for cooks, and therefore less desirable. To properly defrost a 20 pound bird, for example, can take up to six days.

“The news is not promising,” a broker for Shady Brook Farms, one of the nation’s largest turkey suppliers, warned in a July 26 letter about the “status of fresh, whole turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas.”

“The industry continues to struggle with production issues,” said the letter to retailers and distributors, according to a food seller who received it.

Indeed, turkey farmers have been struggling from waning production for years due to slowing demand, experts say. And their woes were only exacerbated by the pandemic, which simultaneously reduced labor and increased costs.

“Turkey is such a seasonal item, dominated by the Thanksgiving market,” explained David Anderson, a professor of agriculture economics at Texas A & M University. “We can build up supplies with frozen turkeys for the Thanksgiving market, but fresh turkeys have a tighter schedule. The eggs have to hatch at a certain time.”

As many turkey producers were trying to decide how many birds to hatch for this year’s holiday season, corn prices began ticking up, forcing many farmers to pull back on their supply for fear that the investment would not pay off, experts said.

Now, just three months before a holiday centered on a roast turkey dinner, supermarkets are seeing their turkey orders slashed by as much as 50 percent.

“Shady Brook told us they could only give us 50 percent of the turkeys we need and want for the holidays,” Stew Leonard, who owns the eponymous grocery chain, told The Post.

The Morton Williams grocery chain was recently informed by its vendors that it won’t get any birds weighing less than 16 pounds. The most popular turkey is 14 pounds.

Fresh birds will be “sporadically” available, according to Morton Williams’ meat buyer, Victor Colello.

“You can get whatever you want if it’s a 20-pound turkey,” Colello said, who is predicting some unhappy customers.

“I’m frustrated that we won’t get the most popular size bird. It’s just another hurdle we have to jump over. I’ll probably have to break down some of the larger turkeys, to give people the parts they want,” he said.

A spokesman for Cargill, which owns Shady Brook Farms, acknowledged the shortage, saying it is the result of “continuing to manage tight labor markets while working to keep employees safe from the impacts of COVID-19 in the communities where they operate.”

“It is important to note,” the company added, “that the overall frozen bird production remains the same compared to previous years though average bird weights are slightly higher for both fresh and frozen birds due processing delays.”

Larger turkeys are more readily available because the birds have been growing faster than the producers can process them, explained to Daniel Romanoff, president of Bronx-based meat distributor Nebraskaland.

“It’s a very precise schedule to get the turkey to the size of 14 pounds or less,” Romanoff said. “And the plants weren’t able to keep up with that size.”

The shortage has some retailers turning to smaller turkey producers, like Jaindl Farms of Allentown, Pa.

“Our customers are having trouble getting their Thanksgiving commitments from their vendors and are coming to us,” said owner David Jaindl, who says he’s been fielding calls from frantic customers over the past couple of months.

Stew Leonard’s, for example, was able to make up for its smaller Shady Brook shipment this year by turning to Jaindl, whose all natural turkeys are generally more expensive than the mass-produced turkeys by Cargill-owned Shady Brook and other large companies.

Jaindl’s farm controls all aspects of the process from growing the corn used to feed the turkeys to processing them, which has allowed him to manage his costs better and to actually increase his supply of turkeys this year, he told The Post.

“The biggest cost of growing a turkey is feeding it,” Jaindl said, “And I think the cost of corn discouraged the big companies from hatching turkeys.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Method Man is bringing his love of weed to New York’s cannabis market.

The Staten Island-based Wu-Tang Clan veteran rapper — whose lyrics often include riffs on pot — is naming his cannabis brand after his first solo album TICAL, a k a Taking into Consideration All Lives.

Method Man told The Post that his socially conscious TICAL firm in New York will aim to tackle racial injustice by offering job opportunities to residents in communities disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs.

“I’m absolutely thrilled at the prospect of bringing TICAL to New York’s newly legalized adult-use market in 2022. Our team has worked long and hard to bring the same energy, creativity and equity to this brand that I have to everything I have done throughout my career,” Method Man, whose real name is Clifford Smith Jr., said in a statement.

“I’m particularly excited about TICAL’s focus and leadership in the cannabis space in working with Black, Women and Minority-owned partners from cultivation to dispensaries.

“We are going to lead by example and ensure that this newly created market is as inclusive as possible. We can’t right all the wrongs that disparate criminalization of cannabis has done to our communities, but we most certainly can make a down payment on the way forward with social equity, inclusion and full economic participation.”

TICAL will offer different cannabis strains including FREE M.A.C., Orange Cookie Kush, Sweet Grease, Spazzola, C.R.E.A.M., Gold Tang and Crowd Walker.

TICAL is already marketing its product in Colorado, where the first stores in the world began peddling recreational marijuana legally in 2014.

On TICAL’s Web site, Method Man says smoking reefer is ingrained in the hip-hop culture.

“To all street intellectually inclined cannabis enthusiasts who embody music, art, fashion, sneakers and subculture. We will continue the TICAL legacy by offering premium flower and spreading love throughout the community,” the site says. “We believe it’s important to provide our customers with essential products that offer healing, serenity and peace.”

Still, Albany’s dysfunction over the state’s launch of the local cannabis market has been a buzzkill for many.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the legislature approved a law legalizing marijuana back in March.

But the pot sales program is stuck in the weeds because of a dispute between Cuomo and fellow Democrats in the state Senate over appointments to the Cannabis Control Board and Office of Cannabis Management. Cuomo linked the cannabis appointments to a separate fight with the Senate over his leadership appointments at the MTA.

The governor’s role in the foot-dragging is apparently now moot — he announced he was resigning as governor last week after a devastating probe by state Attorney General Letitia James found he sexually harassed 11 women, including current and former staffers.

It looks like any movement on the state’s new pot-sales law will now be up to Kathy Hochul — New York’s current lieutenant governor who will take the reins of power from Cuomo when he officially steps aside Aug. 24.

State Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island) said she, for one, is thrilled that Method Man is trying to be a cannabis pioneer in New York while vowing to employ local residents from disadvantaged neighborhoods.

“Method Man can serve as a mentor and model for others who want to get into the cannabis business. We need people who are serious players,” Savino said.

She added that she has spoken to Hochul about the importance of breaking the logjam on appointments to the new cannabis regulatory board and agency, so the state can set up rules and approve licenses for the budding industry.

“I talked to Lt. Gov. Hochul about getting the cannabis program up and running. We have to make the appointments necessary to make that happen,” Savino said.

Method Man’s New York cannabis marketing campaign comes as two of his Wu-Tang Clan comrades — Raekow and Ghostface Killah — headline a concert on Staten Island Tuesday to celebrate the city’s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Taco bout the future of fast food!

Taco Bell unveiled renderings of its latest drive-thru concept — which features an elevated kitchen and “gravity-defying” food delivery system.

The high-tech takeout spots will use a “proprietary lift system” to pass food from the 3,000 square-foot kitchen to the four drive-thru lanes sitting below, the California-based chain said in a news release Thursday.

The fast-food joint will break ground on the first of the new restaurants in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota later this month. Its set to be open to the public by next summer.

Three of the lanes will be dedicated to those who order ahead on a mobile app, which the company said will enable customers to start binging on bean burritos faster.

Customers will scan digital screens with a QR code on their phone before pulling up to grab their orders in the sleek sci-fi setting.

The goal of the new Taco Bell Defy concept is to get diners-on-the-go back on the road quickly — and without any interpersonal interaction.

“The design strategically blends technology and design to deliver the convenience of fast, craveable food without many of the challenges of traditional drive-thrus,” said Michael Strommen, CEO of PD Instore, a design company working on the project.
