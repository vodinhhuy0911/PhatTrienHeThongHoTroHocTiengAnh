The Florida governor’s office said it may withhold the salaries of public school officials who institute mask mandates in their districts as new cases and hospitalizations surge in the state.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order banning school districts from establishing mask mandates earlier this month, days after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that students and staff wear masks.

School boards were warned that state funding could be withheld if districts do not comply with the order.

On Monday, the governor’s office released a statement about what those financial repercussions could look like.

The state board of education could “move to withhold the salary of the district superintendent or school board members, as a narrowly tailored means to address the decision-makers who led to the violation of law,” read a statement from the governor’s office, obtained by CBS 4 Miami.

The governor’s office said the decision is to protect “parents’ rights.”

“Education funding is intended to benefit students first and foremost, not systems. The Governor’s priorities are protecting parents’ rights and ensuring that every student has access to a high-quality education that meets their unique needs,” it read.

Miami-Dade Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, who runs the fourth-largest school district in the nation, released a statement in response, according to CBS 4.

“We have established a process that requires consultation with experts in the areas of public health and medicine. We will follow this process, which has served us well, and then make a final decision,” Carvalho said.

“At no point shall I allow my decision to be influenced by a threat to my paycheck; a small price to pay considering the gravity of this issue and the potential impact to the health and well-being of our students and dedicated employees.”

The new explosion of cases has put a strain on the state’s hospitals, including pediatric hospitals that say they are “completely overwhelmed” by the number of new hospitalizations of children.

Florida reported the highest number of child hospitalizations of any state on Sunday with 172, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Florida has set a record for new cases over the past week with nearly 135,000 new infections of the virus, averaging over 19,000 per day. In the week from July 30 to Aug. 5, the Sunshine State has accounted for about 20 percent of all new cases in the country.

According to the Florida DOH, roughly 63 percent of the state has been vaccinated so far.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson admitted Wednesday that he was wrong for previously banning mask mandates in the state.

The governor now wants to amend the law to give schools the option to adopt their own mask requirements.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former New York real estate heir Robert Durst took the stand in his first-degree murder trial Monday and flatly denied murdering his close friend Susan Berman more than two decades ago.

“No,” Durst answered in response to the direct question from defense attorney Dick DeGuerin: “Did you kill Susan Berman?”

When DeGuerin asked his client if he knew who murdered Berman in her Los Angeles home in December 2000, Durst replied “no” once again.

Prosecutors say Durst, now 78, shot Berman execution-style in order to prevent her from incriminating him in the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathie. Durst’s legal team has said that he found Berman’s body, panicked and fled to Texas, sending a letter to police that read “CADAVER” with his friend’s address.

The ailing Durst struggled to hear both the clerk when he was sworn in and DeGuerin as he asked questions, using a tablet that showed a live transcription to help him understand. He also struggled to hear the prosecution’s objections and the judge’s rulings. He frequently spoke after he was told to stop.

Durst and Berman, the daughter of a Las Vegas mobster, met in the late 1960s, when both attended graduate school at UCLA.

“We both had trust funds,” said Durst, who recalled that the two bonded over their wealth and tragedy-hit childhoods. Both of Berman’s parents had died about a decade before she met Durst, while his mother had jumped or fallen from the roof of his family’s Scarsdale home when he was just 7 years old. Durst added that despite the close friendship, he and Berman were never lovers.

Durst, who suffers from bladder cancer and several other ailments that he listed from the stand, wore the brown jail attire he’s had on in court for the past few weeks of the trial. His attorneys said he’s been unable to stand to put on a suit.

Prosecutors rested their case against Durst last week. They had been allowed to present evidence that Durst murdered both his first wife and his Texas neighbor Morris Black in 2001.

Kathie Durst’s body was never found, but she has been declared legally dead. Durst has never been charged in connection with her disappearance, and has denied having anything to do with it.

A Texas jury acquitted Durst of murdering Black in 2003. During that trial, Durst testified that he had killed Black in self-defense after he entered Durst’s home with a gun. Durst described dismembering and disposing of Black’s body on the stand and later pleaded guilty in December 2004 to two counts of bail jumping and one count of evidence tampering. He was released from prison in 2006.

The latest chapter in Durt’s lengthy legal saga began with the 2015 HBO docu-series “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst” — the final scene of which featured Durst saying on a hot mic: “Killed them all, of course.”

Durst was arrested in Berman’s murder in March 2015, the day before the final episode of “The Jinx” aired. A search of his New Orleans hotel room by FBI agents turned up a .38 caliber revolver, a mask, and more than $40,000 in cash. Durst pleaded guilty in April 2016 to being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to 85 months in federal prison.

In 2016, Durst was extradited to California the following year and a Los Angeles judge ruled in 2018 there was enough evidence for Durst to be tried on the first-degree murder charge. However, the trial did not actually begin until March 2020, when it was almost immediately paused until May of this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state’s hospitals Monday to consider postponing all elective surgeries in order to combat a surge in hospitalizations due to COVID-19.

In a letter to the Texas Hospital Association, Abbott asked medical centers to “to take steps to ensure the availability of adequate hospital capacity to care for COVID-19 patients,” in addition to rescheduling elective procedures “for which delay will not result in loss of life or a deterioration in the patient’s condition.”

Abbott also ordered the opening of five new centers to provide antibody treatments for COVID-19 in addition to an existing facility in Lubbock.

The seven-day average of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Texas had reached 8,432 Sunday, up nearly fivefold from the seven-day average of 1,475 at the end of June. In his letter, Abbott warned that more of the Lone Star State’s 22 Trauma Service Areas are approaching “a seven-day period where the number of COVID-19 hospitalized patients as a percentage of total hospital capacity exceeds 15 percent.”

Abbott further directed the Department of State Health Services to use staffing agencies to help locate out-of-state medical personnel who could help out at overstretched Texas health care facilities.

Hospital officials in Houston said last week that area hospitals with beds had insufficient numbers of nurses to serve them. As a result, some patients had to be transferred out of the city to get medical care, with one patient even being sent to North Dakota.

“The State of Texas is taking action to combat the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and ensure that our hospitals and communities have the resources and support they need to mitigate the virus,” Abbott said in a statement. “Texans can help bolster our efforts by getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, and it is our best defense against this virus.”

Last month, Abbott signed an executive order banning government agencies and municipalities from imposing mask and vaccination mandates. That order is being challenged in court by Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, a Democrat.

Meanwhile, the Dallas school district announced Monday it would require students and staff to wear face masks starting Tuesday. The Houston school district already announced a mask mandate for its students and staff later this week if its board approves. A group of parents sued the Houston Independent School District over the weekend, challenging the requirements.

About 45 percent of Texas’ population has been vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A pair of tattooed brothers were arrested for the fatal shooting of a 29-year old Chicago police officer over the weekend, cops said Monday.

Emonte Morgan, 21, was busted on charges of first-degree murder for killing Officer Ella French on Saturday night. His brother Eric Morgan, 22, was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and obstruction of justice, according to the Chicago Police Department.

The brothers and a third woman were stopped by French and her partner around 9 p.m. Saturday.

Suddenly, gunfire erupted from the vehicle, police said. Officers returned fire, injuring one of the vehicle’s occupants. Police did not give a reason for the traffic stop.



“This is the first step towards justice as we work to honor our fallen officer and her partner,” Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said at a press conference Monday evening.

French’s partner was taken to the hospital with serious gunshot wounds but is “improving incrementally,” Brown said.

Chicago Police Officer Ella French was shot and killed during a traffic stop on August 7, 2021.

The young woman in the car with the brothers has not been charged, due to lack of evidence, he said.

The gun used “was the product of a straw purchase,” Brown said, and was illegally purchased through an Indiana man, Jamel Danzy, 29, who purchased it legally in Hammond, Indiana, and knowingly provided it to another individual in Chicago who was not permitted to own firearms, Brown said.

Danzy was charged by federal authorities Monday.

Brown said traffic stops like Saturday’s are beneficial for keeping guns off the streets. This year alone, he said, 7,536 guns have been recovered by CPD, a 23 percent increase from the same period last year.

“But for the brave conduct of our police officers trying to protect the people of Chicago and recovering an illegally possessed gun, what ended up being an illegally bought gun, but for these types of traffic stops our cities wouldn’t be safe.

“Criminals with illegal guns are driving [up] crime here and everywhere in this country. And officers put themselves in harm’s way stopping suspects like this so that we can all sleep safely in our homes at night.”

French is the first Chicago police officer killed since Lori Lightfoot became mayor of the city in 2019, but the city’s cops have faced a surge of gunfire in the past two years.

In total, 11 people were killed and 73 were shot across the city over the weekend, Chicago police said.

In a fundraising email to supporters over the weekend, the former president announced a new version of the trademark red “Make America Great Again” hats and claimed he had “just designed” the new offering.

“I just designed our BRAND NEW MAGA Hat and I want YOU to have it,” the email teased would-be donors to Trump’s Save America PAC. “You’ve always been one of my most LOYAL supporters, so I don’t want you to have just ANY hat… I want YOU to have the MAGA Hat that I personally HAND-SIGNED for YOU.”

The email included an image of the red hat with white “MAGA” lettering and gold trim, as well as options to donate $25, $50, $100, or $250.

“Our movement isn’t slowing down, in fact, it’s only speeding up,” the email concluded. “That’s why I wanted to design a NEW HAT for all of our best supporters.”

For those content with an unsigned version of the hat, the chapeau is available for $40 on the Save America website.

The original “Make America Great Again” hat remains the definitive pop culture totem of Trump’s tenure as president, having been called “the new white hood” by actress Alyssa Milano in 2019 and featuring memorably in an episode of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” last year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A group of 20 House Republicans are calling out Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for “lackluster performance” in a letter demanding detailed answers to questions about the Biden administration’s immigration policies.

“The southern border is in crisis despite the Biden Administration’s refusal to call it what it is,” read the letter sent Monday, which was initially obtained by Fox News.

“The American people can see the numbers, and Americans in communities across the nation are feeling the burden of our open borders.

“Due to the unprecedented nature of this crisis, it is dangerously irresponsible for your Department to not be as transparent as possible with the American people.”

The letter — which was signed by lawmakers including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Greg Steube (R-Fla.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), and Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) — includes 13 separate requests for information about the surge of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border since President Joe Biden took office in January.

The Republicans’ requests include a breakdown of the number of border agents reassigned from patrol duties to migrant holding facilities; a report on the number of illegal immigrants who tested positive for COVID-19 while in US custody and were released while infected, or were offered a vaccine while being held; information on the number of illegal immigrants released into the US after being apprehended; migrants with connections to cartels or terror groups who have entered the US; and the amount of taxpayer money spent on food, shelter and transportation for illegal immigrants.

In a court filing last week, a top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official estimated that approximately 210,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in July, an 11 percent increase from the 188,829 stops in June and the highest number in more than 20 years.

In the same filing, the official said that more than 19,000 unaccompanied minors were picked up by border authorities, beating the previous high of 18,877 in March.

In past years, the number of attempted border crossings has peaked in May, then dropped in subsequent months due to the scorching summer heat, but that has not proven to be the case so far this year.

The GOP letter Monday described the crossing numbers as “appalling,” telling Mayorkas they are “a direct result of the Biden Administration’s weak border policies and your lackluster performance as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

“DHS’s mission is ‘with honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values,'” the letter adds. “Frankly, you are not fulfilling that mission.”

The letter gives Mayorkas until Sept. 6 to respond.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A professional paintballer was kicked off her team Monday for making fun of a teenager infected with COVID-19 and saying he doesn’t need the vaccine but instead, “a f–king treadmill.”

Jessica Maiolo, 31, posted a since-deleted video on TikTok about the Miami teen, who spent 10 days in the hospital with the virus, and how his mother said she’d wished she’d gotten him the vaccine sooner so the serious illness could’ve been prevented.

“Ma’am your kid does not need a COVID shot,” Maiolo, standing in front of a television with the news report paused, said in the video.

“Your kid needs a f–king treadmill. That’s what he needs.”

Maiolo was excoriated on the social media platform for being a “vile human,” fat shaming a teenager and spreading vaccine misinformation.

Outraged users reported Maiolo’s comments to Team USA Paintball, which is not affiliated with the Olympics, and following a brief investigation, the group announced Monday they were cutting ties with the athlete.

“Our investigation into the troubling conduct of Ms. Maiolo has been concluded and we have decided to remove her from the team indefinitely,” the team wrote in a statement posted to their Instagram account, saying the decision is “final and in effect immediately.”

“Playing for Team USA Paintball means representing the sport at the highest level and being a leader both on and off the field. We are an eclectic mix of culture, opinions and ideas – and that’s what makes our sport so great. We cannot tear each other down, both within our community and out. We are hopeful that this will serve as a valuable lesson for anyone paying attention.”

Maiolo, who previously shared fringe theories about the vaccine and was an outspoken critic against them, shared a statement on Instagram early Monday saying it was “never my intention to shame any individual.”

“What started out as me expressing my personal opinion about something I feel quite passionately about, has turned into a moment of regret for the situation I have put my teammates, our sponsors and the sport I love into,” the statement reads.

“If I were to have such a moment again to convey my full thoughts, I would choose my words more carefully and consider how my opinions may affect others,” the statement continues.

“As may be evident by the hobbies I have, I am a passionate individual. My fire is the same for paintball and fitness as it is for self advocacy and all of the things that make me proud to live where I do.”

Maiolo wrote she has “learned a lot about the power of my reach” in the last 24 hours and said she’ll “be more responsible with it” in the future.

“I appreciate the opportunity to see this situation from the viewpoint of others, and to learn where I can do better and will. I hope that I may inspire others to realize the power of their words too.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A group of Republican senators have drafted a plan to block a push to compel women to register for the draft upon turning 18 — dubbing it the “Don’t Draft Our Daughter’s” resolution.

“Women have heroically served in and alongside America’s fighting forces since our nation’s founding. It’s one thing to allow American women to choose this life, it’s quite another to force it upon our daughters, sisters, and wives,” Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said in a statement.

The resolution is being introduced by six GOP senators: Mike Lee (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Josh Hawley (R-MO), James Lankford (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT) and Roger Wicker (R-MS).

The ​Senate National Defense Authorization Act, approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, includes an amendment that would for the first time force women between the ages of 18 to 25 to sign up for the Selected Service.

Men of that age are currently required to do so. Those that don’t are ineligible for federal student loans and can’t land government jobs.

In introducing the “Don’t Draft Our Daughter’s” resolution, the GOP lawmakers also noted that women tend to score lower on military physical fitness exams.

Sen. Josh Hawley’s tweet opposing women having to register for the draft. Twitter

The language states that “only a small subset of women are able to meet the physical fitness requirements for combat roles.”

Proponents of the resolution stressed that they supported the right of women to join the military but opposed making draft registration mandatory.

“Forcing our daughters into the draft creates a burdensome and disproportionately increased risk of injury and fatalities for our nation’s women, as readiness data shows,” Sen. Lee said in a statement.

“This policy change is rushed and unnecessary in our current time of peace, and unduly harms women more than advancing any notion of equality. While American women should be empowered to serve in our Armed Forces, they should not be forced to fight.”

Ria Tabacco Mar, head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, has countered that the status quo creates a “serious burden on men that’s not being imposed on women.”

She said it sends a “tremendously harmful message that women are less fit than men to serve their country in this particular way and conversely that men are less fit than women to stay home as caregivers in the event of an armed conflict.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A herd of wild elephants that captivated the world with their yearlong trek through China — raiding farms and even a retirement home for food along the way — may finally be heading back home.

The 14 Asian elephants, including three calves, were spotted on Sunday heading across a bridge in China’s southwestern Yunnan province.

The roaming herd is still about 125 miles away from the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve where they lived, but local authorities are currently opening a path to help guide them back there.

The herd left the reserve a year ago for unknown reasons and set off on a 300 mile trek to the north of the country.

Authorities have spent the past year deploying trucks, workers and at least 14 government drones to monitor the elephants as they trekked across the country.

Adorable drone footage shot in June captured the herd napping together near Xiyang.

Officials have also evacuated roads for the elephants so they could pass safely and used food to steer the animals away from populated, urban areas.

After reaching the outskirts of the city of Kunming in June, the herd turned south again and appear to now be en-route back home.

The elephants have stampeded through at least 15 farms and caused more than a million dollars of economic damage throughout their journey, according to local authorities.

No animals and humans appear to have been injured as the elephants roamed free.

One of the male elephants that separated from the herd early last month, however, was tranquilized and returned back to the reserve.

China only has about 300 wild elephants left and their status in the country is highly protected.

It is unclear why the herd left the nature reserve in the first place.

Some have speculated that habitat loss and food resources may have played a role.

The National Forestry and Grassland Administration said the animals were in a “suitable habitat” after crossing the river on Sunday evening.

The shocking killing comes as gangs are increasingly targeting so-called “Insta-bragging” bitcoin traders and influencers after they have flaunted their wealth on social media.

Despite being just 19 years old, Santarem apparently had made a fortune as a cryptocurrency trader and investor for at least three years.

On Instagram, he flaunted his wealth and expensive lifestyle to his 133,000 followers plus a YouTube channel with 15,600 subscribers where he gave trading tips.

His last Insta post was a photo of him sitting on the red Porsche — in which he was shot — as he flicks through wads of cash.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bernie Madoff had some of his toes amputated, was missing eight teeth and wildly hallucinated before he died from kidney disease, a new report says.

The notorious 82-year-old con from New York City was serving a 150-year sentence for his $65 billion Ponzi scheme when he reportedly refused dialysis and died April 14 at a federal prison hospital in Butner, NC.

About a week before he succumbed, the reviled former financier screamed for assistance, and when a nurse responded, he stared at the floor, wiggled his left foot and yelled, “Help! I hate this f–king place!,” according to Market Watch.

Madoff’s fourth toe on the foot, and one of the toes next to it, had to be amputated because of gangrene, the site said.

The nurse told Madoff to stop yelling because he was disturbing other inmates, prompting him to reportedly reply: “F–k them!”

The medical worker then told Madoff to stop cursing and asked what happened, the site said, citing prison medical records.

“I gave them a pass, and no one is respecting me or doing anything! I can’t believe they are doing this to me!” the confused and agitated man replied, although he couldn’t explain whom he was referring to, according to the outlet.

The ailing scammer then stopped answering questions, burying his face in his hands as he sat on his bed, according to Market Watch, which obtained more than 4,000 pages of medical records from the Bureau of Prisons in response to a Freedom of Information request.

He also previously thought he saw a bird in a guard’s pocket and people lurking in his room at night, the documents show.

Madoff spent the final 17 months of his life in hospice care as he died of kidney failure, according to the report.

He also suffered from severe coronary artery disease, which left him gasping for air during short walks, and in 2020 developed gangrene on the fourth toe of his left foot, the records show, according to Market Watch. To prevent the gangrene from spreading, he had the two toes amputated, the outlet reported.

Madoff received low doses of methadone for pain, relied on oxygen tanks, used a wheelchair and underwent dialysis three times a week, although he often cut treatment short or refused it altogether because he found it too debilitating, according to the report.

He also had lost eight of his teeth and was considered a “high fall risk,” records show.

Because of his failing health, Madoff was among the first people in the US to be vaccinated against COVID-19 — getting his first Pfizer jab Dec. 18, 2020, just a week after the immunization was approved for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration, the outlet said. He received his second dose Jan. 9.

Madoff began applying for an early release in the middle of 2019 based on his terminal illness, telling prison officials he planned to move to Baltimore and undergo treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the records show.



He told a social worker “he has several people [redacted] that can assist and some who are ‘indebted’ to him,” according to the files cited by Market Watch.



Madoff’s application was blocked more than once by the warden and prison’s general counsel on the grounds that his crime had been too great and that he declined to undergo dialysis behind bars, the outlet reported.

But health workers eventually said Madoff met the criteria for compassionate release, and the warden agreed to submit the request to a judge, even though the top prison official was not recommending the move.

In June 2020, Judge Denny Chin rejected the request, saying he believed that “Mr. Madoff was never truly remorseful, and that he was only sorry that his life as he knew it was collapsing around him.”

Madoff later appealed to the warden again in a handwritten note, claiming he was at high risk due to the pandemic and in danger of losing his foot to gangrene, but the warden turned him down again, Market Watch reported, citing a letter in the file.



Madoff’s lawyer, Brandon Sample, said officials reviewing Madoff’s petition were well aware of the details about his declining health.



“It was well documented that Mr. Madoff was aged and sick. The BOP, the government, and Madoff’s sentencing judge were all aware of the same,” Sample told Market Watch in a statement.

“Nonetheless, his declining health was insufficient for the judge to show Madoff a bit of mercy. That remains the real story here. There is no point to compassionate release if there is no compassion,” he added.

Madoff’s medical records also showed that he underwent hundreds of doctor’s appointments and tests by cardiologists, nephrologists, psychiatrists, dentists and eye doctors during his time in the slammer.

But he was a difficult patient, regularly refusing treatments, skipping appointments and stopping and starting his meds, according to the records.

Madoff also reportedly declined to undergoing kidney dialysis for years, despite what his doctors urged, and only began treatments after his case was considered terminal in 2019, the report said. He also refused a recommendation to seek a kidney transplant.

Madoff had been treated for mental health issues, including by being put on Prozac and Celexa for depression and anxiety, respectively, according to the records.

“I never sleep and am always tired,” he was quoted as telling a doctor, according to Market Watch, which reported that he also received trazadone to help him with his anxiety and to get some sleep.

In late 2009, Madoff suffered intracranial bleeding, a broken nose, a fractured rib and a cut above his eye when he fainted and struck his head on a water fountain, the report said.

He was unable to explain what had happened, so prison guards thought he had been attacked. But Madoff later explained that he had gotten dizzy after he stopped taking his blood pressure medication because he thought it made him itch, the records show.

In 2013, he underwent an angioplasty after suffering a small heart attack. The following year, he underwent surgery to remove part of his enlarged prostate, which had caused him trouble with urinating. He underwent another angioplasty in 2020, according to the records.

Madoff experienced hallucinations as his mental state declined in his final weeks, the records said.

Just before he had his toes removed March 23, he said he saw people in his room at night. Surgeons also decided not to perform a heart-valve replacement that day because they didn’t think he would survive the operation.



Madoff later told a corrections officer he saw a bird in the guard’s jacket pocket, admitted “feeling crazy” and said that nothing mattered anymore, the records show.

Two days before his death, Madoff — who had signed a do-not-resuscitate order — fell out of his bed and was found on the floor of his cell.

Doctors wrote that he appeared to have reached the “terminal cliff” and switched Madoff to a morphine drip. They moved him to a room closer to the nurse’s station, and he died at 3:10 a.m. April 14 of end-stage renal failure, the records say.

A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons declined to comment to Market Watch about Madoff’s treatment.

Jessica Alba honestly looks like she’s having a relaxing holiday.

The actress-turned-business maven, 40, was snapped soaking up the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, along with her husband, Cash Warren, 42, preparing for a day of snorkeling. Both looked fit and tan carting their undersea equipment around the beach.

The pair met in 2004 on the “Fantastic Four” set and tied the knot in May 2008. They share three children: daughters Honor Marie, 13, and Haven Garner, 9, and son Hayes, 3 — none of whom appeared with them on the beach.

Perhaps the two needed some alone time. The “Dark Angel” star recently admitted on Katherine Schwarzenegger’s Instagram show “Before, During, and After Baby” that she has to work to keep the spark in her marriage with Warren alive, copping to feeling like a “roommate” to him.

“It’s all rosy for 2 1/2 years. But then after that, you become roommates,” she explained. “You’re just going through the motions. You have the responsibilities. It’s a lot of, like, checking the boxes, right?”

Alba recently admitted she sometimes views Warren more like a roommate. HEM / BACKGRID

Alba said that initially the couple was diligent about weekly date nights with no talk about kids or responsibilities but “that stops, because of whatever.”

The Honest Company founder also confessed to sometimes taking Warren for granted.

“We have, like, obviously the friendship, the comfort of, like, ‘You’re not going anywhere,’ and so sometimes you don’t treat those people the best, right? You don’t consider their feelings in the way that you would consider other people’s feelings,” she said. “So that is something that I think is a constant one to work on.”

Alba acknowledged that she doesn’t have the answers to a happy marriage.

“If you’ve figured it out in your relationship, let me know,” she joked.

At least the pair’s social life is going strong: They partied all night in Miami in May to celebrate Honest Company’s billion-dollar valuation.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the wake of the July 11 street protests that rocked Cuba’s Communist regime, the Havana government has moved to reassert control by arresting hundreds of their own citizens, more than three dozen of whom are suspected of having been “forced disappearances”

Beginning the week after the demonstrations, Cubans who had been swept up by the authorities were judged in summary trials in groups of 10 or 12 at a time, independent journalist Cynthia de la Cantera told The Post. She explained that Cuban law allows for such swift disposition of cases involving purportedly minor crimes, where the punishment is less than one year in prison.

“They are making what we call ‘exemplary’ trials, with many people who are being prosecuted without evidence,” she said.

“Many defendants don’t have lawyers, they [the authorities] don’t allow their relatives in court or their relatives are not notified,” Cantera added. “In some cases, the relatives were told the trial would be held at a certain place and when they arrived, it turned out the trial was being held elsewhere, they arrived late and therefore couldn’t enter. In short, there are many irregularities in this process.”

According to Cantera, relatives of defendants who do have access to legal representation are being told to keep quiet about their loved ones’ cases so that they may receive a lighter sentence. She notes that private legal practice is illegal on the island, leaving the accused to stand alone against a rigged system.

“Many lawyers are recommending to the relatives not to divulge the cases on social networks, not to make the case visible, not to talk to the independent press, not to talk to the foreign press,” she said, adding that “some have even told them not to go through an appeal process because the penalty may be higher.”

“There is also a lack of legal culture in Cuba,” she went on, “and right now it puts many families in a very vulnerable situation.”

In an effort to break the code of silence, Cantera and other independent journalists and activists are working to catalogue information about their arrested compatriots.

As of late Tuesday, a Google document contained the names of 805 people who had been arrested or are otherwise unaccounted for in the aftermath of the demonstrations, the intensity of which Cantera described as unprecedented since the ascension of Fidel Castro to power in 1959. The list has been slowly built out despite the best efforts of the Cuban government to limit the spread of information about their actions.

“You have to realize that all this is functionally illegal and blocked by the Cuban government, so they’re trying to hack it as best they can while some among them are getting detained, disappeared, etc. and the internet is shutting off all the time,” said author Antonio Garcia Martinez, who shared the list with The Post. “So, it’s a scramble on their side.”

Glenda Marrero Matanzas

The document, which is entitled “List of detainees and disappeared Cuba July 2021,” includes each person’s name, the place they were last seen, the time and date of their detention if known, the latest report on their status and their age if known. Only a select few can update the document, in order to prevent pro-regime propagandists from deleting the information or spreading falsehoods.

The youngest person on the list is 14-year-old Christopher Lleonart Santana of Havana. At last report, he was arrested July 17 at 3 a.m., accused of throwing stones and held in a detention center for minors.

“His mother reports that he has been beaten,” the document reads.

Another name on the list is 15-year-old Glenda de la Caridad Marrero Cartaya, described as a computer student accused of “inciting riots” in the town of Jovellanos, about 100 miles east of Havana. She faces up to 60 days in prison.

Nearly two dozen people on the list have already been tried and sentenced to between 8 and 12 months in prison. One of them is 17-year-old Katherine Martin, who was arrested along with her mother and her sister Miriam. The document records that Katherine was sentenced to a year in prison after a summary trial on July 20 and was “badly beaten” while in jail.

Anyelo Troya

“Katty is a very brave girl,” the document records the testimony of a fellow detainee. “We called her ‘The Colombian’ because she imitates the Colombian accent to perfection and made us laugh a lot. Katty is only 17 and has had to live in prison because she doesn’t agree, because she doesn’t conform.”

Katherine’s mother, Myra Taquechel, has been sentenced to eight months in prison while sister Miriam has been released on bail.

Another name on the list, 25-year-old photographer old Angelo Troya, was given a year in prison for filming the protests, according to independent journalist Claudia Padrón Cueto.

“Angelo went out to film the protests, to document them. Only that,” Cueto tweeted July 21. “They did not forgive him for filming … They did not forgive him for filming the demonstrations and repression”.

The oldest person on the list is 68-year-old Felix Navarro Rodriguez, who was reportedly arrested and charged with public disorder while inquiring about other detainees the day after the protests in the city of Matanzas, 55 miles east of Havana.

“The list is based on reports from family members and friends,” Cantera explained. “They’re either public reports that are posted on social networks or from people who contact us through our internal channels and ask us to please add their family member to the list, who believe that it is necessary for them to be there to make that case visible, so we do it.”

Once a person is reported detained, Cantera says, a group of women is tasked with verifying they actually have lost their freedom.

“They contact other family members, other friends, they check Facebook, they check social media pages to confirm the last time they posted, what has been known about that person, what has been published about that person, they contact other family members and friends to verify in fact that the information reported is real,” she said. “This process is quite slow compared to the number of reports that come in, because there are other relatives who do not want to talk, relatives who are afraid.”

Cantera adds that regular internet outages, which she calls “a government tool for censorship”, also make the verification process slow going, but “we hope at some point to get to verify all of them.”

Felix Navarro Rodriguez

Of the 805 detainees, 373 are confirmed as being detained at a known location. A further 248 are listed as “En excarcelación” or released, though activists say that number includes people who are under house arrest.

A further 173 people described as being “en proceso de verificación,” meaning their current whereabouts are unknown. The vast majority in this category have been reported detained in connection with the protests, while some are described as having been caught up in “criminal investigations.”

Ominously, 39 people included on the list are confirmed or suspected of being “desapariciónes forzadas” — forced disappearances.

“The people who are in enforced disappearance are people whose whereabouts are still unknown,” Cantera says. “That means that that person has not been allowed to make a call, or that person is detained in a place and we don’t know where they are because he or she does not appear in the records … We are not trying to say that these people have died, [but] they are people whom to this day we do not know where they are.”

The Cuban government has remained tight-lipped about the exact numbers of people who have been detained, missing or charged following the protests. The regime did disclose that one person had died as a result of the protests, but the opposition group Cuba Decide estimate the number of deaths is at least five.

Havana has also blamed the protests on supposed agitators from the Cuban diaspora in South Florida, as well as the US government. While the list of detainees includes opposition activists, others are described as “unemployed” or “housewife”. Katherine Martin is listed as a “student and model”, while her sister Miriam is described as a manicurist.

The efforts of Cantera and her cohorts have drawn the attention of Cuba’s security state. While neither she nor her colleagues have been detained or arrested, Cantera told The Post that one of the “verification girls,” as she calls them, has been placed under police surveillance.

“What they do is that they put a police patrol outside her house and don’t let her out, and that person is still under police surveillance to this day,” she said. “We also know that some officers have been visiting some of the detainees who have already been released, asking them about lists, we know that in some interrogations of detainees inside the facilities, they asked about the list, and who was making the list.

Mayra Taquechel

“So we know that, yes, it is a subject that has come out of the interrogations; but, well, to this day none of us has been detained or called for a summons, nor have we been summoned for this work,” Cantera added, saying that such a summons was “something that we do not rule out happening at some point, either.”

Meanwhile, the Cuban regime has sought to loosen restrictions in an effort to tamp down public unrest. Three days after the protests, the government announced it was lifting caps on the amount of food and medicine travelers could bring into the country, a move Cantera called “a small Band-Aid for all the problems we have here.”

“The Government of Cuba is denying access to human rights observers and is counting on the world to turn a blind eye to its repression. But we will not look away. This is repression,” a State Department spokesperson told The Post Tuesday. “We join the families who are suffering and scared, Cuba’s human rights defenders, and people around the world in calling for the immediate release of all those detained or missing for merely exercising their human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and demanding freedom. We are also joining efforts to catalogue and raise awareness about specific instances of abuses against peaceful protestors.

Katerine Martin

“Violence and detentions of Cuban protesters and missing independent activists remind us that Cubans pay dearly for freedom and dignity,” the spokesperson added. “We call for the immediate release of those wrongfully detained.”

The Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC, did not return requests for comment by The Post.

One month after the July 11 protests, Cantera says the overwhelming feeling in Cuba is “a lot of fear” among people who worry about the consequences of speaking out.

“I have a friend who had never had any kind of behavior on social networks and she posted something, as she was quite outraged about what had happened,” she recounted. “But afterwards, she was very afraid of having written that, in fear for her own well-being and that of her family. So, there is fear even of writing a post on Facebook.”

Cantera said her friend’s fears were well-founded, as the Cuban government has gotten into the habit of checking people’s Facebook pages in order to ascertain their “social and moral behavior” during the protests and their aftermath.

“One of the things everybody thought after July 11 was that that would be it, that the government was going to come to its end, that the totalitarian system was going to fall,” she says. “But the reality is that days have gone by and that, well, has not happened and I don’t believe that it will happen as soon as we were expecting it to.”

Meanwhile, those who took part in the protests, were arrested, and were either released on bail or to house arrest, have suffered what Cantera calls “a terrible trauma from the violence they experienced, either in the protests or in the prisons and in the police stations.

“So, there is a terrible fear,” she said.

The former New York City mayor, who’s been stripped of his law license and is facing a massive defamation lawsuit over his “Big Lie” following the 2020 presidential election, has signed up for the celebrity site, Cameo.

Giuliani announced the move Tuesday morning on Twitter, writing, “Good news: I want to connect with YOU on Cameo — Now taking all Cameo requests!”

“If there is an issue you want to discuss or a story you’d like to hear or share with me, or a greeting that I can bring to someone that would bring happiness to their day, I would be delighted to do it,” Giuliani says in a welcome video posted to his page.

Giuliani’s foray into the gig economy comes as he faces mounting legal bills from the $1.3 billion lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems after he falsely claimed the company stole the election from Donald Trump by flipping votes for President Biden.

In June, Giuliani’s law license was suspended in New York and Washington, DC, over his “false and misleading statements” related to voter fraud in the presidential election while repping Trump.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Renaming the Tappan Zee Bridge for his late father, Mario, was one of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s proudest achievements.

Now, in the wake of his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations Tuesday, many are asking if the famous span should have the Cuomo name scrubbed off.

As recently as this week, lawmakers and residents were calling for the $4 billion bridge — officially named the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge after the former governor — to have its original name reinstated.

They argued the bridge should not be tainted with the Cuomo name after the scathing state attorney general report that accused the governor of sexual harassment.

The bridge was officially renamed after former Gov. Mario Cuomo via a state law passed back in 2017, when an insistent Andrew Cuomo cut a deal with lawmakers.

That means any future name changes can only occur if lawmakers repeal it.

Assemblyman Mike Lawler introduced legislation last week calling for the bridge to have its previous name back.

“I urge each and every one of my colleagues in the Assembly to back this piece of legislation that will remove the stain of Andrew Cuomo’s name from the Tappan Zee Bridge,” Lawler said in a statement.

“No one should have to drive over one of the finest pieces of architecture in our state and be reminded of the unforgivable sins of our governor.”

The bridge is considered one of Cuomo’s major achievements during his stint as governor but it has long been shrouded in controversy.

A series of petitions started by local residents have circulated over the years begging lawmakers to change the bridge’s name back to Tappan Zee.

One petition garnered nearly 166,000 signatures.

Those residents argued the name was historic give the “Tappan” referred a Native American group that lived nearby and “Zee” is Dutch for sea.

After Cuomo was elected in 2010, he started championing replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge between Rockland and Westchester counties in what would become a major infrastructure project.

In 2017, part of the new bridge opened and Cuomo started pushing lawmakers to change its name in honor of his late father.

The deal went ahead — much to the anger of some Hudson Valley residents — and the second portion of the bridge opened the following year.

At the time, Cuomo dismissed the push to change the name back as politically motivated.

“I believe it’s mean. I believe it’s vindictive. But this is the political environment we are in,” he said of the campaign back in 2017.

“My father was governor for 12 years in the state of New York. I think he is respected by Democrats and Republicans all across the board.”

Video shows a black bear calmly strolling down the aisles of a California grocery store.

Many shoppers at the Ralph’s in the Porter Ranch section of Los Angeles weren’t too scared to shoot footage of the 125-pound wild animal which is chased out by some brave workers, images show.

Among those taking video was actress Tisha Campbell, known for her role as Gina in the Martin Lawrence-fronted sitcom “Martin.”

Campbell posted her encounter on TikTok and then filmed herself as she cautiously and anxiously heads to her car in the parking lot.

Inside her car, she comically expresses shock.

“It’s not like I’m in a secluded area, I’m in my f—ing local grocery store,” she says.

“I don’t know what this wild wildlife s–t is right now that’s going on with me. You know what? Stay the f–k away from me because who the f–k knows? A f—king hippo-motherf–king-potamus might pop out of no f–king where.”

The bear apparently wasn’t done shopping for the day.

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife caught up with the animal at a Walmart nearby, KTLA reported. Officials tranquilized the animal and brought it to a safe location, the TV station said.

“Bears know that if they come down out of the mountains into a town, they’re going to find food,” department spokesman told KTLA.

“I thought the video was amazing,” resident David Balen told CBS Los Angeles. “I’m glad that nobody came in contact with the bear. Anything can happen.”

Balen, a member of the local neighborhood council, shared photos and video of the bear on his Facebook page.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Chris Cuomo has a yacht of reasons to hide.

The embattled CNN anchor was spotted at a Hamptons dock late Tuesday by Fox News as he dodged criticism of his role in his brother Andrew’s sexual harassment scandal and resignation.

Chris admitted he was in contact with the governor, but did not say whether he advised his sibling to resign.

The “Cuomo Prime Time” host reportedly spent “four or five hours” on his speedboat before returning to shore as dusk fell. The younger Cuomo was approached by a reporter as he walked to his truck at the Sag Harbor Yacht Yard.

“Of course I have,” Chris Cuomo answered when asked if he had spoken with his brother Tuesday. He then held his tongue when asked if he had told his older brother to step down, whether he was continuing to advise Andrew, and whether that presented an ethical conflict for the younger Cuomo.

The New York Times, citing two sources, reported late Tuesday that Chris Cuomo had advised his brother to give up his office amid the fallout from revelations that he had sexually harassed 11 women — including nine current or former state employees — in violation of federal law.

“I think you’ve got a job to do,” Cuomo finally said as he walked past the reporter, “and I’m letting you do it.”

In the wake of a Post report that Andrew Cuomo has no place of his own to stay once he leaves the governor’s mansion in Albany, Chris Cuomo was later asked if his brother would be joining him in the Hamptons.

“Yes, if you wait here, he’ll be here in five minutes,” the anchor snarked as he got into his Ford F-150. Cuomo ignored other questions as he pulled out of the yacht yard, including whether he believed the women who accused his brother of sexual misconduct.

FoxNews.com also reported that Cuomo had told its reporter that he had called New York state troopers to “tell them not to get you.” It was not immediately clear whether he meant the comment as a joke.

The “Cuomo Prime Time” host has not been on the air since Thursday. The following day, he began an apparently pre-planned vacation to mark his 51st birthday, which fell on Monday. He had not mentioned his brother’s scandal on his program last week.

Andrew Cuomo stepped down as governor Tuesday, 16 months before the conclusion of his third term in office.

A report released Aug. 3 by New York state Attorney General Letitia James detailed the extent of the CNN star’s moonlighting as an adviser to his brother, which the anchor apologized for in May after the Washington Post initially reported on it.

“I can be objective about just about any topic, but not about my family … I am fiercely loyal to them. I’m family first, job second,” Chris Cuomo told his viewers May 20, later adding: “When my brother’s situation became turbulent, being looped into calls with other friends of his, and advisers that did include some of his staff, I understand why that was a problem for CNN. It will not happen again.”

A CNN rep told The Post late Monday that recent conversations between the brothers did not violate network policy because Chris Cuomo was not taking part in gubernatorial staff meetings or acting “in any official capacity.”

Critics have called for the anchor to be disciplined or fired over his dual role, which represents a serious ethical breach.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A California vlogger cooked up an Indian food controversy with a call to cancel the word “curry” – blaming its widespread usage on British colonialism.

A viral April Instagram post from Chaheti Bansal on her Rooted in Spice page sparked a debate over the word’s usage to describe dishes of different tastes from various regions of South Asia and has been widely recirculated in recent media reports.

“I’m not even gonna bother with the recipe in this voiceover cause I have more important things to discuss like canceling the word ‘curry,’ ” she says in the post, accompanying a video of her cooking.

“OK, not in all cultures – but specifically in Indian cuisine cause I don’t understand what that word means,” she adds.

“Like there’s a saying that the food in India changes every 100 kilometers and yet we’re still using this umbrella term popularized by white people who couldn’t be bothered to learn the actual names of our dishes – but we can still unlearn.”

The word “curry” likely originated from British colonists who were mispronouncing something else – although it’s not clear what exactly they were mispronouncing.

Chaheti Bansal cooked up an Indian food controversy. Twitter

“The word curry does not exist in any South Asian language to my knowledge,” University of Vermont Professor Ilyse Morgenstein Fuerst told NBC News. “Curry is one of these words that most historians attribute to the British bad ear.”

White people wanted South Asian food but not overly spiced or “smelly,” the professor said.

“And that lack of temperance, in our food, or in our emotionality, is a problem,” she told NBC News. “That’s one of the things that is rooted in white, Christian supremacy.”

Bansal told NBC she doesn’t want to completely strike “curry” from the record and it is often correct for certain South Asian dishes – she is just aiming for some nuance.

“Curry shouldn’t be all that you think about when you think about South Asian food,” she said in an interview.

But that hasn’t stopped some people from pushing back on the movement. “I lost the will to live as soon as we started talking about it,” British TV host Simon McCoy said in a widely circulated clip covering the controversy.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden on Tuesday nominated Damian Williams to be the new US attorney for Manhattan, one of the most high-profile federal prosecutor positions in the nation.

Williams, 40, would be the first black man to hold the post in the Southern District of New York if he’s confirmed by the Senate.

The White House announced the pick on Tuesday along with seven other nominations for US attorneys — including two others in New York State.

“The President has launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick in gun crime that has been taking place the last 18 months – putting more cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking,” the statement said.

“Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for these efforts.”

Williams would replace Acting US Attorney Audrey Strauss, who ascended to the office’s top spot after former President Donald Trump fired former Attorney Preet Bharara and his successor Geoffrey Berman.

Williams is an assistant attorney in the district and once worked as a law clerk for Merrick Garland on the US Court of Appeals, according to the White House.

The Southern District includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester County and other northern suburbs.

Biden nominated Breon Peace as the US attorney for the Eastern District, which includes Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens and Long Island. Peace is a former assistant US attorney in the district..

Carla Freedman was Biden’s pick for the Northern District of New York, which includes Albany County and other upstate counties in the state.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Kate Brown, the Oregon Democrat, signed a bill last month with little fanfare that drops the requirement that high school students prove proficiency in reading, writing or math before graduation, a report said.

The Oregonian reported that the governor has seemed to avoid discussing Senate Bill 744. Her move to sign the bill was “not public until recently, because her office did not hold a signing ceremony or issue press release.” The paper also pointed out that the bill was first signed on July 14 but not added into the state’s database until July 29 due to a glitch in the system.

Brown’s office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.

In June, state lawmakers voted to approve the bill that suspended the requirements for students for three years, KATU reported. Foundations for a Better Oregon said in a statement at the time that the bill is intended to “truly reflect what every student needs to thrive in the 21st century.” Supporters of the bill insist that considering math and reading essential skills has been an unfair challenge for students who do not test well. The report said the requirement was first suspended at the start of the pandemic.

The KATU report pointed out that Republicans have come out against the bill and claim that it lowers “expectations for our kids.” But there was some bipartisan support.

Charles Boyle, the deputy communications director from Brown’s office, told the paper in an email that staff from the governor’s office informed legislative staffers about the bill’s signing on the day it was passed. He also said that the new standards for graduation will help benefit the state’s “Black, Latino, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian, Pacific Islander, Tribal, and students of color.”

The paper reported that the bill could stay in effect for five years until new requirements.

The paper’s editorial staff urged Brown to veto the bill back in June.

“Oregon schools were among the last in the country to reopen to in-person instruction during the pandemic,” an editorial read. “Our legislators should be focused on how to help students regain the ground they’ve lost after a year and a half of distance learning and hybrid instruction – not on lowering our standards.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden on Tuesday declared that it was “infrastructure decade” and that the US economy is in for a “long term boom” after the Senate passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill — despite much of it not being paid for.

The bill passed the Senate on Tuesday with 19 Republicans joining all 50 Democrats in favor. House passage is likely weeks away due to a scheduled summer vacation period.

“After years and years of ‘infrastructure week’, we’re the cusp of an infrastructure decade that I truly believe will transform America.” Biden said at the White House — before bungling his victory speech by saying Gov. Andrew Cuomo did “a hell of a job” despite resigning amid sexual assault allegations and federal probes of his coverup of COVID-19 nursing home deaths.

The Senate-passed infrastructure bill costs $1.2 trillion over eight years, but it is sometimes cited as $1 trillion, the cost over five years. The bill includes $550 billion in new spending over five years.

Biden spoke as Senate Democrats begin the process of attempting to force through a supplementary $3.5 trillion bill that includes much of the social provisions that didn’t gain support from Republicans amid fear that massive spending will further spur inflation.

The initial infrastructure bill is Biden’s first major bipartisan legislative achievement. The deal was brokered after Biden in March forced through a $1.9 COVID-19 relief bill without Republicans, saying that their counter-proposal was too small.

The Senate-passed bill sets aside $110 billion for roads and bridges, $66 billion for passenger and freight rail, $65 billion for broadband internet, more than $50 billion for water infrastructure, $39 billion for public transit and $25 billion for airports.

It contains some big wins for Democrats who wanted global warming to be addressed, including $7.5 billion to install new electric vehicle charging stations, $5 billion to buy electric and low-emission buses and $2.5 billion for ferries.

The bill would put $73 billion toward “clean energy transmission … including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy,” a recent White House fact sheet said.

Another $21 billion would go toward environmental remediation, “making the largest investment in addressing the legacy pollution that harms the public health of communities and neighborhoods in American history,” the White House said.

The infrastructure bill would add $256 billion to the federal deficit over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But the White House has disputed some estimates and insists the tally doesn’t properly take into account cost savings.

Democrats hope to ram through the larger $3.5 trillion bill next month. It would hike taxes on businesses and higher incomes and is expected to gain no Republican votes. Special budget reconciliation rules allow for passage with a bare majority in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties. Centrist Democrats are likely to demand major changes to that bill.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden said Tuesday that his administration is examining whether he can order universal masking in public schools, overriding Republican governors in states like Florida and Texas.

“I don’t believe that I do [have that power], thus far,” Biden told reporters during an event in the East Room of the White House. “We’re checking that.”

Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended masking for all students, faculty, staff and visitors in K-12 schools due to the spread of the Delta variant.

However, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has dismissed the CDC recommendation. After initially banning school districts from imposing mask mandates and suggesting funding cuts for those that do require masking, the governor suggested Monday that the state could “move to withhold the salary” of local officials who make face coverings mandatory.

DeSantis has insisted that parents should get the final say on whether their kids wear masks in schools, not government or public health officials.

Biden did not mention DeSantis by name Tuesday, but described his actions as “disingenuous.”

“When I suggest that people, in zones where there is a high risk, wear the masks like you all are doing, I’m told that government should get out of the way and not do that, they don’t have the authority to do that,” he mused aloud to reporters. “And I find it interesting that some of the very people who are saying that, who hold government positions, are people who are threatening that if a school teacher asks a student if they’ve been vaccinated, or if a principal says that ‘everyone in my school should wear a mask,’ or the school board votes for it, that governor will nullify that.

“That governor has the authority to say you can’t do that,” Biden added. “I find that totally counter-intuitive and quite frankly, disingenuous.”

The war of words between DeSantis and the White House over mask and vaccine mandates has simmered for more than a week, with Biden telling recalcitrant governors to “get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing” and DeSantis accusing the administration of trying to implement a “biomedical security state.”

Adverse legal advice has not necessarily been an obstacle to the president. Last week, Biden allowed the CDC to implement a new 60-day eviction moratorium in much of the US despite admitting to reporters it was “not likely to pass constitutional muster.”

Meanwhile, former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Monday that his former agency must base their guidance on masking children in school on data and not on their opinion.

“There’s a variety of negative public health consequences that happened as a consequence of doing virtual learning. I think it’s imperative that we get the kids back to face-to-face learning and do all we can to keep them there,” Redfield told Fox News, adding: “There’s very few studies that really are compelling [to support masking] in that setting of the classroom.”

“These are critical questions,” Redfield told Fox host Martha MacCallum elsewhere in the interview. “Is routine screening twice a week in a school, is that the way to limit intraschool transmission? Is it wearing masks or not wearing masks? I’m of the point of view this has to be locally decided as opposed to a general mandate, particularly in the absence of data.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ohio Republican Senate candidate JD Vance scored a major endorsement this week as Rep. Jim Banks, the head of the Republican Study Committee, committed to back his run.

Banks (R-IN) told Axios that Vance “isn’t afraid to stand up to the woke elites and will always put middle- and working-class Ohioans first” — further praising the candidate for standing up to “big tech.”

The Republican Study Committee, led by Banks, is the largest group of GOP members in the House.

Vance is locked in a primary battle with several other candidates including State Treasurer Josh Mandel, who currently leads in the polling, and Ohio GOP Party Chair Jane Timken.

All of the major candidates for the seat are vying for the endorsement of Donald Trump, who back in March, before Vance announced his candidacy, sat down with both Mandel and Timken.

Vance, a venture capitalist, was initially opposed to the presidency of Donald Trump, but like many Republicans he has since come around, saying “I’ve been very open that I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy.”

Internal polling reviewed by Axios shows that the author of the bestselling book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” and first time political candidate is rising in popularity. Back in June he netted a meager 4 percent, but that is now up to 12 percent putting him in second place behind Mandel with 21 percent.

The Banks endorsement comes on the heels of the up and coming congressman being rejected, along with Rep. Jim Jordan, by Speaker Nancy Pelosi for membership on the select committee investigating the Capitol Riot.

In response to the blockage of two of his five picks for the committee, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all of his selections, leaving a committee comprised of only members chosen by Democrat Pelosi.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Health officials in Austin issued an emergency alert over the weekend that the COVID-19 situation in the city was “severely worsening” and has reached a “critical” point.

The “Warn Central Texas” alert system was designed for use during a disaster, which health officials say the city is experiencing.

The alert was distributed on Saturday by text, phone calls and email to residents in Austin and nearby areas of Travis County.

“Our hospitals are severely stressed and there is little we can do to alleviate their burden with the surging cases,” Austin-Travis County Health Authority’s Desmar Walkes said in a statement. “The public has to act now and help or we will face a catastrophe in our community that could have been avoided.”

Walkes explained that hospital bed availability and critical care are extremely limited for anyone – not just COVID-19 victims.

Austin and the surrounding county elevated the COVID-19 risk level to stage 5, which is the highest level of alert.

According to the Texas Department of Health, there are over 3,400 active cases of COVID-19 in Travis County.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statewide ban on mask and vaccine mandates on July 29, saying “the path forward relies on personal responsibility,” Axios reported.

The state has achieved a 44.5% rate of full vaccinations, according to Our World in Data.

Officials urged residents to stay informed on COVID-19, vaccinations and testing by visiting http://www.AustinTexas.gov/COVID19 or calling 3-1-1 (512-974-2000).
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A hospital system in Texas is gearing up with tents for a potential overflow of patients as the latest uptick in COVID-19 cases — driven by the highly contagious Delta variant — pushes its hospitals to capacity.

Harris Health System in Houston set up the tents at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, where 100 percent of its intensive care units are full with mostly COVID-19 patients, CNN reported.

“There is no pre-determined time for when they will begin to be used, but they want the tented environment to be ready to go in the event they are needed,” Harris Health spokesperson Bryan McLeod told the outlet.

The arrival of the tents came after the healthcare system’s two hospitals saw a sharp increase in new patients being admitted for the virus.

The Delta strain of the virus, which first emerged in India in December, now accounts for around 73 percent of new cases in the Lone Star State, according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention figures.

“What is intriguing about this surge is not so much the magnitude of the numbers, but the speed at which the numbers are going up,” President and CEO Esmaeil Porsa told CNN.

“It took us five weeks to get from one (patient) to 120. When I look at the last surge, it took us three months — the rapid rise in the amount of Covid patients is very concerning.”

Currently, there are about 122 patients being treated for the virus at its two hospitals, Porsa said.

The second, Ben Taub Hospital, is currently at 95 percent capacity in its intensive care unit, where 27 percent of patients have tested positive for the virus, CNN reported.

“The situation is bad and only getting worse. We are not heading towards a crisis, we are in the middle of a crisis,” Porsa said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday called for out-of-state help to fight the third wave of cases.

He directed health officials to use staffing agencies to find additional medical staff from beyond state borders.

Around 87.1 percent of all hospital beds in the state are currently in use — the highest level since the start of the pandemic, the Texas Tribune reported.

“Everybody who’s unvaccinated needs to get a vaccine,” Dr. David Callender, president and CEO of Memorial Hermann Health System, told the newspaper.

Hospitalizations and deaths are very rare among vaccinated Americans, CDC data shows.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Las Vegas “mother” who claimed she was facing eviction — prompting donors to pony up more than $200,000 — is just the babysitter of the three kids she identified as her children in a CNN report.

Dasha Kelly, 32, ended up copping to CNN on Monday that she’s not the biological mother of the girls, ages 5, 6 and 8, who were featured alongside her in a segment last week on the federal eviction moratorium that had ended days earlier.

CNN said Kelly’s story “generated a lot of interest” after its initial report, which featured video footage of her and the girls inside her home after the network found her online fundraiser seeking $1,900 to pay back rent.

“My name is Kelly and I have 3 daughters in Nevada,” her plea read. “We were maintaining just before this pandemic hit. Now we are suffering … Please help with anything you can.”

The three young girls referred to Kelly as their mom during CNN’s visit, but another woman, Shadia Halo, later identified herself as their biological mother, reporter Nick Watt said.

“And yes, Shadia Halo is their mother,” Watt said. “We have seen the birth certificates. And now we know that Dasha Kelly is dating the girls’ father.”

Kelly spends a “significant” amount of time caring for the three girls at her apartment, where Halo said she had dropped them off for a week, CNN reported.

Kelly said she described herself as the girls’ mother because she considered herself to be a maternal figure to them. Halo was “understandably upset” by that claim, according to CNN’s report.

An emotional Kelly appeared on CNN a second time last week alongside Missouri Rep. Cori Bush after the Biden administration announced a new 60-day eviction moratorium in counties where the transmission of COVID-19 is either substantial or high.

Kelly ended up copping to CNN that she’s not the biological mother of the girls. CNN

“I’m just so fortunate right now, this is beyond me,” Kelly told Bush. “When I put that up, I never thought that anybody would have reached out, especially CNN, and to hear that a congressperson — my story reached you — this is just amazing.”

Bush told Kelly that she and her family deserved to have lawmakers working for them.

“And so this is the least that we can do for you — is to step up and make sure that you get to stay in the safety and the comfort of your home while we work on other things to help make sure that your life and the lives of your children are better,” the Missouri Democrat told Kelly. “This is the least we can do for you.”

Kelly’s fundraiser had garnered more than $212,000 as of Tuesday. Her GoFundMe page has now clarified that the three girls recognize her as a “mother figure” and that the former casino card dealer loves them unconditionally.

A rep for GoFundMe told the network that the funds raised by Kelly will remain on hold until her information is verified and that no amount had been withdrawn.

Anyone who donated to Kelly can request a refund through Aug. 23, the spokeswoman said.

The girls’ father is Kelly’s boyfriend, whom she does not live with, the website said.

“I take care of these girls in my home for periods of time, and have for the last couple years,” Kelly wrote. “I’ve loved these girls unconditionally, and have been out of the kindness of my heart. I treat them as my daughters, and care for them in this way.”

The girls will be returning to Halo’s home for the start of the school year, CNN reported.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tiger Woods’ former mistress Rachel Uchitel claims the golf star’s lawyers want to go after her for violating an $8 million non-disclosure agreement by speaking out about their affair.

The former nightclub hostess, 46, revealed that she had signed the more than 30-page NDA in 2009 shortly after she was outed for having an affair with the then-married athlete, the New York Times reported.

“His lawyers are saying, ‘We want all your text messages and here’s the price,’ and you’re like ‘Screw you’ and you move into deal-maker mode and all of a sudden, it’s the rest of your life,” Uchitel told the newspaper.

The agreement forbade her from “directly or indirectly, verbally or otherwise” discussing the golfer’s “lifestyle, proclivities, customs, private conduct, fitness, habits, sexual matters, familial matters,” among other topics, with anyone, “including but not limited to, family members, relatives, acquaintances, friends, associates, co-workers, journalists,” the outlet reported.

In return for her silence, she was given $5 million and a promise of an additional $3 million over the next three years, Uchitel said.

But in the end, Uchitel claimed that she only pocketed $2 million of the original $5 million following taxes and lawyer fees.

When it came time for the additional payouts, Uchitel said Woods’ team never followed through.

What she believes was behind the nonpayments was that she appeared on “Celebrity Rehab” to address her supposed issues with male attention, the newspaper reported.

She claimed she was called into arbitration by Woods’ legal team, who allegedly demanded their $5 million settlement back from her.

More than a decade after the affair, Uchitel says her relationship with Woods is still impacting her finances, career, mental health and love life.

She decided to speak out after producers approached her to appear in HBO’s documentary, “Tiger,” in 2019.

“I’ve had it with NDAs,” Uchitel said.

“Ten years later, people were still talking about me as a player in a story I had never talked about. I felt like it was time to take the reins,” she added.

She filed soon after for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and was granted protection from creditors early this year, the newspaper reported.

But after the documentary was released, she was contacted by one of Woods’ lawyers, Michael Holtz.

“’If you get a job, I’ll come after your wages. If you get married, I’ll go after your joint bank account. I will come after you for the rest of your life,’” she said he told her.

Holtz, who argued that he wasn’t properly notified about her bankruptcy cases, is now challenging her protection from creditors — a move that Uchitel claims is so that he can bring a claim against her on his client’s behalf for violating the NDA, the newspaper reported.

She asked criminal lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman, who has represented clients such as El Chapo, for help earlier this year and he agreed to contact Holtz on her behalf, the outlet reported.

“I felt badly for her,” Lichtman told the newspaper. “She had a consensual relationship with Woods, no more her fault than his, but after it was over, he was able to move on with his golf career, while she was stuck with the stigma of being the other woman.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Country singer Clare Dunn has tearfully revealed how a rideshare driver yanked her from the car and violently threw her face-first into the ground — with the driver busted early Tuesday, online records show.

“This has been hell,” the “Get Out” singer tearfully told People magazine, sharing a photo of her bloodied and bruised face from the June 26 attack in Tennessee.

The Colorado-based star had been recording in Nashville when she and a friend shared a Lyft home from a girls’ night out, with the pal dropped off first, Dunn said.

The driver then got increasingly agitated as the 34-year-old singer asked him to take a slower route avoiding highways, and then pointed out that he had missed her turn, she recalled to People.

“He was screaming at me,” Dunn recalled.

“And I just knew in that moment that I wasn’t going to get on that interstate with him. I wasn’t going to go quietly where he wanted to take me. And I think he realized maybe this girl was going to be more trouble than she’s worth,” she said.

The driver then pulled over less than a mile from her house, she said.

The driver became angry with Dunn after she alerted him that he missed her street. Instagram

“Before I could even get my shoes off or get my phone to try and call 911, he grabbed me by the collar, ripped me out of the backseat and slammed me face-first down into a ditch,” she told People.

“Somehow in the scuffle, I thought I called 911, but I didn’t even get the number right. But it was a miracle. They called me back.

“And when I came to, I was screaming, and I saw headlights. He ended up just leaving me alone at that point and took off,” she said, recalling how she ran home with blood on her bruised face.

“He knew what he was doing,” she said of the accused driver.

“He hit ‘complete the ride’ after it was done,” she said, saying that doing so removes key information about the driver from the passenger’s app.

The singer said she and her friend later admitted to each other that they felt “alarm bells” about the driver and are tormented at having ignored them.

“I had that intuition that something was wrong, and I ignored it,” Dunn said, saying she assumed she was “overthinking it.”

“I blame myself,” she said, crying.

Nashville Metro police on Monday put out an alert for suspect Albert Boakye, 46, and he was booked into Metro jail at 12:46 a.m. Tuesday, online records show. He was released just after 4 a.m., with no details immediately available about possible bonds.

Dunn was reportedly slammed face-first into a ditch. Instagram

He had been on a warrant for misdemeanor assault after Dunn provided a photo of him along with her trip information from the Lyft app, police told WKRN.

Lyft told People mag it had reached out to the singer and also helped police with the investigation.

“Safety is fundamental to Lyft. The behavior described is appalling, and we permanently removed the driver from the Lyft platform as soon as we learned of this incident,” a spokesperson told the mag.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kevin Nealon isn’t worried about getting canceled.

“I’m pretty woke on all that stuff,” the “Saturday Night Live” alum told Page Six. “I have a 14-year-old [son Gabe with wife Susan Yeagley]. In school, they really teach them well. So anytime I start going astray he says, ‘No, you’re kind of going in the wrong direction.'”

But the 67-year-old comedian allows that he’s never been one to push the envelope in his act.

“I wouldn’t want to offend anybody or insult anybody … My act has always been very appropriate,” he explained.

“I’ve never been a risk-taker as far as that was concerned. I’ve never been one of those edgy, ranting comics who just seemingly say what’s on their mind and sometimes get into trouble.”

Nealon began his career in stand-up, joined “SNL” in 1987 and stayed on for a then-record-breaking nine seasons, playing characters like Mr. Subliminal, the politically incorrect private investigator Frank Gannon and, of course, Franz (of weightlifting duo Hans and Franz) alongside Dana Carvey.

Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey as “Hans and Franz” on “Saturday Night Live.”

“It was striking gold just to be on that show because I was more of a stand-up than an actor or a sketch player,” he said adding that his favorite thing about being part of “SNL” was working with musical idols like Paul McCartney and James Taylor, who would sometimes stay and play a private mini-concert.

Since leaving “SNL,” Nealon has carved out a steady career in shows like “Weeds,” “Last Man Standing,” and a string of Adam Sandler movies. And in between stand-up appearance, he updates his YouTube series, “Hiking with Kevin,” in which he goes on hikes with various celebs.

The Connecticut-raised star is currently in the midst of a stand-up tour and says that audiences have been great.

“I was thinking that maybe I got funnier,” he quipped, “but I think people are happy to be out there and more grateful — they appreciate what they have now. They want to enjoy life again.”

Nealon is a talented caricaturist. Instagram

If he decides to quit stand-up, Nealon could very well become a professional artist. He often features his incredible caricatures on social media, explaining that he took a ten-class course via Skype during the COVID-19 lockdown.

His visual prowess spans multiple mediums as well: Nealon has another Instagram solely dedicated to his photos of his wife, “Parks and Rec” alum Susan Yeagley, at different locales throughout the U.S.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize third shots of the COVID-19 vaccines for people with compromised immune systems this week, reports said.

The move would come amid a surge in cases due to the more contagious Delta variant.

The FDA will amend the emergency use authorizations for the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines – but not the one-and-done Johnson & Johnson vaccine, NBC News reported, citing sources.

An announcement is expected Thursday, NBC said, although other outlets said that it could come Friday or later.

An FDA spokeswoman told The Post the agency was “evaluating potential options” and would share information in the near future.

“The FDA is closely monitoring data as it becomes available from studies administering an additional dose of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines to immunocompromised individuals,” the spokeswoman said.

If the emergency use order is amended, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would then offer medical guidance. A CDC group will meet Friday to discuss extra doses, CNN reported.

The pending move by the FDA has been expected for some time, as experts say boosters can help people who may not have as strong an immune response to the vaccines.

Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that extra shots would be OK’d for vulnerable groups “as soon as the data gets to us.”

“There’s no doubt that over time, you’re going to have an attenuation of protection,” Fauci said of boosters.

Those with weakened immune systems are 485 times more likely to die or be hospitalized, CNN stated, citing Johns Hopkins research estimates.

About 2.7 percent of the country’s adult population is immunocompromised, according to CDC data.

All three of the vaccines remain under an emergency order, but the FDA is likely to decide whether to grant full approval of the Pfizer vaccine in the coming weeks.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A newborn baby was found tucked into a discarded dresser drawer in a Chicago alley Tuesday morning, police said.

A woman found the days-old baby boy alive on North Oak Park Avenue at about 8:13 a.m. — hours before the piece of furniture and other trash would’ve been picked up by garbage trucks and taken to a landfill, reports said.

The unidentified woman claimed she was driving by and stopped to recycle the handles on the dresser drawers, but found the baby wrapped in rosary beads with a bit of vomit in his mouth, ABC 7 Chicago reported.

She rendered aid until help arrived, the woman said.

“I put my finger on the little foot, to just to see he was moving,” the woman said, according to NBC Chicago.

“Every time I think about the details, it just makes me sad,” she reportedly said. “So I’m just gonna focus on the miracle I was there, and that everybody showed up on time because I was shaking.”

The child was transported to Lurie’s Children’s Hospital in good condition, Chicago police said in a statement provided to The Post.

The Chicago Bureau of Detectives released a picture of the baby and asked for information from the public about the seemingly abandoned child.

Residents were dismayed about the newborn being left because of Illinois’ Safe Haven laws, which would have allowed a parent to drop the child at a location like a police station or hospital so long as he or she is uninjured and not yet 30 days old, ABC reported.

“You got a hospital right here across the street, you got the fire department that’s right around the corner from here,” neighbor Carlos Bracero told the station. “There’s just a lot of options out there.”

Resident Candy Pittner said she was “out of words.”

“She could have even rang my doorbell — I would have taken the baby — and left,” Pittner said. “Anything but leaving it in that drawer in a chest or drawer in the heat.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The spokesman for far-left Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) accused a pro-Israel lobbying group Wednesday of putting the congresswoman’s “life at risk” by going up with an attack ad referencing comments she made in June equating America and Israel with Hamas and the Taliban.

The Facebook ad from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) features a black-and-white image of Omar accompanied by text reading: “For Ilhan Omar, there is no difference between America and the Taliban. Between Israel and Hamas. Between democracies and terrorists.” The ad is captioned: “Stand WITH America. Stand AGAINST Terrorists.”

According to Omar’s communications director, Jeremy Slevin, the language in the AIPAC ad “is virtually identical to the language used in death threats she gets.”

Make no mistake,” Slevin tweeted. “AIPAC is putting Rep. Omar’s life at risk with repeated Islamophobic attack ads.” His post included screenshots of the ad alongside an Omar tweet accompanied by audio of a purported death threat she received in June.

“It shouldn’t have to be stated,” Slevin added in a subsequent tweet, “but baselessly linking Muslim-Americans to terrorism is the textbook example of Islamophobia and is routinely used to silence advocacy for Palestinian human rights.”

On June 7, Omar tweeted video of an exchange between her and Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. She captioned the video: “We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity. We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the US, Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban. I asked @SecBlinken where people are supposed to go for justice.”

The message caused an uproar both on social media and among members of Congress. After a dozen Jewish House Democrats urged Omar to “clarify” her statement, Omar accused them of using “islamophobic tropes.” In a subsequent statement, Omar claimed she “was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems.” Despite walking back her statement, Omar told CNN in a late June interview she did not regret making the initial comment.

In the same interview, Omar claimed that colleagues who criticized her remarks “haven’t been partners in justice. They haven’t been, you know, equally engaging in seeking justice around the world.”

AIPAC fired back at Slevin on Twitter Wednesday, writing: “Your baseless attack on us can’t deflect from @Ilhan ‘s attack on America and Israel.

“It is outrageous for Rep. Omar to put the U.S. and Israel on the same level as the Taliban and Hamas,” the AIPAC tweet added. “There is no moral equivalence between democratic allies and the terrorists who target them.”

The lobby then turned its focus to Omar’s fellow “Squad” member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who had tweeted, “I’m so sick of this s–t” in response to Slevin.

“So are we, Congresswoman,” AIPAC said. “Inciting hate by demonizing Israel and spreading vicious, dangerous lies about our democratic ally Israel doesn’t advance the prospects for peace.”

Omar has repeatedly been accused of making anti-Semitic statements. In 2019, she tweeted that the relationship between the United States and Israel is “all about the Benjamins.”

When Batya Ungar-Sargon, the opinion editor of The Forward newspaper, said, “Would love to know who @IlhanMN thinks is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel,” Omar replied, “AIPAC.”

Omar deleted the tweet and offered an apology, as well as thanks to her colleagues “who are educating me on the powerful history of anti-Semitic tropes.”

“It is no longer possible to hope that the woman will be found alive,” wildlife inspector Andrei Sakulin told the outlet.

There were footprints of a mother bear and cubs, which meant the spot was “very dangerous for humans,” he reportedly said.

Matthew Taylor Coleman, 40, made the statements to federal investigators after being arrested at the border in the wake of Monday’s double filicide, court documents show.

Coleman was reported missing by his wife on Aug. 7 after he left his Santa Barbara home with his 10-month-old daughter and 2-year-old son without a car seat for the infant and took them to Rosarito, according to the documents.

He allegedly shot them dead through their chests with the spear gun and was arrested by Customs and Border Patrol as he tried to re-enter the US alone two days later, an FBI affidavit said.

The border cops “observed what appeared to be blood” on paperwork in his vehicle, and Mexican police found the bodies of young victims matching the description of Coleman’s kids in a ditch, according to the document.

Danbury police said officers responded to a report of shots fired near the Macy’s store at the Danbury Fair Mall shortly after 7 p.m. and found the girl conscious and alert.

She was transported to Danbury Hospital, where her condition is unknown. Her identity has not been revealed.

Danbury Police Chief Patrick Ridenhour told reporters the shooting stemmed from a confrontation between two groups of people and the victim was not the intended target.

The chief also said that the suspect’s group had left the building and police were examining surveillance video in an effort to identify them.

Tyreef Mahboob told Fox61 that he had just entered the mall when he heard “a loud popping noise.

“So my head, right away I just jumped up and was like, ‘What the heck was that?’ Somebody either dropped something, or that was a gunshot,” he said.

“I hesitated for a while, and then I just see people frantically running towards me,” Mahboob added. “So I started to back up and saw like a 16-year-old girl running past me, crying, saying her friend just got shot. Then I saw more and more people running and seeing that it’s the pandemic, people have masks on, so I didn’t know who was the shooter, so I turned around and ran out of there as well.”

Police said they believe the shooting was an isolated incident, but added that an investigation is ongoing, assisted by the Connecticut State Police and other local departments.

Ridenhour said late Wednesday police were investigating whether a white male seen running with a hammer was the shooter’s intended target.

An Ohio woman married a man convicted of killing her half-brother in the 1980s, with the couple exchanging vows while he’s on house arrest awaiting a retrial, reports said.

Crystal Straus and John Tiedjen began their strange courtship when she wrote him a letter saying she forgave him for killing Brian McGary in 1987.

“And I wrote her a letter back and I said I didn’t do it, take a look at this stuff,” Tiedjen, 57, told News 5 Cleveland. “I believe in God too, and I know things about it, but I didn’t do it.”

Tiedjen got out of prison July 22 after he was granted a new trial based on a slew of images and missing police reports, Boston 25 reported.

It’s no given that he’ll be found not guilty the second time around.

“We’ll get through this,” Straus said, according to News 5. “It’s going to be a challenge, there’s no doubt about it.”

The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office thinks it still has a solid case, telling News 5 it has evidence that Tiedjen asked a friend to dispose of the gun that killed McGary. Tiedjen’s attorneys have argued that evidence points to McGary having committed suicide.

McGary, who was Tiedjen’s roommate, was found dead in their apartment with a stab wound and a fatal gunshot wound to the head, reports said. After intense interrogation, Tiedjen signed a statement that said he shot his roomie in self-defense, Boston 25 stated.

Tiedjen popped the question to Straus on the phone on New Year’s 2020, when they weren’t sure he’d ever get out of prison, the Washington Post reported.

“It’s definitely not a fairy tale,” Kendall Corral said of the romance, according to the Post. “But it’s so genuine.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A federal judge in Washington, DC ruled Wednesday that House Democrats are entitled to some of former President Donald Trump’s financial records, though fewer filings than they had sought before the 45th president left the White House.

The decision by US District Judge Amit Mehta was the latest turn in a case that has already seen the Supreme Court intervene once — and the high court may do so again.

Democratic members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee initially subpoenaed Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, in April 2019 for records dating back to 2011. The then-president challenged the subpoena in court and lost twice before the Supreme Court ruled in July of 2020 that the lower courts had not taken into account “special concerns regarding the separation of powers.”

Applying a new analysis set out by the Supreme Court, Mehta ruled that the committee was entitled to information about Trump’s lease agreement with the federal General Services Administration for his Washington, DC hotel. The judge also ordered Mazars to turn over the tax and financial records of Trump and the Trump Organization for 2017 and 2018 to lawmakers.

However, Mehta also ruled the committee was not entitled to other records, saying lawmakers had identified only a “limited need” for them.

“The more Congress can invade the personal sphere of a former President, the greater the leverage Congress would have on a sitting President,” Mehta wrote. “And the greater the leverage, the greater the improper ‘institutional advantage’ Congress would possess over a co-equal branch of government.”

The committee reissued the Mazars subpoena in February of this year after the previous one expired upon the swearing-in of the new Congress in January.

Committee chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), said in a statement that the ruling “recognized that the Oversight Committee is entitled to a broad set of President Trump’s financial records as part of our critical investigation aimed at preventing presidential conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and constitutional violations.”

Maloney added that while it was “disappointing that the Court, despite finding that the entire subpoena served valid legislative purposes, narrowed the subpoena in some respects, the Committee is actively considering next steps.”

Separately, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel said in an opinion last month that the Treasury Department must provide the House Ways and Means Committee with Trump’s tax returns. That opinion said the committee chairman “has invoked sufficient reasons for requesting the former President’s tax information” and that under federal law, “Treasury must furnish the information to the Committee.”

The committee’s hunt for records overlaps with other records that have already been released to investigators. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. in his demand for Trump’s tax records, though the ruling kept the documents out of the public eye. Vance’s office took possession of those records in February.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Suicide Squad” star Joel Kinnaman is under investigation for rape in Sweden — but the actor claims the accusation comes from an obsessed woman seeking revenge over a restraining order.

The public prosecutor announced Wednesday they were investigating the allegation against Kinnaman, TMZ first reported.

But the actor’s legal team told The Post the alleged victim, a Swedish model, only stepped forward with the accusation after Kinnaman had gone to the police himself and gotten the restraining order.

Kinnaman claimed in a recent social media thread that he was being extorted by model Gabriella Magnusson, who goes by the name Bella Davis. On Friday, Kinnaman filed an extortion complaint against her in Sweden and got a restraining order against her in Los Angeles, his attorney Patricia Glaser told The Post.

Klinnaman claimed on social media that he was being extorted by Gabriella Magnusson. Instagram

“It appears that after learning of the restraining order, she filed her complaint,” Glaser said.

“The court papers that Mr. Kinnaman filed stated, among other things, that Ms. Davis threatened to publicize false information about Mr. Kinnaman – including that he had sex with her against her will – unless he capitulated to her monetary and other demands, which included Hollywood introductions, a work visa sponsorship, a blue verification checkmark on Instagram, and more.”

The actor will be cooperating with police “to clear his name,” Glaser added.

A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office told E! News on Wednesday that the probe had just started.

“The prosecutor got the case today and has hardly been able to look at it,” the spokesperson said.

After the temporary restraining order, Davis told E! News that she never threatened Kinnaman or asked him for money. The actor “should have an Oscar for how he’s writing and acting,” she said, according to the outlet.

Kinnaman, 41, had taken to Instagram last Friday saying the model became obsessive after a consensual sexual relationship and was trying to extort him for money and things like a Sports Illustrated photo shoot.

The two met up and had sex in November 2018, when Kinnaman was single, he wrote. A month later, they met and had sex again but didn’t spend the night together because he had work early the next day, he claimed.

“The next day she texted me that she was bothered that I had not asked her to spend the night and that I did not check with her to make sure she made it home safely,” he wrote.

Davis contacted him again in 2019 and 2020 asking to meet up, but he was in a relationship so he didn’t respond, he added. After “increasingly obsessive communication” he tried to cut it off, according to the actor’s post.

“But Bella continued to try to communicate with me – texting and calling from other people’s phones – and these communications became more and more antagonistic, threatening, and frightening over time,” he wrote.

She then threatened to go public to say he “had sex with her against her will,” the actor claimed.

On July 25, he claims they had a lengthy conversation that he recorded.

“At one point, she stated, ‘Do you know how much money I would get and how famous I would be if I went to the press?” he stated.

“She also made threats of physical violence against me and my family by herself and others, including her brother, a convicted felon, who pointed a rifle at my manager,” he added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.

Imitation isn’t always the sincerest form of flattery — at least when it comes to the morning TV wars.

After news broke on Wednesday that “CBS This Morning” was replacing veteran journalist Anthony Mason with former football star and “Extra” correspondent Nate Burleson, several industry insiders told us the network is admitting they’re in trouble by copying rival “Good Morning America.”

And it doesn’t help that the CBS show also announced in May it’ll be filming from a new studio directly across the street from “GMA” in Times Square.

”They’re basically copying ‘GMA.’ They’re moving to Times Square, hiring a [Michael] Strahan. What’s next? Cooking segments? They’re clearly in trouble,” one industry source sniped.

Meanwhile, another source told us that “GMA” staffers are “all shook over why CBS is copying them. It’s all the talk this morning at ABC,” they said.

The move comes as ratings for NBC’s “Today” — once the top of the morning show heap — continue to lose ground to “GMA.” This season-to-date, “GMA” is reportedly the most-watched morning show for the 9th consecutive year, and has this year increased its lead over “Today” to its biggest in four years. (Though “Today” did add viewers during its Olympics broadcasts.)

“CBS This Morning” remains at the bottom.

An ABC insider admitted there was buzz around the news, but “‘shook’ is not the way to describe it,” the source said. “Look at the numbers. Do you think ‘GMA’ would be threatened by CBS?”

CBS’ Strahan-like hire is “taking a page from the playbook. It’s an interesting move for them,” they added.

Another person from a competing network scoffed, “This is the same show [that] put out a statement about not wanting to [have anchors] dress up for Halloween! They planted a stake on Halloween as opposed to having fun, and now a football player is at the table? ‘Real Sports’ wasn’t hiring? It’s insulting to journalists.”

Burleson’s hire comes after former president of ABC-owned television stations Wendy McMahon fled the network to become president and co-head of CBS News and TV stations earlier this year.

“It’s interesting that they’ve put an ABC person in place over there, and she’s running the show. I commend them for recognizing a winning playbook and stealing it, but it could be a recipe for disaster,” the ABC source said.

Another source familiar with Burleson’s hire told us “they were grooming him” to take over after he filled in while co-anchor Tony Dokoupil was away on paternity leave. “Hollywood and this business only find value in former NFL players right now. It’s the Strahan effect. It’s not even a subtle trend,” they said.

In addition to co-anchoring “CBS This Morning,” Burleson’s overall deal will include a role as an analyst at CBS Sports’ “The NFL Today” and regular appearances on Nickelodeon, according to Variety. He’ll join Gayle King and Dokoupil at the table in September.

Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations, described Burleson as the “perfect fit for mornings on CBS” in a press release.

“There is no doubt that Nate’s experiences and broader interests in news, sports and entertainment will be an exciting addition to the table with Gayle and Tony as we continue to evolve the format of the broadcast to double down on news, original reporting, great storytelling and a broad range of feature pieces that appeal to viewers across the country,” he said in an internal memo.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Wuhan lab that was quietly moved by Chinese officials in December 2019 — drawing scrutiny from a World Health Organization scientist — operated under a mild safety level protocol where workers weren’t necessarily required to wear masks, officials said in reports.

At least one employee of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention facility — different than the city’s much-discussed Wuhan Institute of Virology — tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies due to “a family cluster transmission,” though it’s unclear when the tests were conducted, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a World Health Organization report.

The lab, where Chinese scientists research mild human diseases with bats, was moved near the seafood market where the first COVID-19 cases were found just days before the outbreak, WHO investigators said.

Classified with a “Biosafety Level of 2,” the lab also has ventilation controls that aren’t as strict as other more secure facilities, according to the report.

The revelation comes as Dr. Ben Embarek, the Danish head of a WHO-led team of investigators that probe the viruses’ origins, said in an interview this week that more information is needed about the lab’s move.

“It’s interesting that the lab relocated on the 2nd of December 2019: That’s the period where it all started,” Embarek, a food safety and animal diseases expert, said in a documentary that aired on the Danish television channel TV2.

“We know that when you move a lab, it disturbs everything…That entire procedure is always a disruptive element in the daily work routine of a lab,” he said.

Despite his previous assertion that it’s “extremely unlikely” the virus leaked from a lab in China, he now considers the theory a “probable hypothesis,” he said in the interview.

His team’s findings note that the Wuhan CDC moved the facility just days before the onset of the first known case of COVID-19 on Dec. 8, 2019 — and that such relocations “can be disruptive for the operations of any laboratory.”

But it also noted that the lab reported “no disruptions or incidents” due to the move.

In the documentary, Embarek also revealed that his team was pressured by Chinese officials not to pursue the lab leak theory.

They may have steered WHO scientists away from probing the theory because there was “human error behind such an incident” and a feeling among the Chinese that “you should not lose face,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two St. Louis deputies were dismissed last month for working on progressive Rep. Cori Bush’s security detail without permission — days before the “Squad” member defended spending tens of thousands of campaign dollars on private protection while pushing to “defund the police.”

St. Louis Sheriff Vernon Betts told KMOV that he initially warned now-former deputies Tylance Jackson and Maurice Thompson to quit moonlighting as muscle for Bush (D-Mo.) and fill out the proper forms after they accompanied her on a tour of St. Louis jails in April. However, Betts said he was told by Veterans Affairs Police several weeks later that Jackson and Thompson were providing security for Bush again.

In addition to violating policy by not getting approval to work a secondary shift, neither Jackson nor Thompson have licenses to work private security, Betts told KMOV.

Jackson claimed Thursday that he and Thompson were dismissed because they “didn’t push the agenda of the sheriff on the client [Bush].”

“I do feel that the hand that was dealt to us was unfair and unjust,” Jackson told KMOV. “You let us go, but you still have a plethora of individuals doing that but you don’t say anything.”

Betts, a Democrat who was elected to a second four-year term as city sheriff last year, insisted to the Associated Press that the deputies were not fired because of who they were guarding.

“I didn’t fire them for working security for Cori Bush,” Betts said in a phone interview. “I fired them for not following proper procedures for working secondary. So they just happened to be working for Cori Bush. Doing what they did, they would have gotten fired no matter who they were working for.”

The sheriff added that of his 160 deputies, an estimated 150 work at other jobs — with permission.

Bush, who helped lead Black Lives Matter protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson following the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown, has spent at least $70,000 in campaign funds on private security since taking office.

In an interview with CBS Aug. 5, Bush insisted she needed special protection because “I have had attempts on my life and I have too much work to do, there are too many people that need help right now, for me to allow that.

“So if I end up spending $200,000, if I spend 10 more dollars on it, you know what? I get to be here to do the work,” Bush added. “So suck it up.”

In a dramatic pivot, Bush then insisted: “And defunding the police has to happen. We need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets because we’re trying to save lives.”

Critics were quick to call out Bush for her hypocrisy in demanding protection for herself while advocating for the removal of police from neighborhoods across America.

A spokeswoman for Bush’s campaign office declined comment on the firings, saying in an email that personnel matters “are handled by the specific firms retained.”

The email reiterated that Bush uses hired security due to a “non-stop barrage of death threats and targeted harassment.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden said the U.S. is working to help Haiti as it deals with the destruction and tragedy of Saturday’s massive earthquake.

A 7.2 magnitude quake shook the impoverished island nation around 8:30 a.m., collapsing buildings and killing hundreds just weeks after the president was assassinated.

“In what is already a challenging time for the people of Haiti, I am saddened by the devastating earthquake that occurred in Saint-Louis du Sud, Haiti this morning,” Biden’s statement said, offering condolences to victims.

Biden said he named Samantha Power, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, as the senior official to coordinate an “immediate” U.S. response.

The agency will help in the efforts to assess damage and assist efforts to recover the injured and those who must now rebuild, the president said. “The United States remains a close and enduring friend to the people of Haiti, and we will be there in the aftermath of this tragedy.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.

The Biden administration is offering cash to Florida school districts that defy Gov. Ron DeSantis’ mask ban as COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations rose in the state.

Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Friday sent a letter to DeSantis and the Florida education commissioner saying school districts can at their “sole and complete discretion” use federal funds to pay the salaries of administrators and board members withheld by the state for defying the order.

“We are eager to partner with [the Florida Department of Education] on any efforts to further our shared goals of protecting the health and safety of students and educators,” Cardona wrote.

“If FLDOE does not wish to pursue such an approach, the Department will continue to work directly with the school districts and educators that serve Florida’s students.”

A DeSantis spokeswoman blasted the Biden administration for wanting to spend federal funds “on the salaries of superintendents and elected politicians, who don’t believe that parents have a right to choose what’s best for their children, than on Florida’s students, which is what these funds should be used for.”

The Republican governor last month signed an executive order banning school districts from making face masks mandatory for students and staff defending “parents’ freedom to choose.” The order came days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended all students and staff wear masks when they return this fall.

On Monday, the governor’s office threatened to withhold the salaries of school board members and superintendents who did not comply with the ban. DeSantis has also threatened to withhold state funding from districts as well.

But Cardona said that local school leaders should be allowed to make their own mask rules.

“Any threat by Florida to withhold salaries from superintendents and school board members who are working to protect students and educators (or to levy other financial penalties) can be addressed using Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief [ESSER] funds at the sole and complete discretion of Florida school districts,” Cardona wrote.

Florida received over $7 billion in support funds as part of the American Relief Plan, 90 percent of which is designated for ESSR funding, according to Politico. Cordona accused the school of not delivering school districts that funding by May 24 when it should have.

“In fact, it appears that Florida has prioritized threatening to withhold State funds from school districts that are working to reopen schools safely rather than protecting students and educators and getting school districts the Federal pandemic recovery funds to which they are entitled,” he wrote.

President Biden has been feuding with DeSantis over the mask mandate ban — and recently personally personally called school districts who have stood up to the order, according to the Miami Herald.

He told one, Broward County, stands ready to support their school districts and communities to get back to safe, full-time, in-person learning,” the Herald reported.

Four Broward County district teachers died of COVID-19 within the span of 24 hours this week, Broward Teachers Union President Anna Fusco told CBS News.

Broward and Alachua County are only two of the state’s 67 districts that have adopted mask mandates.

Cardona added that he is “deeply concerned” about the governor’s executive order as the state’s coronavirus outbreak seems to be taking a turn for the worse.

Florida health officials said Friday that the number of deaths from COVID-19 jumped significantly to 1,000 this week, from the 600 reported the previous week, raising the state’s death toll to 40,766.

Hospitalizations rose slightly on Friday from 15,358 to 15,441 patients, including about 3,200 who are in intensive care units.

The Sunshine State is now averaging 21,680 cases per day over the last week, officials said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The death toll from Saturday’s earthquake in Haiti soared to at least 1,297 on Sunday — as the struggling nation prepared to get hammered yet again by Mother Nature with Tropical Storm Grace.

The country — still also reeling from the assassination of its prime minister, Jovenel Moïse, in July — reported more than 7,000 homes destroyed and nearly 5,000 structures damaged in the quake — including hospitals, schools and churches.

Now the National Hurricane Center is predicting 4 to 8 inches of rain in Haiti on Monday, adding the threat of floods and landslides to the battered island nation.

The country’s skyrocketing death toll from its 7.2 magnitude weekend temblor came hours after hospitals in Les Cayes, the island’s southwestern port city, reported that they were already “overwhelmed” with injured patients.

Officials said at least 5,700 people were hurt in the powerful quake in the Caribbean nation.

The hospitals, also drowning in COVID-19 patients, are in need of “everything,” said Dr. Inobert Pierre, a local pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which operates St. Boniface Hospital about two hours from Les Cayes.

“Many of the patients have open wounds, and they have been exposed to not-so-clean elements,” Pierre said after visiting two hospitals in Les Cayes — one with about 200 patients, the other with around 90. “We anticipate a lot of infections.”

Haiti’s prime minister, Ariel Henry, said Saturday he was sending emergency services to hard-hit Les Cayes to help coordinate the local response there.

Henry has declared a one-month state of emergency for the country but said he will not ask for international help before assessing the extent of the damage.

“We are mobilizing all of our resources to aid the victims,” Henry said in a tweet.

“I send out my sympathies to the relatives of the victims of this violent earthquake which has cost many lives and a great deal of destruction.”

A video posted online Saturday showed dozens of residents of Les Cayes walking through crumbled homes and a hotel, searching through debris and rubble for loved ones.

“The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,” the prime minister said. “We have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people.”

The epicenter of the quake was about 45 miles east of Les Cayes, between the city and Haiti’s capital of Port-au-Prince, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

In 2010, a 7.0 quake hit closer to the capital and caused widespread destruction. Haiti’s government reported over 300,000 deaths, while a U.S. government report estimated the number between 46,000 and 85,000.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden plans to send an additional 1,000 troops to Afghanistan following the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul Sunday, according to reports.

The move to return thousands of American troops to the country brings the total number of US forces there to 6,000, according to NBC News, and comes as the Islamic militant group expands its control in the country, including the seizure of the presidential palace in the capital city.

Biden had initially planned to keep just 1,000 troops in place for the withdrawal — but administration officials quickly judged that total to be insufficient. The additional troops had been headed to Kuwait, CNN reported.

Their primary responsibility will be security at Kabul International Airport — the only way out for Americans and Afghans fleeing the country which is currently in a state of chaos, the outlet said.

Biden has blamed the mayhem unfolding in Afghanistan on former President Trump’s efforts to end the war, which Biden said created a blueprint that put US forces in a difficult spot with an emboldened Taliban challenging the Afghan government.

“When I came to office, I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor — which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019 — that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001,” he said in a statement Saturday.

“I was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan — two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth.”

The chilling footage shows Karimi, the director-general of the state-run Afghan Film, running through the streets of Kabul as Taliban forces took the city — the fear evident in her face.

Karimi also took to Twitter to plead for help.

“Taliban surrounded Kabul,” she wrote. “I went to the bank to get some money, they closed and evacuated. I still cannot believe this happened.

“Please pray for us, I am calling again,” Karimi said. “Hey ppl of this big world, please do not be silent. They are coming to kill us.”

Doordash delivery driver and TikTok user “frenchfrythug” admitted his letter to a non-tipping customer in a video was fake. TikTok

“Amy is real, she’s a real habitual non-tripper, but I did not leave the note at Amy’s thing,” TikTok user @frenchfrythug posted on Saturday — four days after he shared a now-unavailable video claiming to have left the note along with the female customer’s order.

“If you can’t afford to tip then you should go pick it up yourself,” the note said, according to Insider. “Who do you think you are to order food and have someone come and bring it to your door for FREE? FOR FREE?”

“I just drove my personal car to your house to deliver your food for fun? Naw not today… you can right your wrongs below,” it continued, along with the deliveryman’s Venmo account, “@iforgottotip.”

A subsequent video showed @frenchfrythug supposedly distributing the money he said he received from strangers on Venmo to fellow underpaid DoorDashers.

The initial clip ignited a fury of debate over tipping, with commenters insisting they shouldn’t have to pay an additional tip on top of the fees DoorDash already charges.

“So if a person has no car and is hungry they suppose [sic] to starve because they can’t give a tip,” one TikToker posted in the replies to one of @frenchfrythug’s videos.

“Why do you think you are owed anything[?]” another asked. “When you took your job you understood it but nobody owes you anything and the fact that you expect it is even worse.”

“I tip because I want to,” another said, “not because I have to.”

@Frenchfrythug said he was “moving on” in his video revealing the truth about the note.

“I am a troll. I was joking, the internet took it very seriously and that’s okay,” he said. “If you are angry, maybe ask yourself, ‘Why did this video make me so angry?’ — because at the end of the day, it ain’t real.”

He told Insider he usually declines orders that don’t tip, but opted to deliver this one to teach a “lesson for everyone.”

“I didn’t realize these many people support not tipping drivers,” he told the site.
