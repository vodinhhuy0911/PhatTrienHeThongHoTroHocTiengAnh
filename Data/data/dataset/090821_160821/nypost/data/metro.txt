The aide who has lodged the most serious accusations against Gov. Andrew Cuomo went public in a new interview, claiming he groped and hugged her for “personal sexual satisfaction” — and turned her “dream job … into a nightmare.”

Brittany Commisso, previously known only as “Executive Assistant #1,” tearfully detailed what she called unwanted touching during creepy encounters with Cuomo, for whom she started working in 2017.

“These were not hugs he would give his mother or his brother. These are hugs with the intention of getting some personal sexual satisfaction out of it,” Commisso, 32, said on “CBS This Morning” in an interview that aired Monday.

“And then, they started to be hugs, with kisses on the cheek. And then there was at one point, a hug and when he went to kiss me on the cheek, he quickly turned his head and kissed me on the lips.”

“He thought this was normal to me, and the other women that he did this to,” she added of the incident at the Executive Mansion in Albany. “It was not normal, it was not welcome, and it was certainly not consensual.”

Brittany Commisso claims that Gov. Cuomo groped her from behind after she helped him with his State of the State speech in 2019.

Commisso alleges that on New Year’s Eve 2019, the governor groped her behind after she helped him with his “State of the State” speech.

After Cuomo suggested taking a selfie, Commisso said the 63-year-old governor began “rubbing” Commisso’s butt.

“He was to my left. I was on the right. With my right hand, I took the selfie,” she recalled.

“I then felt while taking the selfie, his hand goes down my back onto my butt, and he started rubbing it. Not sliding it. Not, you know, quickly brushing over it — rubbing my butt.”

She said she was so “nervous” that her hands began shaking, prompting Cuomo to suggest they sit on the couch because all the photos were blurry.

“I remember looking at them, and when he said, ‘Can I see them?,’ I showed him them,” she recalled. “And he said, ‘Oh, those aren’t — those aren’t good,'” and suggested they sit on the couch instead.

“So we sat down on the couch and in the photo I have my arm wrapped around his shoulder, almost as if we were taking a picture with a buddy. And I got a clear photo sitting down,” Commisso continued.

That selfie was released last week as part of New York state Attorney General Letitia James’ damning report accusing Cuomo of sexually harassing 11 women — including Commisso, whose face was blurred out.

After the New Year’s incident, the mom of one claims he groped her a second time in November last year when he hugged her in a “seuxally aggressive manner” at the mansion.

“He goes to give me a hug. It was probably the most sexually aggressive manner than any of the hugs,” she said.

“It was then I said, ‘You’re going to get us in trouble.’ I thought to myself, ‘That probably wasn’t the best thing to say.’ I was so afraid the mansion staff were going to come up and see it,” she recalled.

Commisso said Cuomo then “shut the door so hard” that she thought someone downstairs would think something was going on.

She alleges Cuomo slipped his hand up her shirt and placed his “large hand” on her bra — before leaving without saying a word.

“He came back to me and that’s when he put his hand up my blouse and cupped my breast over my bra,” Commisso said. “I exactly remember looking down, seeing his hand, which is a large hand, thinking to myself, ‘Oh, my God. This is happening.'”

Commisso added, “It happened so quick, he didn’t say anything. When I stopped it, he just pulled away and walked away.”

In March, the governor denied inappropriately touching staffers following an avalanche of accusers early in the year — a denial that prompted Commisso to come forward.

“I know the truth. He knows the truth. I know what happened and so does he,” she said in the CBS interview, calling his denials “disgusting.”

“He almost has this smirk that he thinks that he’s untouchable,” Commisso said while fighting back tears. “I almost feel like he has this sense of almost a celebrity status and it just — that was the tipping point. I broke down. I said, ‘He is lying.'”

“I felt like he was personally saying it to me that, ‘I never touched anyone inappropriately,'” she continued. “And, yes, you did.”

Commisso noted that she told colleagues about the alleged sexual assault at the time.

“I broke down. I told my co-workers a little bit,” she said.

The two colleagues reported Commisso’s allegations to senior staffers in the Executive Chamber, the attorney general’s report revealed.

Commisso, the mother of a daughter around 6 years old, said she initially was afraid to speak out because she feared a “vicious” onslaught from Cuomo and his loyal lackeys.

“I hope that the other women understand and that I’ve seen them and I support them. And I thank them, because without them, I don’t know if I would have come forward,” she said through tears.

“I was afraid that if I had come forward, and revealed my name, that the governor and his ‘enablers,’ I like to call them, would viciously attack me, would smear my name as I had seen and heard them do before to people.”

“People don’t understand that this is the governor of the state of New York,” she added. “He is a professional fighter.”

Additionally, Commisso said her initial silence was partly because she wanted to protect her young child.

“After a couple of months and processing this whole thing, I do want her to know that she has a voice,” Commisso said of her daughter. “I never want her to be afraid to speak. I never want her to be afraid of any person in power, a man or a woman.”

Asked by “CBS This Morning” co-host Jericka Duncan about the “appropriate punishment” for Cuomo, the aide said he should step aside and receive “professional help.”

“I do think he needs to resign, and I also do think he needs to seek counseling. I do think he needs professional help,” she said.

“He has many things he needs to work through.”

Last week, Commisso filed a criminal complaint against the governor. Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said Saturday Cuomo could face “a couple” of misdemeanor charges.

Commisso, who has leveled the most serious sexual misconduct allegations against Cuomo, identified herself as “Executive Assistant #1” for the first time in clips of the CBS interview released Sunday, in which she said the governor “broke the law” by groping her breast under her shirt.

Lindsey Boylan, the first woman to publicly accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment, on Sunday expressed support for Commisso.

“We are with you, Brittany,” she tweeted.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two more women approached the state Attorney General’s Office with allegations against Gov. Andrew Cuomo after Attorney General Letitia James released her sexual harassment report against him last week, The Post has learned.



But the women were told the AG’s investigation was officially over and were referred to local law enforcement authorities, a source familiar with the matter said.

It’s unclear who the women are, what they allege Cuomo did to them or where and when the alleged incidents took place.

James wasn’t even briefed on their allegations, the source said.

The report accused Cuomo of sexually harassing 11 women, nine of whom are current or former state employees.

They include Brittany Commisso, 32, who in an interview broadcast Monday on “CBS This Morning” said Cuomo, 63, groped her breast in the Executive Mansion last year and also grabbed her butt while they were taking selfies.

Commisso also described having being hugged by Cuomo, saying, “These were not hugs he would give his mother or his brother. These are hugs with the intention of getting some personal sexual satisfaction out of it.”

Commisso filed a complaint last week with the Albany County Sheriff’s Department, leading Sheriff Craig Apple to say Saturday that Cuomo could face “a couple” of misdemeanor charges.



Albany District Attorney David Soares had earlier said he was launching an investigation based on James’ report, which he said had “led myself and other prosecutors with concurrent jurisdiction to believe that criminal activity in fact had taken place.”

State law makes it a misdemeanor to commit “forcible touching,” which involves touching someone’s “sexual or other intimate parts” to degrade or abuse the person or to gratify the perpetrator’s “sexual desire.”

Gov. Andrew Cuomo still has not resigned following the sexual harassment report.

Four other DAs — in Manhattan, as well as Nassau, Westchester and Oswego counties — also said they were investigating alleged incidents detailed in the report.



The Nassau DA’s Office said it hadn’t heard from any accusers not mentioned in James’ report. The other prosecutors’ offices didn’t immediately return requests for comment.

Cuomo has been in hiding since James released her report on Tuesday but he released a pre-recorded video statement in which he denied having ever “touched anyone inappropriately” and suggested James’ investigation was politically motivated.

His personal defense lawyer, former US Justice Department official Rita Glavin, has also attacked the credibility of some of his accusers, saying of Commisso, “This woman’s story, as stated as fact in the report, is false.”



James’s office declined to comment and Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately return an inquiry.

Nassau County Judge Patricia Harrington said Christopher Ellis’s conviction should be tossed after a jury convicted him in 1992 based on testimony from a single eyewitness yet “no forensic or physical evidence.”

Long Island prosecutors also had failed to hand over to the defense the notes from the lead homicide detective in the case, which involved the death of 25-year-old Harry Joseph Healy on Sept. 29, 1990.

Still, Harrington said Ellis could be retried in the slaying. Prosecutors said they have yet to decide whether to do so.

The 51-year-old Ellis’s family cheered after Harrington vacated the conviction and the convicted man was uncuffed and released.

“I can’t imagine the celebration going to happen tonight and the wonderful dinner that I’m sure everybody has prepared for you,” Harrington said.

Outside the courtroom, amid boisterous celebration with family, Ellis, who appeared in court with a blue polo and black trousers, told reporters he felt “wonderful.

“I’m just glad to be with my family, enjoy life,” he said.

The first thing he said he plans to do with his newly acquired freedom was to stop for rum-raisin ice cream.

“I knew [this day] would be here, but I didn’t think it would take this long,” he said.

Assistant District Attorney Barbara Kornblau agreed to Ellis’s release on his own recognizance and added the DA’s office has not been decided whether the it would retry him.

“It’s not over yet. … We still have a way to go,” Ellis acknowledged.

Ellis was 20 years old when cops said he killed Healy in a botched robbery outside an Arby’s in Hampstead along with two others, David Liles and Gary Lawrence.

According to court documents, Healy was eating with friends when the group was approached by two men, one of whom pulled a gun and told them all to get up. The other man remarked, “Just do it” and the gunman fired a single shot, killing Healy.

The witnesses, though, were split on whether Ellis was the gunman, second man or even there at all, court docs say.

“Today is a great day for Chris. It’s a great day for justice,” Ellis’s lawyer, Ilann Maazel, said.

“Ellis was charged and convicted for a murder he did not commit. He’s an innocent man, and he spent three decades in prison, and this is his first taste of freedom since he was 20 years old.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@More than 80 dogs were rescued and 10 men arrested in Suffolk County on Monday for one of the largest dog fighting ring takedowns in New York State history.

The dog fighting operation spanned from Long Island, New York City, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and included breeding, training and illegal fighting of pit bulls, an investigation by several local, county and state law enforcement agencies revealed.

The investigation, which began in early 2021, revealed that the defendants prepare pups as young as six months old for practice fights or “rolls” to determine their fighting potential. Throughout their adult lives, the dogs were subject to cruel living conditions and forced to train voraciously for fights,

Once a dog was deemed prepared to fight, a “broker” would organize based on the dog’s height and weight, officials said. A willing opponent would pay a buy-in fee or “forfeit” to enter their dog into the fight, officials said. The victorious dog owner would receive all of the winnings.

Others would bet on the outcomes of the violent fights, in which the dogs can be seriously injured or killed. Dogs that were seriously injured or underperformed were killed by the defendants, the investigation found.

The defendants would also make money breeding and selling dogs deemed to have good fighting genes.

Nine residents in Suffolk County, three in Nassau County and one in Brooklyn were searched on July 31 and Aug. 1, where 81 dogs were rescued. An additional eight dogs were rescued in Connecticut.

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals helped in the recovery of the dogs, who were found in awful living conditions in basements, garages and sheds. Some had no food or water.

“Many of the dogs displayed various medical conditions consistent with dogfighting, including scarring and broken teeth, and were exhibiting fearful behavior,” the DA’s office said.

Searches revealed disturbing dog-fighting paraphernalia, according to officials, including “rape stands,” used to immobilize female dogs for bredding, skin staplers, steroids and supplements, devices used to electrocute dogs, “break sticks” used to break up fights, and dog training equipment like treadmills.

The ten defendants, whose ages range from 32-80, each face a maximum sentence of up to 4 years in prison, a fine of up to $25,000, or both, officials said. One defendant faces up to 20 years for additional drug possession charges.

A special grand jury will investigate the case, Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini said, to make future legal recommendations on effective animal cruelty prevention.

“The Special Grand Jury will be considering recommendations we can make to strengthen the laws on animal cruelty and further protect animals from this kind of senseless abuse,” he said. “We need to hold these bad actors accountable for their violent actions and these crimes need to be treated seriously under our law.”

“We will not tolerate these types of crimes – crimes that injure and, in many cases, result in the death of vulnerable animals,” Sini said in a statement. “Many of us have dogs as pets in our homes and we love them as another family member. This case is about how a criminal network bred dogs, tortured them, and put them in serious harm’s way just to make a buck.

“These arrests represent a significant blow to dogfighting, certainly here on Long Island and we believe it will have impacts throughout the Northeast.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police are investigating an apparent late-night anti-gay attack on the subway that left three people injured amid an uptick in crime on the city’s public transit system.

The incident is being investigated by the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force, police said.

The attack occurred on a Queens-bound E-train on Saturday, July 31 at 3:30 in the morning, when the unidentified suspect approached two 19-year old men.

The suspect made “anti-gay statements” and punched one of them in the face multiple times, police said. As the train pulled into the Court Square station, the man punched the other man in the face.

Once the train arrived at Queens Plaza, the next stop, the two victims fled the train.

Another victim, a 32-year-old female, was also punched in the face by the suspect when she attempted to intervene in the mezzanine area, police said.

The suspect allegedly made “anti-gay statements” and punched one of the victims in the face.

The suspect fled on foot.

All three victims suffered pain and swelling to their faces, police said, but all refused medical attention.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the NYPD.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s accusers said Monday that Cuomo once refused to hire a woman because she wasn’t “pretty enough” — and thought then-President Bill Clinton’s sex scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky was “funny.”

Karen Hinton, who worked as a Cuomo press aide when he was Clinton’s housing secretary, told The Post that during that time, he conducted a job interview with a woman who had “worked on Capitol Hill for years.”

“I knew her, she had a very good understanding of Capitol Hill politics and policy,” Hinton said.

“She came in for an interview and I sat in since I had recommended her, and he said to me after, ‘No, I don’t think so,'” she said.

Hinton added: “I asked, ‘Why?’ He said, ‘She’s not pretty enough. I don’t like the way she looks.'”

Hinton — who has accused Cuomo of having been physically “aroused” when he hugged her “too tightly” and for “too long” in a Los Angeles hotel room in December 2000 — also said he was amused by the scandal that led to Clinton’s 1998 impeachment.

Gov. Cuomo still has not resigned after the attorney general’s report came out.

“I remember him laughing about the Monica Lewinsky situation, not because he didn’t believe her — he did — but because he thought it was funny,” she said. “There were jokes made about it because of the cigars.”

The alleged hotel room incident involving the governor and Hinton, who’s married to former Cuomo administration official Howard Glaser, is briefly mentioned twice in Attorney General Letitia James’ sexual harassment report against him.

But Hinton isn’t included among the 11 complainants whose allegations were addressed in detail because the report only focused on Cuomo’s actions while governor. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio publicly accused Cuomo of demanding that he fire Hinton when she was Hizzoner’s press secretary, and described the three-term Democrat as a “Shakespearean” villain.

Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately return a request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The New York state Assembly’s Judiciary Committee on Monday had “detailed discussions” with its outside lawyers about Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s $5.1 million book deal — and it could spell trouble for former top aide Melissa DeRosa, sources told The Post.

The committee has been probing whether Cuomo improperly used state resources to write his memoir, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” as part of its impeachment inquiry into the three-term Democrat.

“There’s no question that the lawyers have evidence about using taxpayer resources to prepare the manuscript,” a source close to the assembly probe said.

The evidence in question, according to the source, includes emails from DeRosa about “instructions she gave to the staff in the governor’s office to help with the manuscript for Cuomo’s book being pitched to publishers.”

“They clearly have evidence and interviews with staff about Melissa DeRosa instructing them to help with the manuscript,” the source said.

DeRosa, 38, resigned Sunday night amid criticism over her attempts to discredit the governor’s accusers, detailed in state Attorney General Letitia James’ scathing report on Cuomo’s alleged sexual harassment of several women.

Reports in March said that DeRosa and fellow top aide Stephanie Benton, as well as junior staffers, assisted the governor with his memoir, which was published in mid-October.

Crown Publishing has since paused promotion of “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic” because of a federal investigation into the Cuomo administration’s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes, which the impeachment inquiry also covers.

“One of the publishers expressed amazement that the governor had the time to prepare a manuscript in the middle of the COVID crisis,” the source said Monday.

A second source close to the Judiciary Committee said it will be simple to determine whether there was any wrongdoing when it comes to Cuomo’s book deal.

“It definitely came up. Either you did or didn’t do it. There was talking about staff working around the clock and on weekends…,” the source said. “Our lawyers (on the Judiciary Committee) are pursuing it.”

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-The Bronx) on Monday said the committee plans to wrap up its impeachment investigation “with all due haste” in the wake of James’ explosive report. He would not commit to a timeline for a vote, but said the articles of impeachment would be drafted in the next few weeks.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Lavine (D-Nassau) also said that the wide-ranging investigation by the committee’s outside lawyers was continuing into other allegations against Cuomo, including relating to his pandemic memoir.

Assembly David Weprin (D-Queens), who is on the Judiciary Committee, also said there was “no question” the outside lawyers were looking into whether Cuomo used state workers to help prepare and promote his memoir.

“That’s government 101. You can’t do non-government work on government time,” Weprin told The Post. “That’s stuff our lawyers are looking at. No question.”

Both James’ office and the Brooklyn US Attorney’s Office are also probing the book deal.

Spokesman Rich Azzopardi has previously said that “the idea there was criminality involved here is patently absurd on its face and is just the furthering of a political pile-on.”

In a statement Monday, Azzopardi added: “As I previously said, any state official who volunteered to assist on this project did so on his or her own time and without the use of state resources. To the extent a document was printed, it was incidental.”

The number of New Yorkers hospitalized for the virus hit 1,225 on Sunday, up from 354 on July 8, according to the latest figures from Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office.

Meanwhile, in the Big Apple, there were 554 new patients hospitalized with the virus Sunday, according to state figures. That number was the highest since May 20, when there were 590 COVID-19 hospitalizations, data shows.

In New York City, the Delta variant accounts for around 83 percent of current COVID-19 cases, data shows.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already designated around three-quarters of counties in the state as areas of “high” or “substantial” transmission.

The agency recommends that such coronavirus hot spots require people to wear masks indoors, regardless of their vaccination status.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A gaggle of Democratic local politicians have flocked to gauge their standing if they chose to enter a potentially incumbent-free gubernatorial 2022 primary, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo fights for survival after the release of the attorney general’s damning sexual harassment investigation.

Allies of Attorney General Letitia James, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Rep. Tom Suozzi of Long Island have spoken with Rev. Al Sharpton to assess their standing in potential bids to serve as the state’s chief executive, the longtime political broker told The Post.

“Some of their associates reached out,” Sharpton said Monday. “None of them said they were running, they just asked me what I thought about it.”

“None of them said they were absolutely running, they were just feeling me out,” he added.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo still refuses to resign amid his sexual harassment scandal.

Other Democrats have considered a gubernatorial run, including Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone and state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, The Post previously reported.

Sharpton predicted that Cuomo will step down rather than face the prospect of being ousted by lawmakers.

“It’s going to be difficult for him to proceed at this point,” he said. “Rather than go down as the second governor in the story of the state to be impeached, he’ll probably resign at some point.”

James — coming off the release of her office’s widely praised probe of the multiple sexual misconduct allegations levied against Cuomo — would be an early, though not overwhelming, favorite in the 2022 contest provided Cuomo is out of office, according to insiders and a new poll.

“There’s no one with statewide name recognition who can win in New York City like she can,” one veteran political consultant told The Post.

“If there is a primary for governor, she gets in,” said the source. “If she doesn’t want it, she doesn’t want it, but this is the moment to do it.”

In a poll released Monday, James was atop the list of candidates likely Democratic voters said they would pick in a Cuomo-free gubernatorial primary election. But she’s only three percentage points ahead of both Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and 22 percent of likely Democratic voters are “not sure” about whom they’d back if Cuomo isn’t an option, according to the survey.

“It’s wide open. Tish at 13 percent is hardly insurmountable,” said Evan Roth Smith, a partner Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll on Friday and Saturday.

“What I see is a lot of voters who are not married to one of the top contenders. If (Lt. Gov. Kathy) Hochul were dominant, if Tish were the heir apparent, that would be reflected in that question.”

The poll of 600 likely Democratic primary voters comes as a 2022 election without Cuomo, who has served as governor since 2011, look more likely each day.

Nearly all relevant elected officials from his own party — from Mayor Bill de Blasio to President Joe Biden — have stated that the third-term Democrat should step side, and the state Assembly has more than enough votes to impeach the third-term Democrat.

In addition, a desperate Cuomo has recently launched a last-ditch attempt at a deal with lawmakers to bow out of the campaign for a fourth term if lawmakers agree to not boot him from the Executive Chamber via impeachment.

“It was something that was floated to me by the folks in the Cuomo camp as a possible option before the Attorney General’s report came out,” New York state Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs previously told The Post. “I never saw it as a viable option.”

Meanwhile, a sexual assault accuser identified in the Attorney General’s report as “Executive Assistant #1,” tearfully recalled Cuomo groping her during creepy encounters with the 63-year-old.

“These were not hugs he would give his mother or his brother. These are hugs with the intention of getting some personal sexual satisfaction out of it,” Brittany Commisso, 32, said in an interview that aired Monday on “CBS This Morning.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A major union representing New York State Police officers demanded that Gov. Andrew Cuomo immediately resign Monday, after a state probe found he sexually harassed a female trooper assigned to his protective detail.

“As law enforcement professionals charged with investigating serious crimes in New York State, some of NYSPIA’s members are also responsible for providing protective detail for the Governor,” the New York State Police Investigators Association said in a statement.

“Having to continue to protect the Governor under the current circumstances puts our members in an extremely difficult position,” the union said.

“We request that management of the Governor’s detail be immediately transferred to the Division of State Police. This situation clearly demonstrates that the Governor’s control of all aspects of who serves on his protective detail leads to opportunities for impropriety,” it said.

Last week, a probe by state Attorney General Letitia James concluded that Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women, including the female trooper assigned to his security detail.

It’s been six days since AG Letitia James found that Gov. Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women.

The officer, identified only as “Trooper #1” in the report, told investigators the governor ran his hand or fingers across her stomach and her back, kissed her on the cheek, asked for her help in finding a girlfriend and asked why she didn’t wear a dress.

She also said he ran his open hand over her abdomen as she held a door open for him — an incident that left her feeling “completely violated.”

The NYSPIA initially criticized Cuomo’s actions as “completely unacceptable and utterly disgraceful” but stopped short of joining the chorus of lawmakers and allies calling on him to resign.

Then over the weekend, Rita Glavin, a lawyer for Cuomo, conceded during a CNN interview that the governor “may have very well touched the state trooper’s back” but added “she may have understood it one way and he understood it another way.”

In the NYSPIA’s statement Monday, some of the union’s ire was specifically directed at the governor’s “legal team,” which “has made it clear that it seeks to vilify and attack the brave women who have come forward to expose his reprehensible behavior.

“The legal team is an extension of the bullying and aggressive behavior that has been a hallmark of the Cuomo administration,” the NYSPIA wrote.

“Victims deserve to have their privacy protected from members of the Executive Chamber, their legal team, and media, while the Legislature and legal system consider how to address the allegations in court.”

The NYSPIA represents 1,200 active members, including investigators within the state police’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation. It would not confirm whether the trooper accusing Cuomo of wrongdoing is a member of its union.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A woman who testified against a Brooklyn gang that terrorized the NYCHA complex where she lived was hunted down and killed after being branded a “snitch,” federal prosecutors said Monday in revealing chilling details of her execution-style murder.

The victim, 33-year-old Shatavia Walls, was gunned down by two men near a walking path at the Pink Houses in East New York on July 7, 2020, authorities said. She died 10 days later at Brookdale Hospital.

Her murder, federal prosecutors allege, was carefully planned and carried out by members of the Ninedee Gang, one of whom called her a “snitch” on July 4 of that year while they argued about setting off fireworks at the housing complex.

In 2019, Walls had testified in a Brooklyn federal court case that a member of the Loopy Gang — another crew in the complex with close ties to the Ninedees — had shot her two years earlier, the feds said.

At the time of her testimony, she faced extreme pressure in her building — with gang members posting flyers that labeled her a “rat” throughout the complex.

Then, during the July 4 confrontation over fireworks, Ninedee member Maliek Miller called her a “snitch” and fired a gun into the air, prosecutors said.

Miller and two other Ninedee members, Quintin Green and Chayanne Fernandez, then began plotting her murder, prosecutors said.

Green and another unnamed suspect, who was a juvenile at the time, decided to strike three days later on July 7, according to court documents.

The pair “waited at the Pink Houses all afternoon and through the early evening for an opportunity to shoot Ms. Walls, changing their clothes throughout the day in order to disguise their appearance,” prosecutors wrote in a memo filed Monday, urging a federal judge to order two members of the gang detained pending trial.

Walls was allegedly killed by the Ninedee Gang after being labeled a “snitch.” Facebook

When Walls emerged from a building in the complex at about 9:25 p.m., Green approached her from behind, exchanged words with her, then began firing a gun at her, the feds said. Green missed and hit an innocent bystander, prosecutors said.

Walls then sprinted away from Green, who gave chase while continuing to fire at her — at one point leaping over a fence to get a clear shot, according to the court papers.

In the mad dash for her life, the doomed woman unknowingly ran toward a second shooter — the unidentified juvenile suspect — who opened fire, prosecutors charged.

Green then caught up and gunned down Walls behind one of the buildings on Linden Boulevard, prosecutors said. After the slaying, a number of Ninedee members hid out in Queens to avoid increased police scrutiny at the Pink Houses.

Fernandez, Green and Miller were each indicted on murder-in-aid-of-racketeering charges in the slaying.

A fourth suspect, Kevin Wint, was charged with accessory after the fact for helping them hide out in Queens after the murder, according to court papers.

In the days after Walls’ death, her heartbroken mother told The Post that the slain woman approached the gang members on July 4 after Borough President Eric Adams urged Brooklyn residents to talk to neighbors about fireworks, rather than call the police.

“She watched the news. Yes, she heard it,” Helen Testagros said at the time, referring to Adams’ advice. “It was probably in the back of her mind.”

Attorney information for the suspects was not immediately available.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s shocking resignation Tuesday finally put an end to the demands that he leave office in disgrace — but he still faces multiple criminal investigations and a potential impeachment that could bar him from running for office again.

Cuomo is also planning to move out of Albany’s Executive Mansion without a home of his own and a ruined reputation that could sink an attempt to buy a place that requires the approval of any would-be neighbors.

Cuomo likely has no idea where he’ll go, one longtime pal told The Post, while another predicted the nearly three-term Democrat will “take a long vacation” before he starts thinking about trying to rebuild his shattered life.

But any planning could prove premature, with at least five district attorneys — in Manhattan and Albany as well as Nassau, Westchester and Oswego counties — investigating allegations contained in the sexual harassment report issued Aug. 3 by state Attorney General Letitia James that led Cuomo to throw in the towel.

One of the 11 women whom James said Cuomo, 63, harassed — executive assistant Brittany Commisso, 32 — last week filed a complaint against him with the Albany County Sheriff’s Office.

That led Sheriff Craig Apple to say Cuomo could face “a couple” of misdemeanor charges over allegations he groped her breast and grabbed her butt on separate occasions.

James has also said her office is still conducting a criminal probe into whether Cuomo misused government resources by having state employees help produce and promote his memoir, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” which he sold to the Crown Publishing Group for $5.1 million.

And the FBI and Brooklyn US Attorney’s Office are investigating Cuomo and his administration over their handling of nursing homes during the coronavirus crisis, a probe sparked by The Post’s revelation that then-top aide Melissa DeRosa admitted to Democratic lawmakers that officials had covered up the total nursing home death toll from COVID-19.

“We need to proceed to hold him accountable for the nursing home deaths and the book deal. That’s not going away,” said Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens), one of the governor’s most outspoken critics.

Cuomo’s resignation, which he said takes effect in two weeks, came one day after Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) said an impeachment probe launched in March would be wrapped up “with all due haste.”

Assembly Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Lavine (D-Nassau) also vowed that any articles of impeachment drawn up against Cuomo “will be airtight.”

It was unclear Tuesday how Cuomo’s resignation would affect that process, which could lead to a sentence barring him from seeking office again were he convicted after a trial in the state Senate.

“The committee will meet and determine where we go from here,” said Assemblyman Tom Abinanti (D-Westchester), a Judiciary Committee member.

“Whether we can pursue impeachment as a political and legal matter is something we’re looking at. Our lawyers are looking at it.”

Abinanti also said he believed the committee had “an obligation to report back to the Assembly” regardless of whether it approved articles of impeachment.

A Democratic member of the Assembly who spoke on condition of anonymity said legislators may no longer have the political appetite to impeach Cuomo.

“It’s a lot of work and expense,” the source said.

“There’s a legitimate question whether there is such a thing as impeaching someone who is no longer the governor. The one substantive action that could be taken would be to bar him from future office.”

Given Cuomo’s notoriety and rock-bottom poll numbers, the source added, “I doubt that’s something we need to worry about.”

The Sexual Harassment Working Group, made up of former legislative employees, demanded that the Assembly “continue its impeachment investigation, and the Court of Impeachment should convict Cuomo and prevent him from running for public office in the future.”

“We continue to call on the Assembly to break its habit of offering an escape hatch for sexual predators in the workplace,” the group said in a statement.

“For decades, we have experienced and seen women and men suffer the consequences of legislators’ ethically bankrupt nonchalance.”

A longtime Cuomo pal, when asked where the soon-to-be ex-governor would likely relocate, said, “I don’t know that he knows.”

Cuomo, who has three grown daughters with ex-wife Kerry Kennedy, doesn’t own any property in his own name and hasn’t lived in a private residence since his 2019 split from celebrity chef Sandra Lee, who owned a four-bedroom Colonial in Mount Kisco, dubbed “Lily Pond,” that she sold in 2020 for $1.85 million.

When Cuomo separated from Kennedy in 2002, he reportedly moved into the United Nations Plaza apartment of pal Jeffrey Sachs, a health care consultant.

Cuomo also has family members he could hit up for temporary living quarters, including his younger brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who made a spectacle of moving into the basement of his $2.9 million Southampton home while sick with COVID-19 last year.

Another longtime pal said of Cuomo, “My guess is he’ll take a long vacation.”

The friend also said Cuomo, who was briefly a real estate lawyer before going into government, could return to that work.

“In his bones, Andy is a deal guy. He knows how to put deals together,” the source said.

“I think he’ll head into real estate or [mergers and acquisitions].”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s “enabler-in-chief” Melissa DeRosa was spotted by his side Tuesday as he left his Manhattan office after announcing his resignation.

DeRosa, who resigned from her role as secretary to the governor on Sunday, was spotted walking with Cuomo, his daughter Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo and his office director Stephanie Benton as they prepared to board a helicopter out of the city.

Dressed in a navy blue, polka dot dress, sunglasses and her signature Gucci bag, it’s the first time DeRosa has been seen publicly since saying she was stepping down from the state’s highest-ranking appointed position.

The Cuomo loyalist, 38, didn’t note in her resignation statement when her last day was but the New York Times reported it’s timed with Cuomo’s own resignation and will take effect in 14 days.

DeRosa has been facing public excoriation ever since Attorney General Letitia James revealed she played an active role in discrediting and dismissing the women who said they were sexually harassed by the governor.

She’s yet to address her role in the scandal or speak about her resignation.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A man was fatally stabbed inside his Queens penthouse Tuesday — and his killer then set off a massive explosion that blew the roof off the apartment building to try to cover up the murder, police sources say.

The blast tore apart the top-floor apartment and parts of the floor below inside the seven-story building on 41st Avenue near 73rd Street just before 10:30 a.m., fire officials said.

After the four-alarm blaze was put out, responders found 26-year-old Anesti Bulgaretsi unconscious in the bathroom of the apartment, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

But it wasn’t until hours later that authorities discovered Bulgaretsi had been stabbed multiple times, according to police sources, who said they believe the fire had been intentionally set to cover the killer’s tracks.

FDNY Chief Thomas Currao said at the scene that the fire caused “significant damage to the penthouse structure as well as the rear of the sixth floor.

“We have a collapse, it is a very unstable situation right now.

“We have evacuated two buildings to the rear of the main fire structure,” the fire chief said. “[W]e’ll be working with the Department of Buildings to develop a plan for the next phase, which will be structural stability and mitigation.”

Four firefighters also suffered minor injuries from the fire, Currao added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A vandal set fire to a statue of the Virgin Mary outside a Catholic Church in the Bronx, cops said.

The arson occurred outside the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Mary Catholic Church in Melrose around 6 p.m. Sunday, according to police.

A forgiving parish priest who answered the phone at the East 150th Street church Tuesday night said the harm to the statue was mild, and the woman suspected of the crime may be in need of mental health services.

“It’s probably a person who is mentally imbalanced, so she lit some clothing on fire and threw it up on the statue, which is made of concrete, so it didn’t do much damage,” the priest, who did not wish to be identified, told The Post.

“It would be important to check in to why isn’t there more help available for the mentally ill, that would be a better story,” the priest said, dismissing the arson as “a non-incident”

Detectives were still searching for the suspect, police said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CNN anchor Chris Cuomo told his brother Andrew to resign as governor of New York this week during the fallout over the elder brother’s sex harassment scandal, a report said Tuesday.

The host of “Cuomo Prime Time” spoke to his sibling over the phone and explained that the governor could not survive the fallout from a report released last week by state Attorney General Letitia James, according to The New York Times.

James’ report described sexual harassment allegations against the three-term Democrat from 11 women — including nine current or former state employees.

Andrew, the Empire State’s 56th governor, resigned Tuesday, telling New Yorkers “the best way I can help now is if I step aside.”

Cuomo’s CNN colleague, “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter, confirmed the Times report during an awkward taping of an interview with Stephen Colbert on CBS’ “The Late Show.”

“I also have a source that says Chris was on the phone with his brother this week, urging him–,“ Stelter began before Colbert cut him off to ask: “Is your source Chris Cuomo?”

“He is not,” Stelter answered. “He is not. You gotta have boundaries, you gotta draw a line.”

“Why? He doesn’t,” Colbert shot back, to audible “ooooohs” from the audience.

The Washington Post reported late Monday that Chris Cuomo was one of a dwindling number of people the soon-to-be-former governor was in touch with as longtime allies left his administration and the state Assembly built an impeachment case.

Chris Cuomo has not fronted CNN’s 9 p.m. show since Thursday. He claimed to be taking this week off to mark his 51st birthday, which fell on Monday. Neither Cuomo nor his substitute hosts have touched on the Andrew Cuomo harassment scandal since the report was made public by James.

On March 1, after the first claims of sexual harassment were made against the governor, Chris Cuomo told his viewers that he could not cover the story “because he is my brother.” However, the report revealed that at the same time the anchor attempted to detach himself from his sibling’s scandal, he was sitting in on strategy sessions with a gaggle of Andrew Cuomo’s advisers, both from inside and outside the Executive Chamber.

Indeed, the day before the younger Cuomo made his earnest statement to viewers, the James report revealed, he sent an email to the governor’s other advisers with a proposed statement responding to the allegations that he appeared to have drafted or edited.

On May 20, after The Washington Post initially reported that Chris Cuomo had helped advise his brother on the response to the allegations, the CNN host addressed viewers again.

“I can be objective about just about any topic, but not about my family … I am fiercely loyal to them. I’m family first, job second,” he said at the time, later adding: “When my brother’s situation became turbulent, being looped into calls with other friends of his, and advisers that did include some of his staff, I understand why that was a problem for CNN. It will not happen again.”

In a separate statement that day, the network said it was “inappropriate” for their star anchor “to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor’s staff, which Chris acknowledges. He will not participate in such conversations going forward.”

A CNN spokesperson told The Post Monday night that the more recent conversations between Chris and Andrew Cuomo did not run afoul of any network policy.

“As both CNN and Chris have stated publicly, he cannot cover his brother, in part because we certainly expect them to speak,” the rep said. “He’s not joined any meetings nor acted in any official capacity since he apologized for doing so. That’s our expectation as we’ve said all along.”

Stelter defended his network’s much-criticized handling of Chris Cuomo Tuesday, calling the situation “the craziest set of circumstances you can imagine.”

“I talked to a lot of sources at CNN, and some said, ‘Yeah, this is really weird. I’m ticked off at Chris.’ Others said, ‘You know, I understand. You can’t pick who your family members are,’” he told Colbert. “So there was a wide range of opinions.”

Critics have called for Chris Cuomo to be disciplined or fired from CNN, describing his dual role as prime-time anchor and fraternal adviser to be a grievous breach of journalistic ethics.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden on Tuesday nominated Damian Williams to be the new US attorney for Manhattan, one of the most high-profile federal prosecutor positions in the nation.

Williams, 40, would be the first black man to hold the post in the Southern District of New York if he’s confirmed by the Senate.

The White House announced the pick on Tuesday along with seven other nominations for US attorneys — including two others in New York State.

“The President has launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick in gun crime that has been taking place the last 18 months – putting more cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking,” the statement said.

“Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for these efforts.”

Williams would replace Acting US Attorney Audrey Strauss, who ascended to the office’s top spot after former President Donald Trump fired former Attorney Preet Bharara and his successor Geoffrey Berman.

Williams is an assistant attorney in the district and once worked as a law clerk for Merrick Garland on the US Court of Appeals, according to the White House.

The Southern District includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester County and other northern suburbs.

Biden nominated Breon Peace as the US attorney for the Eastern District, which includes Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens and Long Island. Peace is a former assistant US attorney in the district..

Carla Freedman was Biden’s pick for the Northern District of New York, which includes Albany County and other upstate counties in the state.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been missing in action as the state failed to release the vast majority of $2.6 billion in federal funds for tenants on the brink of eviction, the head of the emergency rental relief program testified Tuesday, just before the accused sexual harasser announced his resignation.

“I have not had conversations with the governor about this,” Michael Hein, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, admitted to lawmakers at an Assembly hearing in Lower Manhattan.

Assemblyman Mike Lawler (R-Rockland County) had asked Hein when was the last time he’d spoken with Cuomo about the Emergency Rental Assistance Program passed by Congress in January.

That’s when Hein answered that he’d never spoken to the governor about the program. Instead he communicates with Cuomo’s deputies, Hein testified.

While Hein’s office has paid out $140 million to contractors to administer the program that’s beset with tech problems and only recently added a “save and resume” button to the lengthy online application, only $100 million has been distributed to tenants and landlords since June 1.

That’s just 3.7 percent of the $2.6 billion pot. The state risks forfeiting the federal funds if 65% of the money isn’t paid out by Sept. 30.

“I think what this shows is that the administration is incapable of administering this program,” Lawler fumed.

“It’s unacceptable. It’s unacceptable the tenants, the landlords, and I’m disgusted by the way the state has handled this,” Lawler said.

His remarks came shortly before the governor announced his resignation amidst claims that Cuomo sexually harassed several female staffers. The unexpected announcement caused the room to erupt into applause.

A spokesman for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment on rent relief.

The program provides up to a year of back rent and utility costs to tenants at risk of eviction because of the coronavirus pandemic.

On July 21, New York was the only state in the nation that hadn’t released any of the funds allocated to it by Congress in April.

New York’s eviction moratorium expires at the end of the month.

Late last month Cuomo vowed to fix the program by hiring more employees to help administer the dollars.

But Jesenia Ponce, an attorney with the nonprofit group Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, said there are still many flaws with the process.

“We properly need a working system,” she testified Tuesday.

“We need an application system that works, proper funding for legal services, and an extension to the moratorium that will prevent the deeper state of housing instability in New York City,” Ponce said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Half of all 32 New York City school districts have shed at least 10 percent of their students over the past five years, according to Department of Education data.

Spurred by parental flight, flagging birth rates and the onslaught of the coronavirus, the nation’s largest school system continues to lose kids.

Two smaller city school districts — one in Brooklyn and one in the Bronx — have each seen enrollment plummet by more than 20 percent since 2017.

District 18, which includes parts of Flatbush and Canarsie, had 16,508 student in 2017 and just 12,602 last year — a staggering drop of 23.7 percent.

District 12, which includes Crotona Park, saw enrollment crater by 21 percent over that span.

The DOE stressed Monday that unprecedented COVID-19 upheaval accounts for the bulk of departures from the system and that attrition rates accelerated during the pandemic.

“Hundreds of thousands of families choose a New York City public school to send their child to get a world-class, high-quality education,” said DOE spokeswoman Katie O’Hanlon. “We set the gold-standard in reopening and keeping kids safe during the pandemic and can’t wait to welcome everyone back to buildings this fall.”

Despite its standing as one of the top academic districts in the city, District 15 in Park Slope has also seen notable register losses in recent years

Overall, enrollment was down by only 5.4 percent compared to 2017. But kindergarten numbers have declined in each of the past five years — and are down by 18 percent overall during that period.

In 2017, there were 3,154 kids enrolled in the district’s kindergarten classes. Last year, that figure had dipped to 2,594, according to DOE data.

Kindergarten enrollment also fell by 12 percent over that span in District 20, another of the city’s most competitive academic precincts.

Only one city district has seen an increase in students over the last half decade. District 31 in Staten Island saw its numbers edge up slightly by 0.2 percent since 2017.

The DOE highlighted that its enrollment declines mirror those in other large metropolitan areas and are attributable in part to larger demographic trends.

The agency’s District 75, which serves severely physically and mentally challenged city kids, has seen its rolls grow in recent years.

In 2017 there were 24,604 students enrolled in the program. There were 26,524 last year, a hike of 7.8 percent.

Charter school enrollment increased by 31 percent since 2017, going from 105,065 to 138,648 last year.

The Bronx had the highest overall enrollment losses over that period at 6 percent, followed by Queens at 5, Brooklyn at 4 and Manhattan at 2.5.

Staten Island’s overall enrollment grew by 2 percent.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation announcement on Tuesday marked a shocking turn for one of New York’s most powerful political figures.

Cuomo, whose career spanned four decades, said he would step down within 14 days, something he claimed was necessary to ensure a smooth transition with his successor, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul.

The 63-year-old Democrat, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, will leave the post in the middle of his third term.

Here’s a look back at Cuomo’s career, including his Emmy Award win for his daily coronavirus briefings and multiple scandals, culminating in the damning official report into his alleged sexual harassment and his resignation under threat of impeachment and criminal charges:

November 1982: Mario Cuomo elected governor

After volunteering on his father, late-Gov. Mario Cuomo’s first, and unsuccessful, campaign for governor in 1974 as a 16-year-old, Andrew served as campaign manager in the 1982 race.

Mario Cuomo defeated then-New York City Mayor Ed Koch in a primary. He took office for the first of his three terms in 1983, hiring his elder son as a $1-a-year special adviser.

June 1990: Andrew Cuomo marries Kerry Kennedy

Cuomo married Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, on June 9, 1990, joining two powerful political families. Their union was nicknamed “Cuomolot” after “Camelot.”

The couple would have three daughters, twins, Cara Kennedy-Cuomo and Mariah Kennedy-Cuomo (born 1995), and Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo (born 1997).

They separated in 2003, and divorced in 2005.

Andrew Cuomo ran in the Democratic primary for governor, challenging then-Republican Gov. George Pataki, who had defeated dad Mario when the elder Cuomo ran for a fourth term in 1994.

But Cuomo withdrew his candidacy just a week before the primary, after trailing in the polls to Carl McCall, who was bested by Pataki in the general election.

November 2006: Andrew Cuomo elected New York attorney general

The victory marked Cuomo’s return to politics after a few years in the private sector.

He defeated the Republican nominee, former Westchester district attorney Jeanine Pirro, winning 58 percent of the vote.

November 2010: Andrew Cuomo elected to first term as New York governor

After Democratic Gov. David Paterson withdrew his candidacy for re-election, Cuomo stepped in, cinching the nomination and defeating Republican Carl Paladino in the general race.

During his first term, Cuomo passed a property-tax cap and worked to strike a bipartisan deal for same-sex marriage legalization, one of his most-touted accomplishments as governor.

He was also reportedly involved in the formation of the now-defunct Independent Democratic Conference, which gave control of the state Senate to Republicans.

November 2014: Andrew Cuomo elected to second gubernatorial term

Cuomo sought re-election in 2014, with former Rep. Kathy Hochul as running mate after then-Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy announced that he would not run again.

He defeated Republican Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino in the general election.

Mario Cuomo died on Jan. 1, 2015, within hours of his son being sworn in for his second term.

June 2017: Andrew Cuomo and the NYC subway crisis

Following a series of subway meltdowns, Cuomo declared a “state of emergency” in the transit system.

Early 2020: Andrew Cuomo hailed for coronavirus pandemic response

Cuomo’s popularity exploded during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, with New York emerging as the nation’s hotspot.

He was lauded, included by celebrities, for his daily COVID-19 briefings, in which he frequently criticized the federal government’s response, and emerged as the leading Democratic voice on the outbreak, gaining fans who dubbed themselves “Cuomosexuals.”

During this time, Cuomo made frequent TV appearances — including on his brother Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, engaging in often-cringey banter.

All this took place as Cuomo’s administration was allegedly covering up the COVID-19-related deaths at nursing homes.

Early 2021: Nursing home scandal reaches new heights

On Jan. 28, 2021, a probe by state attorney general Letitia James found that the Cuomo administration undercounted coronavirus deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50 percent.

About two weeks later, The Post broke the stunning news that Cuomo’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, had privately apologized to Democratic lawmakers for withholding the state’s nursing home death toll from COVID-19 — telling them “we froze” out of fear that the true numbers would “be used against us” by federal prosecutors.

The FBI and the US Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn announced they would be probing the incident.

February 2021: More Andrew Cuomo accusers come forward

Boylan wrote an essay on Medium that the governor had harassed her multiple times between 2016 and 2018, when she worked as a state economic development official.

Charlotte Bennett, a former aide to Cuomo, told The New York Times in February that the governor asked her inappropriate personal questions, told her he was open to relationships with women in their 20s, and left her feeling that he “wanted to sleep with me.”

Cuomo calls for a “full and thorough review” of the allegations, and New York Attorney General Letitia James announces her office will hire and deputize outside lawyers to investigate.

March 2021: Pressure builds for Andrew Cuomo to resign, as allegations mount

As more allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior emerge, Cuomo faces pressure to resign from top Democrats, including from New York Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

More than 55 Democratic New York legislators also sign a letter calling on the governor to step down and the Assembly speaker approves an impeachment investigation.

August 3, 2021: Scathing AG report released

New York Attorney General Letitia James announces the findings of the months-long probe into the allegations conducted by two independent investigators.

The 168-page report concluded that Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women, including current and former government staffers, in violation of state and federal law.

He maintains that he “never touched anyone inappropriately.”

August 10, 2021: Andrew Cuomo resigns

With the threat of impeachment looming, Cuomo announces that he will step down in 14 days.

“I think that, given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside,” Cuomo said from his Manhattan office.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Critics are demanding Gov. Cuomo leave office immediately instead of waiting two weeks to step down — and they aren’t buying his claim that the delay is due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I think the easiest, best and cleanest thing for the governor to do right now is to make his resignation immediate,” state Senator Andrew Gounardes (D-Brooklyn) told The Post Tuesday a few hours after Cuomo announced his resignation.

Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi had claimed the delay is “to ensure an orderly transition at this critical time where the key decisions still remain on COVID-19, the Delta variant and other significant challenges facing the state.”

“I don’t know what key decision they might be referring to. I think with the expiration of the emergency powers there aren’t any key decision left to be made,” Gounardes said, citing the state legislature’s move in March to strip Cuomo of the nearly unchecked authority he enjoyed during the height of the pandemic.

“I would be very concerned about the governor trying to spend the next few weeks trying to manipulate the levers of the government in some way, shape or form — either ram something through or install allies in key positions,” Gounardes said.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo plans to focus on making “key decisions” on COVID-19 affecting New York before his registration, according to his spokesman. TheImageDirect.com

Councilman Mark Levine (D-Manhattan), who chairs the body’s health committee, also called B.S. on governor’s reasoning behind the two week wait.

“Any ‘key decisions’ he might take in the next 14 days are steps he should have taken weeks or months ago,” Levine said.

A source with inside knowledge of the governor’s thinking said, “The only reason he’s doing 14 days is his need to control the process as much as possible.”

Melissa DeRosa, the governor’s No. 2, announced her own resignation Sunday but is also waiting two weeks before leaving her job as Cuomo’s trusted secretary. She was seen with Cuomo Tuesday when he gave a televised address about his departure.

Women’s groups blasted Cuomo for taking his time to exit Albany.

“Governor Cuomo should not serve another day in office. Plain and simple,” said Heidi Sieck, head of the interest group #VOTEPROCHOICE.

“His resignation should be effective immediately. His long history of duplicity and using feminist talking points to hide deep corruption must come to an end,” Sieck said.

Another women’s rights organization, UltraViolet, criticized the governor for slow walking his resignation, noting that Attorney General Letitia James found on Aug. 3 that he sexually harassed multiple women.

“UltraViolet believes Cuomo should have resigned immediately, citing AG James’ independent investigation concluding he broke the law by sexually harassing and retaliating against women in attempt to force them not to speak out,” a rep for the group told The Post.

“The organization also believes the New York State Assembly should move forward with impeachment proceedings without delay,” she said.

When former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced his resignation in 2008 after being linked to a prostitution ring, he left office just five days later.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Manhattan modeling agency says a rival firm poached its “rising star,” Victoria’s Secret catwalker Devyn Garcia, according to new court papers.

State Artist Management, LLC, says it plucked Garcia out of obscurity when she was just 18 and signed a three-year contract with her Sept. 3, 2019, according to the Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit filed Tuesday.

Garcia “had little experience with professional modeling,” but the company “saw her potential and marketed her to its select clients as ‘the next star,'” court papers say.

Because of State’s nurturing, Garcia booked gigs with Victoria’s Secret, Adore Me, Nordstrom’s, L’Oréal, Gap and Tommy Hilfiger —resulting in her beginning to earn much higher rates, the court documents claim.

But March 5, Garcia informed State that she was canceling her contract and “almost immediately” after, DNA Model Management, LLC, of Manhattan posted pictures of Garcia on its Web site, the suit alleges.

Garcia is not named as a defendant in the case.

“Defendants enticed Garcia to breach her State contract only half-way through its term and position DNA to reap the financial benefit of State’s efforts to develop and promote Garcia,” the suit alleges.

“DNA is the 10,000 pound gorilla of the model management industry,” the suit says, alleging that the rival firm has a history of inducing models to break their contracts.

“Every model management company in New York has a list of models taken by DNA and State is no different,” the suit charges.

DNA was sued in 2017 by Lions Model Management over Dior catwalker Adwoa Aboah. The case was settled in 2019.

DNA did not return a request for comment.

Garcia could not be reached for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Authorities busted a “24-hour open air bazaar” in Times Square where a crack-cocaine ring brazenly operated for nearly two years, officials said Tuesday.

The eight-man group of suspects is believed to have netted more than $10,000 a week fueled by ’round-the-clock shifts at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue, according to the NYPD and federal authorities, who unsealed an indictment against the crooks Tuesday.

“This crew gave new meaning to the slogan for New York City as the ‘city that never sleeps,’ by allegedly operating a 24-hour drug distribution ring,” said Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations Peter Fitzhugh in a statement.

A senior law-enforcement official noted to The Post that the sales occurred in an area with a vulnerable population living in the shadows of the glitz of Broadway.

“It’s important to note there are people particularly on 43rd Street and non-profits that are offering people [the] opportunity [for] recovering from addiction, striving for sobriety,” the source said.

“Their sensory is overloaded by these street urchins trying to sell them drugs. These people took advantage of some of those most vulnerable,” the disgusted source said.

Six of eight suspects in the ring were busted Monday night, authorities said.

Those arrested were identified as Johnny Perez, also known as “Ghost,” Aaron Starks, who goes by “Duke,” Sekou Simpson, nicknamed “Tre,” Fred Johnson, who goes by “Trinny,” Davon Mial, dubbed “Smooth,” and Donnell Bruns, known as “Mac.”

Aaron Starks, who goes by “Duke,” was arrested. Davon Mial, dubbed as “Smooth,” was also busted.

The two other suspects — Frayvon Young, also known as “Harlem,” and Robert Mason — are still at large, officials said.

The group peddled their illicit goods between at least December 2019 and this month, investigators said.

The operation, dubbed “Ghostbusters,” began when Perez, a member of the Mac Ballers, a subset of the Bloods gang, was identified and said to be using other people to peddle his product, law-enforcement sources said.

One “shift” of sellers — often overseen by Starks — arrived in the late morning and sold the drugs through the late afternoon, officials said.

The second shift was often supervised by Perez, according to the officials.

Suspect Donnell Bruns is also known as “Mac.” Fred Johnson goes by the name “Trinny.”

The investigation — using an undercover law-enforcement officer and surveillance video — revealed that hundreds of grams of crack were sold, police sources said.

Search warrants at three of the suspects’ homes uncovered about 500 grams of alleged crack, large sums of cash, pots and pans with residue, scales and a cash counter, police sources said.

During a period of 11 days this past March and April, the group conducted more than 650 hand-to-hand sales, officials said.

Officers previously busted Starks in January 2020 in the Times Square area, seizing from him about 312 capsules and 52 twists of crack cocaine, according to the officials.

Johnny Perez, known as “Ghost,” was nabbed. Sekou Simpson, nicknamed “Tre,” was arrested.

The investigation was handled by the NYPD, the US Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, and Homeland Security Investigations.

“As alleged, the defendants operated a veritable 24-hour open-air bazaar for the sale of crack cocaine in Times Square,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.

“We recall the bad old days of a much seedier Times Square that was unwelcoming, and we are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to ensure that those days remain just a memory.”

Police Commissioner Dermot Shea lauded his officers for their “work night and day to keep every corner of New York free from the scourge of illegal narcotics, including in the crossroads of the world.”

Suspect Frayvon Young, known as “Harlem,” is still at large for being part of the alleged Times Square drug ring. Robert Mason is still at large for being part of the alleged crack cocaine drug ring in Times Square.

Those already arrested will be presented Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses.

The charge they face carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa held a campaign rally to allege the de Blasio administration’s “reign of non-transparency” on the homeless crisis would continue under rival Eric Adams and the state’s incoming governor.

The Republican hopeful held a Tuesday night rally to mark the five year anniversary of a successful push by protestors to prevent a Maspeth Holiday Inn Express from being permanently converted into a homeless shelter.

Sliwa — donning his Guardian Angels beret and flanked by an enthusiastic group of working class advocates and politicians who alternatively cheered and jeered while toting colorful anti-de Blasio signs — said Adams’ first order of business with Kathy Hochul was lobbying her to sign a bill that would continue the controversial hotel policy.

“He requested a meeting with the incoming governor to encourage her to sign a state bill that would allow outer borough hotels to be used for mental health clinics,” Sliwa said.

The city is phasing out the hotel program, but a push to open 90 new homeless shelters is ongoing. Sliwa accused homeless czar Steve Banks of not seeking community input and ramming the facilities into outer borough communities that don’t want them.

“When I’m elected mayor this will end. $2.1 billion is spend each year for homeless services. And what do they succeed in doing? Warehousing men women and families. That’s all it is,” Sliwa said.

“You’re in by 10:00 at night, that’s the curfew. You get kicked out by 7:30 (a.m.) to roam the neighborhoods that you’ve been put into, many of whom never came from those neighborhoods. It creates an adversarial situation with your neighbors and those who are now clients of the Department of Homeless Services and it’s led to many, many problems.”

Other speakers accused Democratic officials of making “sweetheart deals” to benefit friends in the hotel industry, while doing a disservice to the city’s 60,000 people without homes, many of whom suffer from substance abuse and mental health problems.

Last month, Adams — who is heavily favored to defeat Sliwa — indicated he may keep Banks on board if he wins in November.

“There’s some commissioners and deputy mayors — you look at the amazing things that Banks has done. I knew him when he was an advocate for the legal services, and he was always an advocate,” the Democratic nominee told PIX 11. “I thought he brought fresh ideas.”

“We’re not looking to just remove everyone,” the current Brooklyn borough president said. “We want to have a real transition of looking at the best talent.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Before Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul was repulsed by outgoing Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s treatment of female staffers, she helped prop him up as a leading protector of women in the workplace.

Hochul called Cuomo’s behavior “repulsive and unlawful” shortly after James released her findings last week.

“New York State has zero tolerance when it comes to sexual assault in the workplace,” Hochul said in a 2018 press release from Cuomo’s office about a bill that would end mandatory arbitration for sexual harassment victims.

That same year, the governor allegedly kissed his special adviser, Lindsey Boylan, without her consent.

In 2017, Hochul applauded Cuomo’s effort to raise the age of consent to marry from 17 to 18.

“This administration has a strong record of promoting the interests of all women,” she said in another Cuomo press statement.

Around that time, Boylan says the governor suggested they “play strip poker” during flight home from an event in western New York.

During a 2016 stop at SUNY Geneseo about protecting coeds, Hochul said, “We have a governor who has three college-age daughters. He is very aware of the challenges we face and it troubled him deeply. “

“Gov. Cuomo came up with a plan to protect young people on campuses,” she said.

Last year Cuomo, 63, allegedly tried to get his 24-year-old executive assistant, Charlotte Bennett, to sleep with him.

And in 2019, Hochul championed Cuomo-led changes to policies that extended the statute of limitations for sexual harassment claims.

“These reforms build in New York’s nation-leading efforts to combat sexual harassment and make sure survivors have the tools and support they need to seek justice and hold abusers accountable,” Hochul said in a press release.

Attorney General Letitia James’ sexual harassment probe of Cuomo found that the governor and his team retaliated against at least one victim and created a “toxic” and hostile work environment for women in the Executive Chamber.

“It just really shows that she was wrong,” New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis told The Post about Hochul’s past praise for Cuomo.

“She was wrong, and those of us who have said over the years — that he was a bully, that he was not a nice guy, and that he was operating by a different standard than the one he imposed on the rest of society — were right,” Malliotakis said.

Cuomo has denied any bad intentions or inappropriate physical contact with women, claiming he was just joking around and being friendly.

Reps for Hochul did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York’s socialists are ready to man the barricades in the wake of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s shock resignation — declaring Wednesday that it’s time for them to “seize the moment.”

In an afternoon email blast, the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America said that “with Cuomo gone, we have removed the biggest roadblocks to our socialist platform.”

“We have so many campaigns whose potential for victory just increased exponentially,” the email said.

“We are within striking distance of winning universal healthcare, social housing, and a Green New Deal.”

NYC-DSA claimed credit for helping oust Cuomo, saying it “was one of the first organizations” to demand his impeachment over the sexual harassment scandal that forced him to resign in disgrace on Tuesday.

“The evidence was clear that Cuomo had abused his power to harass almost a dozen women and that, without enormous pressure, he would never give up power,” the email said.

“That’s why we fought for months with our progressive allies and our friends in organized labor to make sure the pressure was so overwhelming, Cuomo had no choice but to step down.”

In addition to dancing on his political grave, the group also solicited donations from its supporters, saying, “With your help today, NYC-DSA can seize the moment to help build a state for the many instead of just the privileged few.”

A spokesperson for Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who’s set to succeed Cuomo when his resignation takes effect, which he said would be Aug. 24, didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

But veteran Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf said that Hochul “should stay close to the center” if she wants to win a full term as governor.

“The issues in next year’s election will likely be crime, COVID and jobs. If the left controls the discussion, Hochul loses,” he said.

“The left’s position to defund the police is not a winning policy or strategy in a statewide election.”

Democratic mayoral candidate Eric Adams, who last month told supporters said that “DSA socialists are mobilizing to stop” him, said at an event in Brooklyn, “It’s clear I did not get one of those letters.”

Adams also noted the pending peaceful transfer of power from Cuomo to Hochul, saying, “That is what is amazing about America that I have never witnessed in socialist countries.”

Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa responded to the DSA email by saying that Cuomo’s resignation gave the GOP “a real opportunity to get back into the governor’s office.”

“Beware of what you feel you’re going to gain,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A 16-year-old girl was shot in the chest at a Connecticut mall Wednesday night, causing the building to be placed on lockdown.

Danbury police said officers responded to a report of shots fired near the Macy’s store at the Danbury Fair Mall shortly after 7 p.m. and found the girl conscious and alert.

She was transported to Danbury Hospital, where her condition is unknown. Her identity has not been revealed.

Danbury Police Chief Patrick Ridenhour told reporters the shooting stemmed from a confrontation between two groups of people and the victim was not the intended target.

The chief also said that the suspect’s group had left the building and police were examining surveillance video in an effort to identify them.

Tyreef Mahboob told Fox61 that he had just entered the mall when he heard “a loud popping noise.

“So my head, right away I just jumped up and was like, ‘What the heck was that?’ Somebody either dropped something, or that was a gunshot,” he said.

“I hesitated for a while, and then I just see people frantically running towards me,” Mahboob added. “So I started to back up and saw like a 16-year-old girl running past me, crying, saying her friend just got shot. Then I saw more and more people running and seeing that it’s the pandemic, people have masks on, so I didn’t know who was the shooter, so I turned around and ran out of there as well.”

Police said they believe the shooting was an isolated incident, but added that an investigation is ongoing, assisted by the Connecticut State Police and other local departments.

Ridenhour said late Wednesday police were investigating whether a white male seen running with a hammer was the shooter’s intended target.

No arrests have been made, and police say the investigation is ongoing. Ridenhour said the mall had been cleared and building management would determine whether it would open as normal on Thursday.

Authorities say the toddler, Ryan, was attacked by the dog at around 10:45 p.m. Tuesday inside an apartment on East 17th Street in Flatbush. Investigators believe Foster had left the child alone with two older brothers, 11-year-old Jayden and 9-year-old Tale’, to go to work.

Ryan’s father Vernon Jones has been charged with criminally negligent homicide after the dog attack.

The Rottweiler, named Buster, left Ryan bleeding heavily from bite wounds to his neck and shoulder, police said. The boy was pronounced dead at Maimonides Hospital.

Video obtained by The Post shows the two older siblings running from the apartment building and frantically asking passersby for help. Their mother, Susan Hyre — who is separated from Foster — said the brothers have been traumatized by their younger sibling’s death.

“They basically cried themselves to sleep,” she said. “Tale’ shares a room with Ryan and Jayden has his own room. Tale’ doesn’t want to sleep in the room where Ryan slept. He is literally asleep in the same bed with his brother. They don’t want to leave each other.”

Hyre told The Post that Buster was a “guard dog” that originally belonged to Foster’s parents and had bitten Jayden two years ago.

The dog was taken away by Animal Care and Control. The investigation is ongoing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He went off the rails.

Soon-to-resign Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s notorious bullying and micromanagement helped fuel years of dysfunction at the MTA, driving away top managers, causing labor strife and prioritizing high-profile construction projects over running trains.

“It’s a great metaphor for his entire tenure — the brutality and the threatening of the underlings — that was what the MTA experienced,” said Norman Brown, an MTA board member, representing the unions for the MetroNorth commuter rail.

“The last few years of demonizing the workforce, it’s been tough to justify,” he added. “Who wants to do business that way.”

The agency is currently confronting a major train operator shortage — driven by pandemic-era retirements and a hiring freeze — that’s caused thousands of cancellations and left fuming straphangers wasting their sometimes waiting 20 minutes or more for subway trains.

This latest crisis comes a little more than a year after Andy Byford quit, following a slew of highly publicized disputes as the governor publicly belittled and sidelined him, even as he oversaw a revitalization of the flailing subway system.

Brown told The Post that much of dysfunction was driven by two of Cuomo’s appointees to the MTA board, Larry Schwartz and Linda Lacewell, who are viewed by agency staff as the governor’s enforcers.

Both figured prominently in Attorney General Letitia James’s blistering 168-page report that affirmed and uncovered 11 women who were sexually harassed or groped by Cuomo and revealed how a “toxic” workplace environment allowed the abuses.

“I have no doubt that he enjoyed humiliating staff,” said a former MTA insider. “I watched him drag people into meetings just to do it.”

Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday during a press conference in Albany she planned to clean house of anyone closely tied to the wrongdoing uncovered by James’ office but was not specifically asked about Schwartz or Lacewell’s fates.

The MTA has suffered through massive turnover during Cuomo’s soon-to-truncated three terms as New York’s top boss. No chief of the city’s bus and subway system lasted for more than two years during the governor’s reign.

Nor was there any question about who was calling the shots at the nation’s largest transit operation, which carried more than 5 million people a day on the subways before the pandemic hit.

“He had a hold over the agency that was unprecedented,” said Jaqi Cohen of the Straphangers Campaign.

Cuomo installed Schwartz and other top aides at the MTA, personally interviewed many top managers and he and his aides were known to berate and big-foot staff over the smallest issues.

Byford went public after quitting, citing Cuomo’s treatment of his subordinates as one reason for his departure.

“I just would not accept the fact that my people were being yelled at,” he said last March in a television interview.

Cuomo picked Sarah Feinberg, a former federal rail official and PR professional, to replace Byford on an interim basis in 2020. She subsequently left the MTA after the state Senate rebuffed Cuomo’s request to make her the board’s chairman.

To Cohen and other transit activists, Cuomo was a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality, where they could find an ally or an enemy, depending on the issue and the day.

He managed to win the decades-long battle over congestion pricing, guaranteeing the agency a new funding stream for needed upgrades and repairs.

However, Cuomo’s focus on mega projects that continued to run massively over budget on his watch — like the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access — diverted funds and attention that could have sped badly needed subway signal upgrades.

“It proves how much he could have done if he cared about maintenance as much as he cared about big fancy projects,” Cohen added. “You can’t cut a ribbon on a subway signal. And those are the kinds of improvements that help everyday New Yorkers.”

Insiders and activists all point to the Byford saga as the clearest example of how Cuomo’s instincts could get it right — and then have it all go terribly wrong.

“The best way to view it is through the parable of Andy Byford,” said Danny Pearlstein, the spokesman for transit activist group Riders Alliance. “The governor had the foresight to bring Andy Byford here and then ran him off.”

The subway system was in crisis as years of deferred maintenance and upgrades finally caught up with the MTA, causing a meltdown that saw on-time figures for the system fall below 70 percent and left riders fuming.

Cuomo hired Byford to fix the mess as he was hammered over it by his 2018 Democratic primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon.

The Brit quickly earned good headlines as his tweaks to the system’s daily operations sped up trains and slashed delays.

But Cuomo tired of someone else getting the credit and began to publicly chafe.

In 2019, the governor organized a conference call where he mocked Byford’s $40 billion plan to modernize the subways signals, a day that one MTA insider describes as the “among the most surreal” of their time at the agency.

Cuomo then belittled the subway system’s station cleaners, triggering a public rebuke from Byford.

A hastily rolled out MTA reorganization plan that summer substantially reduced Byford’s authority at the agency and triggered months of speculation he was looking to leave, before he ultimately departed in 2020.

Cuomo’s love of controversial big-ticket projects didn’t stop at the MTA.

He muscled the Port Authority into approving a $2 billion AirTrain that would loop back from Willets Point to serve LaGuardia Airport, even though the price tag has quadrupled and opponents argue that extended the N line would be far more logical routing.

But, even with Cuomo’s resignation in two weeks, Port Authority insiders say the project “is proceeding as planned.”

“The critics can say what they want,” said Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi. “But, the facts are that without Governor Cuomo, newly accelerated projects like the Second Avenue Subway, the [Long Island Rail Road’s] Third Track and the L-train reconstruction and soon-to-be-completed East Side Access would have remained stalled … and the agency would have continued to languish as it had for decades.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s fall from grace will come with a nice golden parachute in the form of a $50,000-per-year lifetime pension that he will remain eligible for despite his resignation — provoking outrage from the disgraced executive’s critics.

The windfall for Cuomo, who announced his resignation on Tuesday in the midst of a sexual harassment scandal, is coming because he has accumulated 15 years of state service thanks to his 11 years as governor and four years as attorney general, a pension expert said.

“So if you’re wondering, without a felony conviction and several other steps, Cuomo would be eligible for his full pension, at taxpayer expense, for the rest of his life,” said Tim Hoefer, president and CEO of the Empire Center for Public Policy.

The Empire Center crunched the numbers based on Cuomo’s annual pay and years of service and estimated he would be eligible for $4,222 a month in retirement income or $50,662 a year for the rest of his life.

Currently, a public official could have his or her pension reduced or revoked if convicted of a felony under the “Public Integrity Reform Act” approved by Cuomo in 2011, his first year as governor.

But resignation for wrongdoing or impeachment does not trigger a claw-back of a public official’s pension.

Legislation has been introduced to impose pension forfeiture for a public official and apply it retroactively. But the measure requires passage of a constitutional amendment and its passage is doubtful.

The Cuomo pension stuck in the craw of the governor’s critics.

“The only reason I would support Cuomo getting a pension is if he donated it to the harassment victims or the nursing home families whose loved ones died from COVID because of his policies,” said Tracey Alvino said, whose dad, Daniel, was infected with COVID-19 in a Long Island nursing home and later died.

Alvino, who previously called Cuomo’s controversial $5.1 million COVID book deal “blood money ” added, “Otherwise New York should pass a law denying a pension to someone who resigns in disgrace for misconduct or is impeached.”

Erica Vladimer of the Sexual Harassment Working Group said, “We need to re-evaluate laws that don’t hold elected officials accountable when they abuse their power.”

“I would support a law denying a pension to a public official who is impeached. I still think Cuomo absolutely should be impeached. Resigning is not accountability.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Democratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams praised Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul as a “professional” who will lead the state with a “steady hand” after Andrew Cuomo leaves office in the wake of multiple scandals.

“She’s a professional,” Adams told reporters Wednesday after an event at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn.

“A steady hand is what we need right now when you turn over the state to an individual, you need someone with a steady hand. She has a steady hand, and I believe that she’s going to be able to navigate the challenges that we’re having and then voters will decide what’s going to happen in the future,” Adams said.

Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, reached out to Hochul Tuesday shortly after Cuomo announced he’d be stepping down.

“I called her and said, ‘Hey lieutenant governor, soon-to-be governor, there’s some very important items on the agenda — COVID, crime,'” Adams recounted.

“It’s not a new relationship, I’ve known Kathy, the lieutenant governor for some time and we just want to continue to communicate,” Adams said.

“‘She said, ‘Eric, I appreciate that a lot. Let’s do that,'” Adams recalled of the phone call.

He plans to meet with Hochul in the coming days to encourage her to sign a bill that would allow outer borough hotels to be used for mental health and homelessness services.

“That’s an important piece of legislation and I’m hoping that we can get some of the things that are on his desk signed during the next period of time,” Adams said.

He also gave a brief post mortem on Cuomo’s ten-year governorship.

“He had good points, he had bad points,” Adams said. On the plus side, Adams listed Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, passing same sex marriage and gun control laws.

But he dinged Cuomo on inadequate education funding for the city, affordable housing missteps and a lack of focus on handguns.

Finally Adams turned to his own political future.

“I am fueling the plane while I’m flying,” said Adams, who is heavily favored to win the general election in November.

“We have some huge items on our plate so I am moving around the city speaking with smart people who are willing to help and taking notes, taking names so that we will be ready to hit the ground running on day one,” he said. “So, we’re not being presumptuous, we’re being prepared.”

“In a few weeks we’re going to be announcing who is going to be our coordinating chair of this pseudo transition team,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul wishes Gov. Andrew Cuomo would not stick around for 14 days after announcing his resignation — saying Wednesday that his decision to give two weeks notice was not her choice.

“It’s not what I asked for,” said Hochul of the disgraced governor’s plan to have a 14-day transition period after quitting in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal.

“However, I’m looking forward to a smooth transition, which he promised.”

Hochul insisted she’s ready right now — and has been for years — to serve as the state’s chief executive.

“They viewed it as necessary. I’m prepared to take office, as any lieutenant governor is, from the very first hour you’re sworn in as lieutenant governor,” Hochul explained during a press conference in Albany, where she spoke publicly for the first time since Cuomo Wednesday said he’ll leave office.

In a bizarre decision, Cuomo said Tuesday that he’s stepping aside — but won’t leave office until 14 days later. In contrast, after former Gov. Elliot Spitzer resigned amid a sex scandal, David Paterson assumed the top position in New York State government just five days later.

Spitzer resigned on the 12th but it didn’t take effect until the 17th.

Hochul recalled that the current governor told her the gap between Cuomo announcing he’ll leave the governor’s mansion due to the fallout from the state Attorney General’s probe and her taking over is aimed at encouraging “continuity.”

“He spoke to me about wanting to make sure that the transition — that continuity is important, that I have an opportunity to meet the cabinet officials, other people as well,” she said.

Hochul promised to “take advantage” of the gap and to “engage with the people of the state of New York.”

Arthur Shapolsky — whose self-proclaimed real estate “empire” is behind some of the largest commercial offices in New York City — bought the four-story building that housed Tender Buttons on East 62nd Street and Lexington Avenue from its 87-year-old owner Milicent Safro in 2019, according to The Real Deal.

He sued her last year, claiming she duped him into thinking the deal included a 6-inch strip connecting the backside of the lot to Lexington Avenue — which would have allowed him to build along the tony Upper East Side corridor, according to the outlet.

Shapolsky claimed Safro told him about the half-foot strip but that he later discovered it didn’t actually exist, according to the March 2020 lawsuit, which demanded back his $500,000 deposit on the property.

But on Thursday, Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Phillip Hom all but sewed up the case — tossing Shapolsky’s complaint and ordering that he cough up the $500,000 down payment with interest, according to the report.

Nothing in the contract referenced the six-inch strip and it was unlikely that “a sophisticated real-estate developer with decades of experience in the Manhattan real estate market” would be tricked by the elderly gal, Hom wrote.

The judge also poked holes in Shapolsky’s argument by citing to two cases from the 1990s in which he was accused of fraud and was allowed to keep the down payment, according to the outlet.

Safro ran the button shop for more than 50 years before it closed in 2019, according to The New Yorker.

The filmmaker Nora Ephron featured the store in her 2009 movie “Julie & Julia,” and later described it as a “walk-in treasure chest” for lovers of history, sewing and fashion.

Safro and Shapolsky, who runs Arthur Shapolsky Real Estate, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@So much for the friendly skies.

An Albany man who rented billboards bashing Gov. Andrew Cuomo hired a plane to fly over the Capitol Wednesday with the message: “GOODBYE GOVERNOR BAD TOUCH! YOUR FRIEND BRIAN.”

Brian Olesen, 50, was inspired to take his frustrations to new heights after the disgraced New York leader’s “sickening” press conference Tuesday, “where he was attacking victims and his justifying actions.”

“Without a doubt, it’s a celebration,” Olesen said of his high-minded stunt.

The “friend” bit is “obviously sarcastic,” he added, quipping, “I’m one of his biggest supporters.”

He continued, “No, I think the man is a disgusting human being.”

Olesen, the owner of Albany-area gun store American Shooter Supply, previously took out an electronic billboard along Interstate 787 that first targeted Cuomo with his photo and the word “Impeach!” then “Resign Now!”

It was changed in March to read “Liar!” in big red letters to coincide with the soon-to-be-former governor’s scandals — starting with the nursing home crisis and alleged cover-up of the true death count of residents from COVID-19 to the sexual harassment accusations that brought him down.

“I didn’t want to spend the money but after being exposed to that psychotic I had to,” said Olesen, adding he spent around $12,000 on the flyover missive and billboard, which now reads “Pig.”

“I think the man is a disgusting human being,” Olesen said of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Brian Olesen

“Between the senior citizens and the 11 women he harassed that we know of, this man will go down as the worst political servant we’ve ever seen in my lifetime,” he said.

Olesen, who said he is part Italian-American, was also outraged that Cuomo appeared to try to write off his creepy behavior with women as “cultural behavioral differences” during his resignation announcement.

“He insulted every single Italian-American in the country by blaming his heritage for how he treats women,” Olesen said. “It shows how out of touch he is.”

Asked whether he would have any other eye-grabbing messages for Cuomo, Olesen said “stay tuned.”

For now, he thinks the fallen politician — who officially leaves office Aug. 24 — should get “counseling” and “move out of the country.”

“What an embarrassment he is to the state of New York,” Olesen said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul — who will soon take over for disgraced Gov. Andrew Cuomo — on Wednesday distanced herself from the outgoing chief executive, pledging not to foster a “toxic” environment as the state attorney general probe documented.

“I think it’s very clear that the governor and I have not been close — physically or otherwise — in terms of much time,” Hochul said during a press conference in Albany, where she made her first public appearance since Cuomo announced Tuesday that he will resign within two weeks.

Hochul insisted that in recent months she’s been “traveling the state” and doesn’t “spend much time” in Cuomo’s “presence or in the presence of many in the state Capitol.”

Hochul declared, “At the end of my term, whenever it ends, no one will ever describe my administration as a toxic work environment.”

Alongside the substantiation of 11 sexual harassment allegations, Attorney General Letitia James’ probe described Cuomo’s treatment of staff as “toxic” and “bullying.”

After Cuomo’s departure from the governor’s mansion, Hochul will become the first woman governor of New York State.

While in charge of the Empire State’s government, the 62-year-old former member of Congress pledged to “fight like hell” for New Yorkers to help the state stay healthy amid the COVID-19 pandemic — and to rebound from it.

“It’s going to take all of us working together to keep our children safe, our teachers safe, and anyone who works in a school safe,” said Hochul.

“Small businesses are just starting to bounce back into an uncertain world. We need to reassure them that they will be OK,” Hochul went on.

Workers, she said, are weighing if it’s safe enough to return to offices and factories as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads in the Empire State.

“But I know New Yorkers,” she said. “They are hard-wired to persevere and to prevail. And the promise I made to all New Yorkers, right here and right now, I will fight like hell for you every single day, like I’ve always done and always will.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The teen brother of the slain 7-year-old in the Bronx allegedly admitted that he assaulted his sister before she was found dead in their apartment, police sources said Wednesday.

The shocking admission was revealed Wednesday as more details of the girl’s unremitting toxic home life came to light, with family and neighbors describing alleged physical abuse and sources saying city officials only recently returned the girl to her mother.

The tragic girl’s lifeless body — with evidence of trauma all over — was found Tuesday morning, but the girl’s mom told cops she fell and hit her head on a desk, sources said at the time.

The girl’s 17-year-old brother later admitted during questioning that he had punched his sister eight times in the face when their mother went to the store around 5 a.m., police sources said.

Hours later, the girl started throwing up and passed out, prompting the 35-year-old mom to call 911.

The girl, who was identified as Julissia Batties, was rushed to Lincoln Hospital but could not be saved.

Cops have been called to the apartment in NYCHA’s Mitchel Houses on Alexander Avenue six times over the past three years, according to sources, who said that on at least one of those occasions, the mother covered for the teen boy.

The last call came in March 2020, sources said.

In one of the assaults, the teen told cops his mom lied to the Administration for Children’s Services when they showed up at their home and questioned the 7-year-old’s black eye, sources said.

The mom allegedly told officials with the agency that a younger sibling hit the girl with a toy gun by accident, according to sources.

The mother denied knowing of her son attacking his younger sister, the sources said.

“Those kids shouldn’t have been living in that house,” a high-ranking police source railed on Wednesday.

Another source told The Post the girl was returned to her mother in June after previously being placed in her grandmother’s custody. The details of why the girl was removed were not immediately known.

The young girl’s grandma, Yolanda Davis, said city officials have taken each of the troubled mom’s seven kids away at some point.

“My granddaughter was in pediatric counseling to find out what was going on,” Davis said. “Any time we mentioned Julissa’s mother’s name, my granddaughter ran down the hallway.”

Davis demanded justice for her granddaughter’s death.

“I’m destroyed. I’m very numb, frustrated, very hurt,” she said.

Neighbors in the building said the mom had three children — the 7-year-old girl, the 17-year-old boy and another boy around 3 years old.

Police and the Bronx District Attorney’s Office were awaiting the autopsy results Wednesday before filing any charges, the sources added.

Michael Roberts, a 31-year-old neighbor, called the mom’s story “bulls–t.”

“There ain’t no way no baby fell and hit her head on the desk,” he said.

“Everybody knew the baby was being abused,” Roberts claimed, adding his girlfriend called child services on the mother just last week when she spotted the girl with a black eye, hidden behind a pair of sunglasses.

“I feel they should have taken all three kids away from her a long time ago,” he added.

Roberts said his girlfriend has seen ACS knocking on their door “plenty of times” and blamed the agency for not doing more.

“If you come more than three times, you know it’s not a–whipping, it’s abuse… The baby got bruises,” he said. “If they had to come more than once, they should have taken the kids.”

A memorial was set up for the girl inside the building — with a stuffed Minnie Mouse doll, flowers and three prayer candles.

A spokesman for ACS declined to provide specifics on the outcome of the visits.

“Our top priority is protecting the safety and wellbeing of all children in New York City,” the spokesman said. “We are investigating this case with the NYPD.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said Friday he will “suspend” the impeachment investigation into Gov. Andrew Cuomo, arguing that the probe was unneeded after the scandal-scarred executive announced his intention to resign, even though investigators had found evidence of misconduct.

“[T]he Assembly will suspend its impeachment investigation upon the governor’s resignation taking effect on August 25,” Heastie said in a statement released by his office Friday, in a decision that he said was backed by his fellow Democrats, who control the chamber.

The Assembly’s attorneys concluded that New York’s state constitution did not allow them to move to impeach an official who had already stepped down from office, Heastie said.

The announcement came just three days after Cuomo stunned the state by announcing he would resign from office instead of battling for his political survival following the publication of a bombshell 168-page report from Attorney General Letitia James, which allege he sexually harassed or groped 11 women, including several state employees, which he has repeatedly denied.

In an interview with New York Magazine published Friday, his first since announcing his resignation, Cuomo claimed he would have escaped impeachment — and that the Legislature would have ended up looking “like a ship of fools.”

“I’m not gonna drag the state through the mud, through a three-month, four-month impeachment, and then win, and have made the State Legislature and the state government look like a ship of fools, when everything I’ve done all my life was for the exact opposite,” he told the mag. “I’m not doing that. I feel good. I’m not a martyr. It’s just, I saw the options, option A, option B.”

AP

“I feel like I did the right thing. I did the right thing for the state,” by resigning, Cuomo added.

In an interview with Spectrum News 1’s “Capital Tonight”, Heastie denied claims that he had halted the investigation as part of a deal with the governor.

“There was no deal,” Heastie said. “I’ve said that 150 times and I’ll make that the 151st time.”

Lawmakers were blindsided by Heastie’s announcement, which came as progressive members and reformers in his caucus pushed to continue the probe if only to produce a public report, sources told The Post.

“The State of New York deserves an official report on the investigation our committee and our attorney have conducted on the four charges,” Assemblyman Tom Abinanti (D-Westchester), who sits on the committee that was leading the probe and said he was only informed of the decision to suspend the probe Friday morning. “Closing the committee investigation at this point is premature. Gov. Cuomo has not even left office.”

The six Republican members of the Assembly’s Judiciary Committee said in a statement that they were “outraged” by Heastie’s decision and called for the panel to release a full report of what it had uncovered so far.

“Let there be no mistake, this decision was reached by the Democrat leadership in the Assembly without consultation or approval of the entire Judiciary Committee,” their statement read. “Not only does this represent an egregious insult to the countless victims of Gov. Cuomo’s actions, but it is offensive to the men and women who have invested their time and energy on a critical investigation into public corruption.

“While some are intent on bringing the pursuit of truth to an abrupt end, we firmly believe our work is far from complete,” the members added. “At a minimum, the public deserves to see the results of the five-month investigation which they paid for.”

In addition to the harassment allegations, the Assembly’s impeachment probe was also examining allegations that Cuomo used taxpayer resources to draft his $5 million COVID memoir, misled the public about nursing home deaths during the pandemic and covered up safety issues at the new Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, which replaced the Tappan Zee.

The committee’s chairman, Charles Lavine (D-Long Island) refused Friday to commit to releasing a report detailing the probe’s findings, despite calls from lawmakers like Abinanti.

“I will discuss matters such as these after the Cuomo resignation,” Lavine told The Post before hanging up on the reporter.

Cuomo’s victims were also outraged by Heastie’s abrupt decision to pull the plug on the probe.

“The Assembly’s decision to call off its impeachment investigation is an unjust cop out,” tweeted Lindsey Boylan, who was the first woman to accuse Cuomo publicly of misconduct. “The public deserves to know the extent of the Governor’s misdeeds and possible crimes. His victims deserve justice and to know he will not be able to harm others.”

And one of the state senators who would have helped decide Cuomo’s fate in any impeachment trial was similarly upset.

“This is incredibly disappointing, and ensures that there will be no accountability or justice for the Governor’s misdeeds,” tweeted state Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Brooklyn). “I hope that whatever evidence was collected as part of the impeachment inquiry is acted upon expeditiously by the appropriate and relevant authorities.”

In his statement, Heastie (D-Bronx) offered a glimpse into the “credible” evidence already uncovered by the Assembly’s investigators “in relation to allegations that have been made in reference to the governor.”

“Underscoring the depth of this investigation, this evidence concerned not only sexual harassment and misconduct but also the misuse of state resources in relation to the publication of the governor’s memoir as well as improper and misleading disclosure of nursing home data during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. “This evidence — we believe — could likely have resulted in articles of impeachment had he not resigned.”

Heastie said that he had instructed the chair of the Assembly’s Judiciary Committee, Charles Lavine (D-Long Island), who was overseeing the probe, to turn the evidence he’d assembledover tofederal and local prosecutors for their own probes.

The feds in Brooklyn are probing if Cuomo and other state officials misled authorities in Washington about pandemic-related deaths in nursing homes.

Heastie cited those investigations as part of his justification for stopping the Assembly probe.

“The concern behind that is if you’re in the middle of an investigation and other law enforcement is in the middle of this, I don’t want to step on their toes while there are criminal investigations that are ongoing,” the speaker told “Capitol Tonight.”

He also blasted Republicans accusing him of giving the soon-to-be-former governor special treatment as “hypocritical.”

“I think the Republicans are being a little hypocritical for trying to accuse me, the first Democratic Assembly speaker to call for the impeachment inquiry of a governor of my own party,” Heastie said.

“I don’t know how I can be accused of that if this committee uncovered evidence on the book and the nursing homes,” he added.

But one of Cuomo’s accusers told The Post that she would like to see him impeached just to bar him from ever holding statewide office again.

“He has almost $20 million in the bank and unless he’s impeached he can use it to run again,” said Karen Hinton, who was once worked for Cuomo and angered the governor by then working for Mayor Bill de Blasio, with whom he frequently feuded.

“Based on the AG report he’s unfit for office,” she added. “The impeachment should have continued to make sure he doesn’t hold public office again.”

One of the officers who stopped by the memorial in her building Friday brought a bouquet of multicolored roses to mark her passing.

His male colleague also left a brown teddy bear with a heart attached to one of its feet.

“It was just sad what happened,” one of the cops said. “We wanted to do something.”

Both men made the sign of the cross before standing silently at the vigil for several minutes.

Julissia’s body was discovered Tuesday morning inside mom Navasia Jones’ 10th-floor apartment at the NYCHA housing project.

Her 17-year-old half-brother later admitted during police questioning that he had struck the child several times in the face when their mother went to the store around 5 a.m.

Police sources later said those blows were not what ultimately killed her.

Hours later, the girl started throwing up and went unconscious, prompting her mother to call 911.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Disgraced Gov. Andrew Cuomo doesn’t have a clue what he is going to do next — or where he will live — now that he’s set to leave the Executive Mansion later this month, he said in his first interview since announcing his resignation.

“Uh, I don’t know what I’m gonna do,” Cuomo, 63, told New York Magazine when asked about his immediate plans, including where he was going to reside, in an article published Friday.

The scandal-scarred New York executive announced his intent to step down Tuesday amid bombshell allegations of sexual harassment and looming impeachment proceedings, which have since been suspended.

It’s unclear where Cuomo will move to after his last day on Aug. 24. He does not own any property in his name, according to available public records. His last private residence was the four-bedroom Mount Kisco abode he shared with his ex, Sandra Lee, which was in her name. Cuomo moved out in 2019, and Lee sold the Colonial she called Lily Pond in 2020 for $1.85 million.

Wherever he ends up, Cuomo told the magazine he would maintain his public “voice.”

“I’m not disappearing. I have a voice, I have a perspective and that’s not gonna change,” he said. “And the details aren’t really that important to me to tell you the truth.”

“You know? I’m a New Yorker, I’ve lived here, I’ve lived in Queens, I’ve lived in the city, I’ve lived upstate, I’ve lived everywhere, I came to Washington, so that’s … I don’t really care about that,” Cuomo continued, “I’ll figure that out.”

The Democrat, who is in his third gubernatorial term, added he believes he “did the right thing” by choosing to resign instead of battling for his political survival following the publication of the bombshell report from state Attorney General Letitia James, which alleges he sexually harassed or groped 11 women, including several state employees, which he has denied.

Cuomo said he felt his resignation was the best choice for the state, as opposed to going through a lengthy public impeachment proceeding — which he thinks he would have won.

“I’m not gonna drag the state through the mud, through a three-month, four-month impeachment, and then win, and have made the State Legislature and the state government look like a ship of fools, when everything I’ve done all my life was for the exact opposite,” he told the mag. “I’m not doing that. I feel good. I’m not a martyr. It’s just, I saw the options, option A, option B.”

“I feel like I did the right thing. I did the right thing for the state,” Cuomo added.

“[T]he Assembly will suspend its impeachment investigation upon the governor’s resignation taking effect on August 25,” Heastie said in a statement released by his office Friday, in a decision that he said was backed by his fellow Democrats, who control the chamber.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@From tourist trap to culinary nirvana. That’s been the long, strange trip of Pier 17 in the Seaport District, previously known as the South Street Seaport.

Current Seaport owner the Howard Hughes Corp. lured marquee-name chefs — Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Andrew Carmellini and David Chang — and their arrival has proved transformational. The new pier, which resembles a floating fortress more than a dock for ships, has blossomed into a one-stop-noshing complex for three of the city’s most exalted chefs.

This isn’t your mommy or daddy’s Seaport of the 1980s, ’90s or early aughts with its tacky bars and bistros that relied on harbor views to draw tourists and boozy Wall Street Yuppies. (Remember them?)

Rather, the Seaport and the pier, especially, are now a mecca for actual New Yorkers to live and play. Today, some 70,000 of them call the FiDi home, as opposed to the day when 95 percent of the area was devoted to office space. Seaport visitors were 83 percent local just before the pandemic, according to the Howard Hughes Corp., and with travel limited, it’s above 90 percent today.

In addition to spots from top toques, the Pier’s other offerings include farm-to-table fare from Malibu Farm and rooftop revelry at the Greens. But it’s the new projects from Vongerichten, Carmellini and Chang that are really satisfying residents’ appetites.

“With three great restaurants, I no longer have to trek to Soho, the West Village or Tribeca to be in the mix,” said Merv Matheson, the CEO of lifestyle management firm Inner Circle Connect, who lives in the FiDi. “I can keep it all within walking distance.”

Have a look.

Carne Mare

Previous 1 of 3 Next Chef Andrew Carmellini recently opened Carne Mare on Pier 17 in Manhattan. The gorgeous new dining room at Carne Mare. An exterior shot of Carne Mare.

Several years in the making, Carmellini’s newly opened, two-story Italian-style chop house was worth the wait. The richly furnished main dining room, up a curving staircase from a rollicking horseshoe-shaped bar, is decked out with lacquered terracotta walls and brass trim galore. Tuscan leather banquettes face each other to maximize people-watching. You might well spot Carmellini himself running things in the open kitchen. There are a few al fresco tables, but the heart of the restaurant is inside, making it the coziest place on the pier in cold or rain.

The menu boasts an array of carpaccios and tartares ($18 to $23), along with wonderful salads ($15 to $17), each large enough to share, including an excellent Sicilian-style Caesar with sesame dressing. US prime cuts of beef ($36 to $185) are the stars of the show. The Gorgonzola-cured Wagyu strip loin sirloin is an original preparation with a winning musky depth that doesn’t overwhelm the beef. There’s even old-fashioned tableside service for certain dishes such as steamed black sea bass that’s skinned and sauced before your eyes.

“It’s my favorite new place to dine,” enthused Ronnie DeMichael, who’s with Roc Nation Apparel Group and lives a short stroll away.

There’s no bo ssäm on the menu, but the scents of kimchi, kalbi and gochujang waft on river breezes throughout the open-air space. Favorite dishes include smoked sweet-and-sour ribs ($19), cacio e pepe rice cakes with truffles ($48), and a sizzling, kalbi-marinated flank steak ($36) that rightfully seems to be ordered by just about every table. The wide-ranging wine list is more adventurous than the menu with unusual choices from the Pacific Northwest, France, Italy, Germany and Austria.

Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s jumbo seafood joint finally hit full stride this summer after braving two pandemic closings and several redesign tweaks.

There are 240 seats indoors and out across two levels.

My favorite dishes include crispy fish tacos made with Icelandic cod ($19), an unusual mozzarella-and-octopus appetizer ($24) and roasted black sea bass ($54).

The views and the food from Vongerichten and chef Noah Poses are so delicious, even uptowners are coming down to the pier.

Kings County led the city’s massive population growth over the past decade with a 9.2 percent jump — higher than any other borough, according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau.

But there’s a stark demographic divide behind that increase.

White residents saw their ranks climb by 8.4 percent increase while black residents saw an 8.7 percent decline.

Democratic mayoral nominee and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams expressed concern about that drop at a press conference at the Gowanus Houses on Friday.

“We can’t see the future of this city rise, and the decrease of hope decline for black, brown and poor New Yorkers,” he said.

Adams said he would only support the rezoning of the trendy neighborhood — including new high-rise apartment buildings with market rate unit — if Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $274 million to fix the area’s aging public housing.

New York City Housing Authority residents are largely black and Hispanic. Brooklyn’s Hispanic population grew by 6 percent between 2010 and 2020.

Overall, the five boroughs gained 629,057 people in that time, which equates to a massive 7.7 percent population jump. But the black population across the city decreased by 4.5 percent.

“The largest decrease in populations in this city are black folks, and I don’t want to see our city built up and displace black folks who have been here for a long time making this a great city,” Adams said.

This year’s census report continues the trend of black residents abandoning Brooklyn. Between 2000 and 2010 the black population shrunk from 849,000 to 799,000. It’s now at 730,000.

Many black Gowanus Houses residents cited housing costs as the reason for the exodus.

“People are leaving because they don’t have a choice economically,” said Betty Lester, 73, whose daughter moved to Delaware five years ago because she couldn’t afford to buy a home in Brooklyn.

“What she’s paying for a mortgage is less than what a lot of people pay in rent in the hood,” Lester said.

Generra Garris, 26, said some of her neighbors have left the projects for a better life.

“They’re moving out of these communities,” Garris told The Post. “I feel like that’s something also that is playing a part because they want out of these bad environments. They want better for themselves, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” she said.

John Mollenkopf, director of the Center of Urban Research at CUNY’s Graduate Center, said the population shift is more than just gentrification.

Many black homeowners who moved to the borough from the south in the 1940s through 1960s are now retired, selling their Brooklyn homes at a significant profit and returning down south.

Other black Brooklynites have moved up and out.

“There’s been an upward trend in incomes and professional standing and education and they’re suburbanizing just like the white ethnics in the generation before them,” Mollenkopf said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@And just like that, COVID-weary New York City turned into a playground for the “Sex and the City” ladies.

Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis (sans Kim Cattrall) are filming scenes for their HBO Max spinoff, “And Just Like That . . .,” all over the Big Apple, sending superfans into a tizzy trying to catch a glimpse of the stars or land a scoop. Numerous Instagram accounts have sprung up to chronicle the on-location magic, which is bringing back a touch of pre-pandemic glamour and frivolity to the city.

“[The show] is the hottest social hunt of the summer,” Gregory Littley (@littleylittley), a content creator who has captured footage for his more than 20,000 Instagram followers, told The Post. “It’s thrilling, nostalgic and fun to post. The response on social has been a resounding ‘Welcome back, ladies.’ “

Littley, 37, helped tip off fans to a possible juicy plot line when he recorded the first sighting of Bridget Moynahan, a k a Big’s ex Natasha, on set near Balthazar, as he was shopping in Soho with his husband.

“Bridget Moynahan was there, but no one was picking up on it. My husband even thought it was Kristin Davis,” recalled Littley, who recognized that her presence was a big scoop — especially after Page Six reported that Big (Chris Noth) and Carrie (Parker) would be getting divorced.

“Big’s ex is back? What are the implications?” he said. The self-proclaimed “SATC” superfan made a short TikTok video of a chic-looking Moynahan walking on set. The video was viewed more than 200,000 times within the first 24 hours and spawned headlines on nearly every entertainment site.

Other fans say sightings of SJP and Co. are confirming plot twists in their own lives. Stumbling upon Parker on a Nolita set helped fashion executive Shay Gipson know her impending move from Los Angeles to the Big Apple was the right one.

Gipson, a former New Yorker, went West a few years ago but was recently summoned back by a new employer. Last month, she was in town looking for housing and went to a fashion event at the Crosby Street Hotel, where a film crew was set up in front. After her event wrapped, Gipson came out at the exact moment Parker pulled up to the set in a pink frock.

“I was like, ‘Oh, this is my big return to New York and here is SJP filming,’ ” said Gipson, who, years ago, used to bump into Parker at the Serge Normant salon on 23rd Street where the two would chat about the fashion industry. Gipson said the run-in felt like the universe was telling her she was in the right place.

“It solidified my return. I am definitely back in New York,” she said. “I felt like it was definitely an omen.”

For local businesses, the filming is also proving to be auspicious.

When the show recently shot a brunch scene at the East Pole on East 65th Street, crowds formed around the popular restaurant; it was like One Direction was in town.

“The excitement from the fans was palpable,” East Pole owner Anthony Martignetti told The Post. “When [the cast] got out of the town cars, people were screaming the characters’ names. They were really freaking out for Stanford [Willie Garson].”

Martignetti first opened the East Pole with his brother 10 years ago. When the two learned that “And Just Like That . . .” would be filming a brunch scene at their place, it was an exciting honor.

“I remember being a bartender in the city when the show was in its first season,” Martignetti recalled. “Places like SushiSamba and Magnolia Bakery, they really made it on there.”

In the aftermath of the shoot, a steady flow of superfans from the far reaches of Long Island have come into the restaurant, hungry for both farm-to-table fare and plot details.

“A lot of mother-and-daughter teams who follow the filming on Instagram have come in for brunch for the first time,” said Martignetti, adding that it’s been a bright spot for his staff in a tough pandemic year. “It was really exciting for us to have a momentary distraction from the mandates we are under.”

The East Pole wasn’t the only one to get its close-up. Server Mark Sopcyk was there while they were scouting, and he and Nixon hit it off. She requested that they not cast a random actor as their waiter but use Sopcyk, who is a stage performer.

“They signed him up with SAG right away and got his paperwork. He was super thrilled to be on there,” Martignetti said.

The shoot has also turned the city into a runway, showcasing the ladies’ over-the-top fashions. Original stylist Patricia Field is not working on the revival because she’s toiling away on Season Deux of “Emily in Paris,” but her collaborator Molly Rogers has taken the sartorial reins. Her head-turning looks have brought fashionistas to the set and inspired Instagram accounts devoted to the style.

“The sets are also a fashion show,” photographer Steve Sands, who has shot the stars on location, told The Post. “That’s what fans come to see.”

Some clothing choices have been controversial — such as the rumored Forever 21 dress worn by Carrie that a Venice Beach, California, boutique called Raga later claimed. The styles have been feverishly chronicled by Rogers’ own fan fashion account, @AndJustLikeThatCostumes, as well as unaffiliated popular accounts such as @JustLikeThatCloset, @SexAndTheCity_NewYork and @CarrieBradshaw_SexAndTheCity.

“I have been shooting different movies for a while, and this is the first time I’ve seen people this excited. You can feel it in the air,” said photographer Elder Ordonez, who has shot many on set-style moments, including the contentious boho dress. But he also feels the excitement on social media. He said his “SATC” revival snaps “are getting more interaction than any of my other photos. There’s so much interest.”

Littley noted that, in the present moment, frenzy around the filming transcends the latest between Carrie and Big.

He said: “It feels like a rebirth [in the city].”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A city Department of Transportation worker was shot with a BB gun in an apparently random attack while on the job in Brooklyn, cops said Friday.

The 41-year-old man was hit with a small pellet in the back while bending over working around 8:10 a.m. near East 19th Street and Avenue L in Midwood, according to cops.

The man was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.

Law-enforcement sources said the shooting appeared to be random.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Brooklyn dad who left his young kids home alone with the family Rottweiler — only to have the beast fatally maul his 19-month-old son — admitted to cops he knew the dog was “dangerous,” court papers show.

Vernon Foster was charged with criminally negligent homicide, manslaughter and acting in a manner injurious to a child after the attack Tuesday that killed his son Ryan.

The dad was held on $50,000 bail at his arraignment in Brooklyn Criminal Court on Thursday night.

The tragedy unfolded around 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, after Foster left sons Jayden, 11, Tale’, 9, and Ryan home alone with the dog, named Buster, while the dad went to his job at Home Depot, cops said at the time.

Buster viciously attacked Ryan, prompting the toddler’s siblings to run out onto the sidewalk in front of their apartment on East 17th Street in Flatbush and desperately plead with passers-by for help, according to cops and video.

The brothers eventually flagged down a good Samaritan who went into the home and found Buster standing over the child, court papers say. Ryan had “multiple puncture wounds to the neck, face, and body,” according to the criminal complaint.

The father, who is separated from the kids’ mother, was charged in his son’s death the next day.

Vernon Foster’s 19-month-old son, Ryan, was left with “multiple puncture wounds” after being mauled by the family Rottweiler.

The dog was described by the mother as an aggressive “guard dog,” which bit her other child, Jayden, two years ago in an attack that left scars still visible to this day.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Saturday was Moving Day at the Executive Mansion — for at least one member of the Cuomo family.



Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s daughter, Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo, was spotted early in the afternoon schlepping her belongings from the Albany residence that her dad will be vacating in a matter of days.





Kennedy-Cuomo, 23, wearing floral overalls and a tank top, hauled out a cardboard moving box, tote bags, a backpack and what looked like a ukulele case. She placed them in a black SUV, which she got into and then took off.



Kennedy-Cuomo has stood loyally by her dad, accompanying him to Manhattan Tuesday when he announced he would be resigning amid allegations that he sexually harassed 11 current and former employees.

Cuomo said he wouldn’t leave for 14 days, and has no home other than the Executive Mansion.



“Um, I don’t know what I’m going to do,” Cuomo told New York magazine when asked about his immediate plans.



Not everyone seemed sorry Saturday to see Cuomo depart.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The victim Jayquan Lewis, 21. Family photo

Horrifying footage obtained by The Post on Saturday shows the moment a cold-blooded assassin fatally shoots a man seven times inside a Bronx deli — turning the store into a scene described by one ex-cop as something out of “Carlito’s Way.”



The 14-second surveillance clip from the Friday afternoon ambush inside the B.H. Gourmet Deli on Bainbridge Avenue in Fordham Manor shows the victim, 21-year-old “Law & Order” extra Jayquan Lewis, among at least five people in the bodega as he waited to buy a bottle of Poland Spring water.



One customer leaves the store as the gunman suddenly emerges from the back, dressed in denim shorts, a white tank top and sneakers and wearing a black cross-body bag.



The killer walks by a man standing near the deli door, lifts his arm and starts blasting at Lewis — who falls to the ground, his legs seen shaking in the disturbing footage. Lewis was struck three times in the chest, three times in the arm and once in the stomach, sources said.

“The assassination reminds me of the scene from ‘Carlito’s Way’ when Al Pacino’s character gets shot by Benny Blanco from the Bronx,” said Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective who is now an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

Jayquan Lewis was blasted three times in the chest, three times in the arm and one time in the stomach.

A high ranking NYPD source said Lewis was killed over a beef on social media and may have had gang ties — which cops are still probing,



Joseph Giacalone, an adjunct professor at John Jay College and a former NYPD sergeant said the killing appeared “personal.”



“I have no doubt that (the victim) was targeted. The guy standing next to him could’ve easily been killed too, but wasn’t,” he said.



Lewis’ mom, Marisol Sanchez, denied that her son was involved with a gang — but she said she always worried about his safety and warned him, “I don’t want you on the street” before he left home Friday to buy a cold drink on that scorching day.



Lewis told his mom “I love you” before setting out to the nearby deli.

“I warned him because so much stuff has been going on around here. I have seen so many shootings and I’ve been seeing a lot of killings. That was one of my biggest fears, something happening to my son,” said Sanchez, who was wearing a T-shirt with an image of Pablo Escobar that belonged to Jayquan.



Sanchez, 46, said her son, who was known as JJ and was one of five siblings who “loved acting” and wanted to study nursing, did not have enemies. His mom said he was an extra on Law & Order, and Lewis also appeared in the 2019 movie “Joyland,” according to IMDB.



Sanchez said he appeared in 2013 the movie “The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete” and the actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje even asked her son for his autograph telling him “I know you’re going to make it one day.”



“He was not a troublemaker. He was not those types of kids,” she insisted.

If provoked, however, he would fight back, the mom added.



Sanchez, a recently retired postal worker, said the family was thinking of moving from the Bronx because of the escalating violence there.



“We wanted to go an hour or maybe two hours away from here, to a more quiet area,” she said.

Shootings in the 52nd Precinct, which includes Fordham Manor, increased 46 percent through Aug. 8, with 19 up from 13 during the same period in 2020.



There were two murders through Aug. 8, a 33 percent decline from the same period in 2020 when there were three.



Citywide, shooting incidents have increased 15 percent through Aug. 8 to 942 from 820 during the same time frame last year. Murders were up by 0.8 percent to 260 from 258.



Maria Ramirez, 63, who has lived in Fordham Manor for 34 years, said she felt uncomfortable on Bainbridge.



“This street is dangerous especially after COVID-19 with crazy people on the street,” she said. “I feel nervous a lot of the time, and check my surroundings when I walk.”



Workers at the B.H. Gourmet Deli are nervous now, too.



“I don’t feel comfortable like before,” one said. “ But what can I do? I just work here.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The NYPD is mourning another detective who lost her battle with COVID-19.

Det. Shantay Neal-Baker, a veteran officer assigned to the Risk Mitigation Division, succumbed to coronavirus complications on Saturday, department brass said.

The 42-year-old detective “faithfully served the people of NYC for 20 years,” Commissioner Dermot Shea said in a statement.

“Our hearts go out to her friends & family — and we vow to #NeverForget Shantay.”

Neal-Baker got her start as a Police Communications Technician, before becoming an officer in the Brownsville and Williamsburg neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the top cop wrote in an internal memo obtained by The Post.

A volunteer peer support member, Neal-Baker also worked in the NYPD’s Human Resources Division, and most recently in its Risk Mitigation Division, where she was assigned to the Performance Analysis Section.

“We will always keep Shantay and her loved ones and colleagues in our prayers, and her dedication to our department and the people of New York City will never be forgotten,” Shea wrote to New York’s Finest.

At least 58 members of the NYPD have died of COVID-19.

Timing is everything in life.

Sandra Lee has gotten engaged to her boyfriend Ben Youcef, and the beaming couple hit the town in Paris to celebrate, with a besotted Lee showing off her dazzling new engagement ring, multiple sources sources told The Post.

Photos of the lovebirds reveal that Lee, the former girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and her hunky beau have made it official — as there was no mistaking the significance of a giant jewel on Lee’s left ring finger.

Youcef, an interfaith leader, actor and producer, sported a band on his wedding finger.

Lee was seen sporting the sizable new bling just days after Cuomo announced his resignation following a series of scandals — and a damning report by state Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of sexually harassing several women — that have plagued his third term as governor.

Lee and Youcef bolted to the City of Love after she was left devastated by the events of the past week, when Cuomo resigned as governor amid a sex harassment scandal, Lee’s friends said.

The two could be seen outside Parisian hotspot L’Avenue on Saturday night, sharing an embrace before heading in for dinner.

Lee, a 55-year-old lifestyle guru, wore a white summer dress while Youcef, 46, had on jeans, a leather jacket and a white T-shirt emblazoned with the logo “Fear of God.”

A source close to Youcef told The Post: “Ben really wanted to distract Sandra from all the news, so he whisked her away to Paris. He knows how hard this has been on her and he wants to make sure she feels loved and supported.”

The source added: “Ben is incredibly protective of Sandra. They’re soulmates and head over heels in love.”

The pair traveled to Paris after spending time in St. Tropez in the South of France.

Lee and Cuomo never got engaged during their 14 years together, although she was married previously to former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz from 2001 until 2005.

The source said their friends have been rooting for them since they met in the spring in Los Angeles.

As The Post reported, Lee has felt “betrayed” by Cuomo, most recently for what she claims was him taking credit for legalizing same-sex marriage in New York during his resignation speech when she was the one who urged him to push the legislation forward.

Cuomo’s cheating during their relationship, which he denied, was considered an “open secret,” former Cuomo staffers told The Post in April.

She met Youcef after moving to Malibu, Calif., and leaving behind the home she shared with Cuomo.

Lee was previously in a relationship with Gov. Andrew Cuomo for 14 years until they split in 2019. Best Image / BACKGRID Lee met Youcef after moving to Malibu following her breakup with Cuomo. Best Image / BACKGRID

She solidified her move to the West Coast after selling her Mount Kisco home — named “Lily Pond” — for $1.85 million last October.

Youcef, a divorced dad of two, was discovered by Steven Spielberg and went on to appear in his 2005 movie “Munich.”

He has since appeared in a number of TV shows.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is the latest Democrat to embrace the “do as I say not as I do” lifestyle while battling the COVID-19 crisis.



He jetted off to Italy this week for a family vacation at his lavish 23-room mansion in Umbria while both his state and the European nation battle outbreaks of the Delta variant.

The US State Department on Thursday urged Americans to “reconsider travel to Italy due to COVID-19.”

“After this past 17 months, just having a few days together is something that I think all of us want to do with our family, and I’m looking forward to that,” Murphy said Monday during a coronavirus briefing.

Murphy’s palatial villa reportedly boasts horse stable, tennis court and pool and is valued at more than $7 million.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli pounced on the opportunity to bash his elitist rival.

“While ‘Rome is burning’ here in New Jersey, Murphy is living in the lap of luxury and too rich to care about the communities and families impacted by the small businesses who had to close their doors forever,” Ciattarelli tweeted Thursday.

Murphy’s overseas vacation in spite of warnings comes just as Martha’s Vineyard battles a startling rise in COVID cases in the wake of President Obama’s 60th birthday bash last Saturday.

The Massachusetts island resort reported 58 new cases this week – including 28 on Monday alone, the second highest one-day total on the island all year according to state health department data. The former president’s party featured scores of famous guests in close proximity without masks or social distancing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@They claimed to be peddling works from a famed Swiss sculptor — but their story had more holes than a slice of cheese, a lawsuit claims.

The Sotheby’s auction house is demanding a Florida art seller and his wife pay back $7 million after it sold their allegedly phony art, said to be by renowned sculptor and painter Diego Giacometti, whose fanciful depictions of animals have been exhibited at museums across France, says the suit.

Dealers Frederic Thut and wife Bettina Von Marnitz Thut committed a “brazen fraudulent scheme,” Sotheby’s claims in an Aug. 3 Manhattan Federal Court filing.

The Thuts, who own Fine Art Auctions Miami, consigned seven pieces purportedly by Giacometti to Sotheby’s between 2016 and 2017, after the couple claimed to have purchased a “large trove” of the artist’s work, according to Sotheby’s complaint.

The auctioneer sold the art for millions, but learned in 2018 that an independent expert working for a buyer had deemed the pieces bogus, court papers claim.

Sotheby’s hired a handwriting analyst, who “determined that the provenance documents were forgeries,” according to the suit.

Additional documents offered up to support the alleged fraud were also uncovered, it says.

After learning of the alleged ruse, Sotheby’s scrapped the sales and reimbursed buyers, but the Thuts have not given back what they made, the auction house charges.

Sotheby’s, which declined comment, is pursuing nearly $7 million in damages, plus legal fees. The Thuts could not be reached for comment.

Giacometti, who died in 1985, was the younger brother of and collaborator with the famed artist Alberto Giacometti. Diego is said to have “often portrayed animals in bronze with the aesthetic of ancient sculptures or primitive drawings,” according to artnet.com.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Some teachers and parents are demanding the city implement their version of a “safe reopening” for schools — and threatening to walk out if they don’t get their way.

The group has a list of eight ultimatums they want enacted when the school year begins, including: barring any unvaccinated people over the age of 12 from instructional spaces; a mask mandate, “strict adherence” to social distancing — and a remote option.

Mayor Bill de Blasio’s current plan is for a mask mandate, but no remote option.

But the demands, made in an online petition with more than 800 signatures, don’t just cover COVID-19 safety procedures.

The groups also insists there be “no academic screening/diagnostic assessments for so-called deficit of learning/learning loss.”

“Rather, we must focus resources on the social emotional well-being of our students,” the petition says. “We desire a pause in required high stakes state standardized testing until performance based alternatives are explored.”

The petition concludes: “Failure to implement these demands will result in a coalition of educators and parents urging UFT members, families and students to stay out of buildings deemed unfit until they are safe for teaching and learning.”

Daniel Alicea, a 25-year veteran special-education teacher in Far Rockaway, created the change.org petition.

The bid to ditch academic testing “definitely deals with the trauma that many students and families have endured,” claimed Alicea, who is part of an informal group of educators that came together in 2020 around COVID-19 safety issues. He’s also a cohost of the WBAI program “Talk Out of School.”

“New York City schools were among the safest places to be during the pandemic. We are putting the needs of our kids front and center by administering screeners to get the best understanding of their academic progress and by welcoming all of our students back for a full opening,” city Department of Education spokeswoman Danielle Filson told The Post.



The UFT didn’t return a request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York’s new governor won’t clean house completely.

Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul —who has vowed to end Albany’s “legacy of sleaze” when she replaces scandal-scared Gov. Andrew Cuomo this month — said Sunday she will keep some of his agency heads.

Hochul — who also said she’ll oust staffers implicated in Cuomo’s sexual harassment scandal — will keep some of his commissioners for at least 45 days, she said at a press conference at the Erie County Fair.

“What I will do is put together an administration that has some continuity because we are in a crisis situation,” Hochul told Buffalo News, referring to the coronavirus pandemic. “However, I’m going to be signing an executive order to keep people in place for 45 days and continue to evaluate during that time.”

She added, “I was very clear in my first remarks following Gov. Cuomo’s decision to resign from his position that I will not keep anyone who was charged with unethical behavior who was listed in [the AG’s] report,” she said. “So that’s job number one, is to clean house of people who were mentioned in that report in that way.”

But at least one commissioner she plans to keep was involved in ethically dubious behavior during Cuomo’s reign, sources said.

Hochul asked Health Commissioner Howard Zucker to stay on during a meeting about the pandemic Thursday, sources told The Post— even though he’s embroiled in a scandal over nursing home fatalities and allegedly covering up death data.

“Anyone involved in covering up the Governor’s behavior, or responsible for fudging nursing home data, or who engaged in retaliation against the women who spoke up should have no place in government. Kathy Hochul will have to make those decisions,” Assembly Health Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan) told The Post last week.

During the press conference Sunday, Hochul said she plans to retain some Cuomo commissioners because she has good working relationships with them.

“A number of people have left already, and I will continue working with the team I have as lieutenant governor in taking advantage of those deep relationships I have with many outstanding commissioners and public servants that are part of the administration and to give them the freedom to go forth and make smart decisions for the people of New York,” she said.

Earlier this month, she vowed to end Albany’s “legacy of sleaze” — saying, “I will go in there and literally say, ‘It’s a whole new day, zero tolerance.’”

“Yes, this is me operating the train right now,” Belgrave says in one of multiple videos posted to her account, which has since been made private.

At one point, as the love train choo-choos through underground stations, Belgrave is shown in footage alone at the controls and posing for a selfie with Harris in the cab.

Dominique Belgrave was seen driving the subway train.

As the train zips toward Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue, Harris explains that the marker showing where operators must stop is hard to see from the cab, and Belgrave echoes the complaint.

“Y’all ain’t put the stickers in a visible place!” she exclaims.

Belgrave’s caption reads: “Conducting The D u hurdddd.”

Footage of the transit-loving temptress driving the motorman wild went viral among MTA workers over the weekend, and eventually caught the eye of a supervisor — who reported them to the NYPD, police said.

But the rule-breaking ride may be the third rail of career moves.

Interim Transit President Craig Cipriano said Harris will be disciplined. The 32-year-old, 11th-year MTA employee earned $117,486 in 2020, according to SeeThroughNY.

“This video is beyond egregious showing a train operator who betrayed the trust of New Yorkers while creating a dangerous condition,” Cipriano said in a statement.

“I want to assure customers that the operator involved has been removed from service and will no longer be allowed to control a train.”

Other MTA workers reported the incident to the NYPD.

Despite the post-tryst train wreck, Belgrave bragged about the illegal breach of the operator’s cab on Facebook — and suggested she might be angling for a Transit Authority gig herself.

“All you MTA f–kers tryna add me on my Facebook and IG eat a big fat Turtle neck cheesy D–k how bout that,” she wrote.

Other MTA workers reported the incident to the NYPD.

“I’ll might start at the bottom but ima move my way up they gon see me in traffic.”

She did not immediately return a request for comment.

It’s not clear whether Harris or Belgrave will face criminal charges.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A 51-year-old man was attacked by a hatchet-wielding maniac in the ATM vestibule of a Lower Manhattan bank Sunday night, police sources said.

The male suspect whacked the victim in the head and thigh as he was standing in front of the cash machine at a Chase bank on Broadway near Beaver Street in the Financial District at about 5:20 p.m., sources said.

The brute fled after the attack, but left the hatchet behind, according to the sources. He was still being sought late Sunday.

“The guy that got hit in the head was screaming,” a witness told The Post.

“It’s crazy. People were shouting and we saw the guy laying down — a lot of blood,” the witness said.

The victim was hospitalized in stable condition.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@GOP mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa and some local Republican leaders were among 300 people at a Manhattan rally Sunday to protest Mayor Bill de Blasio’s vaccine mandate for city employees and indoor venues.

“Let people have individual rights and freedom — and not the boot, crushing the life out of our economic system, your ability to raise your families,” Sliwa said during the rally, which was held a block from de Blasio’s home base of Grace Mansion.

The Guardian Angels founder said he supported increasing the city’s vaccination rate but argued that the city’s mandate infringes on individual freedom and will be impossible to enforce starting Sept. 13, as the Democratic mayor has promised.

“I think we can all agree here we’d like to see people vaccinated if they want to get vaccinated. Make it available,” Sliwa said.

But then there’s “comrade Bill de Blasio, the part-time mayor, the dope from Park Slope,” pushing his requirement “with no explanations of how he’s going to enforce it,” Sliwa claimed.

“The mandates are specifically meant to keep people like de Blasio in power, the City Council in power, so that they can dictate what we do in our lives and also for our children,” he asserted.

City Councilman Joe Borelli (R-Staten Island) told protesters the mayor’s plan would create “a city where there are two classes of people.

“Good news for you guys: There’s a vaccine that you can get. It’s free. It’s widely available. It’ll probably make you pretty safe from COVID. You should probably get it,” Borelli said. “But if you don’t, I don’t care because I’m not you dad. I’m not your mom. I’m not your doctor. It’s not my job.

“The age of personal responsibility is here,” he said. “The age of individual collective sacrifice has to be gone.”

Also at the rally were Andrea Catsimatidis, head of the Manhattan Republican Party, and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a GOPer running for governor.

De Blasio’s new mandate comes as the hyper-contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 fuels devastating outbreaks in many Southern states such as Florida and Texas, where the rates of vaccination trail those in New York.

All told, 61.8 percent of all New Yorkers have gotten at least one shot — including 73.6 percent of all adults.

Unvaccinated New Yorkers accounted for 495,023 of the 500,302 coronavirus cases in the five boroughs between Jan. 1 and June 15, according to Yale University and the city Department of Health.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sen. Chuck Schumer on Sunday urged the federal government to crack down on the sale of phony COVID-19 vaccination cards — and spread the word that “dumb” people buying the fake inoculation documentation risk spending time behind bars.

“I am urging a federal crackdown on these counterfeit COVID cards and [the start of] an education campaign to make it clear to the American people that this is illegal, you could actually go to prison for buying these,” Schumer (D- NY) said at a press conference in Manhattan.

“There are now people manufacturing and selling fake COVID cards, even though it’s a crime.

“The Feds have to step up their efforts to ameliorate this problem before it gets worse,” said Schumer, the Senate’s majority leader. “The Department of Justice must ensure that fraud cases are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”

He said it is puzzling why unvaccinated people would rather shell out money for illicit counterfeit cards than head to a vaccine site and receive a shot at no cost — and in some cases, such as in New York City, even get paid.

“Some people, rather than get the vaccine, which is free, are paying money for a fake card and risking prosecution because it’s against the law,” Schumer said. “Who could be that dumb?”

Schumer suggested the federal government launch an “education campaign” that would let Americans know they face prison time for purchasing the counterfeit cards.

Schumer’s call for a crackdown on bogus immunization cards comes as fraudsters are hawking the items.

Customs and Border Patrol officers in Tennessee have seized thousands of phony COVID-19 vaccination cards from China in the Past year, according to the agency.

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Aug. 4 that the Big Apple will in September begin requiring movie theaters, restaurants and gyms to require proof of vaccination to enter.

“Here we are going to great lengths to let people go back to their activities at restaurants, at sports stadiums, at gatherings, at clubs, with the idea that if you show the card it’s OK,” Schumer said.

“If fake cards become an epidemic, then people will no longer feel safe to gather at these places, and we will hurt our economy, as well.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former Gov. David Paterson says his scandal-scarred successor, Andrew Cuomo, is not to be trusted — and that he should know.

Paterson claimed Sunday that Cuomo stabbed him in the back by personally calling then-gubernatorial candidate Eliot Spitzer in 2006 to advise him not to support Paterson for lieutenant governor.

“Apparently Andrew didn’t like that he had heard that Gov. Spitzer was going to pick me to be his lieutenant governor,” recounted Paterson during an interview with host John Catsimatidis on WABC 770’s “The Cats Roundtable.”

“So he calls up Spitzer’s office, then he tells … Spitzer, that I was erratic, disloyal, and that things would come out about me that would make him wish he had never chosen me to be his running mate,” Paterson said.

Spitzer told Cuomo to shove it, Paterson said.

“The next morning, Andrew calls me, and he says, ‘What’s going on?’ Like I did something,” Paterson said. “I said, ‘I don’t know, Andrew. Why don’t you tell me?’

“He said, ‘David, don’t listen to them. I didn’t say that stuff. They are trying to divide us.’ I said, ‘Andrew, what is it that we have to divide? We’re not married. We don’t own a business together. What are you talking about?’

“After that conversation, I’d have to say there was some distance between us. I was always pretty leery of anything he said to me,” Paterson said.

Paterson ended up becoming lieutenant governor under Spitzer — then serving as governor from 2008 to 2010 after Spitzer’s resignation over a hooker scandal.

Cuomo took over as governor in 2011 and was serving his third term before a sex-harassment debacle forced him to announce his resignation last week.

Paterson, the state’s first and to-date only black governor, has been on a tear against Cuomo since the latter announced his resignation.

On Thursday, Paterson told WNYC that he found Cuomo’s 14-day notice before officially resigning “suspicious.”

“I just think the governor has just not resolved in his mind what’s actually going on yet, and his self-awareness just does not seem to be particularly helpful to him at this particular time,” Paterson told the radio station.

Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi, responding to Paterson’s claims Sunday involving Spitzer, told The Post, “The very idea that Gov. Cuomo was advising Spitzer on anything is comical.

“‎Everyone knows former Gov. Paterson makes his own truth to fit the moment, and I guess none of these hard feelings were a factor when the current governor made him state Democratic Party chair,” the rep said, referring to Paterson’s time at the helm of the party between 2014 and 2015.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday suggested that she will consider Gov. Andrew Cuomo irrelevant once he leaves office.

“The governor will do what he chooses to do. I’ll be laser-focused on dealing with COVID, getting our economy back, getting kids back in school, and dealing with a whole host of other challenges that I am prepared for,” Hochul said on CNN’s “State of the Union” to host Jake Tapper.

Hochul — who is scheduled to take office Aug. 25 after Cuomo steps aside over sexual-harassment allegations — said any potential commentary from Cuomo when he’s out of the governor’s mansion will be an irrelevant sideshow that she’ll ignore.

“I’m ready for this. I’m ready to lead, and what happens off to the side, I won’t have control over, but it will not distract me,” she said.

During a subsequent appearance on CBS, Hochul took a similar stance to Cuomo chiming in once he leaves office.

“We’re going to stay focused,” she said on “Face the Nation.”

“I will have no distractions in my administration, because we’re focused on doing what’s best for the people of the state.”

Hochul’s vow to ignore an out-of-office Cuomo comes after he gave an interview with New York Magazine, saying he doesn’t know where he’ll live but hinting he’ll continued to share his “voice” and “perspective” after his resignation takes effect.

“Uh, I don’t know what I’m gonna do,” Cuomo said in an interview published Friday. “I’m not disappearing. I have a voice, I have a perspective, and that’s not gonna change.”

Cuomo announced Tuesday that he will step down effective in two weeks, after a state Attorney General probe said he sexually harassed 11 women, including nine current or former staffers. That left Hochul positioned to take the helm of state government by the end of the month.

In turn, the governor-in-waiting has repeatedly distanced herself from the governor’s administration. Hochul, who is slated to be the first woman to serve as New York’s governor, has promised to quickly start a new era in Albany, and clean up the corruption and creepiness that’s afflicted it for decades.
