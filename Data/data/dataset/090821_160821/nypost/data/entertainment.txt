There’s a big stink over celebrity shower habits — but experts say there might be more to this soap opera than meets the naked eye.

Jake Gyllenhaal recently became the latest in a smelly string of A-listers — from O.G. anti-deodorant duo Matthew McConaughey and Cameron Diaz to modern “wait till you see the dirt” proponents Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis — who are freaking out fans by admitting they embrace the funk.

“More and more I find bathing to be less necessary,” Gyllenhaal, 40, told Vanity Fair last week. His aromatic admission came virtually unprompted as the outlet had asked about his experiences in NYC as a “water town” — all tied to Gyllenhaal’s appearance in Prada’s ad for their Luna Rossa Ocean fragrance.

So, what emboldened celebs to share advice on bathing rituals — or lack thereof — with the washed masses? The annals of digital media point to a May 9, 2019 viral origin tweet by Aussie culture critic Sophie Weiner, who doesn’t think it’s “gross” to skip soap on most body parts.

Weiner’s proclamation proved contentious — with more than 10,500 retweets. Perhaps not coincidentally, Taylor Swift, 31, revealed on “Ellen” just a week later that she doesn’t — gasp — wash her legs in the shower.

One day after Swift’s confession, professional stink-raiser Yashar Ali, 41, sought to stir up controversy on Twitter by launching a racially charged bathing discourse: “What is going on with white people confessing on Twitter that they don’t wash their legs, feet, etc. in the shower and just let the water flow do the work?”

However, the dirty-or-not debate dribbled out — until Twitter user @letsassume relaunched it with a now-viral “confession” on March 23, 2021: “I only started washing my legs after the ‘white people don’t wash their legs’ discourse,” said the white woman from Baltimore. The tweeter’s admission garnered nearly 44,000 likes and 15,600 retweets.

Since then, stars such as Gyllenhaal, Kristen Bell, 41, and Dax Shepard, 46, have proudly come forward to (un)shower praise on a status pioneered by “baby wipes” legend Brad Pitt, 57. The movement has become so strong, in fact, that some stars have been forced to come forward in their own defense. “I’m not starting any trends — I shower, trust me,” Jason Momoa, 42, said Monday, adding “I’m Aquaman. I’m in the f–king water.”

Fellow Hawaiian Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson also felt the need to clarify that he bathes — and often: “I’m the opposite of a ‘not washing themselves’ celeb,” Johnson, 49, said, adding that he hits the showers up to three times per day.

Well, turns out there are certain benefits to bathing less, according to Dr. Julie Russak, a private practice dermatologist in Manhattan.

Dermies generally “don’t recommend a prolonged bath or daily showers,” Russak told The Post. Hot showers and lathering up with bath soaps “really removes and destroys the skin’s microbiome,” which plays a role in protecting the skin and is “also extremely important in overall health of the body.”

There’s still the matter of good hygiene, and “waiting for the stink” — as parents Bell and Shepard have suggested — may not be the right indicator that bath time is nigh.

Celebrities can’t stop admitting they’ve de-prioritized bathing — to the disgust of many fans at home. But are there benefits to bathing less? FilmMagic, Photo by Taylor Hill/FilmMagic, http://www.BFA.com

“You also have to still think about all the bacteria and [toxins] that accumulate on the skin,” Russak said. “When the body sweats … it’s all a natural way of removing toxins.” Still, you don’t want to leave that sitting on top of your skin too long, encouraging pimples, folliculitis and other skin infections.

“There has to be a healthy balance,” Russak warned. Here, we ponder whether these unwashed hall of famers have found it in their sparse shower routines.

Taylor Swift

“When you shave your legs, the shaving cream is like soap, right?” Swift asked Ellen Degeneres. The two women ultimately decided at the time that, indeed, shaving does count as bathing. Then the singer was asked to clarify whether her legs are ignored when she’s not shaving.

“I kind of always shave my legs,” the 11-time Grammy winner said. Surprised by Swift’s diligent shaving regimen, Degeneres, 63, said, “You must be hairy.”

Fans were incredulous — both that Swift shaves daily and that shaving cream is equivalent to a good sudsy lather. “How is shaving cream like soap tho, lol,” one doubtful viewer dissed.

However, Dr. Russak was less than scandalized, agreeing that shaving is usually enough to do the trick. But for a better shave — and thus better clean — it’s important to exfoliate first and loosen up the dead skin cells. “If you don’t, you may become more prone to ingrown hairs,” said Russak, who is a big fan of dry-brushing her legs before a shower.

Meanwhile, Twitter is now snarking that shower habits played a role in her breakup with a certain famous ex who is rumored to have inspired the hit “Shake it Off.”

Jake Gyllenhaal

“I do believe, because Elvis Costello is wonderful — that ‘good manners and bad breath get you nowhere,’ ” said Gyllenhaal in his candid interview. “But I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.”

Gyllenhaal’s comments splashed onto social media as fans came to both decry and defend the actor, including one steamy response: “Guys idc if Jake Gyllenhaal and Mila Kunis aren’t showering, I’ll still f–k them … in fact makes them hotter little bit.”

But are humans really self-cleaning machines? “Your body sheds dead cells, millions and millions everyday,” Russak told The Post. But modern life — from clothing to air pollution — has interrupted our body’s naturally evolved cleansing processes. In that way, showering is perhaps even more important now than when early humans lived outdoors and “were naked all the time,” she suggested.

Mila Kunis & Ashton Kutcher

If you see something, soap something.

It was on Dax Shepard’s podcast “Armchair Expert,” with co-host Monica Padman, that Mila Kunis, 37, came clean about how she “wasn’t that parent that bathed my newborns,” of children Wyatt Isabelle, 6, and Dimitri Portwood, 4.

Husband Ashton Kutcher, 43, then elaborated, “If you can see the dirt on them, clean them. Otherwise, there’s no point.”

Their meme-worthy comments spawned several viral responses. “When ashton kutcher and mila kunis kids walk into class,” read one tweet with nearly 93,000 likes, attached to an image of Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen in “Twilight,” making a distinct pee-yew face while seated in a classroom.

Grime is a sure sign that a bath time is necessary, Russak agreed, adding that it’s also especially important after vigorous exercise. If you’re the sort who exercises daily, like Russak herself, a quick rinse post-workout is recommended, and using soap “only in the areas that have higher concentrations of sweat accumulation,” she said.

Kristen Bell & Dax Shepard

“I’m a big fan of waiting for the stink,” admitted “The Good Place” star Kristen Bell, 41, of her two children Lincoln, 8, and Delta, 6, on a recent episode of “The View,” appearing alongside husband Dax Shepard, 46.

In a follow-up question to Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” interview with Kutcher and Kunis, Bell added, “I don’t hate what they’re doing. I wait for the stink.”

Dr. Russak agreed: “I think we are over-bathing our children,” leading to overly sensitive skin in kids, whose dermis is already much more delicate than that of adults. She also shared that her son, who had severe eczema as a child, was allowed to shower just twice a week, and only use the gentlest soaps — to “protect his microbiome.”

Cameron Diaz

At the forefront of the pro-B.O. brigade, Cameron Diaz, now 48, told E! News in 2014 that she hasn’t used antiperspirant “for almost 20 years.”

“It’s really bad for you,” she claimed. “Just trim your armpit hair so it doesn’t hold onto the scent.”

Diaz is onto something. Sweat is our body’s “natural way of detoxifying,” said Russak. “We do need to sweat.” Deodorant — as opposed to antiperspirant, which blocks the sweat glands — is good to help control the bacteria that causes stink.

Body odor is a good indication it’s time to hit the shower. “When you smell, it’s time to take a shower,” said Dr. Russak. The bacteria that causes B.O. occur alongside the same ones that can cause infections. That said, it’s okay to skimp on soap much of the time, focusing primarily on the odor-producing areas.

Matthew McConaughey

Ever the bona fide cowboy, Matthew McConaughey, 51, has long reportedly been on the side of stink in the great deodorant debate.

“I just never wore it,” he professed in an early interview. “No cologne, no deodorant.”

He insisted the “women in [his] life” were down with the funk. “Including my mother, [they] have all said, ‘Hey, your natural smell smells, one, like a man, and, two smells like you.’ ” The number of women in McConaghey’s funky fan club who were directly related to or in a romantic relationship with the actor was not specified — but Kate Hudson sure doesn’t agree. The “Fool’s Gold” co-star allegedly begged the actor to use her natural salt rock deodorant while on set.

Julia Roberts

Julia Roberts, 53, allegedly credits her scant showering habits with concern for the environment. While the actress herself hasn’t spoken publicly about her hygiene, a 2013 tabloid reported Roberts’ bodyguard said that she “likes to save water — she’s really green.”

“She likes the smell of her natural oils,” the blabbing insider added. “She also says that she can’t wash her hair too often because it’s dry.”

Her husband, Daniel Moder, 52, is “as much of a hippie,” the guard added. “Those two are the farthest thing away from Hollywood glamour. They’re grunt all the way.”

Steve Jobs

It’s not all about movie stars: The late Apple founder Steve Jobs was known for his lifestyle quirks, one of which was revealed in the 2011 book “Steve Jobs” by Walter Isaacson. In it, the biographer claims that Jobs, as a student at Reed College in the early 1980s, held an unsubstantiated belief that a fruit-based diet would somehow eliminate his need for showers.

As a result, his stench was allegedly so bad that the young prodigy was relegated to the night shift at Atari, where he helped the company launch a video game revolution.

Jobs’ faith in fruit would come to betray him in the end after he refused treatment for pancreatic cancer on the basis that diet alone could cure his disease. Jobs passed away on Oct. 5, 2011.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He’s “Wild N’ Out” with a bunch of women — and here’s why.

For Nick Cannon, having multiple babies with multiple girlfriends is the father of seven’s way of rebelling against the “Eurocentric” institution of marriage.

“That’s a Eurocentric concept … the idea that you’re supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life,” Cannon, 40, explained Monday on Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club.”

“The idea that a man should have one woman,” the host of “The Masked Singer” continued. “We shouldn’t have anything. I have no ownership over this person.”

Cannon — who welcomed his seventh child, the fourth within a year’s time, in June — said that fathering so many kids is not a decision he gets to make.

“Those women, and all women, are the ones that open themselves up and say, ‘I would like to allow this man into my world and I will birth this child,’ ” the California native insisted. “It ain’t my decision. I’m just following suit.”

The former Nickelodeon star welcomed 10-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with ex-wife and megastar Mariah Carey, 51, in 2011.

He has two children — son Golden, 4, and 8-month-old daughter Powerful Queen Cannon — with Miss Guam 2014 pageant winner Brittany Bell, 33.

On June 14, Cannon welcomed twin boys Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir with DJ Abby De La Rosa, 29.

Then, just nine days later, on June 23, he became the father of his fifth son, Zen, with model Alyssa Scott.

And now, Cannon says his aversion to monogamy is rooted in the European history of marriage.

“If we’re really talking about how we co-exist and how we populate, it’s about what exchange can we create together,” he said.

“I understand the institution of marriage, but if we go back to what that was about … [it] was to classify property,” he added, referring to the dowry system — the practice of trading a woman into marriage in exchange for money or property that was popularized in England between the 12th and 18th centuries.

The “Wild N’ Out” star said he doesn’t want “ownership” of any of the mothers of his children. The Breakfast Club

“One father gave another man his daughter for land,” Cannon said. “So when you really get to that concept, it’s like, we gotta change this up.”

Thus, his parade of paramours prevails.

“I don’t want ownership over anybody,” the “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” star said. “I don’t have ownership over any of the mothers. We create families in the sense that we created a beautiful entity.”

But it’s unclear whether the leading ladies of his love life are happy about Cannon’s staunch commitment to non-commitment.

“Every woman in my life that I deal with or [have] dealt with … they know how I feel,” he said.

“And it usually is a concept like, I’m not going around like, ‘Who am I gonna impregnate next?’ Nah,” Cannon continued.

“When you really look at how the family infrastructure is designed, the woman is the one that always leads and makes decisions,” he said.

“Everyone is like, ‘How is he convincing these women?’ … But I’m not. I’m the one in the scenario who has to follow suit on what they decide.”

Cannon, who admittedly grew up in an “unorthodox” home in which both of his parents were absent at times, said he’s extremely active in all of his children’s lives.

“For every single one of my kids, I’m at every basketball game, I’m at every martial arts practice,” he said.

“People don’t understand how I do it, but my children are my priority.”

“Sex and the City” actor Willie Garson admitted it was difficult to talk to notable guest star Mikhail Baryshnikov on set due to a cultural barrier.

Baryshnikov, 73, starred as Aleksandr Petrovsky, Carrie Bradshaw’s (Sarah Jessica Parker) artist boyfriend, in the iconic HBO show’s final season in 2004. Garson, 54, recently spoke to Us Weekly about working with the Russian dancer and actor.

“I’m not Russian, so it was very hard to make conversation with Mikhail,” Garson said. “Not because he’s bad or mean, he’s just very Russian.”

The “White Collar” star revealed that he doesn’t regret any exchanges he had with the Latvian-born entertainer. Garson even detailed what a typical conversation between them was like way back when.

“You’d say, like, ‘Misha, what’d you do last night?’ and he would literally say, ‘Dinner,’ but just kind of, like, ending the conversation,” Garson explained. “But it’s just a different way of living. And I would [jokingly] tell him, ‘Well, I went to Studio 54 and did cocaine off of Grace Jones last night. So I had a better night.’ No, I never [did that].”

Garson also dished about his experience working with singer Liza Minnelli on the movie “Sex and the City 2.” Minnelli officiated the wedding of Garson’s character Stanford and Mario Cantone’s Anthony, during which she performed Beyoncé’s huge hit “Single Ladies.”

“I love Liza so much and she was such a player and came to play hard. She worked so hard on this song and dance number,” he said. “And I think I did [an] ad-lib in the wedding [scene]. She asked if we say ‘I do.’ And I think I said, ‘I do, Liza Minnelli!’ I think I had to add it because it was so over the top ridiculous.”

Garson and Cantone, 61, will reprise their roles in the 10-episode HBO Max reboot, “And Just Like That,” which has begun filming in and around New York City. There’s no word yet if Baryshnikov will make an appearance in the revival.

In addition to key players Parker, Cynthia Nixon (as Miranda) and Kristin Davis (Charlotte), also reuniting for the sequel are Chris Noth as Mr. Big, John Corbett as Carrie’s former beau Aidan, David Eigenberg as Miranda’s husband Steve and Bridget Moynahan as Big’s ex-wife Natasha. Kim Cattrall, meanwhile, is still MIA.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nobody wants to hear about the pandemic at the theater, right? They’ve come to escape and forget about the news for a few hours. Or, I thought so anyway, until an inspired moment during Shakespeare in the Park’s al fresco “Merry Wives.”

“It’s been a hard year,” Johnny Falstaff, played by Jacob Ming-Trent, says in a hilarious speech to the audience. He complains about the tedium of being cooped up in his apartment for months on end watching Netflix. He’s bored and antsy.

So, Falstaff reasons, “Can you blame me for wanting to get with Madam Page and Madam Ford?”

Theater review merry wives 1 hour, 50 minutes, no intermission. Delacorte Theater, 81 Central Park West; 212-967-7555, PublicTheater.org

Nope! It’s a brilliant line in writer Jocelyn Bioh’s clever adaptation of “Merry Wives,” which opened Monday night at the Delacorte Theater. The quip adds new motivation to a very tricky plot.

You see, Shakespeare’s comedy is about an overweight drunk trying to seduce two married women for kicks. Such behavior would normally be morally abhorrent, but these days the indiscretions are understandable.

Ming-Trent, who could probably make “King Lear” into a laugh riot, leads the audience in a chant: “We feel you, Falstaff!”

And, damn it, we do.

The entire play, directed by Saheem Ali, walks that shrewd line between total irreverence and respect for the Elizabethan source material. While much of it is still from Shakespeare’s quill, a Brit who died in the 17th century clearly did not, for example, watch Netflix or set his show in modern Harlem. He did not give his characters a rainbow of black backgrounds — Nigerian, Jamaican, Ghanaian — as Bioh has. The Bard wishes he’d had designer Dede Ayite’s fabulous, sexy costumes.

Lest you think “Merry Wives” is a nonstop sex romp, get your mind out of the gutter. There are more innocent romances and scheming afoot too.

While the parents of young Anne Page (Abena) are looking to marry her off to a daft sweetheart named Slender, her heart goes out to Fenton, a woman, whom her father refuses to let her be with. (Shakespeare didn’t come up with this bit either).

Meanwhile, Falstaff sends identical love letters to Anne’s mom (Pascale Armand) and Madam Ford (Susan Kelechi Watson) in an attempt to lure them both — separately — into bed. They catch on, and turn the tables on the clown.

At the start of the show, the jokes are way overplayed. Double-entendres and asides, while clearly delivered, are interpreted with the aggression of someone taking a swing at Conor McGregor. Once the cast relaxes, however, the comedy rarely misfires.

Kelechi Watson and Armond are especially delicious as the plotting wives, who cackle in Madam Ford’s laundromat as they outwit the inflamed Falstaff. David Ryan Smith also makes a meal of Doctor Caius, a flamboyant French speaker who is constantly screaming and picking fights.

But “Merry Wives” belongs to the excellent Ming-Trent, who turns Falstaff into a character from “Seinfeld.” The Public Theater delayed opening night for two weeks while the actor recovered from an injury. He was worth waiting for.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A federal judge on Monday said Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) must face a defamation lawsuit by former Manhattan prosecutor Linda Fairstein over her portrayal as a racist and unethical villain in “When They See Us,” a 2019 series about the Central Park Five case.

US District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan said Fairstein had plausibly alleged defamation as to five scenes, including that she withheld evidence, coerced confessions and directed a racially discriminatory police roundup of young men in Harlem.

“The average viewer could conclude that these scenes have a basis in fact and do not merely reflect the creators’ opinions about controversial historical events,” the judge wrote.

Castel said Fairstein could also pursue defamation claims against both the series’ director, Ava DuVernay, and against Attica Locke, a writer and producer, and civil conspiracy claims against all three defendants.

Netflix and the defendants’ lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Fairstein’s lawyer Andrew Miltenberg said he was “exceptionally pleased” with the decision, saying the four-part series falsely depicted his client as “engaging in coercive and discriminatory conduct in order to build a case against innocent young men of color.”

Fairstein was running the sex crimes unit of the Manhattan District Attorney’s office in April 1989 when a 28-year-old white female jogger, later identified as Trisha Meili, was beaten and raped in Central Park.

Five male Black or Hispanic teenagers were convicted and spent five to 13 years in prison before being exonerated in 2002 when another man confessed to the crime.

They reached a $41 million civil settlement in 2014 with New York City, which did not admit wrongdoing.

The case has long been a focal point of discussion about crime and racism.

After the series’ premiere, a hashtag #CancelLindaFairstein called for a boycott of Fairstein, by then a best-selling crime novelist.

Fairstein said she was dropped by her publisher and forced to resign from boards of her alma mater Vassar College and three nonprofits, including two that support victims of sexual violence.

The defendants had called Fairstein’s account “revisionist history” and said their First Amendment free speech rights allowed them to present their viewpoint.

The case is Fairstein v. Netflix Inc et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-08042.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There’s no love lost between Nicole Kidman and husband of 15 years Keith Urban. The “Nine Perfect Strangers” star revealed that the country music singer is perfectly fine when she has to perform a love scene on camera.

“My husband is an artist, so he understands all of it, and he also does not get involved,” Kidman, 54, said on a recent episode of E! News’ “Daily Pop.” “He sees the show at the very end when it’s a show, all edited together, and he’s fresh eyes. He doesn’t read any script, he really doesn’t know what’s going on on the set, he’s got his own career that he’s completely absorbed in.”

The Oscar winner added: “He doesn’t know much about what I’m really doing.”

The longtime couple has been married since 2006 and shares daughters Sunday and Faith. Kidman previously opened up to WSJ. Magazine in April 2020 about how she balances work and family life.

“We have a system worked out to keep the family together. When Keith’s not touring, it’s much easier. He’ll be on tour next year, and then I just don’t work as much. Literally — it will become imbalanced, and we will change it,” the Australian starlet said. “We don’t have the answers, but the one thing we do know is that we will not jeopardize us.”

Urban, 53, previously touched upon his family’s busy lifestyle during an interview with the Times. “We live in different places — between Nashville and London — so we’re just used to not having a particular structure. It’s based on whether Nic’s working, whether I’m working,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Catherine Zeta-Jones is about to get scary. The Oscar winner has recently been cast as Morticia in the upcoming Wednesday Addams series on Netflix.

The “Chicago” actress will star in the eight-episode series alongside cast members Jenna Ortega and Luis Guzmán. Ortega will star as Wednesday and Guzmán will play Gomez Addams, Morticia’s husband.

The mystery-comedy will have a supernatural element, as viewers will follow Wednesday Addams’ school years as a student at Nevermore Academy. While attending class, she’ll have to learn how to control her emerging psychic abilities, combat a killing spree that has terrorized the local town and solve a mystery that involved her parents some 25 years ago — all while navigating her relationships.

The series is written by “Smallville” creators Al Gough and Miles Millar and will be directed by gothic fantasy king Tim Burton. Other iconic actresses who have stepped into the shoes of Morticia include Anjelica Huston, Charlize Theron, Daryl Hannah and Carolyn Jones.

Huston portrayed the character in the 1991 film “The Addams Family” alongside Raul Julia as Gomez Addams and Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester. Theron starred in the most recent adaption of the 1960s-era cartoon when she lent her voice for the 2019 animated film of the same name.

Zeta-Jones’ previous TV projects include “Feud: Bette and Joan,” “Queen America” and “Prodigal Son.”

She plays the psychiatrist on Fox’s “Prodigal Son” and recently spoke about working fellow Welshman Michael Sheen on the show. “I always wanted to co-star with my hometown neighbor from Wales. We’d never met but working with him was on my bucket list,” she said.

“I didn’t have 90 minutes of screen time in this. I had seven lines here, eight there, a snippet, look, a reaction. But I’m like Sugar Ray Leonard in the ring. I can always duck and dive. I’ve got too much OCD to do anything where I didn’t know the beginning, middle and end — so this one was different,” Zeta-Jones added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The world’s oldest industry is also one of today’s better-paid ones.

Top creators on subscription service OnlyFans rake in hundreds of times more money than the average Brit who followed a more traditional career path, a new report has found.

MrQ, a UK-based gaming software website, crunched the numbers on the best paid OnlyFan users and compared their income to existing data regarding what more customary professionals also make: Those who make a name for themselves on the adult content platform, researchers found, bring in a far better income than those who stick to well-traveled job paths like doctors, lawyers and teachers.

The most popular OnlyFans user, gem101, makes over $29.4 million while the 10th most popular, capriceG92, rakes in $4.3 million annually.

To calculate these findings, researchers looked at creators’ subscription costs and subscriber numbers to calculate estimated monthly and annual incomes. The 20% cut that OnlyFans takes from its users was also factored into findings.

An analysis by MrQ found that gem101 is the highest-paid user on OnlyFans. OnlyFans

“Among the most popular accounts with listed subscribers, gem101 ranks as the highest earner, with an estimated [$29.4 million] in annual income, earning an eye-watering [$2.49 million] each month,” a release for the analysis stated. “This comes from a $29 subscription charge per month and 102,800 subscribers to the account.”

By comparison, after 20 years in the field, English doctors — the top paid industry — will only bring in an average income of $109,000. The second best-paid professionals, lawyers, never even hit an annual average take-home of six digits: After 20 plus years of work in the industry, their income average tops out at $90,000 annually.

“While boning up on hard subjects at university might earn a decent amount as doctors at the pinnacle of their career will earn an average of a little over [$109,000] annually (around [$9,152] a month), top models like gem101 earn more than 22 times as much in one month alone,” report authors wrote. “That’s nearly 270 times as much a year.”

And what average income workers take home looks even more meager in comparison.

“A marketing professional earns just [$55,391] while a teacher earns [$48,467] and a journalist earns [$52,620],” researchers offered in stark contrast.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Superstar standup comedian Sebastian Maniscalco couldn’t perform onstage during the pandemic — so he used that time to create his new comedy cooking series, “Well Done with Sebastian Maniscalco.”

“I was looking to get into the cooking space for the last five-to-seven years. I have a passion for the culinary arts and was like, ‘What could we do?,” Maniscalco, 48, told The Post. “Nothing resonated with me until the pandemic; a buddy of mine, Dominick DiBartolomeo…his business was decimated. He provides meats and cheeses to local restaurants in LA and has his own line of Italian [food] products.”

Maniscalco and DiBartolomeo decided to throw a Sunday supper to raise money for charity and to expose DiBartolomeo’s business to Maniscalco’s huge fan base (he’s got 1.1 million followers on Instagram). “It worked out,” Maniscalco said. “It was a really big success and I thought, ‘This is really fun…let’s do a TV show combining my two passions, comedy and food. I wanted to do it around things that interest me in the culinary arts and it also comes from having two small kids [4-year-old Serafina and 2-year-old Caruso]. Being a father, I want to teach them things like how to make bread or take them fishing and show them how to bait the hook.”

Sebastian Manascalco gets busy in the kitchen in his discovery+ series, “Well Done with Sebastian Maniscalco.” Anders Krusberg

“Well Done with Sebastian Maniscalco,” premiering Thursday (Aug. 12) on discovery+, certainly checks all of those boxes. In the opening episode, Maniscalco, DiBartolomeo and chef Michael Cimarusti, who co-owns seafood restaurant Providence in LA, take a fishing expedition from Marina Del Rey — and Maniscalco gets violently ill shortly after their departure, excusing himself to go to the bathroom and emerging the worse for wear. “I knew that I get seasick and I was thinking that maybe this would be different,” he said. “It’s a bigger boat, a commercial boat, and within five minutes I was on the floor. I figured being a larger boat I wouldn’t have as much of a problem, but that thing was shaking. It was all real. So it made for good TV.”

The threesome catch several kinds of fish (including whitefish and sculpin) and, upon their return to the marina, Maniscalco learns how to properly gut and fillet a fish, not without some hiccups (“I did a complete hack job,” he says on-camera). Afterward, Cimarusti cooks the fish at his restaurant.

“One of my favorite shows is ‘Top Chef’ and I kind of loosely watch food shows, whether it be Giada [De Laurentiis] but those are more instructional,” Maniscalco said. “The reason I watch them, particularly ‘Top Chef,’ is to see who’s new and hot in the restaurant game. I don’t want to make this show very instructional — I just want to give some information and provide some entertainment as well.”

Maniscalco said there is a difference between performing standup and hosting a series, albeit one that includes a comedic element.

“Standup is a lot of pressure because of the immediate response — if you’re not funny doing standup then there’s gonna be a problem,” he said. “Here, there’s a different kind of pressure, you know you have to be funny…but, for me, the TV show wasn’t all about that. It was never forced. But this is a comedy cooking show and I was aware of that going in. A lot of the ‘talk to the camera’ stuff was written jokes, so we knew we had that…I knew [the laughs] would come out of the situation I put myself in.”

The seven-episode series will, in future installments, feature Maniscalco and comedian Russell Peters exploring the similarities between sushi and comedy; a “meat-centric” dinner party with guests including Bert Kreischer and Anjelah Johnson; and hunting for sandwiches with Rich Eisen, Fortune Feimster, Gillian Jacobs and Oscar Nunez. The premiere features three episodes, with one episode a week following every Thursday thereafter.

“You’re going to have a little smile on your face while you’re learning about a particular food or making a dish,” Maniscalco said. “People like to tune in and kind of forget their problems for 30 minutes, and this is similar to what I do with standup comedy — escape a little bit and have a little fun watching a cooking show and laughing at the same time.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mama, I’m in love with a criminal — said everyone on TikTok.

Cameron Herrin, sentenced to 24 years in prison in Tampa, Florida, in April for vehicular homicide, has been determined “too cute” to be locked up.

Three months into the 21-year-old’s jail stint, TikTok and Twitter users flooded the platforms with support for Herrin.

On TikTok, supporters of Herrin jumped to make fan accounts to pay homage to their hot felon. Some users made highlight reels of Herrin’s hottest moments in court, tagged with #justiceforcameron.

Herrin, a TikTok creator himself, has amassed 2 million followers on his verified account, despite not having any published content while behind bars.

Hannah Kosh, a popular TikTok user, uploaded an explainer video of the bizarre cult following of Herrin, detailing the fan base he has accumulated in only a few months.

“You’re too cute,” wrote one user featured in her video among a sea of other comments expressing dismay at the “harsh” sentence.

The Tampa Bay Times spoke to Herrin’s mother about the newfound craze of her son, which she said is “almost like an obsession, an unhealthy obsession.” According to the outlet, Twitter suspended 900 accounts that created content about Herrin for violating community guidelines, which resulted in the disappearance of approximately 90,000 tweets.

Cameron Herrin’s father, Chris (from left), mother Cheryl, brother Tristan Herrin and aunt Kim Salter attended court for his hearing. AP

Experts the Times spoke to were suspicious that some of the so-called fan accounts might want to use hot ticket topics to gain a following to then disseminate false or misleading information. They believed this specifically because many of the social media users who wanted “justice” for Herrin were traced back to the Middle East, and at times, his name wasn’t even spelled correctly.

Nonetheless, despite the social outcry across various platforms, it’s probable Herrin will remain in prison for the duration of his sentence.

Pamela Reisinger, mother of Jessica Reisinger-Raubenolt, whom Herrin hit with his car, recalls memories of her daughter while giving her victim-impact statement at Herrin’s sentencing hearing. AP

Herrin was charged with vehicular homicide after killing Jessica Reisinger-Raubenolt, 24, and her daughter, Lillia, who was only 20 months old. He hit them with his Ford Mustang when racing another car in Florida in 2018 and later pleaded guilty in court.

The 24-year-long sentence, given by was the judge overseeing Herrin’s hearing, was calculated based on Herrin’s past of reckless driving and speeding.

Judge Christopher Nash is shown a picture of Lillia Raubenolt, the 20-month-old girl Herrin killed while driving. AP

Herrin is not the first heartthrob con to send pulses racing. Jeremy Meeks, dubbed “Hot Felon,” landed himself modeling gigs and a movie job thanks to his steamy mug shot.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jennifer Lopez is heading back to her block — or close to it — to perform at the Global Citizen Live event in New York City on Sept. 25.

The Bronx-born triple threat will be one of the performers taking the stage from Central Park.

“Ms. Lopez’s involvement in Global Citizen Live is a wonderful progression from our partnership during the Vax Live campaign, event, and primetime broadcast,” Katie Hill, senior vice president of Global Citizen, said in a press release. “With her help, we were able to secure 26 million Covid-19 vaccine doses but our work for vaccine equity continues as the pandemic continues to spread.

“We are thrilled to welcome Jennifer Lopez to our Central Park stage on September 25th to continue our impact together,” Hill added.

Lopez, 52, replied to Global Citizen’s Instagram post announcing the news, writing, “Can’t wait! See you soon NYC!” (No word yet on whether newly rekindled boyfriend Ben Affleck will be on hand.)

The festival is timed to the UN General Assembly scheduled for late September. Besides New York, Global Citizen Live will present events from cities including Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, London, Seoul, Los Angeles, Sydney and more. The event will call on governments and corporations to help defend the planet, defeat poverty, combat climate change, provide vaccine equity and conquer famine.

Other performers set to appear from across the world include just-announced Shawn Mendes, The Weeknd, Ed Sheeran, BTS, Coldplay, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Andrea Bocelli, Metallica, Lorde, Doja Cat, Keith Urban, Usher, H.E.R., Duran Duran, Femi Kuti, Lang Lang, Demi Lovato, Ricky Martin and more.

Guests and attendees will be required to be vaccinated and masked for the duration of the concert. If one is not able to be vaccinated, they must be able to show a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the show.

The event will air live on ABC, BBC, FX, iHeartRadio, Hulu, YouTube and Twitter.

The “Hustlers” actress previously joined the VaxLive concert in May when she performed at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium. She sang a cover of Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline,” as well as her hit “Ain’t Your Mama.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@From Lizzo’s lips to her fans’ ears. The “Juice” singer said fellow Atlantic Records rapper Cardi B — not Harry Styles — will be featured on her new single “Rumors.”

On Friday, Lizzo will debut her tune featuring the “Up” songstress. Lizzo, 33, dropped the news on Instagram alongside a piece of promo for the song.

” ‘RUMORS’ feat @iamcardib 🔥🤫🔥 THIS FRIDAY 8/13🤫🔥🤫🔥🤫🔥,” Lizzo wrote next to a photo of the two licking their bejeweled pointer fingers. “We really did that,” Cardi, 28, jokingly commented.

Over the weekend, the Houston native teased the new tune on TikTok. On Monday, Lizzo posted a FaceTime call between her and Cardi to announce their collab on Instagram. “Good morning, motherf–ker,” she says to the “Bodak Yellow” rapper in the video before giggling. “That’s who is featuring y’all. Period. It’s Harry Styles.” Before the song announcement, Lizzo’s comments section was saturated with guesses that the former British boyband star would be featured.

Styles, 27, and Lizzo have been friends for the last couple of years. They sparked a friendship in December 2019 when the “Watermelon Sugar” crooner covered Lizzo’s song “Juice.”

Styles then gushed in an interview with BBC Radio 1 that Lizzo is “exactly what you want an artist to be.” She responded at the time by reposting the clip on her Instagram Stories, writing, “This is so cute @harrystyles ily. You know what this means right . . .?” with a winking emoji, seemingly hinting at a collaboration.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you never quite got round to adopting that puppy during lockdown, why not adopt an unloved home now instead?

You’ll get the same buzz, promises Elizabeth Finkelstein, who alongside her husband Ethan, runs the Instagram phenom @cheapoldhouses — an account that shows off lusty listings from across the country that are more than 100 years old with asks under $100,000.

House adoption also gives life “immense purpose,” the 41-year-old told The Post. “We’re the Sarah MacLachlan of old houses,” added Ethan, 37, of the SPCA fundraising staple.

It’s a mission that has resonated with the Finkelsteins’ 1.6 million real estate-obsessed followers, who include Blake Lively, Jennifer Garner, SJP, Drew Barrymore and Miranda Lambert (but not MacLachlan, unfortunately – “I wish” laughs Elizabeth).

Now, their social media clout has earned the couple a brand new reality show, “Cheap Old Houses,” premiering today on HGTV and streaming on Discovery+.

In each episode, the elfin, giggle-prone Elizabeth and her low-key, can-do husband scout out two cheap old houses for sale, aiming to decide which they’d buy.

Their recs are a guide for would-be buyers — “always eyeball the original details” (dumb waiters or pocket doors, e.g. — a pair of those costs at least $2,400 to replace) and “the more you find, the better the bargain.” It’s a promising sign of long-time care if the kitchen or bathroom haven’t been modernized, they said.

“When a home is flipped, they’re the first thing to get updated, so if they survive, that’s very special,” Elizabeth explained.

In second half of the show, the Finkelsteins give their stamp of approval to a cheap old house owner who has given their century home a tasteful and historically respectful rehab.

Original details are always fan favorites, according to the Finklesteins. HGTV

The Nyack, New York-based couple are accidental TV stars. Elizabeth, who grew up upstate, attended NYU and worked in historic preservation. Former navy brat Ethan works in digital marketing.

At first, the couple combined their skills on a startup, Circa Old Homes — a real estate eBay, spotlighting historic houses from around the country. On a whim, the Finkelsteins started an Insta account, part promo for their main biz and part chance to indulge their dreams of saving historic homes.

Almost immediately, their followers got in on the fun, bombarding them with suggestions of dirt-cheap historic properties ready to be rescued. If someone DM’d about a historic home they’d purchased, the Finkelsteins would regram it with an “I’ve Been Saved!” sticker, generating new followers on both sides.

The couple — Elizabeth, who worked in historic preservation and Ethan, who works in digital marketing — originally teamed up on a auction startup site called Circa Old Houses. HGTV

That was five years ago — now the pandemic has also helped fuel their follower count.

“If anything, this feed is about nostalgia,” Elizabeth explained. “It’s for the same reason people are leaving their jobs in finance to go create artisanal pickles — the satisfaction we feel completing a project with our hands. This is a subculture of people who want to do something slow, steady and sustainable.”

“If anything, this feed is about nostalgia.” Elizabeth Finklestein

Old buildings that can be repurposed are always catnip for likes, including ready-to-convert churches, mills, courthouses, lighthouses and schoolhouses.

“Whenever we post those, gosh, people love them,” Elizabeth said.

They even spotlighted Nina Simone’s childhood home, in Tryon, North Carolina. Simone’s barely 700-square-foot, shack-like house, which lacked plumbing and electricity, sold for just over $25,000 in 2017 in part thanks to the Finkelsteins’ efforts.

The buyers were a quartet of preservation-minded African-American artists, including Julie Mehretu and Rashid Johnson; it’s now protected as a national treasure.

But their favorite find is the seven-bedroom Duncan Manor, a 1860s mansion in rural Illinois. After one of their followers snapped it up, they moved to the small town of Towanda to restore it while the cameras roll. For a while, they even camped out on the porch until a room was ready for them to live in.

The full scoop on that reno will be featured later in the season of their show, which was filmed throughout last winter, during cold snaps and even a 2-foot blizzard (cue Elizabeth’s assortment of bobble hats).

“Next time we’re filming a show called ‘Expensive Old Houses with Heat and Bathrooms,’ ” she laughed.

Elizabeth and Ethan are evangelical in their enthusiasm for these neglected beauties and they see their new show more like a tent revival than another exercise in real estate porn.

“We hope to inspire people to think about alternative ways to live, [and to create] a different vision of the American dream,” she said. “The average home in America costs $350,000. How does anyone afford a house at a young age? You know, people living in cubicles, paying too much rent in expensive cities — they can buy a mansion in a field in Illinois that they can actually afford — and that needs them. That’s escapism in the greatest sense of the word.”

Elizabeth said that at least 100 of the properties they’ve featured have been rescued and rebooted by their followers.

For their own experiment in living an alternative American dream, the pair and their now 6-year-old son Everett, settled on a love shack far upstate: a 1700s farmhouse sitting on more than 10 acres, which they bought last November for less than $100,000.

“It was the neediest one out there,” Elizabeth joked of their runty, puppy-like choice. A scant few original details remained — wood siding, historic windows — but it was largely a blank canvas, primed to be revived.

“It needed a rescue,” added Ethan, “Omigosh, this thing needs so much love. It’s a gut job at this point.”

The duo confides that far upstate New York is one of the best patches in the country to scour bargains like this, especially around the Finger Lakes, in cities like Rochester and Buffalo.

“New York has had so many different periods of growth, so there’s houses from the 1700s to amazing craftsman bungalows — all types of houses in this state,” Elizabeth said.

To find your own in the wild (without the Instagram competition), they suggest starting in Vermont. It has a $10,000 incentive for folks moving full-time to work remotely there, as well as an excess of ready-to-rescue historic fixer-uppers. Scope outland banks, too, in places like Kingston and Syracuse — these are non-profits that buy up abandoned homes and resell them for peanuts with provisos in places.

For instance, buyers must live there, full-time, and can’t flip them.

“On TV, it has become about doing a big transformation — you know, demo, demo, demo and then a quick flip,” Elizabeth said, momentarily stern. “Flipping is my F word. I cannot stand the idea that people come in and take a house that has had meaning to a community for 200 years, and quickly put stock stuff in there to make a buck on it.”

That might sound like a strange attitude from the newest star of the network that virtually trademarked the buy-fix-flip formula. The couple was approached multiple times about TV shows along those lines but turned them down; they refused to endorse turbocharged payoffs. They compare flipping to McDonald’s, and the “Old House movement” like Slow Food.

“It took a long time before we could find a production company willing to pitch something outside the box of a typical home renovation show,” she said. “We’re not going to get a show shot in three months.”

They hope that the show will further bolster their growing movement and they even encourage viewers to enquire about the homes they see on the show. Ethan estimates around half the homes they feature are still on the market.

“Not everyone will buy a 7,000-square-foot mansion — for that, you need a lot of time and handyman skills, or a large budget,” Elizabeth said. “But there are people on the show who bought 600-square-foot bungalows that didn’t need as much work. There are enough cheap old houses out there for everyone.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For someone who prides himself on optics, Barack Obama just gave us quite an ugly spectacle.

As the rest of America struggles with uncertain employment status and school reopenings, shifting mask mandates, anxiety over vaccinations and variants, the health of the economy and the citizenry at large, Obama had to go and throw himself a huge, epic, three-day birthday bash on Martha’s Vineyard.

You would think a former president — one who clearly considers himself more intelligent and sensitive than most — would exercise some restraint.

Or at least understand that this was a supremely bad look.

Here were a host of left-leaning eco-warrior celebs, all Obama’s “close friends,” of course, descending on an already understaffed and emotionally depleted Vineyard.

“His birthday party is insane,” one of Obama’s caterers told The Post last week. “What is he thinking?”

Clearly, Obama thought to do whatever he damn well pleased — even after such backlash caused him to effectively cancel his party.

“This outdoor event was planned months ago in accordance with all public health guidelines and with COVID safeguards in place,” Obama spokesperson Hannah Hankins told the press last week. “Due to the new spread of the delta variant over the past week, the President and Mrs. Obama have decided to significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends.”

That, we now know, was a lie.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests, all free to go unmasked, while their 200 servers were reportedly forced to mask up. The tiny island’s residents, meanwhile, endured “a s—t-show” of traffic and sudden road closures enforced by the Secret Service.

Is there a more disgusting display of elitist “Rules for thee, not for me” than this?

Famously close friend David Axelrod — who sat for a hagiographic, three-part HBO Obama doc that premiered last week, who just called Obama an “apostle of hope” in the Washington Post, and the adviser most responsible for getting Obama elected in the first place — was, according to the New York Times, cut from the guest list.

Yes, David Axelrod was uninvited at the last minute so “close friends” such as H.E.R., former “Real Housewife of Atlanta” Kim Fields, Bradley Cooper and Stephen Colbert — to name but a few — could attend.

That is some cold stuff.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests for the birthday bash. Instagram

The uninvited, according to the Times, were “abruptly cut.” It tells you just where the Obamas’ post-presidential priorities are: Hollywood, podcasts, Netflix deals, and socializing with celebrities.

Musician H.E.R. was one of the guests at former President Barack Obama’s 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard. Instagram

There’s not much daylight here between the Obamas and the Markles. Who would have thought?

Consider that Jackie O, the most famous woman of her era, lived a very low-profile life on the Vineyard. Sure, she had an estate, but she did not move about ostentatiously.

Throw a lavish party filled with hundreds of A-listers while America remained gripped by a pandemic?

Jackie would never.

Barack, however, was playing 18 holes with Don Cheadle and getting serenaded by Alicia Keys. He was working it out on the dance floor with Erykah Badu while his guests drank top-shelf liquor and smoked cigars and dined from a menu curated by Questlove.

And the mainstream media cheers this on!

“Even Scaled Back, Barack Obama’s Birthday Bash is the Event of the Season,” said Vanity Fair.

“Danced All Night,” People mag said of Obama. “He Never Stopped Smiling.”

No wonder the vaccine is still politicized. No wonder there remains two Americas, despite Obama’s constant, self-aggrandizing promises to unite us.

On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci went on “Meet the Press” to warn that the Sturgis, SD, motorcycle rally (code for “MAGA crowd”) might be a superspreader event.

Then on Monday, a New York Times reporter went on CNN and quoted a Vineyard resident as saying the Obamas were fine because they invited “a sophisticated, vaccinated crowd.”

Nancy Pelosi said she didn’t go to former President Barack Obama’s birthday because she had “other parties” to go to. Maciel-Ngre-GLH / BACKGRID

That says it all. Even Twitter erupted.

“Of course viruses don’t attack sophisticated people, Muffy!” said one.

Perhaps Obama should have winnowed his list down to his close campaign strategists and loyal staffers — those who, according to the Times, were heartbroken to be thrown over for the likes of Chrissy Teigen, famous for little more than her marriage and her cyber-bullying.

These longtime loyalists, the Times said, “generally credit themselves with helping create the Obama legacy that has allowed the former president to settle in so comfortably with the A-list crowd” and all of them had “been looking forward to the reunion after an isolated year.”

Let them eat cake, indeed.

Jessica Alba honestly looks like she’s having a relaxing holiday.

The actress-turned-business maven, 40, was snapped soaking up the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, along with her husband, Cash Warren, 42, preparing for a day of snorkeling. Both looked fit and tan carting their undersea equipment around the beach.

The pair met in 2004 on the “Fantastic Four” set and tied the knot in May 2008. They share three children: daughters Honor Marie, 13, and Haven Garner, 9, and son Hayes, 3 — none of whom appeared with them on the beach.

Alba carried her flippers and mask to the water. HEM / BACKGRID

Perhaps the two needed some alone time. The “Dark Angel” star recently admitted on Katherine Schwarzenegger’s Instagram show “Before, During, and After Baby” that she has to work to keep the spark in her marriage with Warren alive, copping to feeling like a “roommate” to him.

“It’s all rosy for 2 1/2 years. But then after that, you become roommates,” she explained. “You’re just going through the motions. You have the responsibilities. It’s a lot of, like, checking the boxes, right?”

Alba recently admitted she sometimes views Warren more like a roommate. HEM / BACKGRID

Alba said that initially the couple was diligent about weekly date nights with no talk about kids or responsibilities but “that stops, because of whatever.”

The Honest Company founder also confessed to sometimes taking Warren for granted.

“We have, like, obviously the friendship, the comfort of, like, ‘You’re not going anywhere,’ and so sometimes you don’t treat those people the best, right? You don’t consider their feelings in the way that you would consider other people’s feelings,” she said. “So that is something that I think is a constant one to work on.”

Alba acknowledged that she doesn’t have the answers to a happy marriage.

“If you’ve figured it out in your relationship, let me know,” she joked.

At least the pair’s social life is going strong: They partied all night in Miami in May to celebrate Honest Company’s billion-dollar valuation.

The Cajun chicken wasn’t the only thing that was a little bit spicy at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night.

Claudine De Niro caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant, we’re told, by confronting a woman who she accused of taking her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number.

Sources say that the unnamed woman chatted with the Oscar winner around 11 p.m. at the Sag Harbor eatery, and he gave her his details before she said her goodbyes.

And we’re told that De Niro — who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — later stormed over to where the woman was sitting on a sofa in a hallway and demanded, “Why did you take his number? Don’t you know he’s my boyfriend?”

We’re told that the woman stayed seated next to a pal and barely responded, while De Niro stood over her and continued to berate her for some time.

Sources say that a pal of the woman was sufficiently concerned to move the restaurant’s management to ask Claudine to leave — which, we’re told, De Niro assured the pal that they would not. She was correct, and De Niro eventually walked away by herself and headed into the bathroom.

But a source close to De Niro told us she wasn’t being a jealous girlfriend — it was all about business.

The insider said that both De Niro and her foe are real estate agents and that De Niro was mad that the woman had wanted Gooding’s business — not good lovin’.

“It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

The source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

It’s not, of course, the first time Gooding’s got mixed up in some trouble with women.

The “Jerry McGuire” star has been charged with six counts of misdemeanor forcible touching and six counts of third-degree sexual abuse stemming from three alleged incidents. He has pleaded not guilty.

It’s also not the first time the pair have made a spectacle at a fancy spot.

Page Six reported in June 2019 that Gooding was spotted at the sceney Bowery Hotel loudly complaining about one of his accusers.

Le Bilboquet didn’t comment.

Ice-T’s wife, Coco, had strippers taking notes when she hopped on stage and danced at Sapphire on the Upper East Side Sunday night.

Ice-T co-hosted a “post-COVID” party at the Manhattan jiggle joint with film producer Noel Ashman — who also DJ’d, we hear — and Coco hit the stage when he played “I’m in Love with the Coco” by O.T. Genasis.

“Every stripper stopped dancing and started staring at her on stage. They all then gave her a high-five. It was really funny. Ice-T told him what to play, and they were going back and forth with the songs,” a spy told Page Six.

Unlike the strippers, Coco was “in her normal Coco clothes — a revealing top and tight pants,” the source said.

Ashman played music from two iPhones and an obsolete iPod, we’re told. When he played popular tracks like “Billie Jean” by Michael Jackson, and “I Want You Back” by The Jackson 5, Ice-T jokingly announced, “‘Anyone who doesn’t know this should leave!,'” the partygoer said.

When Ice-T, 63, wasn’t having fun with the crowd, the rapper-turned-“Law & Order” star was asking “all the girls who are not strippers to show their t–s,” the source said, and “a lot of them did.”

The club was so packed that security had to usher in Ice-T and Coco through a back entrance.

Old-school hip-hoppers like Treach and The Kangol Kid were also on the scene. At one point in the night, Ice-T and Treach honored late rap legends DMX and Biz Markie, which then turned into a spontaneous concert.

“They performed about four songs each including ‘O.P.P’ and ‘Colors.’ Treach went on stage with a huge wad of 20s and started spraying the crowd,” an insider said.

The evening ended a little after 4 a.m. with “everyone plastered,” we’re told.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Amid a stinker of a debate about showering habits, Rihanna has breaking news: She smells great.

The self-made billionaire seemingly took a stance in the shower vs. no shower debate on Monday, sharing a video on social media of celebrities gushing over her scent — and they’re not even talking her new Fenty perfume.

The 33-year-old shared proof of her olfactory success via a montage of stars such as Jennifer Lawrence and Cardi B being asked their thoughts on Rihanna and offering that she “smells so good.” Lil Nas X, Jim Parsons and beauty blogger NikkieTutorials even declare that the “Hard” singer smells “like heaven.”

While Ri has given a whiff of her personal scent, so have other celebrities recently, like Jake Gyllenhaal, who revealed he doesn’t believe daily bathing is necessary. And he’s not the only one: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis said they didn’t bathe their children when they were toddlers until they saw dirt on them, while Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard agreed and continue the practice with their kids. Jason Momoa, reasonably, is pro shower: “I’m Aquaman. I’m in the f–king water,” he said Monday.

Rihanna launched her first Fenty fragrance, Fenty Eau de Parfum, on Tuesday. Within just hours of its debut, the scent had sold out.

The Barbados-born crooner celebrated her launch in pure billionaire style, sharing an Instagram post of herself relaxing in bed while eating a big bowl of caviar. “How I woke up after #FENTYPARFUM sold out this morning!!!” Rihanna captioned the snap. The “Ocean’s 8” star wore a black hoodie and sunglasses in the pic. “And that’s on [caviar] for breakfast,” Rihanna’s makeup artist Priscilla Ono commented.

The new spritz is “spicy and sweet all at once,” according to the its press release, and it’s inspired by Rihanna’s favorite cities, including Bridgetown, Barbados; Grasse, France; and New York City, Paris and Los Angeles. When fans get a whiff of the scent, they’ll smell the layers of magnolia, musk, tangerine, blueberry, Bulgarian rose absolute, geranium and patchouli.

RiRi previously released several perfumes, including Reb’l Fleur, Rogue and Nude, but this is the first scent released from her own beauty brand. Sign up for the waitlist and you can get a bottle for $120 exclusively at FentyBeauty.com.

“That’s the thing I love the most,” Rihanna shared in a statement. “It’s an experience, it’s a memory, encapsulated into a fragrance. One smell, you’ll never forget it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ryan Reynolds’ newest comedy film, “Free Guy” is full of famous cameos, but one man’s guest role is sure to give everyone the feels. Late “Jeopardy” host Alex Trebek is one of those cameos that even made Reynolds get a little sappy.

Reynolds, 44, revealed back in November 2020 shortly after Trebek’s untimely passing that the game show host shot his short cameo while battling cancer.

“Alex Trebek was kind enough to film a cameo for our film ‘Free Guy’ last year despite his battle. He was gracious and funny. In addition to being curious, stalwart, generous, reassuring and of course, Canadian. We love you, Alex. And always will,” Reynolds tweeted.

Trebek and the “Deadpool” funnyman both hail from Canada and came together shortly before his death to film an episode of “Jeopardy.” The episode aired in January and Reynolds wrote at the time a touching tribute to his fellow Northerner. “It’s an honor (and a little heartbreaking) to be with #AlexTrebek one last time on @Jeopardy,” Reynolds wrote alongside the Canadian flag emoji.

Blake Lively’s husband appeared in the episode to deliver a clue under the category “Movies.” He said in a video message during the show, “In my 2020 movie ‘Free Guy’, I play a bank teller who comes to realize that he’s really an NPC, short for this kind of character in an open world video game?” Reynolds asked the contestants. The answer was a “non-player character.”

Reynolds further elaborated on his meeting with Trebek in an interview with E! News earlier this month.

“We shot that separately, actually after the film had been completely done and dusted and completed. Alex was kind enough to jump in and do this little cameo for us. I was just so blown away by how sweet he was to do that,” he said.

He continued, “Even right up shortly before he passed away, I talked to him on the phone about a charity initiative he was trying to launch. This guy was really made of good stuff right until the end. Having him in the movie is certainly bittersweet, that’s for sure.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Holy coming out, Batman!

In the latest installment of “Batman: Urban Legends,” the DC comic book character Tim Drake — a k a the Caped Crusader’s sidekick Robin — accepts an invitation to go on a date with a man named Bernard Dowd — thereby confirming Robin’s LGBTQ status, TMZ has reported.

Robin’s bisexual narrative unfolds in what one fan calls a “lightbulb moment” as he and Bernard find themselves in a streetside brawl. After the hero ultimately rescues Bernard, Robin later pays him a visit at his apartment.

As Drake, the character can be seen psyching himself up for greeting Bernard: “It’s OK, Tim. You got this.”

At Bernard’s door, Drake stammers, “I’m really glad you got home okay. I was relieved. And I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, about that night. And I — I don’t know what it meant to me. Not yet. But I’d like to figure it out.”

Bernard responds, “I was hoping you would. Tim Drake … do you want to go on a date with me?”

“Yeah, I think I want that,” Robin answers — thus concluding the episode until the next, coming in December.

Fans have long speculated that Robin may be queer, though he has dated women in previous iterations. Said one such reader, “Crazy thing, I saw Tim DRAKE coming out, years ago.. congrats to DC for making it a reality.”

Comics have been increasingly representative of the LGBTQ community as of late. In March, Marvel unveiled their first gay Captain America character — a queer youth advocate named Aaron Fischer — to be included in the upcoming “United States of Captain America” comic book miniseries.

“Aaron is inspired by heroes of the queer community: activists, leaders, and everyday folks pushing for a better life,” creator Aaron Trujillo told Entertainment Weekly at the time of that announcement.

“He stands for the oppressed, and the forgotten,” Trujillo added. “I hope his debut story resonates with readers, and helps inspire the next generation of heroes.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Carnival rides are taking to the high seas.

Carnival Cruise Line’s newest and largest-ever vessel launched out of Florida’s Port Canaveral on July 31, becoming the first-ever cruise ship to set sail with an onboard roller coaster, Bolt.

The landmark cruise creation features an 800-foot-long track marked with twists, dips and a hairpin turn around the ship’s tunnel, industry news site Cruise Critic reported. The attraction is positioned approximately 20 feet above the ship’s 18th deck — specifically, above a miniature golf course and jogging track — and 187 feet above sea level, according to Attractions Magazine. The speed is controlled by riders, who can make it go up to 40 miles per hour.

Due to its unique location on top of a cruise ship, engineers had to get creative in making the attraction functional. It does not use gravity like most roller coasters, but rather electricity. The motorcycle-like cars (only two people can ride Bolt at a time) allow riders to go faster by turning the right handlebar back, like a throttle, or pushing a button by the left handlebar for an extra boost.

For riders who choose to go as fast as possible, the Points Guy says the experience only lasts about 20 seconds. The experience costs $15, a separate fee from the cruise’s ticket price which, the Points Guy said is worth it for thrill-seekers, but certainly not everyone.

“It was certainly more exciting than I expected, but because you (or your driver) can decide how heavily to use the throttle, it’s also a great experience for people who aren’t afraid of heights but prefer a slower-paced ride,” the reviewer wrote of his time aboard Bolt. “So, is it worth the $15 price tag? It’s not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ answer. I likely wouldn’t pay it, but if you’re someone who likes the bragging rights that come with exclusive experiences or if you’ve got thrill-seeking kids, it might be money well spent.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Halle Berry proved she’s a badass on film and in real life. The Oscar winner makes her directorial debut in Netflix’s “Bruised,” where she portrays MMA fighter Jackie Justice.

Berry, who turns 55 Saturday, revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she broke two ribs on the first day filming the action flick — and refused to stop production because of it.

“Bruised” stunt coordinator Eric Brown also told the publication that the “Monster’s Ball” star’s injury was a major one. “[It was] kind of a crazy injury,” Brown said. “But that was just her intensity … Halle’s a special case. I’ve worked with tons of actors, and almost none of them have that kind of work ethic.”

Berry also fractured her ribs during the shooting of 2019’s “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum.”

“I told the director about it, they told the insurance. We had to shut down for months and it was a big ordeal,” Berry said. “On this, because it was an independent movie, we didn’t have a big budget. The director in me said, ‘I didn’t come this far and work this hard to go home.’ “

The role of Jackie Justice was originally written for “Gossip Girl” actress Blake Lively and was set to be directed by Nick Cassavetes.

After Berry took the director’s chair, the cast spent five weeks in late 2019 in Newark, New Jersey, shooting “Bruised.”

The sports drama film is set for release Nov. 24. Netflix

Berry also gave some insight into directing her first feature film to EW. “It was important to me that we make all the characters fractured and broken,” the “X-Men” star said. “Not making anybody bad or good but all shades of gray, all bruised in their way, and all fighting for their own kind of redemption and their own way of fighting to survive their circumstance.”

“I thought it was largely enough for one person to do, to take on this challenge of fighting and learning all these martial arts and playing that role,” Berry said, of stepping into the roles of both the actor and the director. “So I didn’t think I would be directing myself in my debut, ever … Initially, I think it did sound crazy to everybody.”

“Bruised” will premiere on Netflix Nov. 24.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nick Cannon is saying “no” to cancel culture, coming to rapper DaBaby’s defense following his controversial homophobic remarks at the Rolling Loud concert on July 25.

Cannon, 40, appeared on radio station 105.1’s program, “The Breakfast Club” and expressed his thoughts on the 29-year-old’s comments. The “Wild ‘N Out” host himself has previously come under fire for anti-Semitic statements he made on his “Cannon’s Class” podcast in 2020. The father of seven was fired — then re-hired — from “Wild ‘N Out” after apologizing in February 2021.

“First of all, I think not only in the black community — and I’ve experienced it — but definitely just men a lot of times, we have that ego. We believe apologizing is weakness when it actually takes great strength to step up to anyone and say, ‘I was wrong,'” Cannon said on the radio show.

He admitted that DaBaby’s comments were unwarranted and believed the “Under the Sun” rapper could endure a period of “growth” following the situation.

“I know Baby. And that’s a strong brother… That man just lost his pops, his brother, all the things that he [has been through] and still to have that big smile that he has every day, knowing everything that he comes [from]? I grew up in Charlotte [for] part of my life — I know that life,” Cannon added. “He a fighter. We’ve seen his back against the wall. He’s swinging. He’s swinging just so he could get out. We all have to accept emotion.”

The “Drumline” actor continued, “I challenge all these people who actually want to cancel somebody, and even specifically in DaBaby’s situation, let’s use this as an opportunity for education. Because that’s what happened in my scenario to where I still stuck true to the truths. [My minister] told me that I don’t ever want falsehood to come out of my mouth, so if I’m saying something that is not correct about your community, show me where I’m incorrect. Correct me.”

“If I’m saying these things about the LGBTQIA community, show me where I’m wrong,” he said. “Not only is that going to help me, but you’re going to help so many other people who think like me. There are so many DaBabys out there.”

DaBaby was dropped from concerts such as Lollapalooza and New York City’s Governors Ball Music Festival. Cannon explained that he doesn’t agree with the festivals dropping DaBaby from their lineups because they’re enforcing “mob rule.” Cannon reiterated, “Mob rule has never worked in any society.”

“This is a moment where we should all gather around DaBaby and embrace him because if we can do that, watch how many mentalities will change in the hip-hop community,” Cannon said.

On Aug. 2, DaBaby posted (then deleted) an apology for his statements, writing, “I want to apologize to the LGBTQ+ community for the hurtful and triggering comments I Made. Again, I apologize for my misinformed comments about HIV/AIDS and I know education on this is important. Love to all. God bless.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@NEW YORK — A year after depending on drive-in and virtual screenings, the New York Film Festival, one of the premier destinations of the fall festival circuit, will return to in-person premieres at Lincoln Center this September, with vaccination proof required for all attendees.

Film at Lincoln Center, which presents the annual festival, announced the lineup to the 59th NYFF on Tuesday. This fall, festivals are taking varied approaches to the pandemic. The Venice Film Festival, which kicks off the circuit, will be entirely in-person, while the soon-after Toronto International Film Festival will depend more heavily on virtual screenings in addition to gala events in downtown Toronto venues.

The New York Film Festival will include virtual events and some outdoor screenings, but forgo virtual screenings. Organizers said that decision was “in response to distributor and filmmaker partners and in light of festivals returning and theaters reopening across the country.”

Dennis Lim, the festival’s director of programming, called the lineup “a reminder of cinema’s world-making possibilities” that “help us make sense of our moment.”

“I’m in awe of the sheer range of voices, styles, ideas, and images contained in this lineup, which includes many returning filmmakers but also more new names than we’ve had in some time, and I’m eager to welcome audiences back to our cinemas to experience these films as live, communal events,” said Lim in a statement.

Oscar-winning “Nomadland” was the centerpiece screening — in the form of a drive-in experience — at the 2020 New York Film Festival. Mettie Ostrowski

The festival will kick off with the previously announced world premiere of Joel Coen’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” with Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand. Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog,” which will first debut at Venice, is the festival’s centerpiece. Pedro Almodóvar’s “Parallel Mothers” will close the festival a few weeks after it premieres at the Venice Film Festival opener.

Aside from those gala screenings, the 32 features in the festival’s main slate includes the Cannes Palme d’Or winner “Titane,” from French filmmaker Julia Ducournau; and other Cannes entries including British filmmaker Joanna Hogg’s “The Souvenir Part II”; Todd Haynes’ documentary “The Velvet Underground”; and Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s “Memoria.” Other selections include films that premiered at earlier virtual festivals like Céline Sciamma’s “Petit Maman” and Rebecca Hall’s “Passing.” Two Hong Sangsoo films will also play at NYFF: “Introduction” and “In Front of Your Face.”

The New York Film Festival runs Sept. 24 through Oct. 10.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An actress who accused Bill Cosby of assaulting her in the 1960s is dead at age 72.

Sunni Welles died on Monday following a battle with lung cancer, her son confirmed.

Welles started her acting career at just 10 years old when she appeared in sitcoms “Leave It to Beaver” and “My Three Sons.”

She was renowned for her friendship with Elvis Presley, which blossomed when she toured the world as a singer and dancer.

Welles went on to marry fellow singer and actor John O’Banion, with whom she shared a son before their divorce. She is survived by her son, Shaun O’Banion.

In the late 1990s, she retired from acting and performed as a jazz soloist with her band Shiver.

She then went on to settle down in Santa Monica, California, and worked as a spiritual medium until she was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Back in 2015, Welles joined the mass of women who accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault, who she met on the set of TV series “I Spy.”

She said she was a 17-year-old aspiring singer at the time of her encounter with Cosby, which took place in the mid-1960s in Hollywood after a visit to a jazz club.

Sunni Welles speaks at a 2018 news conference in Norristown, Pennsylvania, after Bill Cosby was sentenced. AP

‘HE WAS A STAR’

In a statement, she claimed that she ordered a Coke at the club. She added that she did not remember leaving the club and later woke up in an apartment naked and alone, feeling as though she had had sex.

Once Welles called Cosby, she claimed he said she drank Champagne and he took her to the apartment to sleep it off.

“He was a star. He was Bill Cosby and I buried it in my memory until all of these brave women began to come forward,” said Welles, who sobbed during her statement.

Pennsylvania’s highest court threw out Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction and released him from prison back in June in a stunning reversal of fortune for the comedian once known as “America’s Dad,” ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case was bound by his predecessor’s agreement not to charge Cosby.

Cosby, 83, flashed the V-for-victory sign to a helicopter overhead as he trudged into his suburban Philadelphia home after serving nearly three years of a 3- to 10-year sentence for drugging and violating Temple University sports administrator Andrea Constand in 2004.

The former “Cosby Show” star — the first celebrity tried and convicted in the #MeToo era — had no comment as he arrived and just smiled and nodded later at a news conference outside, where his lawyer Jennifer Bonjean said: “We are thrilled to have Mr. Cosby home.”

“He served three years of an unjust sentence and he did it with dignity and principle,” she added.

In a statement, Constand and her lawyers called the ruling disappointing, and they, like many other advocates, expressed fear that it could discourage sexual assault victims from coming forward. “We urge all victims to have their voices heard,” they added.

Cosby was arrested in 2015 when a district attorney armed with newly unsealed evidence — the comic’s damaging deposition in a lawsuit brought by Constand — filed charges against him just days before the 12-year statute of limitations was about to run out.

But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said Wednesday that District Attorney Kevin Steele, who made the decision to arrest Cosby, was obligated to stand by his predecessor’s promise not to charge Cosby, though there was no evidence that agreement was ever put in writing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Life imitating art. Eden Morrissey, a teen from the United Kingdom, was down in the dumps when she went through a breakup in the summer of 2020. So she did what any sane woman would do — she quit her job and moved to Paris!

Morrissey, 19, is now living a life reminiscent of Netflix’s lighthearted series “Emily in Paris.” She spoke to the Daily Mail about how she gained 100,000 online followers after she began posting her daily adventures in the City of Lights after fleeing her hometown of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

She explained that she knew no one in the city upon her arrival in October 2020. However, she managed to make friends and even began dating someone new. She also scored a job working as an au pair in the French capital.

“I was working for Laura Mercier at the time and had a plan to stay with them and work my way up, because I really liked my brand. But by September 2020, I became exhausted by the restrictions caused by the pandemic and ended up just stacking shelves rather than doing my job,” Morrissey said.

“It’s matured me massively,” she said of her spontaneous move to the City of Love. @edenmorrissey / Caters News

She continued, “I also went through a breakup which was the catalyst in me moving away, and one day, I went to my sister’s house and started crying to her, and she jokingly suggested I should go somewhere new like Paris.”

She also revealed that, in the beginning, her parents were not too keen on the idea of their daughter moving to another country. Morrissey added that her job as an au pair includes looking after a couple’s young daughter, picking her up from school, cooking for her and helping her learn English.

“It’s matured me massively. I wouldn’t have grown up this quickly if I had stayed in the UK, because I threw myself out of my comfort zone completely,” she said.

“Emily in Paris” follows Lily Collins as the title character as she moves away from Chicago to the city of pain au chocolat and Bordeaux for a new job, new friends and a new beau.

Emily Jackson, a 28-year-old North Carolina native, is also epitomizing the series in her own life. “Not only do I share the name and career of the main character, but much of the plot resonates with me,” Jackson told The Post in October 2020. “There’s a lot of clichés but some truths.” She has lived in France for six years, summing it up as “beautiful, difficult and worth it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Alex Cord, the star of 1980s military drama “Airwolf,” has died. He was 88.

Cord’s publicist and friend of 20 years, Linda McAlister, confirmed the news to Deadline on Tuesday. The prolific character actor passed away at his Valley View, Texas, home on Monday morning.

The Floral Park, Long Island, native was best known for his role in the CBS series “Airwolf,” in which he played the white suit and eyepatch-wearing Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (code name: Archangel), a mysterious government contact trying to recover the supersonic helicopter Airwolf from Libya, where it was used by villains to sink American warships.

The show, which also starred Jan-Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine, ran for three seasons and is remembered for its synth-heavy soundtrack and for being one of three helicopter-based TV dramas to debut in 1984.

While best recalled for the iconic eyepatch-wearing “Airwolf” role, the prolific Cord’s career included both film and television parts. Over a four-decade span from the 1960s through the 1990s, Cord racked up dozens of credits in shows including “Route 66,” “The Love Boat,” “Fantasy Island,” “Murder, She Wrote,” “Police Story” and “Walker, Texas Ranger.” He also appears in the movies “The Last Grenade,” “The Dead Are Alive!,” “Grayeagle,” “The Naked Truth,” “Stiletto,” “Stagecoach” and “Jungle Warriors.”

He also made appearances in both CBS’s original “Mission: Impossible” series, which aired from 1966 to 1973, and a 1988 revival — a distinction which, Variety noted, is an honor few other actors can lay claim to.

Born in 1933, Cord beat polio as a child and went on to become a horseman, a skill he used to score a slew of roles in Westerns, Deadline wrote. He graduated from New York University and Connecticut’s American Shakespeare Theatre before scoring his first role in the NBC western “Laramie” in 1961. His first film came the following year in Warner Bros.’ “The Chapman Report.”

The artwork for the Pedro Almodóvar-directed drama simply shows a lone breast dripping milk in front of a red background. Artist Javier Jaén said Monday that the poster was deemed too racy for Instagram. He shared the promo piece on social media again and wrote in Spanish, “As expected @instagram has removed the poster we made for Almodóvar’s latest film #madresparalelas. I will post it again. Thank you for sharing it.”

Fans loved the poster and commented their appreciation for the graphic. “Magnificent work for an amazing film director! Bravo Javier!” one user exclaimed. “Your work is always excellent [and is] breaking barriers, Javier 🙌,” another added. Many other fans simply commented heart, fire and clapping hands emojis to celebrate the risqué artwork.

“Parallel Mothers” is set to premiere at the Venice Film Festival Sept. 1. The movie was shot in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and follows two pregnant mothers who meet in a hospital before giving birth to their babies.

The official plot from Sony reads, “Two women, Janis and Ana, coincide in a hospital room where they are going to give birth. Both are single and became pregnant by accident. Janis, middle-aged, doesn’t regret it and she is exultant. The other, Ana, an adolescent, is scared, repentant and traumatized. Janis tries to encourage her while they move like sleepwalkers along the hospital corridors.”



“The few words they exchange in these hours will create a very close link between the two, which by chance develops and complicates, and changes their lives in a decisive way,” the synopsis concludes.

Director Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of “Dune,” starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will also premiere at the festival, which is scheduled to run until Sept. 11.

The Post has reached out to Cruz, Jaén and Sony for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Female filmmakers are decrying the upcoming honor being presented to embattled actor Johnny Depp.

It was announced this week that the 58-year-old “Pirates of the Caribbean” star would receive the Donostia, a lifetime achievement award, during the 69th annual San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain.

Cristina Andreu, the president of Spain’s Association of Female Filmmakers and Audiovisual Media, said she was “very surprised” in a statement.

“This speaks very badly of the festival and its leadership, and transmits a terrible message to the public: ‘It doesn’t matter if you are an abuser as long as you are a good actor,’ ” Andreu told the Associated Press.

Andreu added that her organization, which works closely with the event, is “studying next steps” to take.

Depp is expected to accept the prize in person on September 22 — his third live appearance during the festival in northern Spain, which lasts from September 17 to 25.

In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, San Sebastián’s festival director José Luis Rebordinos said “the role of a film festival is not to judge the conduct of members of the film industry. The role of a film festival is to select the most relevant and interesting films of the year and to extend recognition to those who have made an extraordinary contribution to the art of film.”

The Depp remains embroiled in lawsuits over allegations of domestic abuse by ex-wife Amber Heard as of late, with a British judge ruling that the charges were “substantially correct.” Last year, a libel case Depp brought against British tabloid the Sun, which had characterized the actor as a “wife-beater” to Heard, was ruled in favor of the newspaper. The British court further refused Depp’s appeal, saying his initial hearing was “full and fair.”

In 2019, Depp filed a defamation suit against Heard in Virginia for $50 million after the “Aquaman” actress wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post on domestic violence, drawing on her experience with Depp.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He just got Burrned.

Stand-up comic Bill Burr is going viral after lambasting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over his recent anti-mask mandates, which were imposed despite the Sunshine State’s unprecedented spike in COVID-19 infections. The “F Is for Family” creator dropped the bombshell on his “Monday Morning Podcast.”

Speaking on the Republican’s possible 2024 presidential run, the 53-year-old funny guy fumed, “DeSantis, whoever this guy is — and they have the most grumpiest-looking photo ever — this guy is starting to build stature in 2024, and he says he disagrees on mask mandates.”

The “Breaking Bad” actor, who is known for trashing figures on both sides of the political aisle, said he found it “hilarious” that elected officials who don’t own a microscope or a pair of scrubs are “literally questioning doctors.”

“These f–king piece of s–t politicians,” Burr added. “He knows that that’s what his fanbase wants him to do, so that’s what the f–k he’s gonna do. Unbelievable.”

Later in the podcast, the outspoken “Mandalorian” star took shots at anti-maskers in general, ranting, “People won’t even put on a mask for three minutes to walk into a 7-Eleven to buy beef jerky without feeling like they’re living behind the Berlin Wall.”

DeSantis’ mask mandate ban comes after Florida experienced 134,506 new COVID-19 cases, recording its highest infection rate since March 2020. SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett

The comedian’s criticism comes after DeSantis signed an executive order banning school districts from establishing mask mandates, a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that students and staff wear masks amid the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. The governor’s office is even considering withholding the salaries of public school officials who institute mask mandates in their districts.

And he’s not just cracking down on facewear initiatives. Last week, DeSantis attempted to impose a law prohibiting cruise ships — which were major hotbeds of coronavirus contagion early in the pandemic — from requiring passengers to provide proof of vaccination. However, he was overruled by US District Judge Kathleen Williams, who granted the cruise line’s request for a preliminary injunction.

The policies come after Florida recorded a whopping 134,506 new cases of the coronavirus, marking the state’s highest infection rate in a single week since March 2020. If that wasn’t troubling enough, on Sunday the state reported having the highest number of children — 172 — hospitalized with the virus.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm on a rare illness that was previously only seen in tropical climates, particularly South Asia and northern Australia.

Now, two people are dead and two have recovered after being infected with melioidosis — a disease that had never before been detected on contiguous US soil. Melioidosis has now been seen in Georgia, Kansas, Texas and Minnesota, LiveScience reported. The only other known cases of melioidosis in the US were in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.

None of the four patients claimed to have traveled outside the country prior to becoming sick between March and July of this year.

The CDC “believes the most likely cause is an imported product (such as a food or drink, personal care or cleaning products or medicine) or an ingredient in one of those types of products,” according to the statement released Monday.

Investigators have taken more than 100 samples of soil, water and common products used in and around each patient’s home in order to discover a link between the four cases — but have found no common source thus far. However, genome sequencing of the bacteria has revealed that the four cases are likely somehow related, the CDC added.

About a dozen cases of melioidosis are seen each year in Americans, nearly all of which can be attributed to travel. This is the first time doctors are seeing the illness seemingly originate within the contiguous US.

Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, melioidosis can take several weeks to set in after exposure to the pathogen. Symptoms include cough and shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, intermittent fever and body rashes, the CDC wrote in a message to physicians on how to spot the illness.

Risk factors for developing the disease include diabetes, liver or kidney disease, chronic lung disease, cancer or another condition that weakens the immune system, the CDC warned.

One of the known cases of melioidosis — involving a 4-year-old girl — was recently publicized in Texas. Preschooler Lylah Baker had no known risk factors for the illness when she was sickened in May. Lylah spent a month in the intensive care unit of Children’s Medical Center Dallas, requiring a ventilator and eventually suffering brain damage, according to the Dallas Morning News.

“She was a healthy, typical little girl about to start pre-K in the fall — no underlying health issues previously. I mean just nothing,” Ashley Kennon, the child’s aunt, told the newspaper. “So it was definitely a major surprise to everybody not knowing where [the bacteria] came from.”

Lylah is convalescing at Our Children’s House Dallas.

The CDC is urging doctors to be aware of melioidosis symptoms regardless of their patients’ locations and travels.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Google has rolled out a new internal calculator to explain potential pay cuts to employees who choose to work remotely — and the early results suggests it will penalize its suburban staffers.

Screenshots obtained by Reuters show that Google employees who previously commuted an hour to Google’s Manhattan offices from nearby Stamford, Conn., for example, would see their salaries slashed by 15 percent if they choose to continue working from home.

By contrast, “Googlers” who live within NYC’s five boroughs and choose to work from home permanently would not see their pay slashed at all.

The screenshots also showed 5 percent and 10 percent differences for commuters living in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.

Google employees who move even farther away from the company’s offices have been warned they could face even harsher pay cuts. A worker who left San Francisco for Lake Tahoe, another expensive area of California, would have their pay cut by a whopping 25 percent.

That would mean an employee with a $150,000 salary would suddenly make less than $112,000 per year.

The calculator states it uses US Census Bureau metropolitan statistical areas, or CBSAs. Stamford, Conn., for example, is not in New York City’s CBSA, even though many people who live there work in New York.

News of the Google tool comes amid a broader debate at tech companies about remote work and compensation.

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have all warned employees who plan to leave expensive cities like New York and San Francisco that their pay will be slashed — while smaller tech companies like Reddit and Zillow say they’ll pay the same regardless of where employees live.

Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination, said Google’s pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely, including families.

“What’s clear is that Google doesn’t have to do this,” Rosenfeld told Reuters. “Google has paid these workers at 100 percent of their prior wage, by definition. So it’s not like they can’t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.”

Google, which has about 140,000 employees worldwide, took in $61.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of this year alone.

The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Post and did not address the Stamford commuter issue in a statement to Reuters.

“Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

“Yeah I am not going to stop talking about this lol,” she captioned a news story about her play on Instagram.

The 24-year-old is a senior at Cal State Northridge, pursuing a degree in deaf studies. She is a proud member of Alpha Phi sorority.

Rohan is a former gymnast and softball player, according to past posts on her public Instagram account — where she documents her relationship with boyfriend Justin Fallon, a ticket operations supervisor with the Dodgers.

When she’s not saving the day at Dodger Stadium, Rohan is like any other college student. She enjoys snowboarding, partying in Vegas, snapping the occasional selfie, and hitting the beach with friends.

Bottom line: Don’t try to get past the Dodgers ball girl.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kevin Nealon isn’t worried about getting canceled.

“I’m pretty woke on all that stuff,” the “Saturday Night Live” alum told Page Six. “I have a 14-year-old [son Gabe with wife Susan Yeagley]. In school, they really teach them well. So anytime I start going astray he says, ‘No, you’re kind of going in the wrong direction.'”

But the 67-year-old comedian allows that he’s never been one to push the envelope in his act.

“I wouldn’t want to offend anybody or insult anybody … My act has always been very appropriate,” he explained.

“I’ve never been a risk-taker as far as that was concerned. I’ve never been one of those edgy, ranting comics who just seemingly say what’s on their mind and sometimes get into trouble.”

Nealon began his career in stand-up, joined “SNL” in 1987 and stayed on for a then-record-breaking nine seasons, playing characters like Mr. Subliminal, the politically incorrect private investigator Frank Gannon and, of course, Franz (of weightlifting duo Hans and Franz) alongside Dana Carvey.

Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey as “Hans and Franz” on “Saturday Night Live.”

“It was striking gold just to be on that show because I was more of a stand-up than an actor or a sketch player,” he said adding that his favorite thing about being part of “SNL” was working with musical idols like Paul McCartney and James Taylor, who would sometimes stay and play a private mini-concert.

Since leaving “SNL,” Nealon has carved out a steady career in shows like “Weeds,” “Last Man Standing,” and a string of Adam Sandler movies. And in between stand-up appearance, he updates his YouTube series, “Hiking with Kevin,” in which he goes on hikes with various celebs.

The Connecticut-raised star is currently in the midst of a stand-up tour and says that audiences have been great.

“I was thinking that maybe I got funnier,” he quipped, “but I think people are happy to be out there and more grateful — they appreciate what they have now. They want to enjoy life again.”

Nealon is a talented caricaturist. Instagram

If he decides to quit stand-up, Nealon could very well become a professional artist. He often features his incredible caricatures on social media, explaining that he took a ten-class course via Skype during the COVID-19 lockdown.

His visual prowess spans multiple mediums as well: Nealon has another Instagram solely dedicated to his photos of his wife, “Parks and Rec” alum Susan Yeagley, at different locales throughout the U.S.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The woman who Claudine De Niro berated at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night for getting her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number tells us she was “scared” by the incident and feels “traumatized.”

As Page Six previously reported, De Niro —who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant allegedly yelling at a woman who got the “Jerry Maguire” actor’s digits.

Now we can reveal that the woman at the center of the conflict was Lieba Nesis, a Harvard-educated lawyer and writer. She tells us De Niro was “aggressive” and “harassing [and] berating” her for at least an hour.

Nesis, who runs with the elite Hamptons and New York City social crowd, tells us that she and Gooding Jr. have known each other for seven or eight years.

“Not well, but we always say hello,” she said.

She says the Oscar winner told her at the restaurant that he’s shooting a film in Miami in September and looking for a place to stay, so she told him that she owns property there that was going to be empty while he was in town. He put his digits in her phone to follow up, Nesis says.

But De Niro saw the exchange go down and lost it.

“His girlfriend goes, ‘Oh my God, what are you doing? That’s my boyfriend! You can’t take down the number,’ and she’s screaming ‘What the f-ck are you doing!” Nesis tells us. “So I started to explain and she was like, ‘You better stop doing that. That’s my boyfriend.”

“She was going on and on so I walked into the other room and thought, ‘Ok, this will simmer down. I come back in and she’s pointing at me and screaming across the room, ‘You better get out of here. You better leave this place.’ Everyone is staring at me.”

“She wasn’t screaming at the top of her lungs,” she added, “but it was very intimidating to me.”

“I really was scared,” she said, “I am not going to fight. I wasn’t expecting to go out and get in a fight. I am spending thousands a weekend to go to the Hamptons and get away from negative energy, I don’t want to do drama. I was like, I’m not going to engage and hopefully she will calm down but she didn’t.”

Nesis says she went into another room again and sat on a sofa to get away from the situation, but that De Niro followed her.

“She comes and stands right on top of me where I am sitting like, ‘You better get the hell out of here,'” Nesis says, adding that De Niro was “cursing me out.”

She says that no one stuck up for her, except for former “Real Housewives of New York” star Jill Zarin, who tried to get management to step in — but nobody from the restaurant intervened.

“The more I tried to explain [that] I was just trying to help, the angrier she got,” Nesis says. “She kept saying, ‘That is my boyfriend, I am a broker, why was I trying to take your business.’ I told her I am not, I am a Harvard-educated lawyer. But she would get angrier and angrier and more out of control.”

Nesis adds, “She was saying she’s a real estate agent and we’re foes, but I don’t know her. I have never met her. I didn’t know she was a real estate agent and I am not a broker. I was in a state of shock. It was out of hand.”

According to her LinkedIn page, De Niro has worked for real estate company Compass for four months. She previously worked at Prudential Douglas Elliman.

Gooding Jr., for his part, seemed to cut and run as things took a turn.

“In the beginning, he was trying to explain and then he just disappeared out of sight,” Nesis says. “I guess he saw she wasn’t going to be mollified … He was somewhere but he wasn’t confronting the situation.”

Nesis wound up leaving to get out of the situation when it allegedly became clear after an hour that De Niro was not going to let up.

She says she now fears another run-in.

“It’s a small circle. I like Bilboquet. It’s a lot of fun,” she says. “I am terrified to go there now. I am worried about seeing her. I was traumatized. I am non-confrontational.”

“It’s like, is she dangerous?” Nesis said. “I wasn’t sure. I felt like I was in danger. You can’t be safe anywhere, even in the Hamptons.”

When we texted De Niro for comment, she wrote in all caps, “Jill Zarin and Lieba are full of s–t,” before texting a few more things and quickly deleting them from WhatsApp, and then adding, “No comment.”

A source previously told Page Six that De Niro’s reaction wasn’t about jealousy over Gooding Jr., but about business. “It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

That source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

De Niro and Gooding Jr. have been dating since 2018, when Page Six first spotted the pair.

In 2019, De Niro was caught on camera berating Gooding Jr. at a bar in Miami, knocking bottles and glasses off the top of the bar before being removed by security. A lawyer for Gooding Jr., Mark Heller, said she got a “little overly playful” while partying with her beau. A source later said she was upset when the actor took a friend’s side over something she was upset about and “it was just a silly argument.”

Like many of us, rapper Cardi B doesn’t quite understand why so many celebrities have shared that they don’t bathe regularly, tweeting her confusion over the admissions Tuesday.

“Wassup with people saying they don’t shower? It’s giving itchy,” the “WAP” rapper, 28, tweeted after several stars admitted that daily showers just aren’t necessary in their household.

Jake Gyllenhaal is the latest to admit he doesn’t find bathing regularly “necessary.”

“More and more I find bathing to be less necessary, at times,” Gyllenhaal, 40, told Vanity Fair last week while promoting Prada’s Luna Rossa Ocean fragrance.

“I do believe, because Elvis Costello is wonderful, that good manners and bad breath get you nowhere. So I do that. But I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.”

Days prior, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard had explained that they wait for their daughters to “stink” before cleaning them.

Mila Kunis, 37, and Ashton Kutcher, 43, have also shared that they only gave baths to their kids, Wyatt and Dimitri, as infants when they could “see the dirt on them.”

“I didn’t have hot water growing up as a child, so I didn’t shower much anyway,” said Kunis of her own showering habits, with Kutcher adding, “I wash my armpits and my crotch daily, and nothing else ever. I got a bar of Lever 2000 that delivers every time.”

Not all celebs are skipping the soap and water, however, as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson waded into the discourse, insisting he showers multiple times a day.

“I’m the opposite of a ‘not washing themselves’ celeb,” the “Jumanji” actor, 49, tweeted Friday. “Shower (cold) when I roll outta bed to get my day rollin’. Shower (warm) after my workout before work. Shower (hot) after I get home from work.”

Johnson was soon joined by Jason Mamoa, who told Access Hollywood Monday, “I’m not starting any trends. I shower, trust me.”

“I’m Aquaman,” Mamoa, 42, added. “I’m in the f–king water. Don’t worry about it. I’m Hawaiian. We got saltwater on me. We good.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kathy Griffin was hard at work before undergoing life-saving cancer surgery.

The comedian is guest-starring on the upcoming fifth season of the HBO Max comedy “Search Party” — which she was shooting amid her lung cancer battle, a source close to Griffin told The Post.

The 60-year-old plays Liquorice Montague, a conspiracy theorist who takes Chantal (Clare McNulty) under her wing as a “co-dependent apprentice,” according to Variety.

Our source also gave an update on Griffin’s health post-surgery.

“She loved the experience working on the show and it was a great creative outlet before undergoing her lung cancer surgery,” the source said. “She is still in recovery but getting better every day.”

The Post has reached out to the show and representatives for Griffin.

Showrunners Sarah-Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers explained in a joint statement to Variety that “working with Kathy was a huge life moment for us. She brought so much warmth, humanity and professionalism to set, and delivered a performance that will delight the world.”

Season 4 of “Search Party” concluded in January and showed Dory’s (Alia Shawkat) friends believing she died in a fire that engulfed the house she was being held prisoner in. The fifth season will see Dory coming into a business partnership with tech billionaire Tunnel Quinn (Jeff Goldblum).

The “My Life on the D-List” star revealed to the world on Aug. 2 that she was suffering from cancer despite “never” smoking, and that she would undergo surgery to have half of her left lung removed. In a lengthy Twitter note, Griffin wrote, “The doctors are very optimistic as it is stage one and contained to my left lung.” She added that she’s hopeful that she won’t need to get chemotherapy or radiation treatment after surgery. “I should be up and running around as usual in a month or less,” she continued.

Her revelation made headlines the same day that ABC’s “Nightline” aired an interview in which she shared some scary details about her secret pill addiction and suicidal thoughts in early 2020.

A few days after her cancer announcement, Griffin explained that her surgery “went well” and she’s in recovery.

Griffin — being the funny woman that she is — shared a video on Aug. 8, shortly after her operation, and laughed at the fact her voice is “really hoarse.” In her health update, she said, “Hi, you guys. I might start to post little videos about, like, my recovery and stuff, but my voice is, like, really hoarse.”

“I’m laughing. It’s just even that notion,” she said. “Also, for some reason, I laugh at everything now. And if it’s horrible, I laugh way more!”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Looks like the popularity of the new hosts of “Jeopardy!” is, in fact, in jeopardy.

News broke Wednesday that after a long and exhaustive search for the new host of the iconic game show, its executive producer, Mike Richards, and actress Mayim Bialik both scored the coveted job, with Richards in the daily hosting seat and Bialik helming spinoff iterations. But fans aren’t happy with the two taking over for the late Alex Trebek.

The star of “The Big Bang Theory,” 45, tweeted out a response to the news: “IT’S TRUE!!! Been waiting a long time to tell you all. Really really honored and astounded and excited for this — it’s beyond anything I ever imagined could happen.”

Viewers were hoping that the new host would be fan favorite LeVar Burton — who guest-hosted the quiz show on July 26.

Meghan McCain disappointedly tweeted, “Why couldn’t they just give it to @levarburton like literally everyone on the planet wanted?”

Oscar-winning filmmaker Matthew A. Cherry interjected, “RIP Jeopardy. Was fun while it lasted.” Another fan, New York Times reporter Astead Herndon, wrote, “After all that ….. the jeopardy exec producer just chose …….. himself lmaoooo.”

“Selma” director Ava DuVernay posted a “Schitt’s Creek” meme and wrote, “Me trying to create a show right in this moment for @levarburton to host and make an international hit.”

Other fans chimed in with their thoughts on the new hosts. “I’m glad to see Mayim Bialik, but definitely was on team LeVar Burton. The two of them would’ve been great together,” wrote one user.

Journalist Jamal Jordan (known in the Twittersphere as Lil Uzi Hurt) added, “JEOPARDY CHOSE *TWO* HOSTS AND NEITHER IS NAMED LEVAR BURTON.”

Some fans were gunning for Ken Jennings, who holds the record for most consecutive wins on the show (74) and won $4.4 million over 15 years of being a contestant.

“Levar Burton is a GOAT, but terrible fit for Jeopardy. That being said, only Ken Jennings was the right fit for the main host position, not Mayim Bialik or Mike Richards,” wrote a critic.

Whined another from the other side of the argument: “Why the f–k would they not give the job to LeVar Burton? He wanted it. The audience wanted it. Instead we get random producer and Blossom,” referring to Bialik’s titular character from the ’90s teen sitcom.

Another fan reiterated, “I was genuinely excited when i thought that [Burton] was going to be the new host, and now i am genuinely disappointed (not that i can even watch the show outside the US, but i just think @levarburton should host/star in everything).”

Richards, who was the rumored front-runner, gave tribute to Trebek — who died at age 80 in November after a battle with pancreatic cancer — in the announcement that he would ascend to the podium, which Trebek had manned since 1984.

“I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to host the syndicated version of ‘Jeopardy!’” said Richards. “Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined being chosen to step into a role of this magnitude. I am incredibly humbled to step behind the lectern and will work tirelessly to make sure our brilliant contestants shine in each and every episode.

“Alex believed the game itself and the contestants are the most important aspects of the show. I was fortunate to witness his professionalism, intensity and kindness up close and that will serve as the ultimate blueprint as we continue to produce the show we love. I am thrilled that Mayim is joining the ‘Jeopardy!’ team. Her academic track record and enthusiasm for the game made her a terrific guest host. It will be a privilege to produce the prime time series with her as host.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pablo Picasso once said “art is the elimination of the unnecessary,” and admirers of his paintings should be prepared to eliminate quite a few zeros from their bank accounts if they hope to own one of his works of art.

In what organizers are boasting is the “largest and most significant fine art auction to ever take place in Las Vegas,” MGM Resorts and Sotheby’s will conduct a sale of 11 Pablo Picasso paintings believed to be worth as much as $104 million on Oct. 23.

The event will take place at the Las Vegas casino Bellagio, where all of the masterpieces have long been displayed.

The Picassos up for grabs span the artist’s career, and include paintings, paper works and ceramics he varyingly created between 1917 and 1969. These include “Femme au béret rouge-orange,” a portrait of the painter’s muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter, estimated to be worth $20 to $30 million; the large-scale “Homme et enfant” and “Buste d’homme,” from the Spaniard’s late period, both valued at upward of $15 million; and the still life “Nature morte au panier de fruits et aux fleurs.”

Bellagio founder and art collector Steve Wynn acquired many of the works set to be auctioned during the late 1990s, and despite a number of company sales and mergers, they’ve remained on display at the casino’s upscale Picasso Restaurant.

Previously, restaurant guests could see the Marie-Thérèse portrait and “Homme et enfant” hanging above separate sideboards and the “Buste d’homme” behind the restaurant’s bar, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, two other multimillion-dollar works soon to be up for auction were hung over a banquette.

The Picasso Restaurant will not be stripped bare of its namesake’s work as a result of the auction. “In order for us to keep the name on the door, of course we have to showcase Picasso’s work,” MGM Resorts’ chief hospitality officer Ari Kastrati told Bloomberg. Some of the 12 other Picassos in the Bellagio’s parent company’s collection will be used to replace the auctioned items.

Ahead of their sale, the auction lots will make an appearance in New York on Sept. 7 to 13 and a more selectively curated assortment will also go to Taipei and Hong Kong later next month.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Suicide Squad” star Joel Kinnaman is under investigation for rape in Sweden — but the actor claims the accusation comes from an obsessed woman seeking revenge over a restraining order.

The public prosecutor announced Wednesday they were investigating the allegation against Kinnaman, TMZ first reported.

But the actor’s legal team told The Post the alleged victim, a Swedish model, only stepped forward with the accusation after Kinnaman had gone to the police himself and gotten the restraining order.

Kinnaman claimed in a recent social media thread that he was being extorted by model Gabriella Magnusson, who goes by the name Bella Davis. On Friday, Kinnaman filed an extortion complaint against her in Sweden and got a restraining order against her in Los Angeles, his attorney Patricia Glaser told The Post.

Klinnaman claimed on social media that he was being extorted by Gabriella Magnusson. Instagram

“It appears that after learning of the restraining order, she filed her complaint,” Glaser said.

“The court papers that Mr. Kinnaman filed stated, among other things, that Ms. Davis threatened to publicize false information about Mr. Kinnaman – including that he had sex with her against her will – unless he capitulated to her monetary and other demands, which included Hollywood introductions, a work visa sponsorship, a blue verification checkmark on Instagram, and more.”

The actor will be cooperating with police “to clear his name,” Glaser added.

A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office told E! News on Wednesday that the probe had just started.

“The prosecutor got the case today and has hardly been able to look at it,” the spokesperson said.

After the temporary restraining order, Davis told E! News that she never threatened Kinnaman or asked him for money. The actor “should have an Oscar for how he’s writing and acting,” she said, according to the outlet.

Kinnaman, 41, had taken to Instagram last Friday saying the model became obsessive after a consensual sexual relationship and was trying to extort him for money and things like a Sports Illustrated photo shoot.

The two met up and had sex in November 2018, when Kinnaman was single, he wrote. A month later, they met and had sex again but didn’t spend the night together because he had work early the next day, he claimed.

“The next day she texted me that she was bothered that I had not asked her to spend the night and that I did not check with her to make sure she made it home safely,” he wrote.

Davis contacted him again in 2019 and 2020 asking to meet up, but he was in a relationship so he didn’t respond, he added. After “increasingly obsessive communication” he tried to cut it off, according to the actor’s post.

“But Bella continued to try to communicate with me – texting and calling from other people’s phones – and these communications became more and more antagonistic, threatening, and frightening over time,” he wrote.

She then threatened to go public to say he “had sex with her against her will,” the actor claimed.

On July 25, he claims they had a lengthy conversation that he recorded.

“At one point, she stated, ‘Do you know how much money I would get and how famous I would be if I went to the press?” he stated.

“She also made threats of physical violence against me and my family by herself and others, including her brother, a convicted felon, who pointed a rifle at my manager,” he added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Olivia Rodrigo is not here for fans trying to pit her and Sabrina Carpenter against each other.

The “Sour” singer responded to fans who think that the lyrics to her hit single, “Drivers License,” are about the former Disney Channel starlet.

Rodrigo, 18, was profiled for Variety‘s Power of Young Hollywood issue where she touched upon the situation that followed after listeners heard the song.

Many fans believed that the lyrics were about the alleged relationship between her “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” co-star Joshua Bassett and Carpenter, 22.

The lyrics in question said, “And you’re probably with that blonde girl/Who always made me doubt/She’s so much older than me/She’s everything I’m insecure about.”

Rodrigo explained to the outlet she wasn’t prepared for how much of a stir her lyrics would cause. “I put it out not knowing that it would get that reaction, so it was really strange [when] it did,” the “Good 4 U” rocker said. “I just remember [everyone being] so weird and speculative about stuff they had no idea about.”

“I don’t really subscribe to hating other women because of boys,” Rodrigo elaborated. “I think that’s so stupid, and I really resent that narrative that was being tossed around.”

Taylor Swift and Rodrigo met each other at the 2021 BRIT Awards. JMEnternational for BRIT Awards/

She added how she forged a friendship with her music idol, Taylor Swift. “It’s so nice to be welcomed into the music industry and so great to be supportive of other women,” she said. “[Swift] wrote me a letter a while ago, and she wrote something about how you make your own luck in the world, and how you treat other people always comes back to you.”

Fellow Disney star Selena Gomez also crossed paths with Rodrigo. “I met Selena, and she was so kind,” Rodrigo said. “She talked to me a lot about prioritizing mental health, which I think is really important in this industry. All of us were in the limelight very young [and] that can be taxing on your psyche and can bring about all these weird issues.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Seven years ago, the world lost a comedic and cinematic icon when Robin Williams died on August 11, 2014, at the age of 63.

But the loss was more acute for Zak Williams, his eldest son.

The 38-year-old took to Twitter with a heartfelt post on Wednesday to commemorate the anniversary of his father’s death.

“Dad, seven years ago today you passed on,” he wrote. “The joy and inspiration you brought to the world carries on in your legacy and in your family, friends, and fans you so loved. You lived to bring laughter and to help others. I will be celebrating your memory today. Love you forever.”

That emotional message comes just weeks after the Prepare Your Mind CEO posted an equally gut-wrenching photo on Instagram, celebrating what would have been the “Good Will Hunting” star’s 70th birthday on July 21.

“Dad, on what would be your 70th birthday, I would want you to know that your incredible spirit lives within us,” he wrote. “Our family will be celebrating you and your memory today. We miss you and love you always!”

Robin Williams took his own life in 2014 after suffering for months from what was initially diagnosed as Parkinson’s disease but an autopsy would prove to be Lewy body dementia.

Zak is the only child his father had with his first wife, Valerie Velardi. The late star is also the father of another son, Cody Williams, 29, and a daughter, Zelda Williams, 32, both with his second wife, Marsha Garces.

Since the Oscar-winning actor’s passing, Zak has dedicated his life to mental health advocacy. The co-founder of Prepare Your Mind supplements, he also supports nonprofits and speaks candidly about his father’s mental health struggles as well as his own.

“After my dad took his life in August of 2014, my anxiety went into overdrive,” he explains on the PYM website. “I found myself depressed, anxious, traumatized and unable to cope with daily life.”

Williams opened up earlier this year during an interview with Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry on the duo’s Apple TV+ series, “The Me You Can’t See,” as well as “The Genius Life” podcast.

When discussing his initial inability to mourn fully due to his father’s public impact, Williams said, “From my end, I didn’t get a chance to focus on the private grieving process until about a year and a half after my dad passed away, meaning that I didn’t recognize that I needed to grieve privately,”

Williams has since become a father himself. He and his wife, Olivia June, have a 2-year-old son, McLaurin Clement, and a 2-month-old daughter, Zola June.

And as of last year, Williams has started to share his late father’s legacy with his own children.

“I have slowly started showing photos and pictures to my son, things from movies and in animation that my dad was in,” he explained on the “Today” show last July. “We have photos and memories around our home and he’s drawn to them. And so when he sees the Genie from ‘Aladdin’ or when he sees a photo of his grandfather, he’s drawn to it. And so we talk about it … It’s a nice way to carry on my dad’s legacy related to our family history.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Troll, ’Bama, troll. Y’all have to check out the latest TikTok trend.

Haters have taken over the #Bamarush and #Alabamarush hashtags — both hubs for University of Alabama co-eds to submit sorority pledge tryout videos — in order to parody accents, attire and attitudes on full display by actual sister wannabes.

Ahead of the new school year, some colleges hold sorority recruitment before classes are even in session, and real-life Potential New Members (PNMs) at ’Bama are currently posting TikTok videos in which the pledge prospects dance or offer up a #fitcheck (show off an outfit) and an #OOTD (“Outfit of the Day”) — even rattling off clothing brands and stores — in the hopes of grabbing a sorority’s attention. In just three days, the combined hashtags have together topped 26 million views.

User @whatwouldjimmybuffetdo has one of the most-viewed videos under #Bamarush — topping 683,000 — in which Makayla and her friends model their rush outfits.

But as soon as TikTokers got wind of the PNM videos — as well as the pledges’ hypnotizing Southern accents — they rushed to the app and ripped on the spectacle, showing off down-market ensembles, mimicking pledges’ presentations and viciously lampooning the whole process.

Of course, it wasn’t all about throwing shade. Some actually seemed in awe of the parade of pledge prospects, with one viewer confessing, “I don’t know how I got on sorority rush TikTok, but I never wanna leave,” and suggesting the over-the-top pledge process put the 2020 Tokyo Olympics “to shame.” And, by the way, he was not alone in that assessment.

Meanwhile, others have even joined in by mocking their own apparently out-of-control obsession with Alabama sorority recruitment.

Beyoncé’s fans have long identified as “the Beyhive,” but the legendary singer now has her own real-life beehives at home, she told Harper’s Bazaar for its September issue.

“Now I’m building a hemp and honey farm. I’ve even got hives on my roof!” she said.

She didn’t specify which of her properties her bees live on — Miami? Bel Air? New Orleans? — but she was most recently staying in the Hamptons with husband Jay-Z and their children, Blue Ivy, Rumi and Sir, at their $26 million mansion.

“During quarantine, I went from overindulgences to creating positive rituals drawing from past generations and putting my own spin on things … I’m so happy that my daughters will have the example of those rituals from me,” she told the magazine.

A representative did not return a request for confirmation about the beehives’ location. Beyoncé has also traveled to Miami in the past few months.

Queen Bey’s history with bees

Beyoncé hasn’t always loved bees. As a child, she and two other girls discovered bees in a bush that sent them screaming, a home video used in her recent advertising campaign with Adidas shows.

“Leave those bees alone!” a man, presumably Beyoncé’s father, can be heard saying in the video as a young Knowles screams on her front porch.

Beyoncé’s newfound interest in raising bees comes from the healing properties of honey, she said. Honey has been proven to have antibacterial properties, according to studies.

“I found healing properties in honey that benefit me and my children,” she said.

The home is near a private airport, which has also dedicated space to beekeeping amid threats the celebrity-favorite transport hub could close.

Beekeeping has become increasingly popular in recent years. Martha Stewart is one celebrity fan of the hobby, and Long Islanders have hopped on the trend.

Beekeepers’ hives have popped up on Brooklyn rooftops, on the Bank of America Tower, on the Brooks Brothers flagship and in the homes of veterans — although not everyone has been happy about it.

On TikTok, beekeeping methodology has stirred controversy, The Post previously reported.

She’s growing hemp, too

Beyoncé is also growing hemp, she said in the interview.

“I discovered CBD on my last tour, and I’ve experienced its benefits for soreness and inflammation. It helped with my restless nights and the agitation that comes from not being able to fall asleep,” she said.

In 2019, Jay-Z became the chief brand strategist at California marijuana dispensary Caliva, a company which has now become part of “The Parent Company,” and Jay-Z’s title has been updated to Chief Visionary Officer, a representative told The Post.

Beyoncé’s father, Mathew Knowles, is a medical marijuana user who works in the marijuana farmland business, he told Page Six.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This model is redefining what it means to be holy — posting on OnlyFans.

Nita Marie, a self-proclaimed Christian OnlyFans model, asserts that stripping for strangers online is what “God wants me to do.”

“I asked God if I should continue stripping off and the answer was always yes,” the Colorado resident, 45, told Jam Press.

Marie believes it’s her divine mission to empower other women to embrace their sexuality.

The Godly model, who has 953,000 followers and earns $1.8 million a year, found Christianity after having a dream about Jesus when she was 9 years old. Although she was not raised in a religious household, she became more spiritual and tried to build a relationship with Christ — without all the misogyny.

“That experience helped me seek out Christianity and I built a relationship with Christ on a personal level, rather than one filled with doctrine written by men thousands of years ago,” Marie told Jam Press.

Marie asserted that Christianity has suppressed women’s sexuality from the beginning, but she believes this is not what God intended. To her, God gave her sexuality as a gift to share with others, where both parties are consensual.

“I want to let women and men know that there’s nothing wrong with embracing their sexuality and being religious,” she said. “It all starts with loving yourself and trusting that when you have a desire for sex, it is OK and healthy to ask for it.”

She views her role as a guide to help people have safe and healthy relationships with sex and their bodies. Jam Press/@love_nitamarie

Marie told the outlet that her job, as well as her views on sexuality and religion, have led some of her Christian friends and family to shun her and fall out with her. However, because she believes God told her to continue, she views her role as a guide to help people have safe and healthy relationships with sex and their bodies.

Although the pious model has tried to empower women through her OnlyFans, the viral model still gets abuse from people online who shame her for “feeling and looking good in my body.”

“I believe that God wants women to look and feel great and to enjoy their sexuality,” she said. Jam Press/@love_nitamarie

“I believe that God wants women to look and feel great and to enjoy their sexuality,” she said. “By empowering myself to feel sexy in my own skin, I allow others to do the same.”

“I want to let women and men know that there’s nothing wrong with embracing their sexuality and being religious,” Nita Marie said. Jam Press/@love_nitamarie

She is writing a book about religion and sexuality to be published in 2022. The book will help women reclaim their “birthright to enjoy their bodies.”

And she’s not the only surprising person pulling a change of pace on the popular adult entertainment platform. Dare Taylor permanently ditched her G-rated job as a Disney princess to become an OnlyFans star. A former daycare worker makes $30,000 on the app, and a trophy hunter also makes bank on OnlyFans in her free time. Even a disgraced Australian police officer turned to the app with a Playboy model.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hey, Mr. Arnstein, here she is!

The musical comedy “Funny Girl” will play Broadway for the first time in nearly 60 years, producers announced Wednesday.

And the show has already found its wisecracking Fanny Brice — Beanie Feldstein.

Feldstein, 28, appeared in the 2017 revival of “Hello, Dolly!” as Minnie Fay but is best known for her film roles in “Lady Bird” and “Booksmart.” She also plays Monica Lewinsky in the upcoming “Impeachment: American Crime Story.”

But Fanny is, without a doubt, the actress’ biggest casting so far. The role made a star out of Barbra Streisand in 1964, when the show played the Winter Garden Theatre, and she won the Oscar for Best Actress for the film version in 1968.

Now, Sonia Friedman will produce Jule Styne’s and Bob Merrill’s musical, which features hit songs such as “Don’t Rain On My Parade” and “People,” and Michael Mayer will direct.

Mayer previously staged another revival of “Funny Girl,” also produced by Friedman, in London’s West End in 2016 starring Sheridan Smith, but it got a mixed response from critics. The Guardian’s Michael Billington wrote that the production “resembles a poor man’s ‘Gypsy.’ ”

The Broadway revival, however, comes with a new set designer, David Zinn, and two new choreographers, Ellenore Scott and Ayodele Casel. Harvey Fierstein will again revamp the book, as he did in London.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The movie’s not even out, but some reviews are already in, and commentators want to know: Who greenlighted this?

Netflix’s upcoming Tokyo-set action flick “Kate” tells the story of an assassin — played by “Birds of Prey” star Mary Elizabeth Winstead — who, after being poisoned on the job while attempting to kill a member of the yakuza, decides to spend her final 24 hours taking revenge against the Japanese crime syndicate. In the process, she befriends the daughter of a former target and gets advice from co-star Woody Harrelson’s character.

While a classic-enough vengeance plot in theory, a trailer for the film that dropped this month has viewers questioning who decided that, after a year of violence against the Asian community, a movie about a white woman going on a murder spree against the Japanese mob was possibly a good idea.

“Wait…so the premise is this white girl is seeking revenge on folks who poisoned her because she was trying to kill the head of the Yakuza?” one critic commented in response to the trailer. “Yeah hard pass.”

“So a movie where a white woman beats up and kills Asian people. Yakuza so technically Japanese, though I doubt only Japanese actors were hired for the Yakuza roles. That is the premise of this movie,” wrote another viewer. “Enough people thought this was a good idea that we’re getting it. Wtf.”

Others summarized their understanding of the film’s plot as “one white women killing a whole lot of Asian people over the course of a movie” and “White Girl on Asian Killing Spree.”

Having white protagonists star in a film with Asian antagonists and “Asians as a cultural background” after the recent “rise of attacks against” the Asian community feels obviously “yucky” and wrong, many noted. The flick not only “fetishizes/villainizes asians & asian culture” but also “reinforces the ‘white saviour’ stereotype.”

“Kate” hits Netflix and select theaters on Sept. 10.

Netflix did not immediately return The Post’s request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Country queen and “9 to 5” singer Dolly Parton has been working overtime again — at her upcoming book “Run, Rose, Run,” cowritten with author James Patterson.

The book marks the 75-year-old musician’s first novel — having already made her name as a 10-time Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, actress, television and film producer, theme park tycoon and humanitarian.

Like so many of Parton’s iconic songs, the story of “Run, Rose, Run” is about breaking free of convention and trauma. It follows Rose, a young woman who moves to Nashville to pursue her dream of making music, drawing on inspiration of her own past trauma.

“The source of her heart-wrenching songs is a brutal secret she has done everything to hide,” reads the plot from a press release sent to People. “But the past she has fled is reaching out to control her future — even if it means destroying everything she has worked for.”

“I cannot be more excited about the release of my very first novel ‘Run, Rose, Run’ with the great James Patterson,” Parton said in a statement. Representatives for Parton declined further comment to The Post.

“It’s been an honor — and a hell of a lot of fun — to work with the inimitable Dolly Parton, whom I’ve long admired for her music, her storytelling, and her enormous generosity,” said Patterson, 74, in his own statement.

Naturally, alongside the book, an eponymous album — featuring 12 songs “based on the characters and situations in the book” — will be released by Parton’s Butterfly Records.

“The mind-blowing thing about this project is that reading the novel is enhanced by listening to the album and vice versa,” added Patterson, the prolific author and creator of the “Alex Cross” series. “It’s a really unique experience that I know readers (and listeners) will love.”

The Post reached out to Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, a monthly book gifting program for children, about their founder’s latest literary accomplishment.

“While Dolly is quite a prolific author with two children’s books and several biography and inspirational books, it is exciting to see her working with James Patterson on this new project,” said Jeff Conyers, president of The Dollywood Foundation, in an emailed statement. “For over 25 years, Dolly has been helping grow the next generation of readers through her Imagination Library program, gifting over 163 million books to children early in life to help build the foundation for a lifelong love of reading.”

“Run, Rose, Run” (Little Brown) is available for pre-order now ahead of its March 7, 2022, release date.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The infrastructure bill the Senate passed Tuesday discriminates against white people at every turn.

Americans are enthusiastic about spending money on physical infrastructure — bridges, roads, broadband. But this racist bill hands out jobs and contracts and locates projects based on race, not merit. Minority businesses and neighborhoods hold the inside track. If you’re white, you’re low-priority.

The bill includes grants to install solar or wind technologies and generate jobs in areas decimated by closing coal mines or coal-fired electric plants. Here’s the catch: When contractors bid, the bill says minority-owned businesses will get selected first. Bad news for small-time white contractors in depressed areas.

The same is true for the bill’s proposals to improve traffic patterns in cities. Contractors and subcontractors get priority only if they’re owned by minorities or women. White male business owners can take a hike.

Americans should be outraged — but not surprised. After all, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act, passed in March, also put into place an ugly system of discrimination against whites. It offered debt relief to black farmers, but not white farmers. Another provision offered billions in aid to minority-owned and women-owned restaurants, but told struggling restaurants owners who happened to be white men that they had to go to the back of the line.

The injustice was obvious. White male farmers and restaurant owners sued, claiming the anti-white provisions are unconstitutional. So far, these challengers are winning. In every case, federal judges have halted the race-based programs in the American Rescue Plan Act until the challengers have their day in court. Politico reported last week that Biden’s Justice Department may fold without a fight on the black-farmer debt relief cases, because the law isn’t on the administration’s side.

The infrastructure hides discriminatory policies behind popular public works projects. EPA/JUSTIN LANE

You would think Democrats and the Biden White House would get the message. Instead, they’re doubling down on rigging legislation and divvying up taxpayer dollars to benefit minorities and shortchange whites.

Chances are high the infrastructure bill’s hodgepodge of anti-white discrimination will be struck down by federal courts. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution bars government from trying to even the score by discriminating against whites and in favor of minorities. The justices warned against creating “a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations” to correct past injustices. That’s precisely what this infrastructure bill does.

The bill’s backers would have you believe that obsolete airports, dilapidated public works and deteriorating roads and public spaces are evidence of racial injustice. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY) rails that “our infrastructure is racist” and calls on the Congress to pass a bill that “puts the needs of underserved and disadvantaged communities at the fore.”

That’s code for minority communities. But the truth is, there are plenty of poor white people in this country, too, and poor, predominantly white communities that could benefit from a bold federal infrastructure initiative. Race and ethnicity should have nothing to do with it. Locate the projects and put the funds where the economic need is greatest, regardless of race.

West Virginia has the lowest average income in the nation and ranks 46th in internet connectivity. Maine ranks 36th out of 50 states for income, and 34th in broadband connectivity. People in these states could really benefit from federal broadband assistance. Here’s the hitch: The infrastructure bill tilts the grant scale in favor of states with high minority and non-English-speaking populations, instead of considering only economic need and existing broadband capacity. Because Maine and West Virginia are 94 percent white, they’ll get less.

Polls show that Americans favor fixing roads, bridges, tunnels and airports. They know that good infrastructure promotes economic growth. But they’ve been kept in the dark about the fine print in the bill. Under the guise of upgrading the nation, the bill unfairly treats whites like second-class citizens.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She gave them a false sense of immunity.

A German nurse is being investigated for allegedly injecting thousands of people with a placebo instead of the coronavirus vaccine.

Based on witness testimony, police investigator Peter Beer said there was “a reasonable suspicion” that the rogue medical professional had administered shots of saline solution to up to 8,600 patients who were slated to receive the COVID jab, Reuters reported.

“I am totally shocked by this episode,” Sven Ambrosy, a local councilor, said of the alarming switcheroo, which reportedly occurred in March and April in Friesland in northern Germany.

It’s unknown why the shot-blocker — reportedly a Red Cross nurse — had injected people with blanks; however, she had reportedly broadcast anti-vax views on social media, investigators reported.

And while the faux jab was harmless, it may have disproportionately affected elderly people, who are at a greater risk of contracting the virus.

In order to prevent casualties from the fake shots, authorities are imploring thousands of people to get a second jab.

“The district of Friesland will do everything possible to ensure that the affected people receive their vaccination protection as soon as possible,” Ambrosy wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post.

Unfortunately, the nurse isn’t the first medical practitioner to express anti-vax views. In June, a Texas hospital suspended 178 employees for two weeks without pay for refusing to get the coronavirus vaccine.

Imitation isn’t always the sincerest form of flattery — at least when it comes to the morning TV wars.

After news broke on Wednesday that “CBS This Morning” was replacing veteran journalist Anthony Mason with former football star and “Extra” correspondent Nate Burleson, several industry insiders told us the network is admitting they’re in trouble by copying rival “Good Morning America.”

And it doesn’t help that the CBS show also announced in May it’ll be filming from a new studio directly across the street from “GMA” in Times Square.

”They’re basically copying ‘GMA.’ They’re moving to Times Square, hiring a [Michael] Strahan. What’s next? Cooking segments? They’re clearly in trouble,” one industry source sniped.

Meanwhile, another source told us that “GMA” staffers are “all shook over why CBS is copying them. It’s all the talk this morning at ABC,” they said.

The move comes as ratings for NBC’s “Today” — once the top of the morning show heap — continue to lose ground to “GMA.” This season-to-date, “GMA” is reportedly the most-watched morning show for the 9th consecutive year, and has this year increased its lead over “Today” to its biggest in four years. (Though “Today” did add viewers during its Olympics broadcasts.)

“CBS This Morning” remains at the bottom.

An ABC insider admitted there was buzz around the news, but “‘shook’ is not the way to describe it,” the source said. “Look at the numbers. Do you think ‘GMA’ would be threatened by CBS?”

CBS’ Strahan-like hire is “taking a page from the playbook. It’s an interesting move for them,” they added.

Another person from a competing network scoffed, “This is the same show [that] put out a statement about not wanting to [have anchors] dress up for Halloween! They planted a stake on Halloween as opposed to having fun, and now a football player is at the table? ‘Real Sports’ wasn’t hiring? It’s insulting to journalists.”

Burleson’s hire comes after former president of ABC-owned television stations Wendy McMahon fled the network to become president and co-head of CBS News and TV stations earlier this year.

“It’s interesting that they’ve put an ABC person in place over there, and she’s running the show. I commend them for recognizing a winning playbook and stealing it, but it could be a recipe for disaster,” the ABC source said.

Another source familiar with Burleson’s hire told us “they were grooming him” to take over after he filled in while co-anchor Tony Dokoupil was away on paternity leave. “Hollywood and this business only find value in former NFL players right now. It’s the Strahan effect. It’s not even a subtle trend,” they said.

In addition to co-anchoring “CBS This Morning,” Burleson’s overall deal will include a role as an analyst at CBS Sports’ “The NFL Today” and regular appearances on Nickelodeon, according to Variety. He’ll join Gayle King and Dokoupil at the table in September.

Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations, described Burleson as the “perfect fit for mornings on CBS” in a press release.

“There is no doubt that Nate’s experiences and broader interests in news, sports and entertainment will be an exciting addition to the table with Gayle and Tony as we continue to evolve the format of the broadcast to double down on news, original reporting, great storytelling and a broad range of feature pieces that appeal to viewers across the country,” he said in an internal memo.

It’s the haves and the … have-some-mores.

The swanky Aman Resorts — where rooms average $1,400 a night and villas go for $50,000 — is offering 100 people the chance to buy an Aman Club membership as it opens a New York location on 57th Street with a members-only space.

For $100,000 initiation fee and $15,000 a year, members will have access to a 24/7 “private office,” which will take care of all travel planning “from facilitating private charters by land, sea, and air, to pre-planning unique experiences across Aman resorts,” as well as upgrades, lax check-in and check-out times, on-demand spa treatments, and access to a private club space, according to a presentation and pricing sheet seen exclusively by Page Six.

Members, which they have dubbed “Founders,” “can expect privileged access to global sporting events, fashion weeks and behind-the-scenes visits to artists’ studios,” it states.

It will also go beyond a guest’s hotel stay. “At home — beyond the resorts, this bespoke support is offered for individual wellness programs to private event planning with our ‘Aman at home’ experiences.”

The membership plan outline explains, “Experts in nutrition, health and fitness will create entirely bespoke, constantly evolving programs for Founders, offering ongoing support and guidance as their wellness journey progresses both on- and off-property.”

The annual dues are required to be paid before the hotel’s NYC opening. According to the website, the new hotel, on 57th Street in the Crown Building, will offer 83 rooms, a “Garden Terrace & Bar,” a three-floor spa, as well as a jazz club and a members-only space.

The membership applies to both the NYC club and global properties.

Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, the Kardashians, Angelina Jolie, David Beckham, George and Amal Clooney, Tom Hanks, and members of various royal families are fans of Aman, which has over 30 properties in 20 countries.

The chain, owned by Russian billionaire Vladislav Doronin, also plans on opening Tokyo and Miami locations.

No-no juice.

Mama June Shannon’s longtime boyfriend, Geno Doak, has been sentenced in his Alabama drug case, landing 16 months in Macon Community Corrections after copping a plea deal.

But TMZ reports that while the reality star will be registered as an inmate, he won’t actually be incarcerated. Instead, he will have strict rules to follow, with violations leading to actual jail time.

Doak’s drug paraphernalia charge was dismissed as part of his plea deal, and he will be placed on probation for two years after he serves his 16 months. Shannon’s beau is also required to complete substance abuse evaluation/treatment.

Doak, 45, and Mama June, 42, were arrested at an Alabama gas station in 2019 after a domestic dispute. The following week, both were charged with felony possession of a controlled substance — listed as crack cocaine — and drug paraphernalia, with Doak picking up an additional domestic violence charge.

As for Mama June, the “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” star pleaded not guilty in Oct. 2019 and was ultimately sentenced to 100 hours of community service. She also agreed to several provisions to avoid jail time, including remaining sober.

By August 2020, Shannon was celebrating six months of sobriety, shortly after admitting to having previously spent nearly $1 million on drugs for herself and Doak.

“I would say the last year of our addiction, probably a good $900,000,” the TLC star confessed. “So much money was sent to our dope man.

“In this industry, it’s kind of crazy that until you get busted it’s okay, and I think that is the wrong way to be, but it is — it’s true,” she added.

Reps for Mama June Shannon did not immediately return our request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@And just like that, COVID-weary New York City turned into a playground for the “Sex and the City” ladies.

Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis (sans Kim Cattrall) are filming scenes for their HBO Max spinoff, “And Just Like That . . .,” all over the Big Apple, sending superfans into a tizzy trying to catch a glimpse of the stars or land a scoop. Numerous Instagram accounts have sprung up to chronicle the on-location magic, which is bringing back a touch of pre-pandemic glamour and frivolity to the city.

“[The show] is the hottest social hunt of the summer,” Gregory Littley (@littleylittley), a content creator who has captured footage for his more than 20,000 Instagram followers, told The Post. “It’s thrilling, nostalgic and fun to post. The response on social has been a resounding ‘Welcome back, ladies.’ “

Littley, 37, helped tip off fans to a possible juicy plot line when he recorded the first sighting of Bridget Moynahan, a k a Big’s ex Natasha, on set near Balthazar, as he was shopping in Soho with his husband.

Fans are showing up in droves to catch a glimpse and a snap of their favorite “SATC” stars. GC Images

“Bridget Moynahan was there, but no one was picking up on it. My husband even thought it was Kristin Davis,” recalled Littley, who recognized that her presence was a big scoop — especially after Page Six reported that Big (Chris Noth) and Carrie (Parker) would be getting divorced.

“Big’s ex is back? What are the implications?” he said. The self-proclaimed “SATC” superfan made a short TikTok video of a chic-looking Moynahan walking on set. The video was viewed more than 200,000 times within the first 24 hours and spawned headlines on nearly every entertainment site.

Other fans say sightings of SJP and Co. are confirming plot twists in their own lives. Stumbling upon Parker on a Nolita set helped fashion executive Shay Gipson know her impending move from Los Angeles to the Big Apple was the right one.

Sarah Jessica Parker is spotted on the set of “And Just Like That . . .” TheImageDirect.com

Gipson, a former New Yorker, went West a few years ago but was recently summoned back by a new employer. Last month, she was in town looking for housing and went to a fashion event at the Crosby Street Hotel, where a film crew was set up in front. After her event wrapped, Gipson came out at the exact moment Parker pulled up to the set in a pink frock.

“I was like, ‘Oh, this is my big return to New York and here is SJP filming,’ ” said Gipson, who, years ago, used to bump into Parker at the Serge Normant salon on 23rd Street where the two would chat about the fashion industry. Gipson said the run-in felt like the universe was telling her she was in the right place.

“It solidified my return. I am definitely back in New York,” she said. “I felt like it was definitely an omen.”

For local businesses, the filming is also proving to be auspicious.

When the show recently shot a brunch scene at the East Pole on East 65th Street, crowds formed around the popular restaurant; it was like One Direction was in town.

“The excitement from the fans was palpable,” East Pole owner Anthony Martignetti told The Post. “When [the cast] got out of the town cars, people were screaming the characters’ names. They were really freaking out for Stanford [Willie Garson].”

Martignetti first opened the East Pole with his brother 10 years ago. When the two learned that “And Just Like That . . .” would be filming a brunch scene at their place, it was an exciting honor.

“I remember being a bartender in the city when the show was in its first season,” Martignetti recalled. “Places like SushiSamba and Magnolia Bakery, they really made it on there.”

In the aftermath of the shoot, a steady flow of superfans from the far reaches of Long Island have come into the restaurant, hungry for both farm-to-table fare and plot details.

“A lot of mother-and-daughter teams who follow the filming on Instagram have come in for brunch for the first time,” said Martignetti, adding that it’s been a bright spot for his staff in a tough pandemic year. “It was really exciting for us to have a momentary distraction from the mandates we are under.”

The East Pole wasn’t the only one to get its close-up. Server Mark Sopcyk was there while they were scouting, and he and Nixon hit it off. She requested that they not cast a random actor as their waiter but use Sopcyk, who is a stage performer.

“They signed him up with SAG right away and got his paperwork. He was super thrilled to be on there,” Martignetti said.

The shoot has also turned the city into a runway, showcasing the ladies’ over-the-top fashions. Original stylist Patricia Field is not working on the revival because she’s toiling away on Season Deux of “Emily in Paris,” but her collaborator Molly Rogers has taken the sartorial reins. Her head-turning looks have brought fashionistas to the set and inspired Instagram accounts devoted to the style.

“The sets are also a fashion show,” photographer Steve Sands, who has shot the stars on location, told The Post. “That’s what fans come to see.”

Some clothing choices have been controversial — such as the rumored Forever 21 dress worn by Carrie that a Venice Beach, California, boutique called Raga later claimed. The styles have been feverishly chronicled by Rogers’ own fan fashion account, @AndJustLikeThatCostumes, as well as unaffiliated popular accounts such as @JustLikeThatCloset, @SexAndTheCity_NewYork and @CarrieBradshaw_SexAndTheCity.

“I have been shooting different movies for a while, and this is the first time I’ve seen people this excited. You can feel it in the air,” said photographer Elder Ordonez, who has shot many on set-style moments, including the contentious boho dress. But he also feels the excitement on social media. He said his “SATC” revival snaps “are getting more interaction than any of my other photos. There’s so much interest.”

Littley noted that, in the present moment, frenzy around the filming transcends the latest between Carrie and Big.

He said: “It feels like a rebirth [in the city].”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Not a good look.

Nick Cannon’s comedy sketch series “Wild ‘N Out” has caught controversy yet again after comedian and cast member Jessie Woo said an off-color joke about the late, great Whitney Houston on Thursday’s episode.

During one of the show’s games, people had to create voice messages while impersonating famous celebs. Woo was tasked with doing an impression of Houston.

The “Love & Hip Hop Miami” star then began to sing a snippet of the singer’s ballad “I Will Always Love You” — holding Houston’s famous long note on the opening words “And I …” — but then abruptly stopping and saying, “I’m dead.” The audience was shocked, and when a clip of the episode hit Twitter, fans dragged Woo for being insensitive.

“#WildNOut is my favorite show. I’ve followed it since 2006. But, I’ll no longer be watching, if Jessie Woo, is a part of the cast. That Whitney Houston joke, was way outta line. She owes Whitney’s family & fans, an apology. Go back to love & hip hop, with that,” wrote one disgruntled fan.

Another viewer chimed in, “The way ugly haters disrespect Whitney Houston is disgusting. I wish her true fans came to her defense instead of staying silent. Because if someone ever comes for Natalie Cole like that I’m lighting your ugly ass up. Jessie Woo you are ugly inside and out! #WildNOut.”

“Now Jessi[e] Woo know she was wrong for that Whitney Joke. That was tasteless. Don’t disrespect Whitney #WildNOut,” added another. “Whitney gonna haunt Jessie’s ass #WildNOut,” said one fan.

Woo, however, pushed back on the cascade of criticism.

“The show is called “WILD N OUT” for a reason… and still I was able to say some wild shit without picking low hanging fruit like her history with drugs… unlike the many comedians who have for decades,” she tweeted Friday morning. “I pushed the envelope and I am proud of me.”

Later, when a naysayer said that no one on set laughed at her joke, she countered, “They were in shock then they ALL laughed. Nick Cannon literally fell to the floor.”

Woo also suggested that she was being dragged solely because she’s a female comic.

“Male Comedians and folks on twitter make jokes about Whitney’s battle with drugs still till this day… but me impersonating her during a voicemail game by singing her song & saying ‘I’m dead’ (a great excuse why she cannot come to the phone)… but I went too far?” she wrote.

Houston died on Feb. 11, 2012, at the age of 48 due to drowning. A coroner indicated that cocaine use and heart disease played a role in her passing.

Woo’s shtick may have been ill-timed, too. On Wednesday, ABC aired an hour-long special, titled “Superstar: Whitney Houston,” that profiled the “Heartbreak Hotel” crooner and interviewed friends who were close to her, such as singers Brandy Norwood and Chaka Khan.

“I had been working with [Houston’s mother] Cissy for quite a while as a background singer and one day we were in the studio, and she said, ‘You know, I have a daughter who can sing,’” Khan said in the special. She then told her to bring her daughter to the studio. “[Houston] was amazing, just amazing.”

“She kicked down doors for every black female artist, every black artist and artists in general,” said Norwood. The two R&B singers starred together in the 1997 movie “Cinderella.”

“She talked to me about the pressures of this business. And media and fame and what it could do,” Norwood continued. “Everyone in your business — everybody wants this from you, wants that from you. That can be very straining on someone’s life and someone’s mind and someone’s spirit.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the most iconic golden voices in pop music history has been silenced.

Tony Bennett has officially retired from singing live, canceling his 2021 tour dates in the wake of an at times heart-wrenching appearance billed as “One Last Time” in New York City.

The 95-year-old — who’s fought a years-long public battle with Alzheimer’s disease — has nixed the rescheduled shows, which were already delayed in 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“There won’t be any additional concerts,” his son Danny Bennett, 66, confirmed to Variety Friday. “This was a hard decision for us to make, as he is a capable performer. One, however, that was made by doctors’ orders.

“It’s not the singing aspect but, rather, the traveling. Look, he gets tired,” Danny, his father’s manager of the last 40-plus years, continued. “The decision is being made that doing concerts now is just too much for him. We don’t want him to fall on stage, for instance — something as simple as that. We’re not worried about him being able to sing. We are worried, from a physical stand point … about human nature. Tony’s 95.”

The “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” crooner’s tour was originally set to relaunch in September in Mashantucket, Connecticut. The additional affected dates include New York, Maryland, Oklahoma and Canada. Ticket-holders are advised to contact the venues for information regarding refunds.

This latest development, sure to devastate loyal fans of the singer, comes on the heels of his pair of weepy shows with Lady Gaga — the presciently titled “One Last Time: An Evening With Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga” — at Radio City Music Hall on Aug. 3 and Aug. 5.

The concerts were a celebration with a caveat: Phone cameras were banned, so as to not flood YouTube with fan clips. Attendants locked them away in security pouches as concertgoers arrived — but The Post was there to witness the historic moment. The show’s cryptic title already had many in the audience fretting aloud that it was the “last chance ever” to see Bennett sing live.

The reason for their dissolution — the pair’s final album together, “Love for Sale,” a collection of Cole Porter tunes will drop on October 1 — is far sadder than the standard musical differences: Bennett revealed in February that he is suffering from a progressive, degenerative brain disease. He was officially diagnosed in 2016 — but he kept right on touring up until the pandemic shut down the live concert industry.

His family told AARP that his battle with Alzheimer’s became seriously concerning in 2018 when he was recording “Love for Sale” with Lady Gaga.

Still, “life is a gift, even with Alzheimer’s,” he tweeted.

Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett’s album “Cheek to Cheek” was released in 2014. YouTube

Meanwhile, there was a production crew on-site filming Bennett and Gaga’s Radio City shows — and audience members, who included Bill and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, were warned they could possibly end up on TV. Dozens of unforced standing ovations ensued throughout the compact, 90-minute concerts.

Lady Gaga could barely hold back tears in their new music video. YouTube

Playing it classy, Gaga left the meat dress in her cooler and opted to hit the stage in a glittering white gown. Bennett, of course, oozed style in his suit and tie.

Beyond the lyrics to his signature tunes, the only words Bennett uttered throughout the show were “Beautiful” and “Beautiful night.” But he still possessed that unmistakable golden vocal touch.

And Gaga, who collaborated with him on a 2014 album, seems to agree wholeheartedly, believing perhaps that Bennett has more great stuff to give. After all, she kicks off their new music video for “I Get a Kick Out of You” by declaring, “Tony’s always ready.”

His loyal son Danny said in the AARP piece announcing the diagnosis, “Managing my father for the last 40 years has been a privilege and an amazing journey. He never ceases to inspire me with his passion and dedication to all that life has to offer. The last four years has been no exception. He continues to sing and stay fit on a daily basis. I speak for the whole family in thanking his wonderful wife Susan for all the support and love she has given to him. Our wish is that by openly sharing his challenges with Alzheimer’s that we will give hope to all that face this condition and will help end the stigma surrounding this disease. Above all else, we want to be able to help raise awareness, advocate for advancing new therapies and one day soon, finding a cure.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“American Idol” star Syesha Mercado is raising her voice against the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office after they seized her 10-day-old baby daughter in a harrowing moment captured in a now-viral video.

This is the second child that authorities have “forcefully and legally kidnapped” — as she describes it — under unclear circumstances in the past five months from the 34-year-old Sarasota, Florida native, who finished in the top three during the seventh season of TV’s long-running singing competition.

Deputies surrounded an SUV that Mercado, her newborn baby and her partner, Tyron Deener, were driving in Wednesday morning to conduct a surprise roadside welfare check, as captured in disturbing footage with more than 2.1 million views as of Saturday afternoon. Police then took custody of the infant to bring her to a hospital for a physical, presumably due to prior — still hotly disputed — allegations of malnutrition concerning the couple’s then 13-month-old son.

Mercado and Deener, 36, posted the incident on Instagram with the caption, “THEY TOOK OUR BABY AGAIN!.” The hour-long video shows multiple police vehicles flashing lights while two male deputies serve the couple with a court order to turn over their baby.

“Do you not feel anything? You guys, I’m human. This is my baby. My babies is days old — and you’re taking my baby away from me,” a crying Mercado can be heard saying in the chilling clip before starting to sob as four female child protective services caseworkers stand their ground.

The singer-actress — who starred in Broadway’s “The Book of Mormon” in 2014 — and Deener attempt to explain to authorities that they are “compliant and following every law,” adding that their daughter had already been seen by physicians just a day prior.

“You are traumatizing my baby. How could you guys do this?,” a distraught Mercado screams as her daughter is taken from her arms and placed alone in the back seat of a city vehicle. “… You have no heart. This is so wrong. I have the key to this city … I’ll hold it together. I’m strong.”

Mercado was indeed presented a key to the city of Sarasota during her “American Idol” hometown visit on May 9, 2008, which was proclaimed “Syesha Mercado Day” by local officials. She eventually finished third behind David Archuleta and that season’s winner, David Cook, on the show. She went on to headline the 2009-2010 national tour of “Dreamgirls,” which launched at Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater, opposite future 2021 Tony nominee Adrienne Warren, who stars as Tina Turner in “Tina” on Broadway.

A decade later, Mercado had to breastfeed her crying baby and provide authorities with a bottle of breast milk on the shoulder of a busy road, The Root reported.

The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office and Florida Department of Children and Families have not responded to The Post’s repeated requests for comment. The last listed professional representative for Mercado said “she’s not really working right now” but expressed concern about her situation. Attempts to contact her directly have been unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, her infant is still in protective custody, according to activist Donisha Prendergast, 36, founder of the We Have the Right to be Right social justice organization, who is advocating for the couple.

Five months earlier, Mercado and Deener’s 1-year-old son, Amen’Ra, also was placed into the system after Mercado’s breast milk supply started to run dry, and the boy would not accept other fluids, FOX Tampa Bay reported at the time. They took Amen’Ra to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg on Feb. 26 for help.

While there, Prendergast’s organization alleges that the little boy was examined by Dr. Sally Smith, the controversial subject of a 2020 USA Today Network investigation after she was accused of being “too quick to diagnose child abuse,” which Smith has denied. Investigators reviewed hundreds of Smith’s cases and found more than a dozen instances where charges were later dropped — but the caregivers names were left irreparably smeared forever.

Dr. Smith did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Almost two weeks after Amen’Ra was admitted, CPS and armed Pinellas County Police officers reportedly ordered Mercado and Deener out of the hospital amid allegations of “trespassing” and “severe malnutrition.” Their son was discharged in late March and immediately transferred by CPS into foster care.

During the ongoing fight to get their son back, the couple asked that all caseworker interactions be facilitated through their lawyer, said Deener, a youth service professional who works in the foster care system. When CPS investigators showed up at their home upon learning Mercado gave birth to her daughter without alerting them, they were refused entry and referred to said attorney. That’s when the agency reportedly received approval to conduct a welfare investigation and remove their newborn.

“My baby is healthy and happy,” a desperate Mercado is heard telling them during the roadside seizure. “All you had to do was call the attorney. We have all the paperwork.”

Prior to this week’s events, the parents had launched a GoFundMe — titled “The Legalized Kidnapping of Black Babies Through CPS” — and more than $327,000 has been raised as of Saturday, surpassing their posted $200,000 goal to cover legal bills.

“I am a pregnant, breastfeeding mama who went to the hospital with the intention to get my [son], Amen’Ra, some fluids while transitioning from extended breastfeeding to being bottle-fed,” Mercado’s crowd-sourcing campaign pitch reads. “On March 11 … Amen’Ra was forcefully and legally kidnapped from us by CPS, who claim we refused a B-12 shot that was a matter of life and death, which is an absolute lie.”

However, authorities did tell local media outlets that medical staff reported Mercado and Deener for turning down a B-12 intramuscular shot, as recommended by hospital doctors, a claim that Mercado adamantly denies.

“We never refused a B-12 shot, and at no point was he on the verge of death,” she said before her second child was taken into custody. “Our [son] has since been placed with a white foster family without interviewing qualified relatives or friends of our family for placement while they investigate. We are given limited information and presently only have weekly zoom visitation for an hour with … no court order stating these visitation limitations.”

Mercado has vowed to keep fighting.

During her time on “AI,” The Post took note of her survival skills: “In the ‘Idol’ dictionary under ‘drama’ lies Syesha’s week in Hollywood. The uber-talented singer spent the whole week on vocal rest to overcome a strained throat, cold and myriad of other complications. But when time came to fight for her spot in the competition, one of the most determined contestants in show history knocked it out the box.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sometimes the facts are stranger than fiction — and sometimes the facts are plagiarized.

The co-founder of myth-debunking website Snopes has been exposed as a plagiarist, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation.

David Mikkelson, who launched Snopes in 1995 with a mission to be “the internet’s definitive fact-checking site,” was suspended by his company, Doreen Marchionni, Snopes’ VP of editorial and its managing editor, confirmed to BuzzFeed, after their reporters uncovered no less than 54 plagiarized articles by Mikkelson.

“Let us be clear: Plagiarism undermines our mission and values, full stop,” Marchionni said in a statement on Friday. “It has no place in any context within this organization.”

In response to the investigation, Mikkelson said, “There is no excuse for my serious lapses in judgement. I’m sorry.”

BuzzFeed wrote that Mikkelson’s Snopes posts contained phrasing — even entire paragraphs — lifted from outlets such as the New York Times, CNN, the Guardian, the LA Times and the BBC between 2015 and 2019, often under the byline “Snopes staff” or while using the pseudonym Jeff Zarronandia.

“Zarronandia” was illustriously described in his Snopes bio as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and someone talented at “mule-skinning,” whose seemingly informed stories on everything from arts and culture to national politics had in the past drawn ridicule from the likes of former Donald Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone, BuzzFeed said.

Snopes’ reporters have also jointly issued a statement, writing that they “strongly condemn these poor journalistic practices,” adding that they “work hard every day to uphold the highest possible journalistic and ethical standards.”

As of late Friday, Snopes had retracted 60 articles and disable advertisements on those webpages, according to the New York Times, and will continue making retractions as they conduct their own internal investigation. The company was said to have already flagged 140 articles for review.

One such cribbed passage, written by Jon Schuppe for NBC News, appeared on Snopes.com under Mikkelson’s own byline: “Muhammad Ali, the silver-tongued boxer and civil rights champion who famously proclaimed himself ‘The Greatest’ and then spent a lifetime living up to the billing, is dead.”

Mikkelson attempted to explain for his crimes in an interview with BuzzFeed. “I didn’t come from a journalism background,” he told them. “I wasn’t used to doing news aggregation. A number of times I crossed the line to where it was copyright infringement. I own that.”

Mikkelson insists that Zarronandia was created as a “stress-relief thing” during the fraught 2016 presidential election, when the concept of “fact-checking” became an ethical beacon for some, and a political bane to others.

“Let’s have some fun and watch these people vent their spleen inventing reasons why this nonexistent persona is biased,” he said.

However, insiders revealed to BuzzFeed that Mikkelson’s habit was driven by a need to drive traffic to the website — by being one of the first sites to rehash the most trending news headlines.

“He would instruct [writers] to copy text from other sites, post them verbatim so that it looked like we were fast and could scoop up traffic, and then change the story in real time,” Snopes’ former managing editor Brooke Binkowski told BuzzFeed. “I hated it and wouldn’t tell any of the staff to do it, but he did it all the time.”

The revelation comes in the aftermath of the heated divorce between Mikkelson and Snopes’ co-founder Barbara Hamel in 2015, which led to Hamel’s share of the company being sold to tech firm Proper Media. In 2017, the company filed suit against Mikkelson, claiming he’d mismanaged Snopes’ finances — and at the same time Mikkelson launched his own GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the website.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jay Duplass was an eyewitness to cancel culture when his “Transparent” co-star, Jeffrey Tambor, was fired from the Amazon series in 2018 following allegations of sexual harassment.

In “The Chair,” premiering Friday (Aug. 20) on Netflix, Duplass plays English professor Bill Dobson, whose mocking Nazi salute during class goes viral on social media (memes, etc.) and sets off a campus firestorm.

“It’s been my observation, and I’ve been very close to one particular cancel-culture moment, that it’s not just the initial event — it’s the handling of the event after the fact and more of a case of whether that person can use the rope to climb out or hang themselves,” Duplass, 48, told The Post. “There are several turning points where Bill chooses well or poorly. It’s the person’s outlook on life and willingness to open up to pain they may have caused, not just for inciting the event but perhaps what they’ve done in the past, as well.”

The six-episode Netflix dramedy was co-created and co-written by actress Amanda Peet and stars Sandra Oh as Ji-Yoon Kim, a 46-year-old single mother who’s just been named the first-ever female chair of the English department at Pemberton, an Ivy League-ish university that’s fallen on tough financial times.

Before she can get comfortable in her new office, Ji-Yoon is tasked by stuffy Dean Larson (David Morse) with ridding her department of several senior professors (played by Bob Balaban, Holland Taylor and Ron Crawford) whose class enrollments are way down or nearly non-existent. She also finds herself locked in a battle over her choice for a distinguished lecturer: she wants her charismatic Pemberton colleague Yaz McKay (Nana Mensah) for the position, while the trustees want … wait for it … David Duchovny. Yes, that David Duchovny (“He almost got his PhD,” Larson says).

And then there’s Bill, whose wife died the year before and who’s just packed his daughter off to college overseas. “I think the way Amanda had originally written him in the script was something in the ballpark of ‘an incredibly respected and published star professor who happens to look more like a teenage surf punk and doesn’t give a s–t what he looks like or smells like,'” Duplass said. “Amanda talked to me a lot about the double-edged sword of Bill’s irreverence. He really knows how to infuse fun and inspiration inside academia, which absolutely needs to happen…but he also has a certain amount of white male privilege that he’s about to become painfully aware of.

“It’s a testament to the murky waters Amanda is swimming through vis a vis the cancel-culture situation. I don’t think anybody is completely falling down on either side of the debate. As much as we know we’re treading into dangerous territory we’re trying to capture the diversity of every human being and the singularity of this approach … while trying to further the conversation.”

Ji-Yoon has a bit of fun with her stubborn daughter, Ju-Hee, played by Everly Carganilla. ELIZA MORSE/NETFLIX

There’s also romantic tension between Bill and Ji-Yoon, who’s having trouble communicating with her young daughter, Ju-Hee (Everly Carganilla), who she adopted from Mexico and who is resistant to learning about Asian culture — but adores Bill, with whom she shares several fun scenes (including his accompanying her to her cousin’s birthday party).

The series was filmed this past January through March in Pittsburgh at several schools — including Chatham University and the University of Pittsburgh. And it was brutally cold. “To go there in the middle of winter in peak COVID was scary but so worth it,” Duplass said. “Several times when we were shooting [scenes] in a faculty meeting or in an office and there were a couple of windows open, you could look outside and see like two feet of snow there. It just brought such an incredibly realistic feeling.”

He also reserved a lot of praise for Taylor, 78, for her portrayal of feisty professor Joan Hambling.

“After I saw the first cut I immediately felt like she’s the secret weapon of the entire series, he said. “Amanda’s writing of the role of Joan was so funny that I never thought anybody could match what it felt like in the script — but I think Holland doubled down on it and made it that much funnier.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Five Bedrooms” was a bright spot when it premiered last summer in the midst of the pandemic.

The ensemble series, streaming here on Peacock, offered some much-needed escapism and comic relief and is back for Season 2 on Thursday (Aug. 19). It hasn’t missed a beat in continuing the interwoven stories of five disparate friends who’ve become a closely knit family while living together in the suburbs of Australia (the eight-episode series is shot in and around Melbourne).

The action picks up three months after the Season 1 finale, in which friends Ben (Stephen Peacocke), Liz (Kat Stewart), Ainsley (Katie Robertson), Harry (Roy Joseph) and Heather (Doris Younane) were forced to move out of their house after a series of unfortunate events left some of them financially strapped.

They’re determined to remain a unit and they do eventually find another suburban dwelling to share — and it’s within that framework (both physically and contextually) that we catch up with their lives and meet several new additions to the cast.

Ainsley is closer to giving birth after a Season 1 dalliance with her caddish co-worker, Lachlan (Hugh Sheridan), who also simultaneously impregnated his ex-wife, Melanie (Kate Jenkinson); man-child Ben and the much-older Heather are still an item, though they’re keeping it on the down-low from their housemates; Harry’s mother has come to terms with the fact that her doctor son is gay, and is hell-bent on finding a guy for him; and attorney Liz, bankrupted by her ex-husband, is dipping her toe into the dating waters and exploring other career opportunities. Liz’s ex, Stuart (Rodger Corser), will soon enter the picture, as will Ben’s brother, Joseph (Daniel Lapaine, “Catastrophe”), an investment banker, and Harry’s new friend, stylish club owner Xavier (Josh McKenzie).

Even though it’s been a year since “Five Bedrooms” first premiered — and there’s always the “TV anxiety” that you won’t remember what happened in Season 1 — fear not, in this case. There’s an instant comfort level with these characters, perhaps because they’re so sharply drawn, and even if you’re fuzzy on last season you’ll be caught up within minutes.

(“Five Bedrooms” has been renewed for a third season, which began shooting this past Thursday.)

The chemistry between the five leads is palpable — you can imagine these people hanging out in real life — and the ways in which they share their trials and tribulations is believable and not too sugarcoated in that TV-comedy type of way. There’s love, laughter, loss and even some legal challenges they will face this season (don’t want to give too much away) and it’s all confronted head-on in realistic, unpretentious fashion without too many trope-y embellishments. The house itself, and its Melbourne surroundings, also adds a smattering of local atmosphere.

If you’re unfamiliar with “Five Bedrooms,” and want to catch yourself up before jumping in, Season 1 is available to stream. Either way, you’ll be drawn into the lives and adventures of Ben, Heather, Harry, Liz and Ainsley.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Grammy-winning folk singer Nanci Griffith has died at the age of 68.

The Texas-born crooner’s management team confirmed her death on Friday but gave no cause.

“It was Nanci’s wish that no further formal statement or press release happen for a week following her passing,” Gold Mountain Entertainment said in a statement.

Singer Darius Rucker tweeted his sadness after Griffith’s passing. “Today i am just sad man. I lost one of my idols. One of the reasons I am in Nashville.She blew my mind the first time I heard [Mary &] Omie. And singing with her was my favorite things to do. Grammy-winning folk singer-songwriter Nanci Griffith dies,” he wrote.

Griffith was known for such hits as “Love at the Five and Dime,” “Once in a Very Blue Moon” and “Outbound Plane.” She also won the 1994 Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album for her record “Other Voices, Other Rooms.”

Griffith won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1994 for her recording “Other Voices, Other Rooms.”

She also worked closely with other folk singers, including Lyle Lovett and Emmylou Harris. Her cover of “From a Distance” — a song later made popular by Bette Midler — was featured on her album “Lone Star State of Mind” in 1987.

Griffith was born July 6, 1953, in Seguin, Texas, and raised in Austin. As a teen, she would perform at clubs and festivals around her hometown. She later attended the University of Texas and desired to become a teacher. However, she then decided to have a career as a musician in 1977. She released her debut album, “There’s a Light Beyond These Woods,” in 1978.

Griffith was married to performer Eric Taylor from 1976 until their divorce in 1982. Her high school boyfriend, John, died in a motorcycle accident and later inspired several of her songs. She was engaged to singer-songwriter Tom Kimmel in the 1990s, but the couple never tied the knot.




@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s . . . the new St. Mark’s Comics — but in Industry City.

The legendary store, which shuttered in February 2019 after 36 years in the East Village, recently reopened in a more roomy and modern space in Brooklyn. The store will feature everything that the old location had — as well as a wider selection of vintage toys and even more comic books.

Co-owner Mitch Cutler bought the comics store in 1984 at just 19. He said he worked 90 hours a week selling books, appraising comics and consulting for publishers and manufacturers.

“I started reading comics as a little kid, and I got a job at a comic shop when I was 15, and then you’re off to the races,” Cutler, 56, told The Post.

St. Mark’s Comics gained worldwide acclaim as one of the country’s premier comic book shops. The store was featured in an episode of “Sex in the City” and still attracts plenty of film enthusiasts and tourists. St. Mark’s Comics also got a shoutout in “Friends” as the place where Phoebe — back in her hardscrabble days — mugged a young Ross when he came to sell his copy of “Science Boy.”

Cutler, a Bronx native, had his “Danny Glover moment” — or the realization that he was burned out — in the months prior to the store’s closing. That, combined with the changing landscape of the East Village even before the pandemic, led him to shutter the store and move to some online sales — after a much-needed two-month break.

“I was exhausted, and then a bunch of the other shops on St. Mark’s went out, and the entire corner of St. Mark’s and Third Avenue was bought and shut down, so that they could put up a giant office building,” said Cutler.

Upon closing the store and selling all its merchandise, Cutler noted that support was through the roof, and people proposed deals for a new location right away, although “none of them turned out to be the right thing.”

According to Cutler, Industry City was a perfect fit. He also entered into a formal partnership with Nick Giangarra, who had been a general manager at the store for years. He said Giangarra had deep contacts in the toy industry and brought both digital and technology experience — all of which, Cutler thought, could bring the latest incarnation of the shop to the next level.

At the new spot at 51 35th St., which had its grand opening on July 30, Cutler hopes to expand inventory beyond the thousands of books already on shelves. Just last week, the store was in talks to acquire a 10,000-book collection, and it bought an assortment of vintage steel cars from the 1930s through the ’70s. Cutler wants to fill up the interior since the space is “enormous, beautiful and clean.”

“One of the beauties of walking in is you never know what you’ll see,” said Cutler. “The stock changes literally every day, because we buy collections literally every day.”

Most of the current merchandise consists of books from the last 30 to 40 years, but Cutler hopes to become more established in the arena of Silver and Golden Age comic books from the 1930s through the ’60s — which are his great passion. The store also has a selection of imported Japanese toys and GI Joe sets in their original boxes.

“Every single guy of a particular age who walks in and sees these original play sets in their original boxes says, ‘I had that as a kid,’ ” he said.

According to Cutler, talking to customers and guiding them through the merchandise has become a “hallmark” of the store — and he’ll go to great lengths to maintain that service.

“There’s a lady who came in much later than she planned on because her international flight landed late, and [my staff] called me at home at 11:30, just as they were locking up, and said, ‘Hey, this lady is here to buy those vintage Spider-Man [comics] for her boyfriend,’ ” Cutler said.

“I got back out on the train in the pouring rain to make sure that she got her books.”

A randy Michigan man redefined “c-block” after he got six kidney beans lodged in his urethra during a bizarro attempt at sexual gratification.

The unnamed 30-year-old patient had reportedly wanted to “express the beans during ejaculation,” according to the wince-worthy report published in the journal Urology Case Reports.

So the sexual eccentric shoved six kidney beans in his urethra and attempted to expel them via “natural emission.” However, his pea shooter jammed during the process, prompting him to try to remove them with tweezers.

When that failed, he reported to the hospital, where he informed doctors that he was struggling to “pea.”

The backed-up bean stalker also admitted it wasn’t his “first time participating in this practice, although he never attempted to utilize this many beans.” A subsequent CT scan confirmed that the poor soul harbored six beans in his urethra, which measured 15 mm by 7 mm each. Four were located between the urethral entrance and the urine pouch, while another had strayed all the way into the bladder.

After initially failing to extract the urethral infiltrators, medics managed to remove one legume by applying numbing cream to the area and then squeezing the penile passageway, the researchers reported.

They eradicated the rest of the beans the following day via a complex process that involved holding the man’s urinary entrance open and inserting a tube through which they passed surgical implements. They then plucked out the taco toppers with a tweezer-like tool and placed them in a basket.

Despite the highly invasive procedure, the frijole fetishist suffered “minimal” trauma to his urethra and was discharged the following day.

Thankfully the beans were extracted with minimal trauma to the man’s urethra. Margeaux Dennis et al.

He should thank his lucky stars. In a similar instance of beans in the urethra, the legumes had swollen to the point that endoscopic retrieval was impossible.

It’s unclear why someone would ever treat their manhood like a rainstick. However, experts say the sexual proclivity stems from psychiatric illness, sexual assault or even attempts to, somewhat paradoxically, “relieve urinary obstruction,” per the study.

Experts have also blamed “sounding,” a bizarre sexual proclivity defined by sticking foreign bodies in one’s urethra. In October 2019, a man in Saudi Arabia made the world wince after revealing that he’d harbored tweezers in his urethra for four years.

Unsurprisingly, scholarship on the subject is scarce due to its “taboo nature.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“South Park” creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker have one thing to say — courtesy of trash-talking character Eric Cartman — to anyone who spread rumors that they couldn’t buy Casa Bonita:

“You will respect our AUTHORITAH!”

On Friday, Parker, 51, and Stone, 50, told Colorado Gov. Jared Polis that they’ve tentatively agreed to purchase the Colorado landmark in Lakewood. The sale comes a few months after the previous owners of the Mexican restaurant — made famous by the biting animated show — said the joint was not for sale.

“As of about an hour ago, pending bankruptcy proceedings, we’ve come to an agreement with the owner and we’ve bought it,” Stone told Polis Friday morning.

Casa Bonita was a beloved childhood location for Parker and Stone, which led to the restaurant receiving several mentions in “South Park.” In 2003, Casa Bonita was the focus of one of the show’s most classic episodes to date.

With the sale, Polis asked the creative pair whether they plan to improve the quality of the food of the restaurant, which has a fairly mundane menu.

The duo has stated their plans to improve amenities at the iconic Mexican restaurant, which features an arcade, cave and waterfall with cliff-divers, among other attractions.

“I think everyone knows the potential of what that place can be and we certainly do, and I think it’s going to be an awesome Colorado thing,” Parker said. He previously told the Hollywood Reporter that he and Stone felt “like it was neglected even before the pandemic,” adding that “We are going to do everything we can. We want to make it right and make it amazing.”

The creators, who both grew up in Colorado, struck a deal to buy Casa Bonita shortly after inking a six-year, $935 million pact with ViacomCBS that includes 14 “South Park” movies for streaming.

Summit Family Restaurants, the current owner of Casa Bonita, was forced to file for Chapter 11 protection after a financial setback amid COVID-19 shutdowns.

The restaurant — which can seat more than 1,000 people — has been closed since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

The final sale is expected to take months, pending court approval.

“If it were up to us, we would have people in there right now working on it,” Parker told the Hollywood Reporter shortly after Friday’s announcement.

Although the sale price has not been disclosed, Parker called the price “fair.”

Located at 6715 W. Colfax Ave. in Lakewood, Colorado, the restaurant first opened in 1974.

“South Park” has featured more than 300 episodes and is now in its 24th season, making it one of the most successful television shows in US history.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Erykah Badu is singing the blues after unintentionally sparking Obama drama on social media.

The soulful Grammy Award winner took to Twitter seeking the former first family’s forgiveness for being a “terrible guest” by posting pictures and videos of Barack Obama’s massive 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard on Aug. 7.

“Mr. And Mrs. Obama, Please forgive me 4 being the ‘terrible guest’ at such a sacred event for your family,” Badu, 50, real name Erica Wright, tweeted Thursday.

The “Window Seat” singer’s unauthorized social media posts showed the birthday boy with wife Michelle, 57, dancing mask-free among the hundreds of attendees at the luau-themed function.

Badu has issued an apology to the Obamas for sharing pictures and video from the former president’s 60th birthday party.

Badu posted and then deleted footage of Obama dancing at his huge, star-studded 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard this past weekend. Instagram

The images have since been removed from Badu’s social platforms.

Prior to the star-studded soiree — with Hollywood heavyweights Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Tom Hanks, H.E.R., Questlove, John Legend and Alicia Keys on the guest list — Obama reportedly “scaled back” his guest list from nearly 500 to 200 due to the rapid transmission of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.

But Badu’s snaps of the unmasked politician and his not-distanced partygoers launched a deluge of disparaging comments from “outraged” detractors who, under the hashtag #ObamaVariant, bashed the 44th commander-in-chief for hosting the jam-packed jamboree.

And for accidentally stirring the pot, Badu is sorry.

“I was so inconsiderate,” the “Tyrone” musician continued in her Twitter mea culpa.

“Thank you for all your love. What an example of ‘how NOT’ to be,” she added, sealing the apology with “erica.”

When asked by a fan if the Obamas “made” her delete the photos and videos snapped during his controversial celebration, Badu said: “Naw sis. It’s just right thing [to do],” suggesting she voluntarily erased the posts amid the uproar.

“Birthday B—h” performer Trap Beckham and his manager TJ Chapman both shared shots of themselves and others partying at the Obamas’ $12 million mansion in Oaks Bluff.

But the rapper and his handler were ultimately asked to delete their snaps of meticulously curated food, drinks and decor — and of themselves smoking marijuana, which is legal in Massachusetts.

“Had to delete everything due to the rules,” Beckham, 30, reportedly explained to his online followers. “It was epic for sure. If any videos surface it’s going viral. He danced the whole time. Nobody ever seen Obama like this before.”

So far, the Obamas have yet to publicly comment on their trending turn up.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former Disney Channel star Leigh-Allyn Baker is not happy about the mask mandate enforced in her children’s Tennessee school district.

A video surfaced on Thursday reportedly showing the “Good Luck Charlie” actress attending the Williamson County Board of Education meeting on Tuesday — and where she went on an anti-mask rant.

“My name is Leigh-Allyn Baker, and I’m a California refugee,” the 49-year-old began her speech. “I gave up everything there: a really successful Hollywood career, television shows. I gave it all up for freedom and to come to this friendly place in Tennessee and be greeted with open arms, and I love it here.”

She went on to tell the audience that she herself has “two vax-injured children, and they have medical exemptions after the seizures and the hospitalizations after all of their immunizations,” adding that she was “obviously” granted a medical exemption.

“And still, I would never put them in a mask because their brain needs oxygen to grow, which the neurologists can confirm,” she continued. “Anyway, the real part of the clown show is that you all think that you actually have the authority to mandate this.”

Baker, who has also appeared in the sitcom “Will & Grace,” added, “Because there are these books that I have and I have them as a gift for you: the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Federalist Papers and also the Bible. These guarantee my freedom and yours and our children’s to breathe oxygen,” Baker said.

Her speech garnered much applause and cheers from the audience. According to the school district, the Williamson County Board of Education approved a temporary mask mandate that began on Aug. 12 and will run until Sept. 12.

Tuesday’s meeting, however, also erupted into chaos when some people hurled threats and obscenities at health care professionals and school board members following the heated debate. One man was observed threatening, “We know who you are! You can leave freely, but we will find you!” while others chanted “We’ll not comply!”

Baker portrayed a nurse and mom of five kids on Disney’s “Good Luck Charlie” for four seasons.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@While Netflix burns the candle at both ends trying desperately to win a Best Picture Oscar, AppleTV+ has gone for more meat-and-potatoes fare, including the feel-good TV show “Ted Lasso” and the soulful new dramedy “CODA” that they snagged for $25 million at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.

If you’re in the market for a heart-warmer, look no further.

“CODA,” stands for child of deaf adults, and that describes Ruby (Emilia Jones), a Massachusetts high school student who lives with her mom, dad and brother, all of whom are deaf.

Ruby is hearing, though, and is therefore a big help when it comes to the modest family fishing business. She haggles with local, often prejudiced buyers to make sure her father Frank (Troy Kotsur) isn’t taken advantage of; she works the phones and listens for other boats’ horns. All of this before school starts in the morning.

movie review coda Running time: 111 minutes. <br>Rated PG-13 (strong sexual content and language, and drug use.) On AppleTV+.

Her dreams, however, expand far away from the Massachusetts coast — Ruby wants to be a musician. So, she joins the school choir, under the tutelage of the eccentric Mr. Bernardo (Eugenio Derbez, funny but over-the-top), and begins drifting away from her family.

Ruby’s mom Jackie, by the way, is played by the always superb Marlee Matlin, who presides over some very funny home-life scenes. At dinner, while Ruby’s brother is showing off his potential Tinder dates, the sister asks, “If music is rude, why is Tinder allowed at the dinner table?”

Her mom signs back: “Because Tinder is something we can do as family.”

At first Ruby’s parents resent her fast-evolving life. She meets a boy named Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) in the choir, and her folks work extra hard to embarrass her in front of him. In a deeply sad moment from writer-director Sian Heder, they come watch her concert, where Ruby and Miles duet on “You’re All That I Need To Get By.” Gradually, the sound fades away and we experience what being deaf at a recital is like. Her family loves Ruby very much, but can’t fully experience the joy of her talent.

“CODA” is part of that fizzling genre of film, popular in the ’90s, in which you’re almost always on the verge of sobbing while watching it. When Frank sits under the stars trying to understand his daughter’s gift, you’ll need a mop for the tears.

If you’ve got it, flaunt it — and Blake Lively definitely does.

The 33-year-old actress promoted her husband Ryan Reynolds’ new movie, “Free Guy,” with a cheeky Instagram pic on Thursday.

Blake Lively bared her booty in a floral bikini to promote husband Ryan Reynolds’ latest project. Instagram

Lively posed poolside in a floral thong bikini for the saucy shot, quipping in her caption, “Go see @freeguymovie this weekend or you’ll be bummed.”

Reynolds, 44, promptly reposted the photo to his own Instagram Story.

Lively also supported her hubby at the “Free Guy” premiere last Wednesday, clad in a backless pink sequin gown by Prabal Gurung featuring sexy cutouts that framed her famous curves.

“What a huge night for #FreeGuy. And what a huge night for @blakelively because this means we’re Instagram official,” the “Deadpool” actor joked on Instagram after the event. “I know how important that was to her.”

Despite the New York City premiere marking the couple’s first red carpet outing in a year and a half, Lively and Reynolds have been keeping fans in the loop about their life at home during the pandemic.

The pair share three daughters: James, 6, Inez, 4, and Betty, 1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was not the kind of green light hitters want to see.

With the Mets and Dodgers tied in the top of the ninth inning Friday in front of a season-high 38,395 at Citi Field, a green light flashed onto Max Muncy’s face, halting play for a few minutes.

Muncy, batting with a runner on second and two out, collected himself before an 0-2 pitch against Edwin Diaz, but before he stepped into the box, his face turned green.

“Come on, jeez,” Ron Darling said on PIX11. “That’s just awful.”

Muncy immediately pointed left and the umpires conferred for several moments. There was no resolution, so Muncy stepped back into the box, and Diaz struck him out to end the inning. The light was not seen again.

“We don’t want that happening in a baseball game. Player safety — everyone’s safety — is always our priority,” said Mets manager Luis Rojas, who was not sure after his team’s 6-5, 10-inning loss if the culprit had been found. “I thought it might have been the best crowd of the season, so for that to happen, it’s just something that you don’t want to see.”

The scene was similar to an incident during a July game at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Red Sox, when a red light began flashing. An MLB investigation found no evidence of a rules violation by either team.

Louis C.K. is “sorry”— but he’s not that sorry.

The disgraced comic performed at New York City’s Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden on Friday and joked about everything except his masturbation scandal.

While the former “Louie” star performed in front of a massive sign that read “SORRY,” he didn’t acknowledge the sexual misconduct scandal that’s been plaguing him since 2017.

Instead, C.K. quipped about the obsession with the COVID death toll, 9/11 and pedofiles.

“I thought some jokes were a little distasteful and over the top but overall it was a good show,” one attendee who asked to be anonymous told Page Six.

Despite the mixed jokes, the crowd was thrilled to see C.K. back on stage.

“People gave him a standing ovation when he came out and when he left,” our insider added. “His set was raunchy but very funny.”

Another attendee, Ron Michelli, told Page Six that they had to lock up their phones—a la Pete Davidson’s stand-up shows—in Yondr pouches at the start of the show to prevent photos and recordings. Michelli also agreed some of C.K.’s jokes went a bit over the line.

“Some went a little more in depth than needed but still funny,” Michelli, 30, told us. “His set seemed to be on the shorter side.”

C.K.’s rep didn’t immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.

C.K. announced his nationwide tour earlier this month in a bizarre email that promised “impolite jokes and stories.” The tour announcement came several years—and a few local shows—after the comic’s shocking sexual misconduct scandal, in which he confirmed allegations that he’d masturbated in front of several women without their consent.

“These stories are true,” C.K. said in a statement at the time. “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my d–k without asking first, which is also true.”

He continued, “But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d–k isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”

Timing is everything in life.

Sandra Lee has gotten engaged to her boyfriend Ben Youcef, and the beaming couple hit the town in Paris to celebrate, with a besotted Lee showing off her dazzling new engagement ring, multiple sources sources told The Post.

Photos of the lovebirds reveal that Lee, the former girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and her hunky beau have made it official — as there was no mistaking the significance of a giant jewel on Lee’s left ring finger.

Youcef, an interfaith leader, actor and producer, sported a band on his wedding finger.

Lee was seen sporting the sizable new bling just days after Cuomo announced his resignation following a series of scandals — and a damning report by state Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of sexually harassing several women — that have plagued his third term as governor.

Lee and Youcef bolted to the City of Love after she was left devastated by the events of the past week, when Cuomo resigned as governor amid a sex harassment scandal, Lee’s friends said.

The two could be seen outside Parisian hotspot L’Avenue on Saturday night, sharing an embrace before heading in for dinner.

Lee, a 55-year-old lifestyle guru, wore a white summer dress while Youcef, 46, had on jeans, a leather jacket and a white T-shirt emblazoned with the logo “Fear of God.”

A source close to Youcef told The Post: “Ben really wanted to distract Sandra from all the news, so he whisked her away to Paris. He knows how hard this has been on her and he wants to make sure she feels loved and supported.”

The source added: “Ben is incredibly protective of Sandra. They’re soulmates and head over heels in love.”

The pair traveled to Paris after spending time in St. Tropez in the South of France.

Lee and Cuomo never got engaged during their 14 years together, although she was married previously to former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz from 2001 until 2005.

The source said their friends have been rooting for them since they met in the spring in Los Angeles.

As The Post reported, Lee has felt “betrayed” by Cuomo, most recently for what she claims was him taking credit for legalizing same-sex marriage in New York during his resignation speech when she was the one who urged him to push the legislation forward.

Cuomo’s cheating during their relationship, which he denied, was considered an “open secret,” former Cuomo staffers told The Post in April.

She met Youcef after moving to Malibu, Calif., and leaving behind the home she shared with Cuomo.

Lee was previously in a relationship with Gov. Andrew Cuomo for 14 years until they split in 2019. Best Image / BACKGRID Lee met Youcef after moving to Malibu following her breakup with Cuomo. Best Image / BACKGRID

She solidified her move to the West Coast after selling her Mount Kisco home — named “Lily Pond” — for $1.85 million last October.

Youcef, a divorced dad of two, was discovered by Steven Spielberg and went on to appear in his 2005 movie “Munich.”

He has since appeared in a number of TV shows.

A rep for Lee declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Method Man is bringing his love of weed to New York’s cannabis market.

The Staten Island-based Wu-Tang Clan veteran rapper — whose lyrics often include riffs on pot — is naming his cannabis brand after his first solo album TICAL, a k a Taking into Consideration All Lives.

Method Man told The Post that his socially conscious TICAL firm in New York will aim to tackle racial injustice by offering job opportunities to residents in communities disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs.

“I’m absolutely thrilled at the prospect of bringing TICAL to New York’s newly legalized adult-use market in 2022. Our team has worked long and hard to bring the same energy, creativity and equity to this brand that I have to everything I have done throughout my career,” Method Man, whose real name is Clifford Smith Jr., said in a statement.

“I’m particularly excited about TICAL’s focus and leadership in the cannabis space in working with Black, Women and Minority-owned partners from cultivation to dispensaries.

“We are going to lead by example and ensure that this newly created market is as inclusive as possible. We can’t right all the wrongs that disparate criminalization of cannabis has done to our communities, but we most certainly can make a down payment on the way forward with social equity, inclusion and full economic participation.”

TICAL will offer different cannabis strains including FREE M.A.C., Orange Cookie Kush, Sweet Grease, Spazzola, C.R.E.A.M., Gold Tang and Crowd Walker.

TICAL is already marketing its product in Colorado, where the first stores in the world began peddling recreational marijuana legally in 2014.

On TICAL’s Web site, Method Man says smoking reefer is ingrained in the hip-hop culture.

“To all street intellectually inclined cannabis enthusiasts who embody music, art, fashion, sneakers and subculture. We will continue the TICAL legacy by offering premium flower and spreading love throughout the community,” the site says. “We believe it’s important to provide our customers with essential products that offer healing, serenity and peace.”

Still, Albany’s dysfunction over the state’s launch of the local cannabis market has been a buzzkill for many.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the legislature approved a law legalizing marijuana back in March.

But the pot sales program is stuck in the weeds because of a dispute between Cuomo and fellow Democrats in the state Senate over appointments to the Cannabis Control Board and Office of Cannabis Management. Cuomo linked the cannabis appointments to a separate fight with the Senate over his leadership appointments at the MTA.

The governor’s role in the foot-dragging is apparently now moot — he announced he was resigning as governor last week after a devastating probe by state Attorney General Letitia James found he sexually harassed 11 women, including current and former staffers.

It looks like any movement on the state’s new pot-sales law will now be up to Kathy Hochul — New York’s current lieutenant governor who will take the reins of power from Cuomo when he officially steps aside Aug. 24.

State Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island) said she, for one, is thrilled that Method Man is trying to be a cannabis pioneer in New York while vowing to employ local residents from disadvantaged neighborhoods.

“Method Man can serve as a mentor and model for others who want to get into the cannabis business. We need people who are serious players,” Savino said.

She added that she has spoken to Hochul about the importance of breaking the logjam on appointments to the new cannabis regulatory board and agency, so the state can set up rules and approve licenses for the budding industry.

“I talked to Lt. Gov. Hochul about getting the cannabis program up and running. We have to make the appointments necessary to make that happen,” Savino said.

Method Man’s New York cannabis marketing campaign comes as two of his Wu-Tang Clan comrades — Raekow and Ghostface Killah — headline a concert on Staten Island Tuesday to celebrate the city’s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Concert promoter and venue operator Live Nation plans to require COVID-19 vaccines for its patrons “everywhere possible” beginning Oct. 4, the company said.

The move to mandate shots for concert-goers comes after the company initially said it would leave the decision whether to require inoculations up to individual artists, Rolling Stone said.

“Vaccines are going to be your ticket back to shows, and as of October 4th we will be following the model we developed for Lollapalooza and requiring this for artists, fans and employees at Live Nation venues and festivals everywhere possible in the US,” Live Nation President and CEO Michael Rapino said in a statement Friday to Rolling Stone and NBC.

The new rule will only be in effect “where permitted by law,” the company said.

Live Nation previously required vaccinations at Chicago’s Lollapalooza music festival.

“12% of fans said Lolla was actually their reason for getting vaccinated – which is a huge number with 400k attendees throughout the weekend,” a company rep told NBC.

Prior to the decision, Live Nation said it was up to the individual artists to require proof of vaccination. FilmMagic

Employees will also have to be vaccinated and be required to have tested negative for the deadly virus, cases of which have surged in recent weeks due to the extra-contagious Delta variant.

Live Nation is the largest live events company in the US.

Its competitor AEG Presents on Thursday announced plans to require proof of shots starting Oct. 1.

A viral video showed a male Rams fan in an Aaron Donald jersey being pummeled by at least four others in the stands of the stadium shared by the two Los Angeles teams.

The melee, which left the fan in the Donald jersey bloodied, lasted nearly a minute.

The beginning of the video showed the fan in the Donald jersey arguing with another Rams fan. An unidentified woman in the back then threw beer on the fan in the Donald jersey, leading him to throw what appeared to be the first punch.

It’s unclear what exactly sparked the altercation and whether there were any arrests.

There’s no crying in casting.

Oscar-nominated actress Debra Winger quit the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own” because Madonna was cast in the women’s baseball dramedy.

According to the Telegraph, Winger was starring in the role of Dottie, which was eventually taken over by Geena Davis.

Serious actress Winger even trained with the Chicago Cubs for three months, but when director Penny Marshall cast Madonna, Winger felt Marshall was making fluff — “an Elvis film.”

“The studio agreed with me because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract. In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court,” she told the Telegraph.

She added, “As entertaining as [the finished film] was, you don’t walk away going, ‘Wow, those women did that.’ You kind of go, ‘Is that true?’”

She said the other stars didn’t train as much as she did, but Davis “did OK.”

Tom Hanks and Rosie O’Donnell also starred in the hit movie. Columbia Pictures

“I certainly don’t begrudge any of them,” said Winger, 66.

As far as Madonna’s performance? “I think [her] acting career has spoken for itself,” Winger reportedly said.

Davis went on to get a Golden Globe nomination for the role, while Madonna picked up a nomination for Best Original Song. The film also stars Tom Hanks and Rosie O’Donnell.

Winger, most famous for her roles in “An Officer and a Gentleman” and “Terms of Endearment,” also spoke about quitting Hollywood back in 1995.

“I stopped because I ceased being challenged,” she said, adding that playing the supportive wife and mother got “pretty boring.”

Over the years, the actress has come back for various indie films like 2008’s “Rachel Getting Married.” Most recently, she acts in Apple TV+’s “Mr. Corman.”
