Jessica Alba honestly looks like she’s having a relaxing holiday.

The actress-turned-business maven, 40, was snapped soaking up the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, along with her husband, Cash Warren, 42, preparing for a day of snorkeling. Both looked fit and tan carting their undersea equipment around the beach.

The pair met in 2004 on the “Fantastic Four” set and tied the knot in May 2008. They share three children: daughters Honor Marie, 13, and Haven Garner, 9, and son Hayes, 3 — none of whom appeared with them on the beach.

Perhaps the two needed some alone time. The “Dark Angel” star recently admitted on Katherine Schwarzenegger’s Instagram show “Before, During, and After Baby” that she has to work to keep the spark in her marriage with Warren alive, copping to feeling like a “roommate” to him.

“It’s all rosy for 2 1/2 years. But then after that, you become roommates,” she explained. “You’re just going through the motions. You have the responsibilities. It’s a lot of, like, checking the boxes, right?”

Alba recently admitted she sometimes views Warren more like a roommate. HEM / BACKGRID

Alba said that initially the couple was diligent about weekly date nights with no talk about kids or responsibilities but “that stops, because of whatever.”

The Honest Company founder also confessed to sometimes taking Warren for granted.

“We have, like, obviously the friendship, the comfort of, like, ‘You’re not going anywhere,’ and so sometimes you don’t treat those people the best, right? You don’t consider their feelings in the way that you would consider other people’s feelings,” she said. “So that is something that I think is a constant one to work on.”

Alba acknowledged that she doesn’t have the answers to a happy marriage.

“If you’ve figured it out in your relationship, let me know,” she joked.

At least the pair’s social life is going strong: They partied all night in Miami in May to celebrate Honest Company’s billion-dollar valuation.

The Cajun chicken wasn’t the only thing that was a little bit spicy at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night.

Claudine De Niro caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant, we’re told, by confronting a woman who she accused of taking her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number.

Sources say that the unnamed woman chatted with the Oscar winner around 11 p.m. at the Sag Harbor eatery, and he gave her his details before she said her goodbyes.

And we’re told that De Niro — who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — later stormed over to where the woman was sitting on a sofa in a hallway and demanded, “Why did you take his number? Don’t you know he’s my boyfriend?”

We’re told that the woman stayed seated next to a pal and barely responded, while De Niro stood over her and continued to berate her for some time.

Sources say that a pal of the woman was sufficiently concerned to move the restaurant’s management to ask Claudine to leave — which, we’re told, De Niro assured the pal that they would not. She was correct, and De Niro eventually walked away by herself and headed into the bathroom.

But a source close to De Niro told us she wasn’t being a jealous girlfriend — it was all about business.

The insider said that both De Niro and her foe are real estate agents and that De Niro was mad that the woman had wanted Gooding’s business — not good lovin’.

“It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

The source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

It’s not, of course, the first time Gooding’s got mixed up in some trouble with women.

The “Jerry McGuire” star has been charged with six counts of misdemeanor forcible touching and six counts of third-degree sexual abuse stemming from three alleged incidents. He has pleaded not guilty.

It’s also not the first time the pair have made a spectacle at a fancy spot.

Page Six reported in June 2019 that Gooding was spotted at the sceney Bowery Hotel loudly complaining about one of his accusers.

Le Bilboquet didn’t comment.

Ice-T’s wife, Coco, had strippers taking notes when she hopped on stage and danced at Sapphire on the Upper East Side Sunday night.

Ice-T co-hosted a “post-COVID” party at the Manhattan jiggle joint with film producer Noel Ashman — who also DJ’d, we hear — and Coco hit the stage when he played “I’m in Love with the Coco” by O.T. Genasis.

“Every stripper stopped dancing and started staring at her on stage. They all then gave her a high-five. It was really funny. Ice-T told him what to play, and they were going back and forth with the songs,” a spy told Page Six.

Unlike the strippers, Coco was “in her normal Coco clothes — a revealing top and tight pants,” the source said.

Ashman played music from two iPhones and an obsolete iPod, we’re told. When he played popular tracks like “Billie Jean” by Michael Jackson, and “I Want You Back” by The Jackson 5, Ice-T jokingly announced, “‘Anyone who doesn’t know this should leave!,'” the partygoer said.

When Ice-T, 63, wasn’t having fun with the crowd, the rapper-turned-“Law & Order” star was asking “all the girls who are not strippers to show their t–s,” the source said, and “a lot of them did.”

The club was so packed that security had to usher in Ice-T and Coco through a back entrance.

Old-school hip-hoppers like Treach and The Kangol Kid were also on the scene. At one point in the night, Ice-T and Treach honored late rap legends DMX and Biz Markie, which then turned into a spontaneous concert.

“They performed about four songs each including ‘O.P.P’ and ‘Colors.’ Treach went on stage with a huge wad of 20s and started spraying the crowd,” an insider said.

The evening ended a little after 4 a.m. with “everyone plastered,” we’re told.

“Misunderstood” no more.

A little over a year after debuting his polarizing under-eye tattoo, Presley Gerber appears to be doing an about-face.

Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber’s 22-year-old son stepped out in Malibu Monday sporting only faint traces of the “misunderstood” tat on his right cheek, suggesting he’s had it removed.

Gerber defended the polarizing design — which was done by celebrity tattoo artist JonBoy — last February.

“If I thought this was going to ruin my face or I didn’t want this, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said on Instagram Live.

“It says misunderstood because that’s how I felt my entire life,” Gerber added at the time. “F—k you if you don’t like it.”

He doubled down on the defense the following month, sharing an Instagram Story that read, “Most and a lot of people can get a face lifts, change genders, lip injections, etc and it’s offensive to say anything in today’s day in age but I get a little face tattoo and now people to love hate me.. Hmmmm? [sic].”

Gerber has multiple other tattoos on his fingers, neck and arms, including a marijuana leaf on his hand and his sister Kaia’s name inked in cursive on the back of his arm.

In April 2020, he also added the number “310” across his torso — in honor of his family’s Malibu area code — as well as a handgun on the front of his right hip, which was placed to look like a partially concealed weapon.

Gerber is just one of the many celebs who’ve opted for laser tattoo removal recently. Pete Davidson — who, incidentally, briefly dated Kaia in late 2019 — famously announced that he plans to remove all of his ink.

Call it arti-couture.

“Motivation” singer Normani is on the cover of Allure’s September issue, and posed for her shoot in a series of edible fashions made from real fruits and vegetables.

In one shot, she’s covered in fresh artichoke leaves that form a living corset, accessorized with a necklace featuring a blinged-out half of the veg.

Designer Laurel DeWitt, who is known for fantastical creations made of metal and chain, crafted the custom piece with help of fantastical fashion stylist Nicola Formichetti.

DeWitt revealed on Instagram that she created the artichoke bodice — as well as a red cabbage top, a pepper bracelet and earrings and lemon earrings — on site at the photoshoot using fresh produce.

“It was such a cool design challenge and not easy,” the designer wrote.

Perhaps Normani’s grocery-store couture served to symbolize her continuing growth as a solo artist; with her debut album still on the way, the former Fifth Harmony member’s career is set to flourish.

Designer Laurel DeWitt posted a close-up of the artichoke bustier, which was custom-made on set for Normani. Instagram

“My purpose in this work that I do is for other people that feel like they have black women figured out. There’s so many layers to us, there’s so many textures, there’s so much that we’re capable of doing,” she told the glossy.

“Yes, I can throw ass. But I can also give you a proper eight-count, and I can do ballet, and I can do contemporary dance. If I want to sing this pop ballad, then you’re going to love it! While you see my black face!”

Amelia Hamlin is keeping Scott Disick close to her heart.

The 20-year-old model gave fans a glimpse at her accessories on Tuesday, debuting a necklace with boyfriend Scott Disick’s nickname, “Lord,” in what appears to be diamonds.

She captioned the zoomed-in Instagram Story photo, “Let the lord be with me,” a take on the 38-year-old star’s signature catchphrase.

The delicate design features sparkling letters on a thin gold chain, which she layered with a diamond tennis necklace.

It’s hardly Hamlin’s first bling featuring her beau’s name, as she sported his name on her wrist in April, debuting beaded bracelets spelling out both “Scott” and “Lord.”

While it’s unclear whether her new necklace was a gift from Disick, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star has been known to deck Hamlin out in diamonds.

Amelia Hamlin showed off her “Lord” necklace in an Instagram Story on August 10.

He treated her to a diamond-encrusted cross necklace for her 20th birthday in April, just a month after she took home a blinged-out party favor from his 38th birthday bash.

Hamlin’s latest “Lord” necklace complements Disick’s own extensive jewelry collection, too. He’s known for wearing his longtime moniker on a series of statement pieces, and he even has his own “Lord” necklace in a slightly different style.

Amelia Hamlin wore her “Lord” bracelet while snuggling up to Scott Disick on a boat in July. Instagram

Things seem to be heating up for the couple this summer, as the lovebirds cozied up to one another on a boat in July.

Hamlin, the daughter of “RHOBH” star Lisa Rinna and actor Harry Hamlin, has also been spending plenty of time with Disick’s children as of late, even going on a family date night in July.

The pair were first linked in October 2020, making their relationship Instagram-official on Valentine’s Day this year.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kevin Nealon isn’t worried about getting canceled.

“I’m pretty woke on all that stuff,” the “Saturday Night Live” alum told Page Six. “I have a 14-year-old [son Gabe with wife Susan Yeagley]. In school, they really teach them well. So anytime I start going astray he says, ‘No, you’re kind of going in the wrong direction.'”

But the 67-year-old comedian allows that he’s never been one to push the envelope in his act.

“I wouldn’t want to offend anybody or insult anybody … My act has always been very appropriate,” he explained.

“I’ve never been a risk-taker as far as that was concerned. I’ve never been one of those edgy, ranting comics who just seemingly say what’s on their mind and sometimes get into trouble.”

Nealon began his career in stand-up, joined “SNL” in 1987 and stayed on for a then-record-breaking nine seasons, playing characters like Mr. Subliminal, the politically incorrect private investigator Frank Gannon and, of course, Franz (of weightlifting duo Hans and Franz) alongside Dana Carvey.

Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey as “Hans and Franz” on “Saturday Night Live.”

“It was striking gold just to be on that show because I was more of a stand-up than an actor or a sketch player,” he said adding that his favorite thing about being part of “SNL” was working with musical idols like Paul McCartney and James Taylor, who would sometimes stay and play a private mini-concert.

Since leaving “SNL,” Nealon has carved out a steady career in shows like “Weeds,” “Last Man Standing,” and a string of Adam Sandler movies. And in between stand-up appearance, he updates his YouTube series, “Hiking with Kevin,” in which he goes on hikes with various celebs.

The Connecticut-raised star is currently in the midst of a stand-up tour and says that audiences have been great.

“I was thinking that maybe I got funnier,” he quipped, “but I think people are happy to be out there and more grateful — they appreciate what they have now. They want to enjoy life again.”

Nealon is a talented caricaturist. Instagram

If he decides to quit stand-up, Nealon could very well become a professional artist. He often features his incredible caricatures on social media, explaining that he took a ten-class course via Skype during the COVID-19 lockdown.

His visual prowess spans multiple mediums as well: Nealon has another Instagram solely dedicated to his photos of his wife, “Parks and Rec” alum Susan Yeagley, at different locales throughout the U.S.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The woman who Claudine De Niro berated at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night for getting her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number tells us she was “scared” by the incident and feels “traumatized.”

As Page Six previously reported, De Niro —who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant allegedly yelling at a woman who got the “Jerry Maguire” actor’s digits.

Now we can reveal that the woman at the center of the conflict was Lieba Nesis, a Harvard-educated lawyer and writer. She tells us De Niro was “aggressive” and “harassing [and] berating” her for at least an hour.

Nesis, who runs with the elite Hamptons and New York City social crowd, tells us that she and Gooding Jr. have known each other for seven or eight years.

“Not well, but we always say hello,” she said.

She says the Oscar winner told her at the restaurant that he’s shooting a film in Miami in September and looking for a place to stay, so she told him that she owns property there that was going to be empty while he was in town. He put his digits in her phone to follow up, Nesis says.

But De Niro saw the exchange go down and lost it.

“His girlfriend goes, ‘Oh my God, what are you doing? That’s my boyfriend! You can’t take down the number,’ and she’s screaming ‘What the f-ck are you doing!” Nesis tells us. “So I started to explain and she was like, ‘You better stop doing that. That’s my boyfriend.”

“She was going on and on so I walked into the other room and thought, ‘Ok, this will simmer down. I come back in and she’s pointing at me and screaming across the room, ‘You better get out of here. You better leave this place.’ Everyone is staring at me.”

“She wasn’t screaming at the top of her lungs,” she added, “but it was very intimidating to me.”

“I really was scared,” she said, “I am not going to fight. I wasn’t expecting to go out and get in a fight. I am spending thousands a weekend to go to the Hamptons and get away from negative energy, I don’t want to do drama. I was like, I’m not going to engage and hopefully she will calm down but she didn’t.”

Nesis says she went into another room again and sat on a sofa to get away from the situation, but that De Niro followed her.

“She comes and stands right on top of me where I am sitting like, ‘You better get the hell out of here,'” Nesis says, adding that De Niro was “cursing me out.”

She says that no one stuck up for her, except for former “Real Housewives of New York” star Jill Zarin, who tried to get management to step in — but nobody from the restaurant intervened.

“The more I tried to explain [that] I was just trying to help, the angrier she got,” Nesis says. “She kept saying, ‘That is my boyfriend, I am a broker, why was I trying to take your business.’ I told her I am not, I am a Harvard-educated lawyer. But she would get angrier and angrier and more out of control.”

Nesis adds, “She was saying she’s a real estate agent and we’re foes, but I don’t know her. I have never met her. I didn’t know she was a real estate agent and I am not a broker. I was in a state of shock. It was out of hand.”

According to her LinkedIn page, De Niro has worked for real estate company Compass for four months. She previously worked at Prudential Douglas Elliman.

Gooding Jr., for his part, seemed to cut and run as things took a turn.

“In the beginning, he was trying to explain and then he just disappeared out of sight,” Nesis says. “I guess he saw she wasn’t going to be mollified … He was somewhere but he wasn’t confronting the situation.”

Nesis wound up leaving to get out of the situation when it allegedly became clear after an hour that De Niro was not going to let up.

She says she now fears another run-in.

“It’s a small circle. I like Bilboquet. It’s a lot of fun,” she says. “I am terrified to go there now. I am worried about seeing her. I was traumatized. I am non-confrontational.”

“It’s like, is she dangerous?” Nesis said. “I wasn’t sure. I felt like I was in danger. You can’t be safe anywhere, even in the Hamptons.”

When we texted De Niro for comment, she wrote in all caps, “Jill Zarin and Lieba are full of s–t,” before texting a few more things and quickly deleting them from WhatsApp, and then adding, “No comment.”

A source previously told Page Six that De Niro’s reaction wasn’t about jealousy over Gooding Jr., but about business. “It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

That source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

De Niro and Gooding Jr. have been dating since 2018, when Page Six first spotted the pair.

In 2019, De Niro was caught on camera berating Gooding Jr. at a bar in Miami, knocking bottles and glasses off the top of the bar before being removed by security. A lawyer for Gooding Jr., Mark Heller, said she got a “little overly playful” while partying with her beau. A source later said she was upset when the actor took a friend’s side over something she was upset about and “it was just a silly argument.”

Like many of us, rapper Cardi B doesn’t quite understand why so many celebrities have shared that they don’t bathe regularly, tweeting her confusion over the admissions Tuesday.

“Wassup with people saying they don’t shower? It’s giving itchy,” the “WAP” rapper, 28, tweeted after several stars admitted that daily showers just aren’t necessary in their household.

Jake Gyllenhaal is the latest to admit he doesn’t find bathing regularly “necessary.”

“More and more I find bathing to be less necessary, at times,” Gyllenhaal, 40, told Vanity Fair last week while promoting Prada’s Luna Rossa Ocean fragrance.

“I do believe, because Elvis Costello is wonderful, that good manners and bad breath get you nowhere. So I do that. But I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.”

Days prior, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard had explained that they wait for their daughters to “stink” before cleaning them.

Mila Kunis, 37, and Ashton Kutcher, 43, have also shared that they only gave baths to their kids, Wyatt and Dimitri, as infants when they could “see the dirt on them.”

“I didn’t have hot water growing up as a child, so I didn’t shower much anyway,” said Kunis of her own showering habits, with Kutcher adding, “I wash my armpits and my crotch daily, and nothing else ever. I got a bar of Lever 2000 that delivers every time.”

Not all celebs are skipping the soap and water, however, as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson waded into the discourse, insisting he showers multiple times a day.

“I’m the opposite of a ‘not washing themselves’ celeb,” the “Jumanji” actor, 49, tweeted Friday. “Shower (cold) when I roll outta bed to get my day rollin’. Shower (warm) after my workout before work. Shower (hot) after I get home from work.”

Johnson was soon joined by Jason Mamoa, who told Access Hollywood Monday, “I’m not starting any trends. I shower, trust me.”

“I’m Aquaman,” Mamoa, 42, added. “I’m in the f–king water. Don’t worry about it. I’m Hawaiian. We got saltwater on me. We good.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@We’re in the final stretch of Jeopardy! guest hosts. Last night (August 9th) on the ABC quiz show, the final temp host took the podium — and according to fans, the show is going out with a bang — just maybe not a good one — with Joe Buck, a longtime Fox Sports broadcaster. Even though most guest hosts have been welcomed by Jeopardy! audiences, Buck has become one of the rare spoilers. Audiences took to Twitter last night to share just how much they dislike him after his first show aired.

Buck follows a handful of well-loved Jeopardy! guest hosts like Faber, LeVar Burton, and Sanjay Gupta. But in the Jeopardy! hosting game, they can’t all be winners, right? Even though Buck said that hosting the game show would be the “highlight” of his 30-year broadcasting career, clearly, Jeopardy! fans aren’t on the same page.

“Also, I have no idea who Joe Buck is,” one Twitter user wrote, sinking the ship with, “but he’s annoying me as the guest host.”

Even Jeopardy! legend James Holzhauer, who is the second-highest winner in the game show’s history, chimed in, roasting Buck with the rest of the audience. “Jeopardy says whoever hosts full time will have to quit their other job,” Holzhauer wrote, “so I’m crossing my fingers it’s Joe Buck.”

A few lone voices did send their support Buck’s way, celebrating his appearance on the show while complimenting his technique. “Joe Buck is good on Jeopardy which is not a surprise because he is generally just quite good,” one differing voice shared.

Jeopardy! fans may not have to worry about the Fox Sports broadcaster returning to the podium anytime soon. This week, it was reported that executive producer Mike Richards was in advanced negotiations to take over as the permanent host, although the series producers are still in talks with other potential hosts. Though Richards confirmed the rumors, nothing is set in stone yet — and a resurfaced series of alleged harassment and discrimination may cast a shadow on his chances.

Jeopardy! airs weeknights on ABC at 7/6c.

“Bridgerton” fans can now dress the part.

Hill House Home, the brand known for its viral “nap dress,” has partnered with Netflix, Shondaland and Phenomenal on a limited-edition line of lounge frocks fit to woo a Duke.

The launch offers three nap dresses priced at $125 each, including two colors of the classic “Ellie” style featuring custom prints by Diane Hill, a black female artist based in London whose work is inspired by Chinoiserie.

The third “Nesli” dress features a new “Whistledown Trellis” print by Hill House Home exclusive to this collaboration.

There’s also a duo of $40 hair accessories, which are handcrafted in Italy and available in both pink and blue.

While the Shonda Rhimes-produced show has sparked an obsession with “Regencycore” looks like corsets, empire waists and pearls — even prompting “Bridgerton” superfan Kim Kardashian to seek out her own corset from the set — the nap dress is designed for comfort and lounging.

Sarah Jessica Parker always makes a statement at the Met Gala, whether she’s showing up in a meme-worthy headpiece or hitting the red carpet in a divisive dress.

But at this year’s American fashion-themed event, the ever-stylish “Sex and the City” star might be MIA — along with her BFF, Andy Cohen.

“I’m taking a year off,” Cohen, 53, told “Access Hollywood” on Tuesday when asked about his plans for the September shindig.

“My date is filming this year. She’s filming ‘And Just Like That…,'” he added.

Parker, 56, has attended the Met Gala with Cohen no fewer than five times in the past, and when the 2020 ball was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pair still celebrated together — from a safe distance, of course.

This year’s gala is set for September 13, with Timothée Chalamet, Billie Eilish, Naomi Osaka and Amanda Gorman hosting. All guests will be required to show proof of vaccination, and must remain masked while indoors.

The event usually takes place on the first Monday in May, but the first Monday in September is Labor Day — and as one insider told us, “Even Anna Wintour can’t change a federal holiday.”

SJP has been hard at work filming the much-anticipated “Sex and the City” reboot this summer, so perhaps her shooting schedule conflicts with the big night.

But one thing’s for sure: Even if she skips the Met to work, we’re sure Parker will still make headlines with her outfits.

From Skims to swims?

Kim Kardashian tweeted a cryptic message on Monday, suggesting her shapewear empire might soon expand to include swimwear.

After a fan tweeted “S W I M B E R L Y,” the reality star replied, “S O O N C O M E,” seemingly confirming a plan to dive into bikini waters.

Further fueling the theory, the official Skims Twitter account chimed in with a series of black hearts.

Kardashian, 40, could be planning to offer swimwear under the same name, as her 2019 Skims trademark application included swimwear, swim caps and beach cover-ups.

Fans were excited about the prospect of the new line, as one commented, “don’t know what’s you [sic] up to but I know it’s gonna be great.”

“I was seriously thinking about how I wish ya’ll had swimwear,” another replied.

While Kardashian has yet to design her own suits, she regularly sets pulses racing with her bikini-clad Instagram posts – whether she’s sporting a thong on the beach or slipping into a string bikini for a hot tub dip.

Kim Kardashian has been soaking up the summer – and posting a slew of swimsuit photos. Instagram

Her sisters are no stranger to sexy swims either, with Khloé Kardashian already having expanded her Good American brand to include bathing suits in a variety of styles and sizes.

And it seems Kylie Jenner is on the same wavelength as her older sisters when it comes to business decisions; the Kylie Cosmetics founder filed to trademark Kylie Swim in May. Perhaps Kim and Kylie will take their nearly-twinning bikini snaps a step further by teaming up on a launch.

Could Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner both be releasing their own swimwear? Instagram

The potential addition to Skims also comes in the midst of a major rebrand for Kim’s KKW Beauty. The makeup mogul, who temporarily shut down the site on August 1, also filed to trademark the name SKKN in March, perhaps as part of the overhaul.

However, she was issued a cease-and-desist letter in July over competition for the name and may be planning something totally surprising for fans.

Celebrities: they’re allegedly just like us.

Now, be just like them, too — or at least dress like it — with the Free People FP Movement collection that celebs from Addison Rae and Hailey Bieber to Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens are obsessed with.

Spanning leggings, jackets, crop tops and more, the activewear collection has been snapped by paparazzi left and right. Even better, the celebs themselves have sung their praises for the workout gear, posting to their own social media in the outfits, like “The Hills” Whitney Port and real-estate developer and lead of season 12 of “The Bachelorette” Joelle Fletcher.

Another aspect of the FP Movement collection is giving back, as 1% of all FP Movement purchases benefit the non-profit Girls Inc, which works to empower women and girls with fitness and wellness programming and support. After all, if you are going to dress like a celebrity, you may as well act like one and do some philanthropy while you shop.

Since online shopping can be hard, forcing you to rely on studio photography and editing when looking at the clothes, we thought we’d let the star snaps be your shopping inspiration. See how Bieber styles her fuzzy fleece jacket to grab a green juice and take notes on Rae’s periwinkle one-piece ensemble, as she tips her hat to the FP Movement collection.

We hope you get some good karma and feel some star quality when rocking these leggings from the FP Movement collection.

Actress and TV personality Whitney Port shared a photo on her Instagram story wearing the Good Karma leggings in the delicious chocolate color. The “The Hills” star paired it with a matching bra top as well, which we found to be the Square Neck Good Karma Bra for just $48, should you want to take your own mirror selfie in a matching set.

Start your day with a trip to the gym and you may run into Addison Rae doing the same.

The star was snapped by paparazzi wearing the Good Karma Onesie in an amazing Faded Periwinkle color. Since the outfit is one-piece, all the TikTok star needed to do was throw on a pair of white sneakers and a black baseball cap and her look was a done deal.

Whether you’re actually on the ski slopes or just cozied up in your room this fall, the Hit The Slopes Fleece is a celebrity must-have.

Especially for model Kaia Gerber, who owns the jacket in both the dark blue Eclipse color and the fun purple Jamming version. Perfect to pair with a full athleisure look or dress up over jeans and a top, the jacket comes in an array of colors, that both you and Gerber can collect.

Forget the slopes and have a blast dancing in the streets like Hailey Bieber back in April.

The model, formerly known as Hailey Baldwin before her marriage to Justin Bieber, was spotted by an Instagram fan account back in April, wearing the Printed Hit the Slopes Fleece Jacket in the Black Toile Combo color. The coat also comes in pink daisies, brown zebra and an array of other fun patterns, all of which can help you feel like the model while also staying nice and comfy all fall long.

No, you aren’t seeing double.

Bieber is back on our list and wearing another version of the fuzzy jacket, but this time in a pull-over style. The celeb was spotted by the paparazzi wearing the Victory Red-colored Hit The Slopes Colorblock Pullover, holding a few drinks and donning a black beanie and matching mask.

Since the star’s spotting, the red color is almost sold out on the site, only available in an extra small size. However, if you are a fan of hit pink, you’re in luck as the Haute Pink Combo color of the same style is still in stock in all sizes from an XS to a large.

Celebrities favorite FP Movement tops

Photos via Instagram

Is it the 2000’s again or are Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens playing a trick on us?

This surely is good karma for fans of these celebs, as they both posted outfit pics of themselves in the Good Karma Crop tank tops, Hudgens in an Instagram Live wearing the Red Apple color and Duff in a full outfit of Dried Rose. Both actresses paired their tops with matching leggings, but feel free to “Say OK” to wearing them with jeans or a skirt, because “Why Not” mix and match a bit?

Image via Instagram

Will you accept this tank?

Joelle “JoJo” Fletcher will, as “The Bachelor” contestant and star of “The Bachelorette” was spotted on her Instagram wearing the Happiness Runs Crop in a stunning Azur blue color. Great for a tropical ride on a golf cart like Fletcher or relaxing at home like the rest of us, the stretchy active tank top can be worn to the gym or styled into your everyday outfits, coming in an array of bright and fun colors to choose from.

Imitation isn’t always the sincerest form of flattery — at least when it comes to the morning TV wars.

After news broke on Wednesday that “CBS This Morning” was replacing veteran journalist Anthony Mason with former football star and “Extra” correspondent Nate Burleson, several industry insiders told us the network is admitting they’re in trouble by copying rival “Good Morning America.”

And it doesn’t help that the CBS show also announced in May it’ll be filming from a new studio directly across the street from “GMA” in Times Square.

”They’re basically copying ‘GMA.’ They’re moving to Times Square, hiring a [Michael] Strahan. What’s next? Cooking segments? They’re clearly in trouble,” one industry source sniped.

Meanwhile, another source told us that “GMA” staffers are “all shook over why CBS is copying them. It’s all the talk this morning at ABC,” they said.

The move comes as ratings for NBC’s “Today” — once the top of the morning show heap — continue to lose ground to “GMA.” This season-to-date, “GMA” is reportedly the most-watched morning show for the 9th consecutive year, and has this year increased its lead over “Today” to its biggest in four years. (Though “Today” did add viewers during its Olympics broadcasts.)

“CBS This Morning” remains at the bottom.

An ABC insider admitted there was buzz around the news, but “‘shook’ is not the way to describe it,” the source said. “Look at the numbers. Do you think ‘GMA’ would be threatened by CBS?”

CBS’ Strahan-like hire is “taking a page from the playbook. It’s an interesting move for them,” they added.

Another person from a competing network scoffed, “This is the same show [that] put out a statement about not wanting to [have anchors] dress up for Halloween! They planted a stake on Halloween as opposed to having fun, and now a football player is at the table? ‘Real Sports’ wasn’t hiring? It’s insulting to journalists.”

Burleson’s hire comes after former president of ABC-owned television stations Wendy McMahon fled the network to become president and co-head of CBS News and TV stations earlier this year.

“It’s interesting that they’ve put an ABC person in place over there, and she’s running the show. I commend them for recognizing a winning playbook and stealing it, but it could be a recipe for disaster,” the ABC source said.

Another source familiar with Burleson’s hire told us “they were grooming him” to take over after he filled in while co-anchor Tony Dokoupil was away on paternity leave. “Hollywood and this business only find value in former NFL players right now. It’s the Strahan effect. It’s not even a subtle trend,” they said.

In addition to co-anchoring “CBS This Morning,” Burleson’s overall deal will include a role as an analyst at CBS Sports’ “The NFL Today” and regular appearances on Nickelodeon, according to Variety. He’ll join Gayle King and Dokoupil at the table in September.

Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations, described Burleson as the “perfect fit for mornings on CBS” in a press release.

“There is no doubt that Nate’s experiences and broader interests in news, sports and entertainment will be an exciting addition to the table with Gayle and Tony as we continue to evolve the format of the broadcast to double down on news, original reporting, great storytelling and a broad range of feature pieces that appeal to viewers across the country,” he said in an internal memo.

It’s the haves and the … have-some-mores.

The swanky Aman Resorts — where rooms average $1,400 a night and villas go for $50,000 — is offering 100 people the chance to buy an Aman Club membership as it opens a New York location on 57th Street with a members-only space.

For $100,000 initiation fee and $15,000 a year, members will have access to a 24/7 “private office,” which will take care of all travel planning “from facilitating private charters by land, sea, and air, to pre-planning unique experiences across Aman resorts,” as well as upgrades, lax check-in and check-out times, on-demand spa treatments, and access to a private club space, according to a presentation and pricing sheet seen exclusively by Page Six.

Members, which they have dubbed “Founders,” “can expect privileged access to global sporting events, fashion weeks and behind-the-scenes visits to artists’ studios,” it states.

It will also go beyond a guest’s hotel stay. “At home — beyond the resorts, this bespoke support is offered for individual wellness programs to private event planning with our ‘Aman at home’ experiences.”

The membership plan outline explains, “Experts in nutrition, health and fitness will create entirely bespoke, constantly evolving programs for Founders, offering ongoing support and guidance as their wellness journey progresses both on- and off-property.”

The annual dues are required to be paid before the hotel’s NYC opening. According to the website, the new hotel, on 57th Street in the Crown Building, will offer 83 rooms, a “Garden Terrace & Bar,” a three-floor spa, as well as a jazz club and a members-only space.

The membership applies to both the NYC club and global properties.

Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, the Kardashians, Angelina Jolie, David Beckham, George and Amal Clooney, Tom Hanks, and members of various royal families are fans of Aman, which has over 30 properties in 20 countries.

The chain, owned by Russian billionaire Vladislav Doronin, also plans on opening Tokyo and Miami locations.

No-no juice.

Mama June Shannon’s longtime boyfriend, Geno Doak, has been sentenced in his Alabama drug case, landing 16 months in Macon Community Corrections after copping a plea deal.

But TMZ reports that while the reality star will be registered as an inmate, he won’t actually be incarcerated. Instead, he will have strict rules to follow, with violations leading to actual jail time.

Doak’s drug paraphernalia charge was dismissed as part of his plea deal, and he will be placed on probation for two years after he serves his 16 months. Shannon’s beau is also required to complete substance abuse evaluation/treatment.

Doak, 45, and Mama June, 42, were arrested at an Alabama gas station in 2019 after a domestic dispute. The following week, both were charged with felony possession of a controlled substance — listed as crack cocaine — and drug paraphernalia, with Doak picking up an additional domestic violence charge.

As for Mama June, the “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” star pleaded not guilty in Oct. 2019 and was ultimately sentenced to 100 hours of community service. She also agreed to several provisions to avoid jail time, including remaining sober.

By August 2020, Shannon was celebrating six months of sobriety, shortly after admitting to having previously spent nearly $1 million on drugs for herself and Doak.

“I would say the last year of our addiction, probably a good $900,000,” the TLC star confessed. “So much money was sent to our dope man.

“In this industry, it’s kind of crazy that until you get busted it’s okay, and I think that is the wrong way to be, but it is — it’s true,” she added.

Reps for Mama June Shannon did not immediately return our request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.

Paris Hilton knows how to splurge in style.

While the “Cooking With Paris” star, 40, has a closet full of designer duds, she revealed her “biggest splurge” to date is a custom pink Hermès Birkin bag covered with crystals.

Hilton gave fans a glimpse into her extensive wardrobe Thursday for an Elle closet tour, recounting her most memorable — and expensive — outfits and accessories.

“For my biggest splurge, this is a custom-made Birkin bag,” she said, holding up the rare Rose Tyrien-colored purse. “I love Hermès, and I love this bag.

“If I was a bag, this would be me,” the entrepreneur and DJ added of the design, which is covered in “over 60,000 Swarovski crystals.”

While Hilton said she “can’t remember how much it cost,” the bag’s value was estimated at $65,000 when she purchased it in 2018.

The coveted carryall filled a long-empty space in her closet, as a group of teenagers known as the Bling Ring robbed Hilton of 20 precious Birkins in 2008.

“Since the Bling Ring broke into my house and stole my Birkin collection, I had been searching for this rare Rose Tyrien-colored Birkin,” she told Purse Blog in 2018, revealing she “finally found it” at Privé Porter, a leading reseller of Hermès bags in Miami.

Hilton showed off her sparkly splurge at LAX in 2018 with then-fiancé Chris Zylka. GC Images

Michelle Berk, founder of Privé Porter, told the outlet that the bag includes five different sizes of crystals, all applied by a female craftsman.

“For the crystals, it took her 60 hours to put 30,000 crystals on it,” she said. “Think about that: It takes an Hermès craftsman around 45 to make the bag itself.”

The piece now holds a place of pride in Hilton’s wardrobe, along with iconic outfits ranging from her “ode” to Britney Spears’ “Toxic” outfit to the white dress she wore when her fiancé, Carter Reum, proposed in February.

And while it may be her biggest splurge, the rare design is far from the only Birkin she’s toting these days. The star went on another Privé Porter shopping spree in March, even treating her Chihuahua, Diamond, to her own $5,500 Hermès Kelly bag.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@And just like that, COVID-weary New York City turned into a playground for the “Sex and the City” ladies.

Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis (sans Kim Cattrall) are filming scenes for their HBO Max spinoff, “And Just Like That . . .,” all over the Big Apple, sending superfans into a tizzy trying to catch a glimpse of the stars or land a scoop. Numerous Instagram accounts have sprung up to chronicle the on-location magic, which is bringing back a touch of pre-pandemic glamour and frivolity to the city.

“[The show] is the hottest social hunt of the summer,” Gregory Littley (@littleylittley), a content creator who has captured footage for his more than 20,000 Instagram followers, told The Post. “It’s thrilling, nostalgic and fun to post. The response on social has been a resounding ‘Welcome back, ladies.’ “

Littley, 37, helped tip off fans to a possible juicy plot line when he recorded the first sighting of Bridget Moynahan, a k a Big’s ex Natasha, on set near Balthazar, as he was shopping in Soho with his husband.

“Bridget Moynahan was there, but no one was picking up on it. My husband even thought it was Kristin Davis,” recalled Littley, who recognized that her presence was a big scoop — especially after Page Six reported that Big (Chris Noth) and Carrie (Parker) would be getting divorced.

“Big’s ex is back? What are the implications?” he said. The self-proclaimed “SATC” superfan made a short TikTok video of a chic-looking Moynahan walking on set. The video was viewed more than 200,000 times within the first 24 hours and spawned headlines on nearly every entertainment site.

Other fans say sightings of SJP and Co. are confirming plot twists in their own lives. Stumbling upon Parker on a Nolita set helped fashion executive Shay Gipson know her impending move from Los Angeles to the Big Apple was the right one.

Gipson, a former New Yorker, went West a few years ago but was recently summoned back by a new employer. Last month, she was in town looking for housing and went to a fashion event at the Crosby Street Hotel, where a film crew was set up in front. After her event wrapped, Gipson came out at the exact moment Parker pulled up to the set in a pink frock.

“I was like, ‘Oh, this is my big return to New York and here is SJP filming,’ ” said Gipson, who, years ago, used to bump into Parker at the Serge Normant salon on 23rd Street where the two would chat about the fashion industry. Gipson said the run-in felt like the universe was telling her she was in the right place.

“It solidified my return. I am definitely back in New York,” she said. “I felt like it was definitely an omen.”

For local businesses, the filming is also proving to be auspicious.

When the show recently shot a brunch scene at the East Pole on East 65th Street, crowds formed around the popular restaurant; it was like One Direction was in town.

“The excitement from the fans was palpable,” East Pole owner Anthony Martignetti told The Post. “When [the cast] got out of the town cars, people were screaming the characters’ names. They were really freaking out for Stanford [Willie Garson].”

Martignetti first opened the East Pole with his brother 10 years ago. When the two learned that “And Just Like That . . .” would be filming a brunch scene at their place, it was an exciting honor.

“I remember being a bartender in the city when the show was in its first season,” Martignetti recalled. “Places like SushiSamba and Magnolia Bakery, they really made it on there.”

In the aftermath of the shoot, a steady flow of superfans from the far reaches of Long Island have come into the restaurant, hungry for both farm-to-table fare and plot details.

“A lot of mother-and-daughter teams who follow the filming on Instagram have come in for brunch for the first time,” said Martignetti, adding that it’s been a bright spot for his staff in a tough pandemic year. “It was really exciting for us to have a momentary distraction from the mandates we are under.”

The East Pole wasn’t the only one to get its close-up. Server Mark Sopcyk was there while they were scouting, and he and Nixon hit it off. She requested that they not cast a random actor as their waiter but use Sopcyk, who is a stage performer.

“They signed him up with SAG right away and got his paperwork. He was super thrilled to be on there,” Martignetti said.

The shoot has also turned the city into a runway, showcasing the ladies’ over-the-top fashions. Original stylist Patricia Field is not working on the revival because she’s toiling away on Season Deux of “Emily in Paris,” but her collaborator Molly Rogers has taken the sartorial reins. Her head-turning looks have brought fashionistas to the set and inspired Instagram accounts devoted to the style.

“The sets are also a fashion show,” photographer Steve Sands, who has shot the stars on location, told The Post. “That’s what fans come to see.”

Some clothing choices have been controversial — such as the rumored Forever 21 dress worn by Carrie that a Venice Beach, California, boutique called Raga later claimed. The styles have been feverishly chronicled by Rogers’ own fan fashion account, @AndJustLikeThatCostumes, as well as unaffiliated popular accounts such as @JustLikeThatCloset, @SexAndTheCity_NewYork and @CarrieBradshaw_SexAndTheCity.

“I have been shooting different movies for a while, and this is the first time I’ve seen people this excited. You can feel it in the air,” said photographer Elder Ordonez, who has shot many on set-style moments, including the contentious boho dress. But he also feels the excitement on social media. He said his “SATC” revival snaps “are getting more interaction than any of my other photos. There’s so much interest.”

Littley noted that, in the present moment, frenzy around the filming transcends the latest between Carrie and Big.

He said: “It feels like a rebirth [in the city].”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2013, Becky G made history by becoming the youngest-ever CoverGirl spokesperson at the age of 15. Now, less than a decade later, she’s at the helm of her very own beauty brand, Treslúce.

“As a young Latina businesswoman, I realized I don’t just want to be the pretty Latina face of something. I want something that’s ours, something that we own, something that’s made by us and for us,” the 24-year-old “Fulanito” singer told Page Six Style.

Treslúce gets its name from a mashup of two Spanish words. There’s “tres,” the number three — a symbolic numeral representing the mind, body and soul — followed by a conjugation of “lucir,” which means “to shine.”

“It’s just such a spiritual representation of how I identify with makeup; not just being an expression of what’s on the outside, but also from within,” Becky explained of her inspiration. “Makeup, for me, has always been kind of this intimate process of transformation to a brighter version of myself.”

Becky G recently launched her own makeup line, Treslúce Beauty. Treslúce Beauty

The Mexican-American star, who said she’d “for sure” be a makeup artist if she wasn’t a musical artist, fell in love with cosmetics as a young age, and recalls frequently borrowing from her mom’s stash of beauty products.

“I had a young, cool mom who wasn’t like, ‘No, you’re too young for makeup,'” Becky explained. “She was all about [us] learning to express ourselves.”

And there are countless ways to do just that with Treslúce Beauty’s hero product, the “I Am” eyeshadow palette ($30), which is packed with 18 vivid matte and shimmery shades formulated with Mexican blue agave.

“I wanted to infuse little things that meant so much to me. And the blue agave is actually from Jalisco, Mexico, where my grandparents are from,” Becky shared of the unconventional ingredient. “I love tequila, so that’s probably where it came from too!”

In further nods to her roots, the palette’s packaging features a third eye design by Mexican artist Monica Loya, while the shade names — a mix of adjectives in both English and Spanish, including “divina,” “fuerte” and “unstoppable” — are meant to serve as affirmations.

And considering that her debut single was titled “Becky From the Block,” it shouldn’t be too surprising that the Latin Grammy nominee looks up to Jennifer Lopez as her personal beauty (and business) hero as she continues to build her own brand.

“She’s not just a great performer; she’s an actress, she’s an executive producer on a lot of the film and TV stuff that she does, as well as a fashionista, as well as a beauty brand owner. And on top of that, she’s a mom,” Becky said.

“So the possibilities are endless. When people ask me, ‘Where do you see yourself in five years?,’ it’s always like … I don’t know! Of course I have goals in mind. But I’m also only 24!”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Last night on Real Time with Bill Maher, the HBO host went to bat for Matt Damon, who—he claims—is currently “flailing around in cancel culture quicksand.” The popular actor recently acknowledged he used to use a common gay slur while growing up in Boston, but has since stopped.

“Okay, he was late to the party. To which we could say, ‘Welcome, glad you could make it. Or we could say, ‘You came later than I did. Die,’” said Maher facetiously. He claimed the Behind the Candelabra star is “one of the most likeable guys in Hollywood, with impeccable liberal credentials.”

During an interview with the U.K.’s Sunday Times, Damon admitted he had recently stopped using a derogatory term towards homosexuals after his daughter explained to him the offensive nature of the slur.

“There are too many people in this country motivated not by what they really believe, but by what will get Twitter to react to them with likes and retweets. That’s called bad faith,” said Maher, blasting cancel culture and headline writers – “Matt Damon isn’t a terrible person, he’s just ignorant.”

“Really? … He’s got a clean water charity and delivers food to Haiti. What have you done, Fox headline writer? And yet he is always getting pulled over by the woke police.”

You can check out the clip from Maher’s New Rule segment above.

Maher began his show talking about ageism with Martin Short and Steve Martin ahead their new dark comedy series, Only Murder in the Building, premiering on Hulu. Maher joked that Martin having “white hair when he was three” was a good move since he has always looked the same.

Martin said that he has “never ever thought of dying it.”

The evening’s panel, which included Donna Brazile (USA Today columnist and ABC News contributor) as well as Vice News national correspondent Michael Moynihan, spoke about climate change and the difficult topic of the Taliban’s rapid takeover of Afghanistan since President Biden sent home U.S. troops. “It’s terrible. Twenty years we were there. All for nothing,” Maher exclaimed. “It’s like when Sean Hannity went to high school.”

Michael is a music and television junkie keen on most things that are not a complete and total bore. You can follow him on Twitter — @Tweetskoor

Powered by Reelgood

After weeks of speculation, we finally know how HBO’s The White Lotus ends. (Spoiler warning, obviously.) The wildly chaotic hotel manager Armond (Murray Bartlett) was the one doomed to die. It wasn’t a guest and it wasn’t one of the annoying teen girls. It was Armond. Moreover, Armond was accidentally murdered by guest Shane (Jake Lacy).

However The White Lotus Season 1’s ending was way more than just the death of Armond. We also learned that Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) eventually did let spa director Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) down, the state of Rachel (Alexandra Daddario) and Shane’s marriage, and which character, shockingly, did decide to change their life totally after a week on the beach.

The White Lotus Season 1’s ending was full of chaotic coincidences, happily ever afters, tragic betrayals, and, yes, death. Still a little confused about everything that went down? Here’s your guide to The White Lotus Season 1 ending explained…

Who Dies in The White Lotus Finale?

Armond! (Yeah, we already addressed this.)

However what’s still worth going into is how Armond died. While it would be easy to ascribe the moment to the long-simmering feud between him and Shane, that’s not exactly accurate. And yet it is.

Here’s how it breaks down… Once Shane caught Armond giving a drugged up rim job to employee Dillon (Lukas Gage), he had the power to not only force Armond to scramble to fulfill his every whim, but Armand’s time at the White Lotus was ticking. Add to that the fact that Paula (Brittany O’Grady) stupidly egged her loverboy Kai (Kekoa Scott Kekumano) on to rob the Mossbachers — meaning a staff member committed a crime on Armond’s watch — and Armond was doomed.

After snorting a load of cocaine for his final dinner as hotel manager, Armond decides to leave a fetid gift for nemesis Shane. He sneaks into Shane’s beloved pineapple suite, zips open luggage, and poops. What he doesn’t count on is Shane coming back into the room.

When Shane realizes that someone is still in his suite, he grabs the room’s pineapple knife to defend himself from the interloper. Since the Mossbachers were robbed, Shane assumes the person in his room is the same violent assailant. Armond and him have a tense stand off that ends with Armond rushing into Shane’s blade.

So it was a terrible accident that would not have happened had Armand not hated Shane so much that he needed to shit in his stuff.

And that is why Shane is upset in the first scene set at the airport in The White Lotus. Well, that, and he believes his marriage to Rachel is over…

Why Does Rachel Stay with Shane in The White Lotus Finale?

The most surprising part of The White Lotus finale might have to do with Alexandra Daddario’s Rachel tearfully joining Shane at the airport and promising she’ll be happy with him. Everything in the series thus far had been signaling that theirs was a mis-match. In fact, Rachel starts the final episode of The White Lotus by telling Shane marrying him was a mistake. She even gets her own room and grapples with ending the marriage that’s barely begun.

However, when Rachel turns to Belinda for advice, the devastated spa manager refuses to help. After being burned by Tanya — who was all in on funding Belinda’s dream business before becoming distracted by a new romance — Belinda tells Rachel she’s all out of advice. The conversation leaves Rachel in a lurch, without guidance to follow her own bliss, and forced to deal with the choices she’s made.

It’s unclear about when and how Rachel learned about Armond’s death, but her arrival at the airport obviously signals that she has decided to give up her own professional dreams and devote her life to being Shane’s trophy wife. (In a frightening way, it’s possible his act of violence could have even scared her into thinking it’s now her job to make him happy, but that could be reading too much into it.)

What Happens to Everyone Else in The White Lotus?

Tanya and new lover Greg (Jon Gries) decide to make the most of their time together, as Greg has unspecified health issues he’s dying from. (I’m assuming it’s some sort of lung disease and not COVID, folks.) They decide to fly to Aspen together and live life to the fullest. Again this leaves Belinda in the lurch.

Olivia (Sydney Sweeney) confronts Paula about her role in the robbery and eventually comforts her friend, cementing their toxic friendship for good. Why was Paula so upset? Because the cops apprehended Kai and put him in jail (and returned the Mossbacher’s expensive jewelry to them).

The drama of the robbery also cemented Nicole (Connie Britton) and Mark’s (Steve Zahn) marriage, meaning they came out better for all the drama. Except for that final little twist…

After finding companionship with the locals, Quinn (Fred Hechinger) decides to slip away from his family as they’re boarding their flight home to stay in Hawaii. As he explains to his parents, he doesn’t want to go home. He wants to finish school remotely and join his new friends as they paddle around the islands and eventually across the ocean to Fiji. Of all the characters in The White Lotus, Quinn might be the only one to truly rid himself of his toxic ties and behavior. We’re rooting for you, Quinn!

Will There Be a The White Lotus Season 2?

Yes! HBO has already announced that writer/director Mike White will be making a second season of The White Lotus. The White Lotus Season 2 will feature all new characters in a new location, i.e. a different White Lotus resort.
