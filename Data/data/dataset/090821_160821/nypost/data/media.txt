Major League Baseball and Barstool Sports have had significant negotiations about having national midweek games on the site’s platforms, The Post has learned.

The discussions are what Barstool founder Dave Portnoy was referring to last week when he mentioned his company has had talks with “major leagues.”

MLB and Barstool potentially could team up to create a new type of broadcast with a focus on in-game gambling.

The talks have started recently, and while they have picked up steam, an agreement is not yet a certainty. One source deemed it “50-50.”

MLB and Barstool declined to comment.

Major League Baseball currently has national TV deals with Fox, Turner and ESPN. As part of its new ESPN contract that begins next year, the network dropped regular, non-exclusive Monday and Wednesday games, leaving MLB trying to find a buyer for that inventory. Turner will move its regular-season games to Tuesday, from Sunday, beginning next season.

YouTube is a possibility for the midweek national games, as it already has streamed MLB games for three years. Peacock just did a weekend series last month, as well, and is seen as a contender.

But Barstool sticks out because it has the connection to a younger audience MLB craves and could possibly create buzz with its alternative delivery approach. Barstool would be expected to deliver the games through its website, Instagram and Twitter accounts, among others.

Barstool recently announced that it would be a title sponsor and broadcaster for college football’s Arizona Bowl. The platform is expected to soon sign other deals for live rights.

As is Barstool’s wont, the Arizona Bowl broadcast is not expected to be traditional in its delivery, which could appeal to MLB.

Noah Garden, MLB’s chief revenue officer, has been wanting baseball to become younger. He has not been shy about expanding into gambling, and he likes the idea of alternative broadcasts.

The “Bettor’s Eye,” a baseball betting-focused show, was scheduled for Monday and new episodes are planned for the next three Mondays on MLB Network. Previously, segments of the program have run on MLB Network.

MLB Network, during a few of its games this season, has featured what it termed the “Clubhouse Edition” approach with CC Sabathia, among others, on hand.

On Tuesday night, MLB Network’s game between the Cubs and Brewers will have Sabathia, Jason Kendall, Matt Vasgersian and Mark DeRosa hanging out.

For Barstool, it is trying to be at the center of the convergence of sports gambling, media and now, potentially, live games.

Barstool’s parent company, Penn National, just bought the Canadian betting app, theScore. It has sportsbooks in several states with the list growing. And now it is moving into live rights.

There is one major issue that all potential streamers have to overcome to make in-game gambling a reality. The lag time between live action and the stream must be eliminated if betting in-game is to become a reality.

Doing business with Barstool could come with controversy for MLB, as Barstool has been accused of being misogynistic. But Barstool has been embraced by many top major leaguers, including Bryce Harper, making it possibly a popular choice among some players.

If the games are nonexclusive, Barstool probably wouldn’t have to do the production, as it could take feeds from regional sports networks (RSNs). Barstool then could produce its own nontraditional, gambling focused broadcast without a play-by-play voice and analysts. Its relaxed approach could feature Portnoy, Dan (Big Cat) Katz and, for say, a Yankees game, Eric Hubbs, who writes about the team for the site.

If a deal is completed and it is nonexclusive, the games would likely still be broadcast on RSNs, making Barstool’s stream an alternative broadcast. That means local fans who want the traditional approach would not be disrupted.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Podcast king Joe Rogan slammed so-called COVID-19 vaccine passports, which provide proof of vaccination, saying they would bring the US “one step closer to dictatorship.”

The 53-year-old UFC announcer singled out CNN host Don Lemon for “openly” talking about a future where only the vaccinated have the freedom to “do what they want” and go “wherever the f–k you wanna go.”

Rogan said only “dumb” people would accept such restrictive rules, especially when the US became the “greatest superpower the world has ever known” through the first “experiment in self-government that actually worked.”

“And how did it do that? It did it through freedom,” he told listeners on Friday’s episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” with Donald Trump Jr. among those who have shared a clip seen 3.7 times by Monday.

“Because when you give people freedom, you let them do whatever the f–k they want to do, they actually find ways to succeed and grow and thrive,” Rogan said.

“But as soon as you put the boots to them, as soon as you tell them, ‘You have to do this, or you can’t do that. You have to listen to me’ — now you have a mini dictator,” he insisted.

“You have one step away from a king. One step closer. You’re moving one step closer to dictatorship. That’s what the f— is happening,” groaned the podcaster, who previously admitted he was “not a respected source of information.”

“That’s what’s gonna happen with a vaccine passport. That’s what gonna happen if they close borders,” he continued, suggesting a day when “You can’t enter New York City unless you have your papers.”

It would create a country where officials tell citizens, “You can’t do what you want to do unless you do what I want you to do,” he predicted.

He said he found it “terrifying” that some “smart people are applauding” such restrictions.

He also predicted that officials would then not “give that power up” and force people to start carrying papers.

“As soon as you give politicians power — any kind of power that didn’t exist previously — historically they don’t relinquish that power. They find new reasons to use it,” he warned.

He also called it “hilarious” that “people shouldn’t be skeptical or nervous” about COVID vaccines now that it is clear “not only can you get it, but you can spread it” even once inoculated.

“All you hear is, ‘Take this vaccine that doesn’t even prevent you from getting the disease’ or you can’t go … wherever the f–k you wanna go. It really is madness,” he said.

However, severe COVID-19 breakthrough infections are extremely low among those fully vaccinated, CDC data shows.

Donald Trump Jr. was one of many who shared clips of the tirade, with the one shared by the first son seen more than 3.7 million times by Monday morning.

“Joe Rogan gets it,” Trump Jr. tweeted.

Rogan’s views on coronavirus vaccines previously landed him in hot water in April when he told listeners that young, healthy people don’t “need to worry about” getting the shots.

“I’m not a doctor, I’m a f–cking moron,” Rogan later said of the huge backlash his comments caused.

“I’m not a respected source of information, even for me … But I at least try to be honest about what I’m saying.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A New York Times reporter received backlash on social media after making a comment on another network that critics believe dismissed concerns about former President Barack Obama’s star-studded, maskless birthday party over the weekend.

New York Times White House correspondent Annie Karni discussed the controversy surrounding Obama’s much-criticized Martha’s Vineyard celebration, where he was seen not wearing a mask, and used the term “sophisticated” crowd, saying that the guests were “following all the safety precautions.”

The clip sparked outrage on social media, including from journalist Glenn Greenwald, who wondered why more people weren’t concerned about the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus at Obama’s party.

“A NYT reporter on CNN justifying Obama’s huge maskless birthday bash because he only invited ‘a sophisticated, vaccinated crowd’ is about as emblematic of liberal discourse as it gets,” Greenwald tweeted. “What happened to all the concerns about vaccinated people passing Delta to the unvaccinated?”

“Of course viruses don’t attack sophisticated people, Muffy!” attorney Harmeet K. Dhillon tweeted.

“Someone really should inform Annie Karni what certain parts of Hollywood thinks of vaccines,” The Spectator contributor Stephen L. Miller tweeted.

The clip of Annie Karni speaking to CNN has sparked outrage on social media. CNN

Karni attempted to clarify the clip. saying the word “sophisticated” was a direct quote from one of the residents she spoke to and that she was simply conveying the beliefs of some of the people on the island.

“Watch the full clip,” Karni tweeted. “The Q was, what do people on the island think of the party? The A was me summarizing views of ppl I spoke with: some are upset, + others think the concerns about it are overblown. ‘Sophisticated crowd’ was from a quote in the story.”

Obama had said his party, which was originally going to entertain over 500 people, was “scaled back” due to the spread of the Delta variant. However, the former president was widely panned on social media after images from the party surfaced showing a massive tent and photos of maskless attendees.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Conservative shock jock, Newsmax anchor, voice-over actor and vocal anti-vaxxer Dick Farrel has died after contracting COVID-19. The Queens native was 65.

The radio veteran was beloved by fans for his strong far-right opinions, including that Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election was fraudulent, the coronavirus vaccine is of questionable efficacy, and Dr. Anthony Fauci is a “power-tripping lying freak” conspiring with “power trip lib loons,” the Daily Mail reported.

Although Farrel called the vaccine “bogus bull shid” [sic] that’s “promoted by people who lied 2u all along” as recently as July on social media, loved ones now say that, after being hospitalized for the novel virus, Farrel changed his stance on the vaccine.

“COVID Took One Of My Best Friends! RIP Dick Farrel. He is the reason I took the shot!” Farrel’s friend Amy Leigh Hair posted on her Facebook page after his August 4 death. “He texted me and told me to ‘Get it!’ He told me that this virus is no joke and he said: ‘I wish I had gotten it!’ ”

Hair, a noted theatrical sign-language interpreter for Hands On Broadway, is now grateful to have the shot, she told West Palm Beach NBC affiliate WPTV.

“I was one of the people like him who didn’t trust the vaccine. I trusted my immune system. I just became more afraid of getting COVID-19 than I was of any possible side effects of the vaccine. I’m glad I got vaccinated,” she said.

His life partner, Kit Farley, took to Facebook to grieve Farrel’s loss and emphasize the seriousness of COVID-19.

“[He] fought like a tiger. Please don’t put off getting attention for this illness. Yes, for some it has minimal effects, but others it is deadly. We will always love Dick Farrel, always appreciate his spirit, and miss him greatly. He was known as the other Rush Limbaugh. With a heavy heart, I can only say this was so unexpected. He will be missed,” Farley wrote.

Many friends and Floridians recall Farrel for his deep voice, loyalty and passion.

While Farrel posted anti-vax content as recently as July, loved ones say he changed his stance and began urging friends to get the shot after contracting COVID. YouTube

“Dick was a pioneer ‘shock talk’ host, certainly here in South Florida, and a loyal friend both personally and to listeners here for decades,” Hubbard South Florida Creative Director Mick McCabe told WPTV.

“Was he loyal? Unquestionably! Was he skilled? Yessir! His passing is a big loss,” former CBS Radio West Palm Beach market general manager Lee Strasser told the local outlet. “He was a kind-hearted person with a load of passion, and his memory will stand the test of time.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Charlie Ergen’s Dish Network beat Wall Street’s second-quarter estimates even as it continued to bleed tens of thousands of pay-TV subscribers.

The satellite TV company was boosted by its growing wireless business even as customers continued cord-cutting, in which they cancel traditional cable or satellite TV packages and opt to stream content instead.

Dish said it closed the quarter with nearly 9 million wireless subscribers thanks to “transformative” deal Ergen announced last month with AT&T to make it the primary network services partner for its wireless customers.

Under the terms of the 10-year pact worth at least $5 billion, AT&T will provide voice, data and messaging services to customers of Dish-owned Boost Mobile, Ting and Republic Wireless.

Charlie Ergen cut a $5 billion deal with AT&T to ramp up its wireless service last month. AP

Dish lost 67,000 pay-TV subscribers in the quarter ending June 30. Overall, the company ended the period with nearly 11 million total subscribers, including 8.6 million Dish TV subscribers and 2.4 million Sling TV streaming subscribers.

The satellite TV company on Monday posted a 48.4 percent rise in quarterly net income to $671 million or $1.06 a diluted share from year-ago income of $452.3 million, or 78 cents a share as it boosted its wireless business.

Revenue rose 40.8 percent to $4.49 billion from $3.19 billion. Analysts’ expected 88 cents on sales of $4.43 billion.

The wireless pact is part of a race among telecom firms to ramp up their 5G infrastructure to provide faster data services and better coverage to customers. It also helps Dish accelerate its wireless distribution in more rural markets where the company already provides satellite TV services.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He’s “Wild N’ Out” with a bunch of women — and here’s why.

For Nick Cannon, having multiple babies with multiple girlfriends is the father of seven’s way of rebelling against the “Eurocentric” institution of marriage.

“That’s a Eurocentric concept … the idea that you’re supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life,” Cannon, 40, explained Monday on Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club.”

“The idea that a man should have one woman,” the host of “The Masked Singer” continued. “We shouldn’t have anything. I have no ownership over this person.”

Cannon — who welcomed his seventh child, the fourth within a year’s time, in June — said that fathering so many kids is not a decision he gets to make.

“Those women, and all women, are the ones that open themselves up and say, ‘I would like to allow this man into my world and I will birth this child,’ ” the California native insisted. “It ain’t my decision. I’m just following suit.”

The former Nickelodeon star welcomed 10-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with ex-wife and megastar Mariah Carey, 51, in 2011.

He has two children — son Golden, 4, and 8-month-old daughter Powerful Queen Cannon — with Miss Guam 2014 pageant winner Brittany Bell, 33.

On June 14, Cannon welcomed twin boys Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir with DJ Abby De La Rosa, 29.

Then, just nine days later, on June 23, he became the father of his fifth son, Zen, with model Alyssa Scott.

And now, Cannon says his aversion to monogamy is rooted in the European history of marriage.

“If we’re really talking about how we co-exist and how we populate, it’s about what exchange can we create together,” he said.

“I understand the institution of marriage, but if we go back to what that was about … [it] was to classify property,” he added, referring to the dowry system — the practice of trading a woman into marriage in exchange for money or property that was popularized in England between the 12th and 18th centuries.

The “Wild N’ Out” star said he doesn’t want “ownership” of any of the mothers of his children. The Breakfast Club

“One father gave another man his daughter for land,” Cannon said. “So when you really get to that concept, it’s like, we gotta change this up.”

Thus, his parade of paramours prevails.

“I don’t want ownership over anybody,” the “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” star said. “I don’t have ownership over any of the mothers. We create families in the sense that we created a beautiful entity.”

But it’s unclear whether the leading ladies of his love life are happy about Cannon’s staunch commitment to non-commitment.

“Every woman in my life that I deal with or [have] dealt with … they know how I feel,” he said.

“And it usually is a concept like, I’m not going around like, ‘Who am I gonna impregnate next?’ Nah,” Cannon continued.

“When you really look at how the family infrastructure is designed, the woman is the one that always leads and makes decisions,” he said.

“Everyone is like, ‘How is he convincing these women?’ … But I’m not. I’m the one in the scenario who has to follow suit on what they decide.”

Cannon, who admittedly grew up in an “unorthodox” home in which both of his parents were absent at times, said he’s extremely active in all of his children’s lives.

“For every single one of my kids, I’m at every basketball game, I’m at every martial arts practice,” he said.

“People don’t understand how I do it, but my children are my priority.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For someone who prides himself on optics, Barack Obama just gave us quite an ugly spectacle.

As the rest of America struggles with uncertain employment status and school reopenings, shifting mask mandates, anxiety over vaccinations and variants, the health of the economy and the citizenry at large, Obama had to go and throw himself a huge, epic, three-day birthday bash on Martha’s Vineyard.

You would think a former president — one who clearly considers himself more intelligent and sensitive than most — would exercise some restraint.

Or at least understand that this was a supremely bad look.

Here were a host of left-leaning eco-warrior celebs, all Obama’s “close friends,” of course, descending on an already understaffed and emotionally depleted Vineyard.

“His birthday party is insane,” one of Obama’s caterers told The Post last week. “What is he thinking?”

Clearly, Obama thought to do whatever he damn well pleased — even after such backlash caused him to effectively cancel his party.

“This outdoor event was planned months ago in accordance with all public health guidelines and with COVID safeguards in place,” Obama spokesperson Hannah Hankins told the press last week. “Due to the new spread of the delta variant over the past week, the President and Mrs. Obama have decided to significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends.”

That, we now know, was a lie.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests, all free to go unmasked, while their 200 servers were reportedly forced to mask up. The tiny island’s residents, meanwhile, endured “a s—t-show” of traffic and sudden road closures enforced by the Secret Service.

Is there a more disgusting display of elitist “Rules for thee, not for me” than this?

Famously close friend David Axelrod — who sat for a hagiographic, three-part HBO Obama doc that premiered last week, who just called Obama an “apostle of hope” in the Washington Post, and the adviser most responsible for getting Obama elected in the first place — was, according to the New York Times, cut from the guest list.

Yes, David Axelrod was uninvited at the last minute so “close friends” such as H.E.R., former “Real Housewife of Atlanta” Kim Fields, Bradley Cooper and Stephen Colbert — to name but a few — could attend.

That is some cold stuff.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests for the birthday bash. Instagram

The uninvited, according to the Times, were “abruptly cut.” It tells you just where the Obamas’ post-presidential priorities are: Hollywood, podcasts, Netflix deals, and socializing with celebrities.

Musician H.E.R. was one of the guests at former President Barack Obama’s 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard. Instagram

There’s not much daylight here between the Obamas and the Markles. Who would have thought?

Consider that Jackie O, the most famous woman of her era, lived a very low-profile life on the Vineyard. Sure, she had an estate, but she did not move about ostentatiously.

Throw a lavish party filled with hundreds of A-listers while America remained gripped by a pandemic?

Jackie would never.

Barack, however, was playing 18 holes with Don Cheadle and getting serenaded by Alicia Keys. He was working it out on the dance floor with Erykah Badu while his guests drank top-shelf liquor and smoked cigars and dined from a menu curated by Questlove.

And the mainstream media cheers this on!

“Even Scaled Back, Barack Obama’s Birthday Bash is the Event of the Season,” said Vanity Fair.

“Danced All Night,” People mag said of Obama. “He Never Stopped Smiling.”

No wonder the vaccine is still politicized. No wonder there remains two Americas, despite Obama’s constant, self-aggrandizing promises to unite us.

On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci went on “Meet the Press” to warn that the Sturgis, SD, motorcycle rally (code for “MAGA crowd”) might be a superspreader event.

Then on Monday, a New York Times reporter went on CNN and quoted a Vineyard resident as saying the Obamas were fine because they invited “a sophisticated, vaccinated crowd.”

Nancy Pelosi said she didn’t go to former President Barack Obama’s birthday because she had “other parties” to go to. Maciel-Ngre-GLH / BACKGRID

That says it all. Even Twitter erupted.

“Of course viruses don’t attack sophisticated people, Muffy!” said one.

Perhaps Obama should have winnowed his list down to his close campaign strategists and loyal staffers — those who, according to the Times, were heartbroken to be thrown over for the likes of Chrissy Teigen, famous for little more than her marriage and her cyber-bullying.

These longtime loyalists, the Times said, “generally credit themselves with helping create the Obama legacy that has allowed the former president to settle in so comfortably with the A-list crowd” and all of them had “been looking forward to the reunion after an isolated year.”

Let them eat cake, indeed.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A pair of tattooed brothers were arrested for the fatal shooting of a 29-year old Chicago police officer over the weekend, cops said Monday.

Emonte Morgan, 21, was busted on charges of first-degree murder for killing Officer Ella French on Saturday night. His brother Eric Morgan, 22, was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and obstruction of justice, according to the Chicago Police Department.

The brothers and a third woman were stopped by French and her partner around 9 p.m. Saturday.

Suddenly, gunfire erupted from the vehicle, police said. Officers returned fire, injuring one of the vehicle’s occupants. Police did not give a reason for the traffic stop.



“This is the first step towards justice as we work to honor our fallen officer and her partner,” Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said at a press conference Monday evening.

French’s partner was taken to the hospital with serious gunshot wounds but is “improving incrementally,” Brown said.

Chicago Police Officer Ella French was shot and killed during a traffic stop on August 7, 2021.

The young woman in the car with the brothers has not been charged, due to lack of evidence, he said.

The gun used “was the product of a straw purchase,” Brown said, and was illegally purchased through an Indiana man, Jamel Danzy, 29, who purchased it legally in Hammond, Indiana, and knowingly provided it to another individual in Chicago who was not permitted to own firearms, Brown said.

Danzy was charged by federal authorities Monday.

Brown said traffic stops like Saturday’s are beneficial for keeping guns off the streets. This year alone, he said, 7,536 guns have been recovered by CPD, a 23 percent increase from the same period last year.

“But for the brave conduct of our police officers trying to protect the people of Chicago and recovering an illegally possessed gun, what ended up being an illegally bought gun, but for these types of traffic stops our cities wouldn’t be safe.

“Criminals with illegal guns are driving [up] crime here and everywhere in this country. And officers put themselves in harm’s way stopping suspects like this so that we can all sleep safely in our homes at night.”

French is the first Chicago police officer killed since Lori Lightfoot became mayor of the city in 2019, but the city’s cops have faced a surge of gunfire in the past two years.

In total, 11 people were killed and 73 were shot across the city over the weekend, Chicago police said.

Jessica Alba honestly looks like she’s having a relaxing holiday.

The actress-turned-business maven, 40, was snapped soaking up the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, along with her husband, Cash Warren, 42, preparing for a day of snorkeling. Both looked fit and tan carting their undersea equipment around the beach.

The pair met in 2004 on the “Fantastic Four” set and tied the knot in May 2008. They share three children: daughters Honor Marie, 13, and Haven Garner, 9, and son Hayes, 3 — none of whom appeared with them on the beach.

Alba carried her flippers and mask to the water. HEM / BACKGRID

Perhaps the two needed some alone time. The “Dark Angel” star recently admitted on Katherine Schwarzenegger’s Instagram show “Before, During, and After Baby” that she has to work to keep the spark in her marriage with Warren alive, copping to feeling like a “roommate” to him.

“It’s all rosy for 2 1/2 years. But then after that, you become roommates,” she explained. “You’re just going through the motions. You have the responsibilities. It’s a lot of, like, checking the boxes, right?”

Alba recently admitted she sometimes views Warren more like a roommate. HEM / BACKGRID

Alba said that initially the couple was diligent about weekly date nights with no talk about kids or responsibilities but “that stops, because of whatever.”

The Honest Company founder also confessed to sometimes taking Warren for granted.

“We have, like, obviously the friendship, the comfort of, like, ‘You’re not going anywhere,’ and so sometimes you don’t treat those people the best, right? You don’t consider their feelings in the way that you would consider other people’s feelings,” she said. “So that is something that I think is a constant one to work on.”

Alba acknowledged that she doesn’t have the answers to a happy marriage.

“If you’ve figured it out in your relationship, let me know,” she joked.

At least the pair’s social life is going strong: They partied all night in Miami in May to celebrate Honest Company’s billion-dollar valuation.

The Cajun chicken wasn’t the only thing that was a little bit spicy at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night.

Claudine De Niro caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant, we’re told, by confronting a woman who she accused of taking her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number.

Sources say that the unnamed woman chatted with the Oscar winner around 11 p.m. at the Sag Harbor eatery, and he gave her his details before she said her goodbyes.

And we’re told that De Niro — who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — later stormed over to where the woman was sitting on a sofa in a hallway and demanded, “Why did you take his number? Don’t you know he’s my boyfriend?”

We’re told that the woman stayed seated next to a pal and barely responded, while De Niro stood over her and continued to berate her for some time.

Sources say that a pal of the woman was sufficiently concerned to move the restaurant’s management to ask Claudine to leave — which, we’re told, De Niro assured the pal that they would not. She was correct, and De Niro eventually walked away by herself and headed into the bathroom.

But a source close to De Niro told us she wasn’t being a jealous girlfriend — it was all about business.

The insider said that both De Niro and her foe are real estate agents and that De Niro was mad that the woman had wanted Gooding’s business — not good lovin’.

“It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

The source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

It’s not, of course, the first time Gooding’s got mixed up in some trouble with women.

The “Jerry McGuire” star has been charged with six counts of misdemeanor forcible touching and six counts of third-degree sexual abuse stemming from three alleged incidents. He has pleaded not guilty.

It’s also not the first time the pair have made a spectacle at a fancy spot.

Page Six reported in June 2019 that Gooding was spotted at the sceney Bowery Hotel loudly complaining about one of his accusers.

Le Bilboquet didn’t comment.

All hail the queen.

Beyoncé graces not one, not two, but three different covers of Harper’s Bazaar’s September 2021 “Icons” issue, donning a trio of looks that reflect her Houston roots.

On one of the covers, the 39-year-old superstar models a head-to-toe denim look from her upcoming Ivy Park Rodeo collection, complete with chaps and gleaming belt buckle.

On another, she poses in a Stetson cowboy hat and fringed leather gloves styled with a sheer Valentino bodysuit and sequin cape.

And on her third cover, Beyoncé dazzles in a plunging Gucci gown dripping with delicate feathers and shimmering crystals.

Throughout her shoot, the “Halo” hitmaker sparkles in baubles from Tiffany & Co.; she and husband Jay-Z were recently named the new celebrity faces of the jewelry brand.

“We were inspired by the culture and swag of the Houston rodeo,” Beyoncé told Bazaar of her new Ivy Park x Adidas collection. “This collection is a mixture of my childhood growing up in Texas and a bit of American history. I grew up going to the Houston rodeo every year. It was this amazing diverse and multicultural experience where there was something for every member of the family.”

The pop performer added that she was particularly influenced by the “overlooked history” of the black cowboy.

“Many of them were originally called cowhands, who experienced great discrimination and were often forced to work with the worst, most temperamental horses,” she explained. “They took their talents and formed the Soul Circuit. Through time, these black rodeos showcased incredible performers and helped us reclaim our place in western history and culture.”

Elsewhere in her interview, Beyoncé spoke about her hopes for her next decade of life — “My wish is for my 40s to be fun and full of freedom,” she said — and promised fans that new music “is coming.”

The “Love On Top” singer also hinted that she might have another project in the pipeline, revealing that she spent quarantine “creating positive rituals drawing from past generations and putting my own spin on things” and has been enjoying the benefits of CBD and honey.

“One of my most satisfying moments as a mom is when I found [my daughter] Blue one day soaking in the bath with her eyes closed, using blends I created and taking time for herself to decompress and be at peace,” she recalled. “I have so much to share…and there’s more to come soon!”

Shari Redstone is hitting pause on any potential partnership talks between her media company ViacomCBS and NBC owner Comcast in hopes of lining up more suitors, The Post has learned.

The billionaire heiress, who serves as chairman of ViacomCBS, has decided to hold off until next year before re-engaging in talks with Comcast’s Brian Roberts, according to two sources close to the situation.

This includes any talks of a merger or a joint domestic venture where Comcast and ViacomCBS could combine their respective streaming services, Peacock and Paramount Plus, according to a source.

Reps for ViacomCBS, Redstone and Comcast declined to comment.

ViacomCBS’s directors had suggested to controlling shareholder Redstone that her business will likely attract multiple suitors if she waits to shop around, sources said. Redstone agreed with the board and the company is focusing on building out its business for the time being, these sources added.

“Board members are speaking to Shari and saying don’t panic,” a source said referring Hollywood’s consolidation frenzy.

It’s been widely reported that Comcast has been eyeing buying Viacom/CBS assets, which includes Nickelodeon and the Paramount Pictures movie studio, as industry consolidation heats up in an effort to compete for streaming subscribers.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts met with Redstone and ViacomCBS CEO and president Bob Bakish in late June in New York to discuss a potential streaming pact for international markets. Last week, ViacomCBS announced a distribution partnership in Europe between Paramount+ and Comcast’s Sky.

A June report from The Journal also that said Roberts was mulling a potential tie-up between his company and ViacomCBS. And in July, Roberts and Redstone were spotted at the Allen & Co. annual media conference, sparking further speculation about a deal.

Comcast’s Roberts has downplayed the idea of a merger, both publicly and behind the scenes. Speaking on CNBC after Comcast’s earnings report in late July he said: “We don’t feel we need to do M&A.”

But sources say that this may be because Roberts knows that a deal between Comcast and ViacomCBS might be easier to get past regulators if Redstone’s media company could first sell CBS.

Federal Communications Commission rules prohibit broadcasters from owning two of the major four networks, in this case NBC and CBS.

One potential buyer of CBS is the media entity that will emerge next year from AT&T’s planned sale of its WarnerMedia unit, behind HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN, and Discovery, which operates TLC, HGTV and Animal Planet.

But that new entity, to be run by Discovery CEO David Zaslav, cannot even think about any new deals until its own $43 billion merger is completed.

“Shari is hearing a lot of people could be interested in combining with ViacomCBS but not now,” a source said. That includes Zaslav, according to a person familiar with the media boss’s thinking.

Other people close to Redstone, however, insist that she’s not interested in selling CBS to anyone and that the most logical suitors at the moment are private equity firms.

Another source suggested that Redstone could also find a suitor in the tech world where companies like Amazon and Apple are scrapping for TV shows and movies to fill their streaming services.

“I think the hope is big tech comes in the picture,” the source said. “She can benefit from waiting.”

Amazon, which recently agreed to buy MGM, the movie studio behind the James Bond franchise, for $8.45 billion, may also be on the hunt for more film and TV shows once it closes that deal.

Sources close to Redstone also note another factor that may be drawing the media mogul to the sidelines— Bob Bakish, who she tapped to run ViacomCBS when the two formerly separate entities merged in 2019.

Bakish has only been running the business since December 2019 and is not interested in being replaced so soon, sources said.

“I don’t think Shari is ready to force Bob into doing a deal,” the source said.

Although he is close to Redstone, Backish was not at the Allen & Co. conference participating in the talks with Roberts, sources said.

On a ViacomCBS earnings call last week, in which he unveiled a massive $900 million deal for new episodes of “South Park,” Bakish said he will always evaluate every merger opportunity declining to elaborate further.

“We believe organic execution continues to be the right path,” he said, adding: “Of course, we will always evaluate any opportunities through a shareholder value creation lens.”

However, for the time being, the reality is ViacomCBS is simply not in play, sources close to the situation said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s official. Kasie Hunt, the former NBC News correspondent and MSNBC anchor, has decamped for CNN.

Rumors that Hunt was heading for CNN began to spread after the journalist announced her departure on air last month during her MSNBC morning show, “Way Too Early.”

CNN officially announced Hunt’s hire on Tuesday, noting that she will join the network as an anchor and chief national affairs analyst.

The former NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent will cover national and breaking news stories for CNN and its streaming service, CNN+ when it launches in early 2022. She will also anchor a daily political news show for the CNN+, which marks the network’s first big push into streaming.

Hunt, who starts at her new gig on Sept. 7, is the first new talent hire for CNN+, which was first announced by CNN boss Jeff Zucker last month.

Details of her show and additional hires for the streaming service are expected in the coming months ahead of the launch.

Hunt most recently spent eight years at NBC News where she cut her teeth as an off-air reporter before securing a weekend show in 2017, and then her show “Way Too Early” last year. Her role at CNN+ will be important to the nascent streaming service’s success as it enters a crowded that includes rival services such as Fox News’ Fox Nation and NBCUniversal’s Peacock.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Chris Cuomo has a yacht of reasons to hide.

The embattled CNN anchor was spotted at a Hamptons dock late Tuesday by Fox News as he dodged criticism of his role in his brother Andrew’s sexual harassment scandal and resignation.

Chris admitted he was in contact with the governor, but did not say whether he advised his sibling to resign.

The “Cuomo Prime Time” host reportedly spent “four or five hours” on his speedboat before returning to shore as dusk fell. The younger Cuomo was approached by a reporter as he walked to his truck at the Sag Harbor Yacht Yard.

“Of course I have,” Chris Cuomo answered when asked if he had spoken with his brother Tuesday. He then held his tongue when asked if he had told his older brother to step down, whether he was continuing to advise Andrew, and whether that presented an ethical conflict for the younger Cuomo.

The New York Times, citing two sources, reported late Tuesday that Chris Cuomo had advised his brother to give up his office amid the fallout from revelations that he had sexually harassed 11 women — including nine current or former state employees — in violation of federal law.

“I think you’ve got a job to do,” Cuomo finally said as he walked past the reporter, “and I’m letting you do it.”

In the wake of a Post report that Andrew Cuomo has no place of his own to stay once he leaves the governor’s mansion in Albany, Chris Cuomo was later asked if his brother would be joining him in the Hamptons.

“Yes, if you wait here, he’ll be here in five minutes,” the anchor snarked as he got into his Ford F-150. Cuomo ignored other questions as he pulled out of the yacht yard, including whether he believed the women who accused his brother of sexual misconduct.

FoxNews.com also reported that Cuomo had told its reporter that he had called New York state troopers to “tell them not to get you.” It was not immediately clear whether he meant the comment as a joke.

The “Cuomo Prime Time” host has not been on the air since Thursday. The following day, he began an apparently pre-planned vacation to mark his 51st birthday, which fell on Monday. He had not mentioned his brother’s scandal on his program last week.

Andrew Cuomo stepped down as governor Tuesday, 16 months before the conclusion of his third term in office.

A report released Aug. 3 by New York state Attorney General Letitia James detailed the extent of the CNN star’s moonlighting as an adviser to his brother, which the anchor apologized for in May after the Washington Post initially reported on it.

“I can be objective about just about any topic, but not about my family … I am fiercely loyal to them. I’m family first, job second,” Chris Cuomo told his viewers May 20, later adding: “When my brother’s situation became turbulent, being looped into calls with other friends of his, and advisers that did include some of his staff, I understand why that was a problem for CNN. It will not happen again.”

A CNN rep told The Post late Monday that recent conversations between the brothers did not violate network policy because Chris Cuomo was not taking part in gubernatorial staff meetings or acting “in any official capacity.”

Critics have called for the anchor to be disciplined or fired over his dual role, which represents a serious ethical breach.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CNN anchor Chris Cuomo told his brother Andrew to resign as governor of New York this week during the fallout over the elder brother’s sex harassment scandal, a report said Tuesday.

The host of “Cuomo Prime Time” spoke to his sibling over the phone and explained that the governor could not survive the fallout from a report released last week by state Attorney General Letitia James, according to The New York Times.

James’ report described sexual harassment allegations against the three-term Democrat from 11 women — including nine current or former state employees.

Andrew, the Empire State’s 56th governor, resigned Tuesday, telling New Yorkers “the best way I can help now is if I step aside.”

Cuomo’s CNN colleague, “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter, confirmed the Times report during an awkward taping of an interview with Stephen Colbert on CBS’ “The Late Show.”

“I also have a source that says Chris was on the phone with his brother this week, urging him–,“ Stelter began before Colbert cut him off to ask: “Is your source Chris Cuomo?”

“He is not,” Stelter answered. “He is not. You gotta have boundaries, you gotta draw a line.”

“Why? He doesn’t,” Colbert shot back, to audible “ooooohs” from the audience.

The Washington Post reported late Monday that Chris Cuomo was one of a dwindling number of people the soon-to-be-former governor was in touch with as longtime allies left his administration and the state Assembly built an impeachment case.

Chris Cuomo has not fronted CNN’s 9 p.m. show since Thursday. He claimed to be taking this week off to mark his 51st birthday, which fell on Monday. Neither Cuomo nor his substitute hosts have touched on the Andrew Cuomo harassment scandal since the report was made public by James.

On March 1, after the first claims of sexual harassment were made against the governor, Chris Cuomo told his viewers that he could not cover the story “because he is my brother.” However, the report revealed that at the same time the anchor attempted to detach himself from his sibling’s scandal, he was sitting in on strategy sessions with a gaggle of Andrew Cuomo’s advisers, both from inside and outside the Executive Chamber.

Indeed, the day before the younger Cuomo made his earnest statement to viewers, the James report revealed, he sent an email to the governor’s other advisers with a proposed statement responding to the allegations that he appeared to have drafted or edited.

On May 20, after The Washington Post initially reported that Chris Cuomo had helped advise his brother on the response to the allegations, the CNN host addressed viewers again.

“I can be objective about just about any topic, but not about my family … I am fiercely loyal to them. I’m family first, job second,” he said at the time, later adding: “When my brother’s situation became turbulent, being looped into calls with other friends of his, and advisers that did include some of his staff, I understand why that was a problem for CNN. It will not happen again.”

In a separate statement that day, the network said it was “inappropriate” for their star anchor “to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor’s staff, which Chris acknowledges. He will not participate in such conversations going forward.”

A CNN spokesperson told The Post Monday night that the more recent conversations between Chris and Andrew Cuomo did not run afoul of any network policy.

“As both CNN and Chris have stated publicly, he cannot cover his brother, in part because we certainly expect them to speak,” the rep said. “He’s not joined any meetings nor acted in any official capacity since he apologized for doing so. That’s our expectation as we’ve said all along.”

Stelter defended his network’s much-criticized handling of Chris Cuomo Tuesday, calling the situation “the craziest set of circumstances you can imagine.”

“I talked to a lot of sources at CNN, and some said, ‘Yeah, this is really weird. I’m ticked off at Chris.’ Others said, ‘You know, I understand. You can’t pick who your family members are,’” he told Colbert. “So there was a wide range of opinions.”

Critics have called for Chris Cuomo to be disciplined or fired from CNN, describing his dual role as prime-time anchor and fraternal adviser to be a grievous breach of journalistic ethics.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CNN is facing fierce backlash after it emerged that star anchor Chris Cuomo was reportedly still advising embattled older brother, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, amid his sexual harassment allegation scandal — with some calling for the network to launch an investigation.

The prime-time personality was among a handful of people consulting Gov. Cuomo as he tried to salvage his career in the wake of last week’s bombshell report accusing him of sexually harassing 11 women, the Washington Post revealed on Monday.

Gov. Cuomo resigned from his position on Tuesday.

But the retaliation against CNN was swift, with critics declaring it was “utter madness” that Chris was supposedly still conferring with the governor.

Some went as far as calling for the network to investigate the CNN anchor.

It comes after reports first emerged in May that Chris had advised his brother and staffers to take a defiant approach as the accusations gained momentum.

CNN issued a statement at the time saying Chris would no longer engage in discussions with Gov. Cuomo’s staffers about the allegations — and Chris declared on air that he understood how it could be problematic for the network.

“When my brother’s situation became turbulent, being looped into calls with other friends of his and advisers that did include some of his staff, I understand why that was a problem for CNN. It will not happen again,” Cuomo said in May.

“It was a mistake, because I put my colleagues here, who I believe are the best in the business, in a bad spot. I never intended for that. I would never intend for that and I am sorry for that.”

Washington Post opinion writer Erik Wemple on Monday called for CNN to “commission a report of its own to determine just how its star anchor fit into this sexual harassment pushback effort.”

“This has got to be Chris Cuomo’s last day on the job come on,” writer Jonathan Katz tweeted.

Variety editor-at-large Kate Arthur simply tweeted: “Utter madness.”

Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean said in response to the report: “So yeah, this is a problem. @CNN.”

Journalist Zaid Jilani said Chris had a “conflict of interest” by maintaining his role as a CNN host.

Fox News contributor Joe Concha tweeted: “I agree, help your brother… But you can’t continue to go on television claiming you’re an objective anchor that covers the big stories because he didn’t cover the biggest story in the world last week.”

Concha was referring to how the younger Cuomo failed to mention the bombshell report by state Attorney General Letitia James during his show last week.

Andrew Cuomo made appearances on his brother Chris’ CNN show to tout NY’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Chris was mentioned four times in the 165-page report handed down by the attorney general last week.

It described Chris as one of several outside advisers who were “regularly provided with confidential and often privileged information” that impacted the government despite having no “formal role, duty, or obligation to the state.”

In past statements, CNN has said Chris Cuomo has not been involved in the network’s coverage of harassment allegations against his brother.

Chris had previously told CNN viewers that he could not cover the initial allegations of sexual harassment against the governor “because he is my brother.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@At least one person still supports Gov. Andrew Cuomo — his younger brother Chris.

The CNN host has been chatting with the embattled governor as he tries to salvage his political career following a bombshell report that detailed the numerous sexual harassment allegations made against him by staffers, according to The Washington Post.

Chris was suspiciously absent from his program “Cuomo Prime Time” on Monday. He claimed to have a planned vacation for his 51st birthday.

The younger Cuomo did not mention the report by state Attorney General Letitia James on CNN last week, despite handing the coverage to Don Lemon, who dove into the scandal.

Substitute host Michael Smerconish did not broach the topic when he sat in for Cuomo on Friday night, and Cuomo’s normal block Monday was given over to a documentary about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

In the report, which concluded that Cuomo had harassed 11 women — including nine current or former state employees — in violation of state and federal law, Chris Cuomo was described as part of a group of outsiders who were “given privileged and confidential information “and helped make decisions that impacted State business and employees—all without any formal role, duty, or obligation to the State.”

The AG’s report also included a statement apparently drafted or edited by Chris Cuomo for his older brother.

In March, Chris Cuomo told CNN’s viewers that he could not cover the initial allegations of sexual harassment against the governor, “because he is my brother.” When The Washington Post reported in May that the anchor was advising the governor on how to respond to the harassment allegations, Chris Cuomo told his audience that “I can be objective about just about any topic, but not about my family … I am fiercely loyal to them. I’m family first, job second.”

In the same soliloquy, the younger Cuomo said: “When my brother’s situation became turbulent, being looped into calls with other friends of his, and advisers that did include some of his staff, I understand why that was a problem for CNN. It will not happen again.”

On Sunday, CNN “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter told viewers Chris Cuomo had been given two instructions by his bosses: “One, that he can’t talk about his brother, Andrew Cuomo, on TV, and, two, that he cannot participate in any more strategy sessions with the governor’s aides.”

“I think Chris should be asked about all this,” Stelter added. “He should be grilled like anyone else. That’s what numerous staffers at CNN said to me this week. The logic on the part of management is that whatever Chris says about the allegations against his brother will be picked apart. He will be accused of either using his platform to spin for his family or he’ll be accused of betraying his brother.

“The logic is that he should just stay out of it,” Stelter said. “He should do the job that the viewers want him to do.”

On Sunday, Andrew Cuomo’s longtime right-hand woman, Melissa DeRosa, resigned after the report revealed she had sought to dismiss and discredit the governor’s accusers. Among other revelations, DeRosa admitted she had decided to release the personnel file of Lindsey Boylan — a Cuomo accuser and former aide — to certain media outlets in December after she consulted with other staffers.

The report also found that DeRosa helped circulate a proposed op-ed, originally drafted by Cuomo, that contained “personal and professional attacks” on Boylan, and later shared it with current and former Executive Chamber employees.

The Washington Post report Monday identified two other members of Cuomo’s shrinking inner circle as communications director Rich Azzopardi and lobbyist Charlie King, a longtime confidant.

A rep for CNN did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Post.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm on a rare illness that was previously only seen in tropical climates, particularly South Asia and northern Australia.

Now, two people are dead and two have recovered after being infected with melioidosis — a disease that had never before been detected on contiguous US soil. Melioidosis has now been seen in Georgia, Kansas, Texas and Minnesota, LiveScience reported. The only other known cases of melioidosis in the US were in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.

None of the four patients claimed to have traveled outside the country prior to becoming sick between March and July of this year.

The CDC “believes the most likely cause is an imported product (such as a food or drink, personal care or cleaning products or medicine) or an ingredient in one of those types of products,” according to the statement released Monday.

Investigators have taken more than 100 samples of soil, water and common products used in and around each patient’s home in order to discover a link between the four cases — but have found no common source thus far. However, genome sequencing of the bacteria has revealed that the four cases are likely somehow related, the CDC added.

About a dozen cases of melioidosis are seen each year in Americans, nearly all of which can be attributed to travel. This is the first time doctors are seeing the illness seemingly originate within the contiguous US.

Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, melioidosis can take several weeks to set in after exposure to the pathogen. Symptoms include cough and shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, intermittent fever and body rashes, the CDC wrote in a message to physicians on how to spot the illness.

Risk factors for developing the disease include diabetes, liver or kidney disease, chronic lung disease, cancer or another condition that weakens the immune system, the CDC warned.

One of the known cases of melioidosis — involving a 4-year-old girl — was recently publicized in Texas. Preschooler Lylah Baker had no known risk factors for the illness when she was sickened in May. Lylah spent a month in the intensive care unit of Children’s Medical Center Dallas, requiring a ventilator and eventually suffering brain damage, according to the Dallas Morning News.

“She was a healthy, typical little girl about to start pre-K in the fall — no underlying health issues previously. I mean just nothing,” Ashley Kennon, the child’s aunt, told the newspaper. “So it was definitely a major surprise to everybody not knowing where [the bacteria] came from.”

Lylah is convalescing at Our Children’s House Dallas.

The CDC is urging doctors to be aware of melioidosis symptoms regardless of their patients’ locations and travels.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Google has rolled out a new internal calculator to explain potential pay cuts to employees who choose to work remotely — and the early results suggests it will penalize its suburban staffers.

Screenshots obtained by Reuters show that Google employees who previously commuted an hour to Google’s Manhattan offices from nearby Stamford, Conn., for example, would see their salaries slashed by 15 percent if they choose to continue working from home.

By contrast, “Googlers” who live within NYC’s five boroughs and choose to work from home permanently would not see their pay slashed at all.

The screenshots also showed 5 percent and 10 percent differences for commuters living in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.

Google employees who move even farther away from the company’s offices have been warned they could face even harsher pay cuts. A worker who left San Francisco for Lake Tahoe, another expensive area of California, would have their pay cut by a whopping 25 percent.

That would mean an employee with a $150,000 salary would suddenly make less than $112,000 per year.

The calculator states it uses US Census Bureau metropolitan statistical areas, or CBSAs. Stamford, Conn., for example, is not in New York City’s CBSA, even though many people who live there work in New York.

News of the Google tool comes amid a broader debate at tech companies about remote work and compensation.

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have all warned employees who plan to leave expensive cities like New York and San Francisco that their pay will be slashed — while smaller tech companies like Reddit and Zillow say they’ll pay the same regardless of where employees live.

Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination, said Google’s pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely, including families.

“What’s clear is that Google doesn’t have to do this,” Rosenfeld told Reuters. “Google has paid these workers at 100 percent of their prior wage, by definition. So it’s not like they can’t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.”

Google, which has about 140,000 employees worldwide, took in $61.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of this year alone.

The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Post and did not address the Stamford commuter issue in a statement to Reuters.

“Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marissa Rohan — the Los Angeles Dodgers ball girl — has been dubbed a “hero” after she tackled a fan who ran onto the field during Sunday’s 6-1 win over the rival Angels.

Rohan, who reps a No. 93 Dodgers jersey on the field, got the job done after a number of security personnel couldn’t catch the intruder. Rohan has worked for the team since 2019, but Sunday’s fan take-down is believed to be her first-ever viral field moment.

Rohan has been reposting messages and support from others to her Instagram Story. She even joked that Sunday was a “rough day at work.”

“Yeah I am not going to stop talking about this lol,” she captioned a news story about her play on Instagram.

The 24-year-old is a senior at Cal State Northridge, pursuing a degree in deaf studies. She is a proud member of Alpha Phi sorority.

Rohan is a former gymnast and softball player, according to past posts on her public Instagram account — where she documents her relationship with boyfriend Justin Fallon, a ticket operations supervisor with the Dodgers.

When she’s not saving the day at Dodger Stadium, Rohan is like any other college student. She enjoys snowboarding, partying in Vegas, snapping the occasional selfie, and hitting the beach with friends.

Bottom line: Don’t try to get past the Dodgers ball girl.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kevin Nealon isn’t worried about getting canceled.

“I’m pretty woke on all that stuff,” the “Saturday Night Live” alum told Page Six. “I have a 14-year-old [son Gabe with wife Susan Yeagley]. In school, they really teach them well. So anytime I start going astray he says, ‘No, you’re kind of going in the wrong direction.'”

But the 67-year-old comedian allows that he’s never been one to push the envelope in his act.

“I wouldn’t want to offend anybody or insult anybody … My act has always been very appropriate,” he explained.

“I’ve never been a risk-taker as far as that was concerned. I’ve never been one of those edgy, ranting comics who just seemingly say what’s on their mind and sometimes get into trouble.”

Nealon began his career in stand-up, joined “SNL” in 1987 and stayed on for a then-record-breaking nine seasons, playing characters like Mr. Subliminal, the politically incorrect private investigator Frank Gannon and, of course, Franz (of weightlifting duo Hans and Franz) alongside Dana Carvey.

Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey as “Hans and Franz” on “Saturday Night Live.”

“It was striking gold just to be on that show because I was more of a stand-up than an actor or a sketch player,” he said adding that his favorite thing about being part of “SNL” was working with musical idols like Paul McCartney and James Taylor, who would sometimes stay and play a private mini-concert.

Since leaving “SNL,” Nealon has carved out a steady career in shows like “Weeds,” “Last Man Standing,” and a string of Adam Sandler movies. And in between stand-up appearance, he updates his YouTube series, “Hiking with Kevin,” in which he goes on hikes with various celebs.

The Connecticut-raised star is currently in the midst of a stand-up tour and says that audiences have been great.

“I was thinking that maybe I got funnier,” he quipped, “but I think people are happy to be out there and more grateful — they appreciate what they have now. They want to enjoy life again.”

Nealon is a talented caricaturist. Instagram

If he decides to quit stand-up, Nealon could very well become a professional artist. He often features his incredible caricatures on social media, explaining that he took a ten-class course via Skype during the COVID-19 lockdown.

His visual prowess spans multiple mediums as well: Nealon has another Instagram solely dedicated to his photos of his wife, “Parks and Rec” alum Susan Yeagley, at different locales throughout the U.S.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The woman who Claudine De Niro berated at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night for getting her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number tells us she was “scared” by the incident and feels “traumatized.”

As Page Six previously reported, De Niro —who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant allegedly yelling at a woman who got the “Jerry Maguire” actor’s digits.

Now we can reveal that the woman at the center of the conflict was Lieba Nesis, a Harvard-educated lawyer and writer. She tells us De Niro was “aggressive” and “harassing [and] berating” her for at least an hour.

Nesis, who runs with the elite Hamptons and New York City social crowd, tells us that she and Gooding Jr. have known each other for seven or eight years.

“Not well, but we always say hello,” she said.

She says the Oscar winner told her at the restaurant that he’s shooting a film in Miami in September and looking for a place to stay, so she told him that she owns property there that was going to be empty while he was in town. He put his digits in her phone to follow up, Nesis says.

But De Niro saw the exchange go down and lost it.

“His girlfriend goes, ‘Oh my God, what are you doing? That’s my boyfriend! You can’t take down the number,’ and she’s screaming ‘What the f-ck are you doing!” Nesis tells us. “So I started to explain and she was like, ‘You better stop doing that. That’s my boyfriend.”

“She was going on and on so I walked into the other room and thought, ‘Ok, this will simmer down. I come back in and she’s pointing at me and screaming across the room, ‘You better get out of here. You better leave this place.’ Everyone is staring at me.”

“She wasn’t screaming at the top of her lungs,” she added, “but it was very intimidating to me.”

“I really was scared,” she said, “I am not going to fight. I wasn’t expecting to go out and get in a fight. I am spending thousands a weekend to go to the Hamptons and get away from negative energy, I don’t want to do drama. I was like, I’m not going to engage and hopefully she will calm down but she didn’t.”

Nesis says she went into another room again and sat on a sofa to get away from the situation, but that De Niro followed her.

“She comes and stands right on top of me where I am sitting like, ‘You better get the hell out of here,'” Nesis says, adding that De Niro was “cursing me out.”

She says that no one stuck up for her, except for former “Real Housewives of New York” star Jill Zarin, who tried to get management to step in — but nobody from the restaurant intervened.

“The more I tried to explain [that] I was just trying to help, the angrier she got,” Nesis says. “She kept saying, ‘That is my boyfriend, I am a broker, why was I trying to take your business.’ I told her I am not, I am a Harvard-educated lawyer. But she would get angrier and angrier and more out of control.”

Nesis adds, “She was saying she’s a real estate agent and we’re foes, but I don’t know her. I have never met her. I didn’t know she was a real estate agent and I am not a broker. I was in a state of shock. It was out of hand.”

According to her LinkedIn page, De Niro has worked for real estate company Compass for four months. She previously worked at Prudential Douglas Elliman.

Gooding Jr., for his part, seemed to cut and run as things took a turn.

“In the beginning, he was trying to explain and then he just disappeared out of sight,” Nesis says. “I guess he saw she wasn’t going to be mollified … He was somewhere but he wasn’t confronting the situation.”

Nesis wound up leaving to get out of the situation when it allegedly became clear after an hour that De Niro was not going to let up.

She says she now fears another run-in.

“It’s a small circle. I like Bilboquet. It’s a lot of fun,” she says. “I am terrified to go there now. I am worried about seeing her. I was traumatized. I am non-confrontational.”

“It’s like, is she dangerous?” Nesis said. “I wasn’t sure. I felt like I was in danger. You can’t be safe anywhere, even in the Hamptons.”

When we texted De Niro for comment, she wrote in all caps, “Jill Zarin and Lieba are full of s–t,” before texting a few more things and quickly deleting them from WhatsApp, and then adding, “No comment.”

A source previously told Page Six that De Niro’s reaction wasn’t about jealousy over Gooding Jr., but about business. “It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

That source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

De Niro and Gooding Jr. have been dating since 2018, when Page Six first spotted the pair.

In 2019, De Niro was caught on camera berating Gooding Jr. at a bar in Miami, knocking bottles and glasses off the top of the bar before being removed by security. A lawyer for Gooding Jr., Mark Heller, said she got a “little overly playful” while partying with her beau. A source later said she was upset when the actor took a friend’s side over something she was upset about and “it was just a silly argument.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Any woman can be a magazine cover girl these days — if she’s willing to pony up the dough.

Juliet Amelia, a 45-year-old licensed massage therapist from Florida, looked like the hottest model around when she suddenly appeared on eight Playboy international editions — including Playboy Sweden, Playboy South Africa and Playboy New Zealand — during a 12-month period from 2018 to 2019.



Amelia — who now sells copies of these covers as well as other “uncensored images” on her website — also was splashed on the front page of British men’s magazine FHM in South Africa and Australia during the same period.



“Not even Pamela Anderson was on as many covers,” said Johnny Kortis, former editor and publisher of Playboy Slovakia.



Kortis claims Amelia would have added Playboy Slovakia to her collection except for the fact that he turned down a $10,000 offer by a photographer.

Playboy Slovakia is not for sale, said Kortis, who claims the practice was so rampant when he was running the magazine that he complained to headquarters, saying it was watering down the brand.



Playboy, which now only runs content online after dropping its print version last year, said it prohibits models from paying to appear in the magazine founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953.



“Playboy Enterprises does not condone the practice of charging models to be in our pages or those of our international editions,” said a Playboy spokeswoman. “This practice is counter to Playboy’s brand standards. We urge any model who has been approached to make us aware of the situation.”



Amelia didn’t return requests for comment.

Magazine covers are still jealously guarded terrain for editors of most US publications. But they are increasingly “for sale” in a shadowy overseas market where wannabe pinup girls are promised prime media real estate in exchange for a fee — often as much as $10,000, not including the cost of the wardrobe, makeup, shooting and editing, which is also paid for by the model.

Photographers often broker these transactions — collecting money from eager models and then shopping the glamor shots around to overseas versions of popular men’s magazines, sources said.

“Sometimes you pay the magazine these days and sometimes they do it for free depending on the girl, her social following, her looks and what’s going on in her life,” explained photographer Ryan Dwyer

If the model is the girlfriend of a famous athlete, “they will do it for free,” Dwyer said. “If she’s Lacy the stripper from Vegas, they want to get paid.”



The practice of models paying for placement has blossomed thanks in part to social media sites like Instagram, where all that matters is the appearance of success. A cyber “cover” can help aspiring influencers gain social media followers, which can then lead to forms of revenue, like brand sponsorships.

And with readership in sharp decline, some magazines can no longer afford to finance splashy shoots in exotic locales, or pay big bucks for the publishing rights of an undiscovered beauty.



“I used to get $7,500 for a cover, $3,500 for a spread for five or six pages,” Dwyer explained, referring to the good old days of magazine shoots.



“I used to work and see a random hot girl in a coffee shop. Back then, I’d supply clothes and makeup and hair and pay for it all and then sell it to the magazines. I wasn’t just picking up any girl. I knew I could sell it and that’s how I’d get paid,” he said.



As magazine “budgets started to dwindle,” Dwyer realized he could make more money churning out covers for women willing to pay for the privilege.

“Who doesn’t want to be on a cover of Maxim?” said Kaila Methven, who runs an LA-based lingerie company. DailyCeleb.com

“I went from shooting hot girls in London, UK and Rome to plastic-surgery chicks that wanted covers. I downgraded for sure quality-wise but financially [it] was the total opposite,” he said.

“Who doesn’t want to be on a cover of Maxim?” said Kaila Methven, who goes by the name Madame Methven and runs an LA-based lingerie company.



Cover girl for a “special travel edition” of Maxim South Africa in February 2018 and Playboy Mexico later that same year, Methven denies she ever paid for a cover. But the photographer behind her South Africa cover photo says the magazine didn’t hire him — Methven did.



“Her team reached out to me saying they wanted [me] to shoot her,” Irvin Rivera told The Post of Methven, who bills herself as a Kentucky Fried Chicken “heiress” since her family once owned a vast South African chicken farm that was a vendor to KFC.



At the end of the shoot, Methven paid for the photos she liked, including the one that landed her on the Maxim South Africa cover, he said.



Rivera said he wasn’t involved in getting the photo on the cover of the magazine. “She knows someone from there,” he said of Maxim South Africa.

Methven called the claims an attempt by Rivera “and his associates, to try and grab one last headline at my expense.”

“It is unfortunate that myself, and other hard-working women in the industry, are constantly criticized rather than celebrated for our accomplishments,” she said.

Another model who has graced the cover of Maxim South Africa ended up suing the parent publication, claiming she was duped into a pay-to-play scheme that resulted in her forking over thousands of dollars only to find out she was being placed on “fake” covers.



Russian-born Marina Pahomova, also known as Marina Pamo, claims she was lured into the alleged scheme by photographer Brian B. Hayes, who sold himself online as the exclusive photographer for Maxim Middle East and Maxim South Africa.



“Some magazines … will ONLY publish my photos on their covers,” he allegedly wrote on his Facebook page in 2016. “We are proud to provide FREE submissions for those models who book photoshoots with me.”



Hayes told Pahomova she would need to pay $2,000 for a photo session so he could present the right kind of photos to Maxim, the lawsuit said.

He then suggested a second photo session so Pahomova could have “other ‘looks’ for the other publications,” costing another $3,000.

After the second photo shoot was over, Hayes allegedly told Pahomova it would cost even more money to get her photos “on the cover and as a feature inside” Maxim magazine.

He directed her to wire $6,000 to his account and told her he was friends with the editor of Maxim South Africa, Dirk Steenekamp. He even sent her a screenshot of an allegedly pre-approved Maxim South Africa cover with Pahomova as the cover model, the lawsuit said.



Pahomova was able to buy print editions of her May 2016 Maxim South Africa magazine cover. But she claims she was also conned into paying her way onto a slew of “fake Maxims” that were allegedly being produced in Muslim countries that had banned the mag from appearing on newsstands.

In her lawsuit, she said she believes Hayes has duped “hundreds” of models over the years, and netted himself over $1.5 million.

“Maxim is defrauding the general public into spending money on purchases of fake Maxims along with defrauding models and commercial advertising that paid for placements in fake Maxims, resulting in damage in the amount of several million dollars,” the lawsuit said.

Maxim didn’t respond to requests for comment.

When The Post called Pahomova last year, she said the suit was settled and abruptly hung up the phone. Maxim appears to have never issued a formal response to the lawsuit, which was settled in February 2020, court records show.



Neither Steenekamp nor Hayes returned requests for comment about Pahomova’s claims. But in the settlement, Hayes also acknowledged that he charged her $6,000 for her Maxim cover and he gave her back the rights to the 2,000 photos he took of her.



Pahomova, meanwhile, was fined by the judge for not showing up to depositions, legal papers show.



Fitness model Paige Munroe took a “cover” image off her Instagram page when she learned the story behind it. Facebook



The practice of paying for covers is condemned by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which boasts members from the nation’s top glossy magazines.



“ASME’s position on covers for sale — on any content — is: Don’t deceive the reader,” said Sid Holt, CEO of the trade association.



Of course, many covers nowadays live only in the cyber world with no magazine pages — or readers — behind them. Models are often posing for nothing more than a digital mockup with the magazine’s logo, headline and model that they can post on social media, sources said.



Photographer Joel Alvarez outed this practice in 2019 when he railed on Facebook against a “mock cover” he claims he shot for Maxim France under then-owner Florent Carmin.



“Even though Maxim France never actually went into circulation it’s still nice to see my work on a mock cover,” Alvarez wrote. “But I’ve noticed a lot of [people] posting and even believing that Maxim France is an actual publication.”



Alvarez — known for his 2017 Black Tape Project, featuring beautiful women dressed in outfits made of skimpy, strategically placed strips of electrical tape — attached to his Facebook screed a Maxim France cover of fitness model Paige Munroe wearing a gold version of his electric-tape “bikinis.”



The bare-bones cover offers little more than a picture of Munroe, who boasts 102,000 Instagram followers, with a headline in French that translates roughly to: “The bombshell is the type to be respected.” The cover doesn’t even have a date.



Munroe told The Post she didn’t pay for her cover and was stunned when The Post informed her that there may have been no magazine pages behind it. She said she did the photo shoot in LA with Alvarez and Carmin, believing it was for a print edition of the mag.

“I’ve never paid for a publication in my life. If someone paid for something for me, I was not aware of that, nor would I ask them to do that,” Munroe said. The Maxim France “cover” was removed from Munroe’s Instagram page after The Post contacted her.

Carmin responded to Alvarez’s Facebook post by threatening legal action. “Kindly remove that post of [sic] your page,” he wrote, “or lawsuit will be filed.”

But when reached by The Post, Carmin said he is no longer in charge of Maxim France after getting heat from Maxim USA over the way he was running the business. He said his problems with the home office began shortly after The Post began contacting Maxim US with questions about his operation back in 2020.

In an interview, Carmin acknowledged that he did “very few” print editions of the magazine after landing the Maxim France license in 2018. He said he did lots of “digital covers,” often producing several “covers” in a single month.

Carmin also insisted he never took money directly from models to appear on his cyber covers. He only acknowledged being paid by “sponsors” of models.

In the case of Munroe, Carmin said he did the shoot as a “favor” to Alvarez, not in exchange for money.

In addition to the photos, Bella Baez shared her experiences with depression. Instagram



While the pay-for-play model of magazine covers can be exploitative, some women walk away feeling richer than ever — as was the case for Santa Monica-based fitness buff Bella Baez, who appeared on Maxim New Zealand’s cover in 2020.



The California native said she paid $12,000 to be featured on the cover and an inside spread that included an inspiring Q&A about “a broken heart,” and how it led her to get in the best shape of her life and compete in Miss Bikini competitions.



She said she paid $2,000 for the photo shoot with Hayes, the photographer named in the Pahomova suit. Another $10,000 was “for Maxim to get published and to get a page spread.”



Bella Baez partly financed her foray into Maxim by selling her valuable handbags.

And she doesn’t regret it for a second.

One reason is that it was cathartic. To pay for the cover and spread, Baez sold Chanel bags she got from the same ex-fiancé who sent her spiraling into depression after they broke up in 2016.

“It’s just materialistic things,” she said of the designer bags. “I wanted to share my story and I wanted to inspire people so that, to me, is worth more than a single bag.”

Maxim New Zealand didn’t return a request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nate Burleson is a crossover star to bet on because he is more skilled as a TV performer than he was as a football player.

That is not meant to be disrespectful about his career as an NFL receiver. After all, spending 11 years in the league is impressive. But with the Lions, for example, he was the No. 2 option after Calvin Johnson, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame this past weekend.

On TV, however, Burleson is quickly becoming Megatron. One day, he will likely lead a Super Bowl broadcast.

Burleson was named Wednesday as a host of “CBS This Morning.” He will remain as an analyst on the network’s “The NFL Today,” while adding more duties on Nickelodeon, which is also owned by ViacomCBS.

For good measure, he will still appear on NFL Network every now and then.

Burleson has not yet reached Michael Strahan’s heights. The former Giant is on the more popular “Good Morning America” and “Fox NFL Sunday.” But Burleson has a chance to do more — and maybe even become bigger than Strahan.

CBS, according to sources, already views Burleson as the heir apparent to “The NFL Today” host James Brown. Brown, 70, has given no indication that he plans to retire soon, but when he does, Burleson is expected to step to the lead chair.

That is significant because, besides the weekly show, it would mean Burleson would host a Super Bowl.

Nate Burleson AP

Burleson will still be on NFL Network on occasion, but will no longer appear daily on the fun and popular, “Good Morning Football.” He will not be easy to replace.

He called the “GMFB” crew of Peter Schrager, Kyle Brandt and Kay Adams a family. The foursome became early morning friends for viewers.

A couple of names that likely will be considered to replace Burleson on “GMFB” are DeAngelo Hall and Andrew Hawkins, according to sources.

Whoever gets the job will have to be as committed as Burleson and the crew. Morning shows are only for people who truly want to be on TV. Burleson did it, and now is moving to a larger morning stage.

Nate Burleson spent 11 seasons in the NFL. AP

With CBS, Burleson will also do more of the Nickelodeon games that led to such a success during last year’s wild-card showing. Burleson’s authenticity, which shined through on that broadcast, is what will likely make him a morning success.

Burleson had a nice NFL career. One year, he even had 1,000 yards receiving. But he was a possession guy.

The new deal means, however, that on the TV stage, Burleson is a No. 1 option and he just moved to another level.

The Premier League will kick off Friday in its final year of its current contract on NBC. The network has been using the soccer league to increase its Peacock subscriptions, but it will surely have major competition to keep the rights from ESPN+, Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video and network TV. NBC paid a reported $1.3 billion for six years on its current deal.

That number is expected to skyrocket and the desire to continue airing the Premier League was seen as a large reason why NBC did not retain the NHL.

For the subscription platforms, the Premier League is the most valuable among soccer because it is weekly from August through May, meaning subscribers would be retained — probably in most cases — for a whole year.

The Premier League’s depth also is protected from a situation that ESPN finds itself in after Lionel Messi this week left Barcelona to sign with Paris Saint-Germain.

ESPN just signed a long-term deal with La Liga and, if Messi had remained with Barcelona, you can be assured that his face would have been all over ESPN advertising the start of the season. Instead, there is no Messi and much less buzz.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Late-night host Trevor Noah is being mercilessly mocked for turning against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo just months after repeatedly declaring himself a “Cuomosexual.”

After the disgraced politician finally resigned Tuesday, Noah quickly tweeted that “New York has successfully flattened the perv.”

But rather than the expected laughter, his tweet instead just sparked a flood of followers reminding him of his earlier declarations of devotion to the scandal-scarred gov.

“This you?” asked Accuracy in Media, a site exposing media bias, one of many to share clips of “The Daily Show” host’s previous confessions.

One widely shared clip from April last year showed Noah, 37, calling Cuomo “the one governor who’s crushing it the most right now.”

“Yeah. People online are falling in love with him. And I’m not gonna lie. Those people include me. My Tinder profile now lists me as Cuomosexual,” Noah said.

Noah gushed over Cuomo more than a year ago. Comedy Central

Others re-shared an interview Noah gave Ellen DeGeneres the same month sharing his love.

“Everyone should be a Cuomosexual,” he told DeGeneres. “You should love a leader who engages the people and remembers that they’re serving the people.”

“Oh I like how quickly you turned against your crush,” one person teased the host, while another said, “We’re gonna file this under badly aged tweets…”

Cuomo misconduct accuser Anna Ruch is seen with him in 2019.

“Sit this one out, buddy,” another follower advised the host, while others told him, “You don’t get to slide from this that easy.”

Even Noah himself joined in the mocking, retweeting a March clip in which he conceded the error of his ways in so vigorously backing the handsy gov.

“I’ll tell you, man, all those people who praised Cuomo so highly last year, whew — those people really don’t look so smart now,” he said — pretending to shout off-camera, “Delete the f—ing tapes!”

Noah’s past praise of Cuomo came at a time when the now-disgraced governor had sky-high approval ratings. Comedy Central

“I mean, it must be so embarrassing, can you imagine if you’re one of those people?” he added, pretending to laugh — then again shouting off-camera, “Just burn them! I don’t give a s–t, burn them!”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Comcast’s NBCUniversal is postponing its return to office, citing a rise in breakthrough cases of COVID-19.

NBC had been planning a large-scale return to the office after Labor Day, but it is now moving the date to Oct. 18 “at the earliest,” the company said Wednesday. And the company will require employees, when they return, to be vaccinated.

According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, Comcast chief administration officer Adam Miller broke the news to employees via an internal email.

“Recent developments, including the rise in regional positivity rates due to variants and breakthrough cases, and guidance from medical experts and authorities have led us to the conclusion that we need to alter our approach,” Miller wrote, adding that fully vaccinated employees can return to the office on a voluntary basis now.

When employees finally return in October, NBC will require its US employees to be fully vaccinated, Miller said. The company will also require those employees to provide details of their vaccination status.

Many other US companies have reassessed their office reopening plans amid spikes in the infection rate due to the Delta variant. Media companies like CNN and Discovery have delayed their return-to-work plans to October, while the New York Times has postponed its return “indefinitely.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Country queen and “9 to 5” singer Dolly Parton has been working overtime again — at her upcoming book “Run, Rose, Run,” cowritten with author James Patterson.

The book marks the 75-year-old musician’s first novel — having already made her name as a 10-time Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, actress, television and film producer, theme park tycoon and humanitarian.

Like so many of Parton’s iconic songs, the story of “Run, Rose, Run” is about breaking free of convention and trauma. It follows Rose, a young woman who moves to Nashville to pursue her dream of making music, drawing on inspiration of her own past trauma.

“The source of her heart-wrenching songs is a brutal secret she has done everything to hide,” reads the plot from a press release sent to People. “But the past she has fled is reaching out to control her future — even if it means destroying everything she has worked for.”

“I cannot be more excited about the release of my very first novel ‘Run, Rose, Run’ with the great James Patterson,” Parton said in a statement. Representatives for Parton declined further comment to The Post.

“It’s been an honor — and a hell of a lot of fun — to work with the inimitable Dolly Parton, whom I’ve long admired for her music, her storytelling, and her enormous generosity,” said Patterson, 74, in his own statement.

Naturally, alongside the book, an eponymous album — featuring 12 songs “based on the characters and situations in the book” — will be released by Parton’s Butterfly Records.

“The mind-blowing thing about this project is that reading the novel is enhanced by listening to the album and vice versa,” added Patterson, the prolific author and creator of the “Alex Cross” series. “It’s a really unique experience that I know readers (and listeners) will love.”

The Post reached out to Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, a monthly book gifting program for children, about their founder’s latest literary accomplishment.

“While Dolly is quite a prolific author with two children’s books and several biography and inspirational books, it is exciting to see her working with James Patterson on this new project,” said Jeff Conyers, president of The Dollywood Foundation, in an emailed statement. “For over 25 years, Dolly has been helping grow the next generation of readers through her Imagination Library program, gifting over 163 million books to children early in life to help build the foundation for a lifelong love of reading.”

“Run, Rose, Run” (Little Brown) is available for pre-order now ahead of its March 7, 2022, release date.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nate Burleson is getting his broadcasting chance outside the sports world.

Burleson will join “CBS This Morning” alongside current co-hosts Gayle King and Tony Dokoupil starting next month. Burleson will replace CBS News’ Anthony Mason, who joined the network in 1986.

A former member of the Minnesota Vikings, Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions, Burleson is currently a studio analyst on CBS Sports’ “NFL Today,” and a co-host on NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football.” He is also a correspondent for “Extra.”

Burleson will leave “Extra,” and “Good Morning Football,” but will keep contributing to “NFL Today,” and the NFL Network.

“We started the show, it seems like forever ago, as friends. And now, five years later, we’re family. Not just here at the table, but everyone behind the scenes. Which is why this is tough to say right now I am announcing that I will be joining ‘CBS This Morning’ as a host.” Burleson said on “Good Morning Football.”

According to The Post’s Andrew Marchand, Burleson is considered the leading candidate to replace James Brown as the host of “NFL Today.” According to Marchand, Brown, 70, is not stepping away anytime soon. But, if he did, Burleson would be the next man up.

The 39-year-old first auditioned for the morning job in June when Dokoupil was on paternity leave, according to the LA Times. He filled in and impressed executive producer, Shawna Thomas, with his high energy. Eventually, they had discussions about Burleson joining full-time.

The former wide receiver joins Giants legend Michael Strahan as NFL players who will becoming morning show staples. Strahan has been a part of ABC since he joined “Live with Kelly and Michael,” in 2012. However, after a fallout with co-host Kelly Ripa, he left that show to become a regular contributor on “Good Morning America,” in 2016.

Burleson will join the program in September and be on air from 7-9 AM. He is also obligated to make multiple appearances on Nickelodeon – where he was the color analyst for the Nickelodeon telecast of an NFL wild-card game between the New Orleans Saints and the Chicago Bears in January.

“Nate is an extremely gifted broadcaster, interviewer and storyteller, whose deep curiosity and enthusiasm is the perfect fit for mornings on CBS,” Neeraj Khemlani, President and Co-head of CBS News and Stations said in a press release.

“His wide range of experience and interests – from news to sports, from music to poetry, and from fashion to cryptocurrency – provides a unique perspective that will deepen the show’s connection with our viewers. He excites audiences in every arena, and we’re fortunate to have Nate joining Gayle and Tony at the table in September.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AT&T is in talks to sell WarnerMedia’s popular celebrity gossip site TMZ to Fox, according to a report from The Information.

The move comes as AT&T has inked a $43 billion deal to spin off its WarnerMedia entertainment division to Discovery, owner of TLC, Animal Planet and HGTV.

Neither Fox nor AT&T/ WarnerMedia returned requests for comment.

Until that mega-deal closes — sometime in the middle of next year — the telecom giant is required to operate on a business-as-usual basis, the report said.

Over the course of the year, AT&T, led by CEO John Stankey, has focused on selling off non-core businesses to raise cash in order to pay down debt and make new investments in 5G technology.

Aside from the Discovery deal, this year alone, AT&T has sold its animé streaming business Crunchyroll to Sony for about $1 billion, and it spun off its DirectTV business, selling a 30 percent stake to private equity firm TPG.

In the case of TMZ, it isn’t clear if the gossip site was part of the Discovery deal and if there would be any adjustments in the deal terms as a result.

As for Fox, TMZ is already a known entity to the network. Its syndicated gossip show “TMZ on TV” airs on Fox stations. This is not the first time the Harvey Levin-founded tabloid gossip site has been rumored to be on the block. In 2017, there had been buzz that AT&T was mulling a sale of assets when it bought Time Warner.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The National Security Agency’s (NSA) inspector general said Tuesday that his office will look into claims by Fox News prime-time host Tucker Carlson that his identity was “unmasked” and illegally leaked to the media in retaliation for trying to arrange an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The statement from watchdog Robert Storch said his office was reviewing “recent allegations that the NSA improperly targeted the communications of a member of the U.S. news media.”

Carlson initially accused the NSA June 28 of monitoring his emails in an effort to find material that would force Fox to take his top-rated show, “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” off the air. That claim prompted a rare public denial from the agency, which stated that Carlson “has never been an intelligence target”.

On July 7, Axios reported that Carlson had reached out to “US-based Kremlin intermediaries” about a potential sitdown with Putin. Carlson confirmed the story on his program that night, claiming he had reached out to “a couple of people” he thought could help fix the interview. The host claimed he had told no one other than his show’s executive producer that he had sent the emails.

“I wasn’t embarrassed about trying to interview Putin,” Carlson said at the time. “He’s obviously newsworthy. I’m an American citizen, I can interview anyone I want, and I plan to. But still, in this case, I decided to keep it quiet. I figured that any kind of publicity would rattle the Russians and make the interview less likely to happen. But the Biden administration found out anyway by reading my emails.”

The host further claimed that a “whistleblower” had told him that the NSA planned to leak his emails to media outlets in an effort to “paint me as a disloyal American, a Russian operative (I’ve been called that before), a stooge of the Kremlin, a traitor doing the bidding of a foreign adversary.”

Late last month, cybersecurity news site The Record reported that an internal NSA investigation found Carlson’s name was revealed, or “unmasked,” after it was mentioned in “communications between two parties” that were under surveillance. The report noted that the NSA notified both the House and Senate intelligence committees of the internal probe’s findings.

The unmasking of a US citizen’s name can be requested by intelligence community officials with proper security clearance, provided they have a good reason. If the unmasking request is approved, the name is shared with the person who requested it. Leaking “unmasked” names to the media or otherwise making them public is illegal.

Storch said Tuesday that his office would examine “NSA’s compliance with applicable legal authorities and Agency policies and procedures regarding collection, analysis, reporting, and dissemination activities, including unmasking procedures, and whether any such actions were based upon improper considerations.”

“We are gratified to learn the NSA’s egregious surveillance of Tucker Carlson will now be independently investigated,” a Fox News spokesperson said. “As we have said, for the NSA to unmask Tucker Carlson or any journalist attempting to secure a newsworthy interview is entirely unacceptable and raises serious questions about their activities as well as their original denial, which was wildly misleading.”

The inspector general’s office can open an investigation on its own or in response to a request from lawmakers or others who have reported alleged wrongdoing.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday that the review “is an important step toward ensuring public confidence. It is important that this review is as transparent as possible so it doesn’t fuel further public suspicion and distrust.”

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called Carlson’s allegations the “latest right-wing attempt to damage our security services.”

“People like Tucker Carlson can’t help themselves,” Himes said. “They’re badly hurting our intelligence community with outright lies.”

More than 9,000 people’s identities were “unmasked” in 2020, according to an intelligence review published earlier this year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The infrastructure bill the Senate passed Tuesday discriminates against white people at every turn.

Americans are enthusiastic about spending money on physical infrastructure — bridges, roads, broadband. But this racist bill hands out jobs and contracts and locates projects based on race, not merit. Minority businesses and neighborhoods hold the inside track. If you’re white, you’re low-priority.

The bill includes grants to install solar or wind technologies and generate jobs in areas decimated by closing coal mines or coal-fired electric plants. Here’s the catch: When contractors bid, the bill says minority-owned businesses will get selected first. Bad news for small-time white contractors in depressed areas.

The same is true for the bill’s proposals to improve traffic patterns in cities. Contractors and subcontractors get priority only if they’re owned by minorities or women. White male business owners can take a hike.

Americans should be outraged — but not surprised. After all, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act, passed in March, also put into place an ugly system of discrimination against whites. It offered debt relief to black farmers, but not white farmers. Another provision offered billions in aid to minority-owned and women-owned restaurants, but told struggling restaurants owners who happened to be white men that they had to go to the back of the line.

The injustice was obvious. White male farmers and restaurant owners sued, claiming the anti-white provisions are unconstitutional. So far, these challengers are winning. In every case, federal judges have halted the race-based programs in the American Rescue Plan Act until the challengers have their day in court. Politico reported last week that Biden’s Justice Department may fold without a fight on the black-farmer debt relief cases, because the law isn’t on the administration’s side.

You would think Democrats and the Biden White House would get the message. Instead, they’re doubling down on rigging legislation and divvying up taxpayer dollars to benefit minorities and shortchange whites.

Chances are high the infrastructure bill’s hodgepodge of anti-white discrimination will be struck down by federal courts. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution bars government from trying to even the score by discriminating against whites and in favor of minorities. The justices warned against creating “a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations” to correct past injustices. That’s precisely what this infrastructure bill does.

The bill’s backers would have you believe that obsolete airports, dilapidated public works and deteriorating roads and public spaces are evidence of racial injustice. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY) rails that “our infrastructure is racist” and calls on the Congress to pass a bill that “puts the needs of underserved and disadvantaged communities at the fore.”

That’s code for minority communities. But the truth is, there are plenty of poor white people in this country, too, and poor, predominantly white communities that could benefit from a bold federal infrastructure initiative. Race and ethnicity should have nothing to do with it. Locate the projects and put the funds where the economic need is greatest, regardless of race.

West Virginia has the lowest average income in the nation and ranks 46th in internet connectivity. Maine ranks 36th out of 50 states for income, and 34th in broadband connectivity. People in these states could really benefit from federal broadband assistance. Here’s the hitch: The infrastructure bill tilts the grant scale in favor of states with high minority and non-English-speaking populations, instead of considering only economic need and existing broadband capacity. Because Maine and West Virginia are 94 percent white, they’ll get less.

Polls show that Americans favor fixing roads, bridges, tunnels and airports. They know that good infrastructure promotes economic growth. But they’ve been kept in the dark about the fine print in the bill. Under the guise of upgrading the nation, the bill unfairly treats whites like second-class citizens.

A German nurse is being investigated for allegedly injecting thousands of people with a placebo instead of the coronavirus vaccine.

Based on witness testimony, police investigator Peter Beer said there was “a reasonable suspicion” that the rogue medical professional had administered shots of saline solution to up to 8,600 patients who were slated to receive the COVID jab, Reuters reported.

“I am totally shocked by this episode,” Sven Ambrosy, a local councilor, said of the alarming switcheroo, which reportedly occurred in March and April in Friesland in northern Germany.

It’s unknown why the shot-blocker — reportedly a Red Cross nurse — had injected people with blanks; however, she had reportedly broadcast anti-vax views on social media, investigators reported.

And while the faux jab was harmless, it may have disproportionately affected elderly people, who are at a greater risk of contracting the virus.

In order to prevent casualties from the fake shots, authorities are imploring thousands of people to get a second jab.

“The district of Friesland will do everything possible to ensure that the affected people receive their vaccination protection as soon as possible,” Ambrosy wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post.

Unfortunately, the nurse isn’t the first medical practitioner to express anti-vax views. In June, a Texas hospital suspended 178 employees for two weeks without pay for refusing to get the coronavirus vaccine.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.

Imitation isn’t always the sincerest form of flattery — at least when it comes to the morning TV wars.

After news broke on Wednesday that “CBS This Morning” was replacing veteran journalist Anthony Mason with former football star and “Extra” correspondent Nate Burleson, several industry insiders told us the network is admitting they’re in trouble by copying rival “Good Morning America.”

And it doesn’t help that the CBS show also announced in May it’ll be filming from a new studio directly across the street from “GMA” in Times Square.

”They’re basically copying ‘GMA.’ They’re moving to Times Square, hiring a [Michael] Strahan. What’s next? Cooking segments? They’re clearly in trouble,” one industry source sniped.

Meanwhile, another source told us that “GMA” staffers are “all shook over why CBS is copying them. It’s all the talk this morning at ABC,” they said.

The move comes as ratings for NBC’s “Today” — once the top of the morning show heap — continue to lose ground to “GMA.” This season-to-date, “GMA” is reportedly the most-watched morning show for the 9th consecutive year, and has this year increased its lead over “Today” to its biggest in four years. (Though “Today” did add viewers during its Olympics broadcasts.)

“CBS This Morning” remains at the bottom.

An ABC insider admitted there was buzz around the news, but “‘shook’ is not the way to describe it,” the source said. “Look at the numbers. Do you think ‘GMA’ would be threatened by CBS?”

CBS’ Strahan-like hire is “taking a page from the playbook. It’s an interesting move for them,” they added.

Another person from a competing network scoffed, “This is the same show [that] put out a statement about not wanting to [have anchors] dress up for Halloween! They planted a stake on Halloween as opposed to having fun, and now a football player is at the table? ‘Real Sports’ wasn’t hiring? It’s insulting to journalists.”

Burleson’s hire comes after former president of ABC-owned television stations Wendy McMahon fled the network to become president and co-head of CBS News and TV stations earlier this year.

“It’s interesting that they’ve put an ABC person in place over there, and she’s running the show. I commend them for recognizing a winning playbook and stealing it, but it could be a recipe for disaster,” the ABC source said.

Another source familiar with Burleson’s hire told us “they were grooming him” to take over after he filled in while co-anchor Tony Dokoupil was away on paternity leave. “Hollywood and this business only find value in former NFL players right now. It’s the Strahan effect. It’s not even a subtle trend,” they said.

In addition to co-anchoring “CBS This Morning,” Burleson’s overall deal will include a role as an analyst at CBS Sports’ “The NFL Today” and regular appearances on Nickelodeon, according to Variety. He’ll join Gayle King and Dokoupil at the table in September.

Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations, described Burleson as the “perfect fit for mornings on CBS” in a press release.

“There is no doubt that Nate’s experiences and broader interests in news, sports and entertainment will be an exciting addition to the table with Gayle and Tony as we continue to evolve the format of the broadcast to double down on news, original reporting, great storytelling and a broad range of feature pieces that appeal to viewers across the country,” he said in an internal memo.

It’s the haves and the … have-some-mores.

The swanky Aman Resorts — where rooms average $1,400 a night and villas go for $50,000 — is offering 100 people the chance to buy an Aman Club membership as it opens a New York location on 57th Street with a members-only space.

For $100,000 initiation fee and $15,000 a year, members will have access to a 24/7 “private office,” which will take care of all travel planning “from facilitating private charters by land, sea, and air, to pre-planning unique experiences across Aman resorts,” as well as upgrades, lax check-in and check-out times, on-demand spa treatments, and access to a private club space, according to a presentation and pricing sheet seen exclusively by Page Six.

Members, which they have dubbed “Founders,” “can expect privileged access to global sporting events, fashion weeks and behind-the-scenes visits to artists’ studios,” it states.

It will also go beyond a guest’s hotel stay. “At home — beyond the resorts, this bespoke support is offered for individual wellness programs to private event planning with our ‘Aman at home’ experiences.”

The membership plan outline explains, “Experts in nutrition, health and fitness will create entirely bespoke, constantly evolving programs for Founders, offering ongoing support and guidance as their wellness journey progresses both on- and off-property.”

The annual dues are required to be paid before the hotel’s NYC opening. According to the website, the new hotel, on 57th Street in the Crown Building, will offer 83 rooms, a “Garden Terrace & Bar,” a three-floor spa, as well as a jazz club and a members-only space.

The membership applies to both the NYC club and global properties.

Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, the Kardashians, Angelina Jolie, David Beckham, George and Amal Clooney, Tom Hanks, and members of various royal families are fans of Aman, which has over 30 properties in 20 countries.

The chain, owned by Russian billionaire Vladislav Doronin, also plans on opening Tokyo and Miami locations.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CBS shocked the news biz when it announced former football player and “Extra” correspondent Nate Burleson would replace longtime journalist Anthony Mason on “CBS This Morning.” But multiple insiders tell Page Six that Gayle King was one of his biggest advocates.

“Gayle is a huge fan of Nate, and she has more clout than people realize,” one source said.

Another told us King was a “proponent of Nate and was instrumental behind the scenes to make [the deal] happen.”

Sources previously told us Burleson was “being groomed” when he tested out for the spot in June while filling in for Tony Dokoupil, who was on paternity leave. “The morning [shows] are about chemistry, and Gayle clicked with him. That’s hugely important in the mornings,” a third source said.

A CBS spokesperson told us there’s no validity to King influencing the network’s decision to hire Burleson.

“This isn’t true. Leadership in news and sports drove this entirely,” they said.

Another CBS insider insisted “talent was not a part of this,” and said the hire was because of executives Neeraj Khemlani and Shawna Thomas.

“He was electric when he filled in on the show, and Gayle, like everyone else, is excited he’s joining,” they said.

Meanwhile, Drew Barrymore, whose daytime show is on CBS, had also filled in at one point, signaling an “identity crisis” for a morning show that prides itself on rebuffing fluff for hard news.

“It’s a disaster. they keep going back and forth, trying to figure out who they are. They’re having an identity crisis. They are real far behind in third place [in the ratings], and they haven’t been able to get it together since Charlie [Rose was fired],” the second source said.

The third source told us that CBS is desperately trying to recreate the magic King, Norah O’Donnell and disgraced Rose had while “trying to make the show feel younger and more relevant” by hiring Burleson.

“Gayle, Norah and Charlie got so many accolades. The numbers were going up. It was a real bright spot, and then it all fell apart,” the source said. “Gayle had to carry Tony and Anthony Mason to make that show work. No one ever thought that trio was going to match Gayle, Norah and Charlie.”

Burleson joining the team is “a really bitter pill to swallow at CBS News” for other on-air talents, who have jumped from market to market, according to the third insider. “This guy hasn’t done that, but lands one of the best jobs in television — an anchor chair at the third-place morning show is still one of the most coveted.”

It’s probably not the last we’ve heard of any behind-the-scenes scuttlebutt over the new hire. “You’ll hear about it pronto if he starts rubbing people the wrong way. CBS is so leaky,” a source warned.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@MSNBC’s star anchor Rachel Maddow is reportedly mulling leaving the network to launch her own media company amid “heated” contract negotiations.

Maddow, 48, is said to be “seriously considering leaving the network when her contract ends early next year,” according to The Daily Beast, which cited six sources.

The network’s highest rated host has increasingly spoken about leaving MSNBC when her contract is up, and is unlikely to go to a rival news network, according to the report.

Maddow, who has hosted “The Rachel Maddow Show” since 2008, is said to be interested in streaming and podcasting, which would allow more time for her personal life in the absence of rigorous nightly television deadlines, the article said.

Though Maddow has held talks about splitting from the cable news channel, she may ultimately decide to stay put, sources told CNN Business.

Some media observers think that the liberal icon is unlikely to leave MSNBC, and could be using reports about her own possible media ventures as a negotiating ploy in her contract negotiation.

Maddow, who reportedly earns $7 million a year, has reportedly enlisted top Hollywood agents Ari Emanuel and Mark Shapiro to represent her in contract talks.

“Nothing has been decided. We are deep into it with NBCUniversal and Rachel has an excellent relationship with them,” Shapiro told The Daily Beast.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sometimes the facts are stranger than fiction — and sometimes the facts are plagiarized.

The co-founder of myth-debunking website Snopes has been exposed as a plagiarist, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation.

David Mikkelson, who launched Snopes in 1995 with a mission to be “the internet’s definitive fact-checking site,” was suspended by his company, Doreen Marchionni, Snopes’ VP of editorial and its managing editor, confirmed to BuzzFeed, after their reporters uncovered no less than 54 plagiarized articles by Mikkelson.

“Let us be clear: Plagiarism undermines our mission and values, full stop,” Marchionni said in a statement on Friday. “It has no place in any context within this organization.”

In response to the investigation, Mikkelson said, “There is no excuse for my serious lapses in judgement. I’m sorry.”

BuzzFeed wrote that Mikkelson’s Snopes posts contained phrasing — even entire paragraphs — lifted from outlets such as the New York Times, CNN, the Guardian, the LA Times and the BBC between 2015 and 2019, often under the byline “Snopes staff” or while using the pseudonym Jeff Zarronandia.

“Zarronandia” was illustriously described in his Snopes bio as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and someone talented at “mule-skinning,” whose seemingly informed stories on everything from arts and culture to national politics had in the past drawn ridicule from the likes of former Donald Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone, BuzzFeed said.

David Mikkelson founded Snopes.com with then-wife Barbara Hamel in 1995, billing the site as “the internet’s definitive fact-checking site.” David Mikkelson

Snopes’ reporters have also jointly issued a statement, writing that they “strongly condemn these poor journalistic practices,” adding that they “work hard every day to uphold the highest possible journalistic and ethical standards.”

As of late Friday, Snopes had retracted 60 articles and disable advertisements on those webpages, according to the New York Times, and will continue making retractions as they conduct their own internal investigation. The company was said to have already flagged 140 articles for review.

One such cribbed passage, written by Jon Schuppe for NBC News, appeared on Snopes.com under Mikkelson’s own byline: “Muhammad Ali, the silver-tongued boxer and civil rights champion who famously proclaimed himself ‘The Greatest’ and then spent a lifetime living up to the billing, is dead.”

Mikkelson attempted to explain for his crimes in an interview with BuzzFeed. “I didn’t come from a journalism background,” he told them. “I wasn’t used to doing news aggregation. A number of times I crossed the line to where it was copyright infringement. I own that.”

Mikkelson insists that Zarronandia was created as a “stress-relief thing” during the fraught 2016 presidential election, when the concept of “fact-checking” became an ethical beacon for some, and a political bane to others.

“Let’s have some fun and watch these people vent their spleen inventing reasons why this nonexistent persona is biased,” he said.

However, insiders revealed to BuzzFeed that Mikkelson’s habit was driven by a need to drive traffic to the website — by being one of the first sites to rehash the most trending news headlines.

“He would instruct [writers] to copy text from other sites, post them verbatim so that it looked like we were fast and could scoop up traffic, and then change the story in real time,” Snopes’ former managing editor Brooke Binkowski told BuzzFeed. “I hated it and wouldn’t tell any of the staff to do it, but he did it all the time.”

The revelation comes in the aftermath of the heated divorce between Mikkelson and Snopes’ co-founder Barbara Hamel in 2015, which led to Hamel’s share of the company being sold to tech firm Proper Media. In 2017, the company filed suit against Mikkelson, claiming he’d mismanaged Snopes’ finances — and at the same time Mikkelson launched his own GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the website.

If you’ve got it, flaunt it — and Blake Lively definitely does.

The 33-year-old actress promoted her husband Ryan Reynolds’ new movie, “Free Guy,” with a cheeky Instagram pic on Thursday.

Lively posed poolside in a floral thong bikini for the saucy shot, quipping in her caption, “Go see @freeguymovie this weekend or you’ll be bummed.”

Reynolds, 44, promptly reposted the photo to his own Instagram Story.

Lively also supported her hubby at the “Free Guy” premiere last Wednesday, clad in a backless pink sequin gown by Prabal Gurung featuring sexy cutouts that framed her famous curves.

“What a huge night for #FreeGuy. And what a huge night for @blakelively because this means we’re Instagram official,” the “Deadpool” actor joked on Instagram after the event. “I know how important that was to her.”

Despite the New York City premiere marking the couple’s first red carpet outing in a year and a half, Lively and Reynolds have been keeping fans in the loop about their life at home during the pandemic.

The pair share three daughters: James, 6, Inez, 4, and Betty, 1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was not the kind of green light hitters want to see.

With the Mets and Dodgers tied in the top of the ninth inning Friday in front of a season-high 38,395 at Citi Field, a green light flashed onto Max Muncy’s face, halting play for a few minutes.

Muncy, batting with a runner on second and two out, collected himself before an 0-2 pitch against Edwin Diaz, but before he stepped into the box, his face turned green.

“Come on, jeez,” Ron Darling said on PIX11. “That’s just awful.”

Muncy immediately pointed left and the umpires conferred for several moments. There was no resolution, so Muncy stepped back into the box, and Diaz struck him out to end the inning. The light was not seen again.

“We don’t want that happening in a baseball game. Player safety — everyone’s safety — is always our priority,” said Mets manager Luis Rojas, who was not sure after his team’s 6-5, 10-inning loss if the culprit had been found. “I thought it might have been the best crowd of the season, so for that to happen, it’s just something that you don’t want to see.”

The scene was similar to an incident during a July game at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Red Sox, when a red light began flashing. An MLB investigation found no evidence of a rules violation by either team.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“American Idol” star Syesha Mercado is raising her voice against the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office after they seized her 10-day-old baby daughter in a harrowing moment captured in a now-viral video.

This is the second child that authorities have “forcefully and legally kidnapped” — as she describes it — under unclear circumstances in the past five months from the 34-year-old Sarasota, Florida native, who finished in the top three during the seventh season of TV’s long-running singing competition.

Deputies surrounded an SUV that Mercado, her newborn baby and her partner, Tyron Deener, were driving in Wednesday morning to conduct a surprise roadside welfare check, as captured in disturbing footage with more than 2.1 million views as of Saturday afternoon. Police then took custody of the infant to bring her to a hospital for a physical, presumably due to prior — still hotly disputed — allegations of malnutrition concerning the couple’s then 13-month-old son.

Mercado and Deener, 36, posted the incident on Instagram with the caption, “THEY TOOK OUR BABY AGAIN!.” The hour-long video shows multiple police vehicles flashing lights while two male deputies serve the couple with a court order to turn over their baby.

“Do you not feel anything? You guys, I’m human. This is my baby. My babies is days old — and you’re taking my baby away from me,” a crying Mercado can be heard saying in the chilling clip before starting to sob as four female child protective services caseworkers stand their ground.

The singer-actress — who starred in Broadway’s “The Book of Mormon” in 2014 — and Deener attempt to explain to authorities that they are “compliant and following every law,” adding that their daughter had already been seen by physicians just a day prior.

“You are traumatizing my baby. How could you guys do this?,” a distraught Mercado screams as her daughter is taken from her arms and placed alone in the back seat of a city vehicle. “… You have no heart. This is so wrong. I have the key to this city … I’ll hold it together. I’m strong.”

Mercado was indeed presented a key to the city of Sarasota during her “American Idol” hometown visit on May 9, 2008, which was proclaimed “Syesha Mercado Day” by local officials. She eventually finished third behind David Archuleta and that season’s winner, David Cook, on the show. She went on to headline the 2009-2010 national tour of “Dreamgirls,” which launched at Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater, opposite future 2021 Tony nominee Adrienne Warren, who stars as Tina Turner in “Tina” on Broadway.

A decade later, Mercado had to breastfeed her crying baby and provide authorities with a bottle of breast milk on the shoulder of a busy road, The Root reported.

The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office and Florida Department of Children and Families have not responded to The Post’s repeated requests for comment. The last listed professional representative for Mercado said “she’s not really working right now” but expressed concern about her situation. Attempts to contact her directly have been unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, her infant is still in protective custody, according to activist Donisha Prendergast, 36, founder of the We Have the Right to be Right social justice organization, who is advocating for the couple.

Five months earlier, Mercado and Deener’s 1-year-old son, Amen’Ra, also was placed into the system after Mercado’s breast milk supply started to run dry, and the boy would not accept other fluids, FOX Tampa Bay reported at the time. They took Amen’Ra to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg on Feb. 26 for help.

While there, Prendergast’s organization alleges that the little boy was examined by Dr. Sally Smith, the controversial subject of a 2020 USA Today Network investigation after she was accused of being “too quick to diagnose child abuse,” which Smith has denied. Investigators reviewed hundreds of Smith’s cases and found more than a dozen instances where charges were later dropped — but the caregivers names were left irreparably smeared forever.

Dr. Smith did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Almost two weeks after Amen’Ra was admitted, CPS and armed Pinellas County Police officers reportedly ordered Mercado and Deener out of the hospital amid allegations of “trespassing” and “severe malnutrition.” Their son was discharged in late March and immediately transferred by CPS into foster care.

During the ongoing fight to get their son back, the couple asked that all caseworker interactions be facilitated through their lawyer, said Deener, a youth service professional who works in the foster care system. When CPS investigators showed up at their home upon learning Mercado gave birth to her daughter without alerting them, they were refused entry and referred to said attorney. That’s when the agency reportedly received approval to conduct a welfare investigation and remove their newborn.

“My baby is healthy and happy,” a desperate Mercado is heard telling them during the roadside seizure. “All you had to do was call the attorney. We have all the paperwork.”

Prior to this week’s events, the parents had launched a GoFundMe — titled “The Legalized Kidnapping of Black Babies Through CPS” — and more than $327,000 has been raised as of Saturday, surpassing their posted $200,000 goal to cover legal bills.

“I am a pregnant, breastfeeding mama who went to the hospital with the intention to get my [son], Amen’Ra, some fluids while transitioning from extended breastfeeding to being bottle-fed,” Mercado’s crowd-sourcing campaign pitch reads. “On March 11 … Amen’Ra was forcefully and legally kidnapped from us by CPS, who claim we refused a B-12 shot that was a matter of life and death, which is an absolute lie.”

However, authorities did tell local media outlets that medical staff reported Mercado and Deener for turning down a B-12 intramuscular shot, as recommended by hospital doctors, a claim that Mercado adamantly denies.

“We never refused a B-12 shot, and at no point was he on the verge of death,” she said before her second child was taken into custody. “Our [son] has since been placed with a white foster family without interviewing qualified relatives or friends of our family for placement while they investigate. We are given limited information and presently only have weekly zoom visitation for an hour with … no court order stating these visitation limitations.”

Mercado has vowed to keep fighting.

During her time on “AI,” The Post took note of her survival skills: “In the ‘Idol’ dictionary under ‘drama’ lies Syesha’s week in Hollywood. The uber-talented singer spent the whole week on vocal rest to overcome a strained throat, cold and myriad of other complications. But when time came to fight for her spot in the competition, one of the most determined contestants in show history knocked it out the box.”

Timing is everything in life.

Sandra Lee has gotten engaged to her boyfriend Ben Youcef, and the beaming couple hit the town in Paris to celebrate, with a besotted Lee showing off her dazzling new engagement ring, multiple sources sources told The Post.

Photos of the lovebirds reveal that Lee, the former girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and her hunky beau have made it official — as there was no mistaking the significance of a giant jewel on Lee’s left ring finger.

Youcef, an interfaith leader, actor and producer, sported a band on his wedding finger.

Lee was seen sporting the sizable new bling just days after Cuomo announced his resignation following a series of scandals — and a damning report by state Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of sexually harassing several women — that have plagued his third term as governor.

Lee and Youcef bolted to the City of Love after she was left devastated by the events of the past week, when Cuomo resigned as governor amid a sex harassment scandal, Lee’s friends said.

The two could be seen outside Parisian hotspot L’Avenue on Saturday night, sharing an embrace before heading in for dinner.

Lee, a 55-year-old lifestyle guru, wore a white summer dress while Youcef, 46, had on jeans, a leather jacket and a white T-shirt emblazoned with the logo “Fear of God.”

A source close to Youcef told The Post: “Ben really wanted to distract Sandra from all the news, so he whisked her away to Paris. He knows how hard this has been on her and he wants to make sure she feels loved and supported.”

The source added: “Ben is incredibly protective of Sandra. They’re soulmates and head over heels in love.”

The pair traveled to Paris after spending time in St. Tropez in the South of France.

Lee and Cuomo never got engaged during their 14 years together, although she was married previously to former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz from 2001 until 2005.

The source said their friends have been rooting for them since they met in the spring in Los Angeles.

As The Post reported, Lee has felt “betrayed” by Cuomo, most recently for what she claims was him taking credit for legalizing same-sex marriage in New York during his resignation speech when she was the one who urged him to push the legislation forward.

Cuomo’s cheating during their relationship, which he denied, was considered an “open secret,” former Cuomo staffers told The Post in April.

She met Youcef after moving to Malibu, Calif., and leaving behind the home she shared with Cuomo.

She solidified her move to the West Coast after selling her Mount Kisco home — named “Lily Pond” — for $1.85 million last October.

Youcef, a divorced dad of two, was discovered by Steven Spielberg and went on to appear in his 2005 movie “Munich.”

He has since appeared in a number of TV shows.

A rep for Lee declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rams and Chargers fans commemorated their return to SoFi Stadium with a massive brawl on Saturday.

A viral video showed a male Rams fan in an Aaron Donald jersey being pummeled by at least four others in the stands of the stadium shared by the two Los Angeles teams.

The melee, which left the fan in the Donald jersey bloodied, lasted nearly a minute.

The beginning of the video showed the fan in the Donald jersey arguing with another Rams fan. An unidentified woman in the back then threw beer on the fan in the Donald jersey, leading him to throw what appeared to be the first punch.

It’s unclear what exactly sparked the altercation and whether there were any arrests.

The Week 1 preseason game, which the Chargers won 13-6, marked the return of NFL fans amid the pandemic.

There’s no crying in casting.

Oscar-nominated actress Debra Winger quit the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own” because Madonna was cast in the women’s baseball dramedy.

According to the Telegraph, Winger was starring in the role of Dottie, which was eventually taken over by Geena Davis.

Serious actress Winger even trained with the Chicago Cubs for three months, but when director Penny Marshall cast Madonna, Winger felt Marshall was making fluff — “an Elvis film.”

“The studio agreed with me because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract. In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court,” she told the Telegraph.

She added, “As entertaining as [the finished film] was, you don’t walk away going, ‘Wow, those women did that.’ You kind of go, ‘Is that true?’”

She said the other stars didn’t train as much as she did, but Davis “did OK.”

“I certainly don’t begrudge any of them,” said Winger, 66.

As far as Madonna’s performance? “I think [her] acting career has spoken for itself,” Winger reportedly said.

Davis went on to get a Golden Globe nomination for the role, while Madonna picked up a nomination for Best Original Song. The film also stars Tom Hanks and Rosie O’Donnell.

Winger, most famous for her roles in “An Officer and a Gentleman” and “Terms of Endearment,” also spoke about quitting Hollywood back in 1995.

“I stopped because I ceased being challenged,” she said, adding that playing the supportive wife and mother got “pretty boring.”

Over the years, the actress has come back for various indie films like 2008’s “Rachel Getting Married.” Most recently, she acts in Apple TV+’s “Mr. Corman.”
