With each step now, with each cut now, with each wheel route he runs now, with each passing day now, the sight of Saquon Barkley looking more and more like Saquon Barkley, feeling more and more like Saquon Barkley, makes the hearts of Giants race and sing.

When there is a bounce in No. 26’s step, there is a bounce in every Giants’ step.

They are all sick and tired of the agony of defeat, from the owners on down, and it is a triumphant return to the playing field by Saquon Barkley nearly one year after his devastating torn ACL that will send a jolt of electricity through the entire organization.

Removed from the PUP list at last, a grueling rehab still in progress, the Giants can suddenly dream the sweet dream of getting their dawg back on the field for Week 1. And Barkley can dream now, too. “You’re definitely hopeful,” he said.

On a hopeful Monday afternoon: One small step for Saquon, one giant leap for Giantkind … eventually.

As desperate and as famished as the Giants are to make their fans proud again, to be Giants again, they will continue to err on the side of precaution and do right by their franchise running back, and no one will complain.

The Giants, common sense would tell you, aren’t interested in any fleeting Willis Reed moment of inspiration.

They’re interested in Barkley chasing the “gold jacket” career that GM Dave Gettleman envisioned when he stiff-armed the analytics crowd and made Barkley the second-overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft.

It is why they must keep him in mothballs until the games begin to count … or until the designated time when Barkley no longer has to be protected from himself.

Judge was asked if he would be all right playing Barkley in a preseason game.

“Theoretically, yeah,” he said. “Yeah, I am, absolutely.”

Judge referenced his time in New England and added: “And to be honest with you, I’ve had experience with this. Look, there was a day I had to walk in and tell Josh Gordon, Demaryius Thomas and Julian Edelman, ‘Hey, all three of you are going to play against the Giants in preseason Game 4 because you haven’t done anything competitively in training camp.’ ”

I believe that when push comes to shove, Judge will say to hell with that theory.

Rams head coach Sean McVay said a couple of days ago that there is “zero chance” his new quarterback, Marthew Stafford, will play in the preseason. Bingo!

“The thing is, before you get hit in the first game at full speed when the speed does elevate, we want to go out there and just get you used to the tempo of the game, the pace of the game. Get you a catch, get you hit, get the feel of being tackled,” Judge said. “So, am I looking to put Saquon into something that’s not going to be in his best interest? Absolutely not, but at some point the doctors say, ‘He’s ready to play,’ and if we have the opportunity to get him in at a certain point, we will. But I’m not going to press that timetable.”

Good. It would be folly to press it. Barkley is the franchise’s crown jewel, franchise face and invaluable investment, and Judge and everybody else knows it.

Barkley himself conceded that he would be comfortable for Week 1 without any preseason action. There were no preseason games in 2020, of course.

“The year before that, I don’t think I played in one,” he said. “My rookie year I played in one, had like two carries. So I wouldn’t really be worried about that if I didn’t play preseason because I know that the coaches and the training staff and the strength staff wouldn’t let me out there if I didn’t show ’em something that I’m capable of going out there and, one, keep myself safe, and also go out there and compete at a high level for my teammates.”

Judge is smart enough to simulate practices enough to prime Barkley for the real thing.

“One thing about me, I’m all for whatever’s gonna help the team win,” Barkley said. “If they feel that’s what I need to do to get myself back for whenever I’m able to come back for my team, I’m willing to do that.”

He trusts Judge and the medical men and the strength and conditioning staff implicitly. Does he think he can be ready for Game 1?

“I don’t know,” Barkley said. “Obviously you guys know how I am as a competitor. I’m pretty sure you guys know what my thought process is, but at the same time, I’m very fortunate to play for an unbelievable coach and an unbelievable organization that is actually thinking about me and thinking about the rest of my career and the longevity of my career, and don’t feel forced.”

He wore white leggings over those freakish Saquads and moved well at his customary 230 pounds. You couldn’t tell that he underwent surgery less than 10 months ago. But he’s not in football shape yet and he’s not as confident in his right knee — no brace — as he will be.

He has been champing at the bit to fight alongside his brothers. And happy to run laps and do push-ups with them as a team leader following the infamous team brawl.

“I do believe we will have a very special year,” Barkley said. “I think that’s one of the things we’re gonna be able to point back to, I’d say that really helped bring us together.”

Barkley in his blue No. 26 jersey was a sight for sore Giant eyes. He joked that he felt like a rookie again. They busted his chops. Barkley, with a big smile: “ ‘Whoa, who’s that?’ Shaking my hand, introducing themselves.”

He needs no introduction. Only the football, and not before the games start to count.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@George Fant received good news and bad news on July 2.

The good news: Training partner and friend Morgan Moses was now his teammate. The bad news: Moses was brought in to battle Fant to be the starting right tackle.

“It’s cool,” Fant insisted on Monday after practice. “I met ‘Mo’ a while back, training together in Miami. Even then, I was a younger guy than him — he had been in the league for a couple of years — so I leaned on him when we were training.

“I learned a lot from him, he learned a lot from me. We continue to do that. It’s cool to have that relationship we have.”

After the Jets signed Fant, 29, to a three-year, $30 million deal prior to last season, he started 14 games at right tackle to middling results. He struggled at times, netting a 61.6 Pro Football Focus grade that ranked 64th out of 79 offensive tackles. Moses notched a 79.9 PFF grade, the sixth-best among right tackles. After The Washington Football Team released him, the Jets picked up the durable 30-year-old, inking him to a one-year, $3.6 million deal.

“He’s a great veteran to add to our room. Happy to have him here,” Fant said. “That’s what this game’s all about. You’re competing all the time. I’ve been in this league for six years, ex-basketball player, undrafted. I’ve competed my whole career. This is just another step in my growth as a player.”

Moses has a significant head start on winning the job. Fant, despite being vaccinated, tested positive for COVID-19 and missed the first eight practices of training camp. With a gym in his home, Fant was able to stay in shape. He returned on Saturday and took part in the Green and White scrimmage at MetLife Stadium. The coaches had to basically drag him off the field.

“You got to push yourself through certain situations so you can be prepared for the right situation,” he said. “You got to be a pro. I’ve played for a while. I consider myself a veteran as far as being able to prepare. I know my stuff. When I got here, I was trying not to miss a beat.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — The Knicks attempted to trade their two first-round picks to move up to No. 13 to draft Oregon swingman sniper Chris Duarte.

As it happened the Pacers wanted no part of it and selected Duarte. Meanwhile, the Knicks made a series of trades that ultimately landed them the 25th pick which they used on the University of Houston’s shooting guard Quentin Grimes.

The disparity was evident in Monday’s game with the Pacers as Duarte played his first summer league game. He showed why the Knicks lusted after him. Duarte scored 14 points in 26 minutes, making 3 of 7 3-pointers, and registering two blocks. Afterward, Duarte said he was aware the Knicks were trying to move up but was just happy to be picked so high.

Duarte blocked Grimes’ shot on a fast break, then demonstrated his jumping ability by leaping to reject with two hands an Obi Toppin runner.

According to a source, Knicks senior vice president William Wesley was Duarte’s biggest fan and sat courtside in watching Duarte’s polish Monday.

Grimes had his second poor shooting performance, going 2 of 10 for six points, but he finished with six rebounds and four assists in 35 minutes. He’s got a solid shooting stroke but nothing is falling. He’s a combined 5 of 21 in the first two games.

“I feel like I’ve been playing all right,’’ Grimes said. “Just got to shoot the ball a little bit better, trying to get the jitters out and everything. New team, playing with new guys.’’

Lefty combo guard Rokas Jokubaitis, the Knicks’ second-round pick out of Lithuania, made his debut and looked nervous. He fumbled two passes in nine minutes but showed speed in getting to the rim and finished with three points. Jokubaitis likely is headed to Barcelona for the season. … Knicks rookie center Jericho Sims, selected 58th, is still perfect. He was 4-for-4 from the field, even showing a nice post move on a turnaround half-hook shot. He’s now 10-for-10 in two games — all inside buckets. He did miss his two free throws. Sims also grabbed nine rebounds.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — Immanuel Quickley can’t wait to learn from Bronx point guard Kemba Walker.

Quickley said he’s been talking to different point guards around the NBA to get their feel of the game. And now he’ll have a four-time All-Star in his locker room — even if the 31-year-old Walker is aging and potentially unable to play a full 82-game season because of an arthritic left knee.

“Offseason moves were great,’’ Quickley said after starting at point guard Monday and dropping 32 points and eight assists with only one turnover in a summer league victory over Indiana. “We added a guy, Kemba Walker, who can do it all, somebody I can learn from, compete with to expand my game. I want to be where he is eventually one day. So no better guy than Kemba Walker to come in — just like I learned from Derrick Rose, I can learn from somebody else. And Evan Fournier, competitor, shooter — so we added shooting and defense. I think we made great moves this offseason.’’

The Knicks have not announced the Walker signing. A report surfaced that Walker’s buyout with Oklahoma City saw him give up roughly $20.5 million of the $74 million left on his contract to agree to terms with the Knicks.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Zach Wilson’s MetLife Stadium introduction to Jets fans didn’t go as planned.

The franchise’s latest hope at quarterback is expected to have a quarter, if not more, to make a better second impression.

Coach Robert Saleh said after Monday’s practice the plan is for the second-overall pick in the draft to play “at least” the opening quarter against the Giants in both teams’ preseason opener.

“Just be comfortable in the offense,” is what Saleh wants to see from Wilson. “Seeing coverages, seeing different things. He’s got to see it all. And the more he sees, the more reps he gets, the more comfortable he’s going to get.”

Wilson followed up Saturday’s shaky performance in the Green-White scrimmage in which he threw two interceptions and led the first-team offense to just a field goal with an uneven practice on Monday. In team drills, he completed 5 of 13 passes. He was sacked twice, at times holding onto the ball too long, and had a pass knocked down at the line of scrimmage. He was mostly indecisive and inaccurate. Wilson did rebound and threw a pair of touchdowns to Corey Davis, finding the newcomer on a fade pattern in the left corner of the end zone and zipping in a toss through traffic.

“There’s a reason why being a rookie is hard in this league. There was a Hall of Famer [on Sunday] that was inducted [into Canton who had] a 71 quarterback rating as a rookie,” Saleh said, referring to Peyton Manning. “It’s not easy to play quarterback in this league as a rookie. But it is going to get worse before it gets better.”

One criticism aimed at the Jets with regards to Wilson is the lack of a veteran quarterback who can tutor — and challenge — him. They recently added Josh Johnson to the quarterback room, but the 35-year-old journeyman last played in an NFL game in 2018 and has just 33 appearances on his résumé. Plus, Wilson is being molded by a first-year offensive coordinator (Mike LaFleur) and first-year quarterbacks coach (Rob Calabrese).

“He’ll have Rob, who’s fantastic. He’ll have Mike, who’s been through it and he’s been able to watch the best do it,” Saleh said. “And so that part of the experience, I’m not very concerned about that, no.”

Saleh expressed confidence that Wilson is improving, that he has a strong command of the huddle, he knows where everyone is supposed to be, he is adept at making adjustments and correcting his own mistakes. Still, this is all new to him. He’s only had a handful of practices as a professional.

“There’s a process that he’s got to go through,” Saleh said. “It’s not easy, but we have tremendous hopes for him. He’s going to be just fine.”

That process will continue Saturday night when Wilson faces a different team for the first time. The young quarterback and the Jets hope to see some progress.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Oshane Ximines has a ways to go before fighting for his spot on the field.

While the Giants linebacker was activated off the physically unable to perform list before Monday’s practice, he was relegated to only individual drills and basic defense practice. Still rehabbing his hamstring injury, Ximines will have to wait to participate in team drills.

“I felt great to get back out, man,” Ximines said. “It’s been a long, long offseason trying to get back right. Today is just a first step in a long journey to be where I was.”

Ximines’ season ended after tearing his rotator cuff in November 2020, and he had to have surgery shortly thereafter. Last season, he notched one tackle for loss and three quarterback hits in four games — a far cry from the five tackles for loss, nine quarterback hits and 4.5 sacks Ximines recorded in his rookie season.

This season will be the 24-year-old’s first opportunity to truly play for Joe Judge’s staff. Still, Judge believes that Ximines can be an asset as he provides much-needed power and speed.

“In terms of holding the edge, playing with extension, shedding blocks, [Ximines] really plays more to his physical build which is really power and anchor at the point of attack,” Judge said. “He’s a guy that’s helped in the kicking game, too. He’s had roles on defense, so we’re looking to get him involved in everything we do.”

Oshane Ximines (l.) Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

However, it’s unknown whether Ximines will be ready for action at the beginning of the season and his chances to return have become slimmer with rookie Azeez Ojulari’s addition.

Ojulari was arguably the best edge rusher in the SEC last season, leading the conference in sacks (8.5) and tackles for loss (12.5), and was tied for second in FBS with four forced fumbles.

“Coach Judge made it clear that this is gonna be a competitive camp,” Ximines said.

Lorenzo Carter has most likely taken one starting edge position, and now Ximines must go head-to-head with Ojulari — if he is even healthy enough to play.

“This is a day-to-day business. Nobody’s secure, ever. That’s nowhere in the NFL,” Ximines said. “So whatever they’re doing, they’re doing. … I’m going to work every day like I’ve always done and let the chips fall where they may.”

It sure sounds as if Judge wants Nate Ebner back with the Giants as soon as possible. Ebner, a special teams ace who is currently unsigned, was injured and had to pull himself off the U.S. Rugby Olympic team.

“The nature of Nate is, he doesn’t know how to slow down, so there was a point where he was kind of pushing and pushing his body and he had to make a decision at one point,’’ Judge said. “We’re looking forward to getting him and as soon as we get a chance to get him back. I’m anxious to see him back.’’

Do not expect many starters to be on the field for extended playing time, or perhaps any playing time, in Saturday night’s preseason opener against the Jets.

“The priority for me is to treat this more like a traditional Game 4 and when I say that, it’s more of a make sure all of the players that we really have to evaluate get an evaluation,’’ Judge said. “Because of the rules this year, we have to cut five guys after the Jets game. I want to make sure that we don’t make any decisions that impact our or their future without a proper evaluation.’’

The Giants’ all-white Color Rush uniforms were popular with fans and they will be worn at least twice this season, back-to-back in Week 11 at Tampa on “Monday Night Football” against the Super Bowl champion Buccaneers and in Week 12 at home against the Eagles. The Giants have an option to wear the Color Rush uniform a third time later in the season.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I am not a big fan of predictions because even when right, they are often wrong.

After all, if you viewed the New York teams as playoff contenders in spring the optimism was, yes, built around dynamic aces in Jacob deGrom and Gerrit Cole, but also that the Mets and Yankees were going to score. A lot. These were going to be deep, powerful lineups.

But with eight weeks to go on the schedule neither club was in postseason position because of offense failings. If either team was just league average at this point, its standing would be greatly improved.

Instead, only two teams completed the weekend averaging worse than the Mets’ 3.75 runs per game — the last-place Pirates and Rangers, who were a combined 64 games under .500. Seven of the nine lowest-scoring teams were under .500. The exceptions: New York, New York, which when combined is a hell of a town, but separately have been the majors’ most disappointing offenses.

The Mets were teetering near break-even at 56-55. Maybe they can stumble into the playoffs because the Phillies and Braves are ordinary. But that was the theory for the past few months and suddenly the Mets are a third-place team. To this point, nothing has worked. Chili Davis was fired as hitting coach in May, enforcement of pitchers using sticky substances was elevated in June and Javier Baez was added to the lineup in July and the before/after picture each time has been similar — and unacceptable.

The burden to fix this remains spread out, but here are five position players with a lot to lose if they don’t start helping the Mets win:

The acquisition of Javier Baez has not led to more victories for the Mets. Getty Images

1. Javier Baez

You know what has been another terrible (multiyear) prediction — anticipation that the free-agent shortstop class for the 2021-22 offseason would create a frenzy never before seen? The visions of uncontained bidding were built around five stars — Baez, Carlos Correa, Francisco Lindor, Corey Seager and Trevor Story. Only Correa has played near his peak. In fact, Brandon Crawford and, especially, Marcus Semien — also both free agents — have outplayed the others.

Lindor at least got paid, signing a 10-year, $341 million pact to avoid free agency. But how much does his underperformance and injury scare off other teams from offering dollars like that elsewhere? Fernando Tatis Jr. has been brilliant when he has played since signing his 13-year, $340 million deal. But the key words in that sentence were “when he has played.” Tatis is on the injured list with a left shoulder subluxation for a second time and (if he returns in 2021) might come back as an outfielder; perhaps another blow to the financial stratosphere of the coming class.

At the deadline, the Dodgers traded for Seager’s 2022 replacement in Trea Turner and put him at second. The Rockies claimed that no club matched their prospect request for Story. The Mets did for Baez, giving up one of their best in Pete Crow-Armstrong. Baez was hitting .176 in nine Met games before injuring his hip.

There is a highlight reel quality to Baez’s game, but 17 walks and 144 strikeouts for the season? There are 26 shortstops with at least 500 innings at the position and Baez ranks 23rd in FanGraphs’ defensive metric (Tatis is the worst).

2. Michael Conforto

Baez might not be the player who has cost himself the most in free agency. Off arguably his best campaign (albeit in a shortened 2020), Conforto had an age/offensive production case to shoot for George Springer’s six-year, $150 million deal signed last winter with Toronto. Now? Will he consider accepting a qualifying offer to re-establish his value?

Much has been made that Brett Gardner is at the finish line with his .202/.320/.306 slash line. Conforto’s is .201/.331/.339. He is a roller coaster offensively who can get hot and he so often seems a bellwether for the club — when he goes well so do the Mets. They need the best version now.

3. Francisco Lindor

On the subject of Springer, the Mets had a choice last offseason to keep their shortstop assets (Andres Gimenez/Amed Rosario) and either deal with that position at the trade deadline or the following winter and sign Springer instead. Since Springer returned for good on June 22, he has been one of the best hitters in the game.

The Mets have not averaged this few runs since 1992. That club was dubbed “The Worst Team Money Could Buy” and its big-money switch-hitting addition was Bobby Bonilla, who came in smiling and saying all the right things. But that went horribly wrong and Bonilla could not reverse it. Another big-money switch-hitter, Carlos Beltran, was able to survive a poor first Mets season.

Lindor’s offensive trend line since his career-best 2018 has been steadily falling. Now, he is out with an oblique injury. Smile and positive words or not, Lindor is going to have to win Met fans over with his bat. He should have at least September to do that.

4. James McCann

Another free-agent move gone bad? The Mets did not wait out the J.T. Realmuto trade market after the 2018 season concerned they would be shut out at the position and signed Wilson Ramos. They did not wait out the Realmuto free-agent market last offseason concerned they would be shut out at the position and enlisted McCann. They just might have signed a backup catcher for four years at $40 million.

His 86 OPS-plus is the lowest by a Met with at least 300 plate appearances since Juan Lagares in 2015 (Conforto is at 87). Maybe the fast-rising Francisco Alvarez could make McCann a backup by midseason 2022, though that would be aggressive. For now, the Mets need more from him.

5. Dominic Smith

The Mets were viewed as one of the NL teams hurt the most by MLB and the players association being unable to agree on a universal DH this year. For Smith could have played first with Pete Alonso DHing. But that was based on the 2020 Smith who had the sixth best OPS-plus (167) out of 142 qualifiers compared to this year’s 110th best (94) out of 135 qualifiers.

Perhaps the 2021 offensive plunge of Smith and Gleyber Torres (116th best) can be explained, at least in part, in asking guys to play defensive positions for which they are not well-equipped and the toll that takes on their confidence. Smith played half-time at his more natural first base last year.

Smith (along with Conforto, Lindor, Jeff McNeil and Brandon Nimmo) were expected to be lefty bats that made the Mets fierce versus righties. But the Mets’ .685 OPS versus righties is 13th out of 15 in the NL (the Mets are due to face three righty starters against the floundering Nationals beginning Tuesday). Robinson Cano was supposed to be gone in 2021 and probably forgotten after another PED-related suspension. But with the DH likely going universal next year, Smith (or McNeil), in particular, could be beginning to damage their 2022 playing time if they do not help the offense perform much better down the stretch.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Major League Baseball and Barstool Sports have had significant negotiations about having national midweek games on the site’s platforms, The Post has learned.

The discussions are what Barstool founder Dave Portnoy was referring to last week when he mentioned his company has had talks with “major leagues.”

MLB and Barstool potentially could team up to create a new type of broadcast with a focus on in-game gambling.

The talks have started recently, and while they have picked up steam, an agreement is not yet a certainty. One source deemed it “50-50.”

MLB and Barstool declined to comment.

Major League Baseball currently has national TV deals with Fox, Turner and ESPN. As part of its new ESPN contract that begins next year, the network dropped regular, non-exclusive Monday and Wednesday games, leaving MLB trying to find a buyer for that inventory. Turner will move its regular-season games to Tuesday, from Sunday, beginning next season.

YouTube is a possibility for the midweek national games, as it already has streamed MLB games for three years. Peacock just did a weekend series last month, as well, and is seen as a contender.

But Barstool sticks out because it has the connection to a younger audience MLB craves and could possibly create buzz with its alternative delivery approach. Barstool would be expected to deliver the games through its website, Instagram and Twitter accounts, among others.

Barstool recently announced that it would be a title sponsor and broadcaster for college football’s Arizona Bowl. The platform is expected to soon sign other deals for live rights.

As is Barstool’s wont, the Arizona Bowl broadcast is not expected to be traditional in its delivery, which could appeal to MLB.

Noah Garden, MLB’s chief revenue officer, has been wanting baseball to become younger. He has not been shy about expanding into gambling, and he likes the idea of alternative broadcasts.

The “Bettor’s Eye,” a baseball betting-focused show, was scheduled for Monday and new episodes are planned for the next three Mondays on MLB Network. Previously, segments of the program have run on MLB Network.

MLB Network, during a few of its games this season, has featured what it termed the “Clubhouse Edition” approach with CC Sabathia, among others, on hand.

On Tuesday night, MLB Network’s game between the Cubs and Brewers will have Sabathia, Jason Kendall, Matt Vasgersian and Mark DeRosa hanging out.

For Barstool, it is trying to be at the center of the convergence of sports gambling, media and now, potentially, live games.

Barstool’s parent company, Penn National, just bought the Canadian betting app, theScore. It has sportsbooks in several states with the list growing. And now it is moving into live rights.

There is one major issue that all potential streamers have to overcome to make in-game gambling a reality. The lag time between live action and the stream must be eliminated if betting in-game is to become a reality.

Doing business with Barstool could come with controversy for MLB, as Barstool has been accused of being misogynistic. But Barstool has been embraced by many top major leaguers, including Bryce Harper, making it possibly a popular choice among some players.

If the games are nonexclusive, Barstool probably wouldn’t have to do the production, as it could take feeds from regional sports networks (RSNs). Barstool then could produce its own nontraditional, gambling focused broadcast without a play-by-play voice and analysts. Its relaxed approach could feature Portnoy, Dan (Big Cat) Katz and, for say, a Yankees game, Eric Hubbs, who writes about the team for the site.

If a deal is completed and it is nonexclusive, the games would likely still be broadcast on RSNs, making Barstool’s stream an alternative broadcast. That means local fans who want the traditional approach would not be disrupted.

NBC’s prime-time audience was down 51 percent from the Rio Games. As quiet as the numbers were, viewers still preferred the Tokyo Games to the games Chris “Crickets” Cuomo is playing.

The Yankees had their five-game winning streak snapped on Sunday. They hit the road and travel to Kansas City. Jameson Taillon (7-4, 4.04 ERA) is 5-0 in his past seven starts. The Royals’ Carlos Hernandez (3-1, 4.58 ERA) will make his 17th appearance, fifth start. Hernandez has allowed a single run over his last 11 innings, all against the potent White Sox. The Royals, crowned nightly, are 28-25 at home. Play 10 units on the Royals.

The New York Yankees made their splashes at the trade deadline mainly with the bats they acquired, but they entered Sunday on a stroll pitching roll. The Yankees had allowed three runs or fewer in each of the previous seven games started by anyone other than Andrew Heaney, and will look to hold down the Royals on Monday.

Jameson Taillon had a tough start to his road season, allowing four runs or more in his first five starts away from Yankee Stadium. But since the start of July, he has allowed four earned runs and six total runs in his four road starts. In this span, the Yankees are 3-1 with Taillon giving up two home runs across 25 ²/₃ innings with a 1.40 ERA.

The Royals look to young Carlos Hernandez, whose first two starts of the season did not go as planned with seven runs and six walks allowed across 6 ²/₃ innings, but he comes in having allowed just one run and three walks in 11 innings in a pair of wins against the Chicago White Sox.

The Royals’ bullpen has had its ups and downs but entered the week ranked 10th in MLB in ERA since the All-Star break while the Yankees are fifth in overall ERA since the break.

With both teams in the bottom nine in runs per game (Yankees 4.2, Royals 4.1), both lineups will get barbecued on Monday in Kansas City.

The Play: Yankees-Royals total, Under 9.5 runs.

The VSiN college football analyst and looks at some betting angles for the 2021 Pac-12 season.

Favorites: USC and Oregon

A wide-open conference race means there is no dominant team, and that’s the case again this year in the Pac-12. Five teams will set the pace — Oregon (5/2 at BetMGM), Washington (7/2), USC (4/1), Arizona State (4/1) and Utah (6/1), according to the BetMGM odds board — with UCLA chasing as a 12/1 long shot. USC is the obvious favorite in the South, and the North is a coin flip between Oregon and Washington.

Trojans quarterback Kedon Slovis is the conference’s top Heisman Trophy candidate (28/1) after totaling 47 touchdown passes in two seasons. USC coach Clay Helton has underachieved with an 18-13 record the last three seasons, and he was lucky to go 5-1 last year, when Slovis led improbable comebacks to beat Arizona State, Arizona and UCLA.

Oregon returns nine starters, including senior quarterback Anthony Brown, on an electric offense. The Ducks are probably more talented than the Huskies, but Oregon drew a more difficult schedule with road games against UCLA, Utah and Washington. The Huskies avoid playing USC and Utah from the South and will host Arizona State and UCLA. Washington faces a big question mark at quarterback, so it’s tough to pick the Huskies to win the North.

The Sun Devils will be a threat with the return of quarterback Jayden Daniels, and the Bruins are hoping talented QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson has a breakthrough year for coach Chip Kelly, who’s 10-21 in three disappointing years at UCLA. Kelly has 20 starters returning, so this is his chance to move up the standings and finally reach a bowl. Of the Power 5 conferences, the Pac-12 appears to be the odd man out of the four-team playoff picture, but the league has opportunities to make a statement and test its strength in several marquee non-conference games.

Live ‘dogs: Utah and California

Who’s the best coach in the conference? If you don’t answer Kyle Whittingham, it’s the wrong answer. Utah went 11-3 in 2019 under Whittingham, and this team might be better. The Utes return 19 starters and have the league’s top offensive and defensive lines. Baylor graduate transfer quarterback Charlie Brewer should lift the offense to the next level. The Utes get home games against Arizona State, Oregon and UCLA, and they are worth a shot to win the league at odds as high as 8/1 in the market. Cal coach Justin Wilcox is a defensive mastermind, and junior quarterback Chase Garbers is 8-3 in his last 11 starts for the gritty Golden Bears.

Dead money: Arizona

The Wildcats will carry a 12-game losing streak into this season. Jedd Fisch, formerly the quarterbacks coach for the New England Patriots, takes over as the only new head coach in the conference. Fisch can motivate Arizona’s players to be more competitive, but a three-win season looks to be the ceiling.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Professional bodybuilder John Meadows died “unexpectedly” and “peacefully” at home on Sunday at 49 years old, according to a Facebook post by his wife.

“Dear Friends & Family,” said the post signed by Brooke Nappo, who issued the statement for Meadows’ wife. “This morning John passed away unexpectedly and peacefully in their home. As you can imagine this is a complete shock to her and the boys.

“She will update as soon as she can. Please know she is very thankful for all the prayers and support she knows her and the boys will receive from you.”

Known as the “Mountain Dog,” Meadows competed in bodybuilding competitions for over 30 years. He entered his first competition at the age of 13 in 1985 while also pursuing his passion for powerlifting.

In 2005, Meadows was diagnosed with a rare colon disease called idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of the mesenteric veins. He returned in 2007 to come in 16th place in the IFBB North American Championships. In 2015, he earned a pro card by coming in first place in the NPC Universe, Bodybuilding Over 40 Overall.

In 2020, Meadows was hospitalized with a blood clot that was thought to stem from the disease. He is survived by his wife and twin sons, Jonathan and Alexander.

After beating France to win gold at the Tokyo Olympics, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and the rest of Team USA men’s basketball let loose on the bus ride to the airport — courtesy of LeBron James’ Lobos Tequila. Green and Lakers star Anthony Davis are both investors in the liquor company.

Green shared a number of Instagram videos that showed Durant shouting out James while lounging in the back of the bus with what appeared to be the gold medal-winning game ball in his lap.

“Hey Bron, hey Bron, Bron Bron,” a laughing Durant yelled in one video. “We got Lobos in the cup!” he added. Meanwhile, it sounded like Devin Booker said, “818,” which is his girlfriend Kendall Jenner’s new Tequila brand.

“Just a bunch of gold medalists man… and Lobos in the cup,” said Green, who tagged James and his business partner Maverick Carter — who’s also part of Main Street Advisors’ (MSA) investment group that co-led the investment in Lobos 1707 with Mezorio Spirits.

Team USA’s Jayson Tatum can be heard saying Green and Durant were “drunk” in the clip.

Lobos had fun with Team USA’s post-gold tequila celebration and responded to the clip on Twitter, writing, “The drink of Champs.” James agreed in retweet and added, “ABSOLUTELY!!! Congrats Men!!!”

Warning: This video contains graphic language.

In a separate tweet responding to the video, Lobos wrote, “Everyone has the fire… but the champions know when to ignite the spark… Celebrating all weekend with Liquid Gold @lobos1707 in the cup, only the best for the best.”

Other videos on social media showed Green at Drai’s Nightclub in Las Vegas holding a bottle of Lobos. He re-posted the clip to his instagram Story.

Despite declining to complete in the rescheduled 2020 Tokyo Olympics, James still managed to make a splash at the Summer Games.

Cheers to Team USA!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New couple alert.

Sports reporter Holly Sonders is dating Hall of Fame boxer Oscar De La Hoya, according to TMZ, which spotted the pair at celeb hotspot Nobu in Malibu on Friday night.

The website shared photos of Sonders, 34, and De La Hoya, 48, as they exited the restaurant. He lifted his black long-sleeve shirt to expose his abs amid training to fight Vitor Belfort on Sept. 11. Sonders was all smiles in a white dress as she held onto De La Hoya’s arm and placed her hand on his chest.

The reported new couple has yet to confirm they are an item. Though, Nobu Malibu is a magnet for paparazzi, and celebs usually show up to be seen.

De La Hoya and Sonders met at a boxing event in June, where Sonders was a host. That month, she shared a photo interviewing the former six-weight class world champion. The new couple has been “inseparable” ever since, according to TMZ.

Sonders and De La Hoya reportedly took a recent trip to Pebble Beach golf course, where they hit the links together.

The relationship news comes after Sonders split from fiance, sports betting consultant, Dave Oancea — also known as “Vegas Dave” — sometime in 2020 or earlier this year. She announced the couple’s engagement in Dec. 2019, in a since-deleted Instagram post.

In an exclusive interview with The Post in February, Sonders opened up about how she was inspired to rebrand herself “once things kind of ended with Dave.”

Sonders was previously romantically linked to Arizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury. She divorced former Golf Channel co-host Erik Kuselias in 2016.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Australian soccer star Sam Kerr has confirmed her relationship with USWNT midfielder Kristie Mewis amid romance rumors.

On Sunday, Kerr made the relationship Instagram official with a PDA Polaroid photo of pair, which showed Mewis sitting on Kerr’s lap while they shared a kiss. She captioned the post with a red heart emoji and tagged Mewis — who shared a selfie of the couple to her Instagram Story.

Kristie Mewis and Sam Kerr confirmed their relationship on Instagram this weekend. Instagram

Mewis left a heart and kiss-face emoji in the comments, where fellow soccer players gushed over the couple. Kerr shared a flirty response, writing, “Oh, wait til I’m gone to send this?”

Rumors of a romance began brewing in recent weeks when fans noticed Kerr and Mewis sharing flirty comments on social media. The pair continued to spark dating buzz when photos showed Mewis comforting Kerr on the pitch Thursday, after the U.S. women’s national team beat Kerr’s Matildas 4-3 to win bronze in Tokyo.

Kerr confirmed the new relationship after she called it quits with her longtime partner Nikki Stanton, an American soccer player for the Chicago Red Stars. Kerr, who met Stanton in 2014, broke things off just before the Summer Games in Tokyo, according to The Daily Telegraph.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After almost two years of Zoom school, it may finally be time to brush up on your bag lunch game with a bento box.

To get the kids excited for school again — while also making sure they stay as safe as possible — lunchtime can be a game-changer. Packing your kiddos a fun lunchbox can not only get them to eat their fruits and veggies but also help to avoid the crowded cafeteria lines and touching communal trays and keypads when getting a school lunch.

If you haven’t heard of them, bento boxes are a Japanese solution to a boring lunch — “bento” meaning a single portion of something. The lunch boxes are divided into different compartments, keeping food from touching or spilling over, which can be a picky kid’s worst nightmare. Plus, the box is great for portioning out your child’s meal, making sure they get enough nutrients during the school day.

While bento boxes have been around for quite a while in Asia and beyond, they have skyrocketed in popularity, thanks to TikTok, where parents show off just how cute they can package them. Many of the videos feature other fun gadgets, like food picks with stars and characters, rice ball makers for a perfect bite of rice every time and colorful cupcake liners to serve as additional separation inside the box.

While you don’t have to go as all-out as Jessica Woo from the above video, taking the time to cut cute shapes and write sweet notes to your kids may give them the boost they need to get back into the swing of things this school year — especially if they’ve been home since spring 2020.

To get you started on the bento box craze, read below for the best bento boxes as well as food picks, liners and other accessories to make a boring bag lunch a thing of the past.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Mets’ nosedive is not threatening Luis Rojas’ job.

Although the Mets have fallen to third place with a 9-15 second half, a source familiar with Steve Cohen’s thinking said the owner is not holding the manager responsible for the poor play.

Cohen believes this is a different time with a different type of player makeup than when George Steinbrenner used to fire Yankees managers regularly in bad periods for the club and/or to try to jolt players into better play, the source said.

Luis Rojas Bill Kostroun/New York Post

Cohen was with the team Sunday in Philadelphia and felt the players had a positive outlook and were prepared to play despite being swept over the weekend, the source said.

Cohen remains under the belief that there is no dominant NL East team.

Even with the second-half stumbles, the Mets are 2 ¹/₂ games out of first. Thus, Cohen does not see a reason to act impulsively because there remains a third of the season for the Mets to right themselves and win the division, the source said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pete Alonso apparently is a “trust the process” kind of guy.

The Mets slugger is mired in an 0-for-21 hitless skid over the past week entering Tuesday’s homestand opener against the Nationals, but he feels like the quality of his at-bats recently portend that the breakout the sliding Mets sorely need from him is coming.

“Well, I’m hitting balls hard, they’re either not going out of the yard or I’m hitting line drives right at guys,” Alonso said after Sunday’s 3-0 blanking against Zack Wheeler and the Phillies, the Mets’ seventh loss in eight games to fall out of first place in the NL East. “It’s a tough game sometimes and I’ve been putting together a lot of really quality at-bats. I’ve been taking my walks.

“I’ve been taking what pitchers have given me, but I’m doing the best I can to try to hit the ball hard and find a hole.”

Alonso hasn’t mustered a hit since blasting a third-inning homer — his 24th of the season — and reaching on a fifth-inning single last Monday in Miami, but he has drawn eight walks over the past six games. He also pointed out that he crushed a 107 mph shot to dead center that “unfortunately the wind knocked down” in the seventh inning Sunday in Philadelphia

“That how it goes sometimes,” Alonso said. “Over the past week, it’s been frustrating not seeing balls fall, but what is good is I’m hitting the ball hard on a pretty consistent basis, day-in and day-out of putting together quality at-bats, getting my ‘A’ swings off, and I feel like I’ve been getting on base a whole bunch.

“So yeah, it’s baseball, there’s ups and downs. And right now, this is unfortunate, but it is what it is, and on to Tuesday.”

Alonso added that he understands baseball is “a results-oriented game,” and the Mets’ unproductive offense has totaled just 20 runs during this eight-game stretch (2.5 per game). Their 416 runs scored overall this season rank second-to-last in all of MLB, ahead of only the Pirates (411).

“Collectively as a group, it’s just been really tough to find hits … and it’s frustrating,” Alonso said. “I’m lucky and blessed enough for this to be my job, but my job is on TV. And this past week, it was a rough week for me, no doubt, for sure.

“Everybody has had a bad day at work, and even though you’re trying and giving your best at work, whatever your profession, you can try, try, try, and you can really dive into it and really hope that you turn things around. … There’s certain times in the process where you know you’re doing the right thing, you know you’re on the right path, but you’re just not getting the tangible results.”

Alonso also attempted to reassure the team’s fans that the Mets (56-55) have both the time and the talent to recover and capture the NL East crown. They open this six-game homestand 2 ½ games behind the first-place Phillies, but they also will face the playoff-positioned Giants and Dodgers for 13 consecutive games beginning Friday.

“Mets fans, believe in us. And don’t just believe. Know,” Alonso said. “Because there’s tough times, not just in baseball, but in life in general, know that this is just going to be a speed bump and a challenge. And also smile, you get to watch baseball. It’s a game.

“I know we have the most passionate fan base in baseball. I know that. And I understand it’s frustrating. It’s frustrating for us, but just understand that we’re here together. We’re all in this together, and we got this. Just smile and just know that we got this.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — Don’t tell Immanuel Quickley he’s not a point guard. On Monday, he took steps toward proving it.

After a brutal shooting performance in Sunday’s summer league opener, Quickley responded with a golden performance, scoring 32 points with eight assists, only one turnover and one steal as the Knicks beat the Pacers, 94-86, at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center.

Quickley started at point guard for a second straight game and looked completely different than in Sunday’s opener when he shot 5 of 17 overall (2-of-11 from 3).

“I know I’m a point guard,’’ Quickley said of his doubters. “I happen to be able to score the ball, happen to be able to play off other players. But I know I’m a point guard and can get other guys the ball. If that’s how people see it, that’s how people see it but I know for sure I’m a point guard. I just have the ability to be able to score.’’

The second-team all-rookie selection out of Kentucky drilled 4 of 12 3-pointers and finished 11 of 21 overall Monday. Obi Toppin, the 2020 first-round pick, scored 22 points in a productive performance. Because of the pandemic, neither Quickley nor Toppin had the benefit of summer league last season after being drafted in November.

Quickley looked a lot more sure of himself in running the offense Monday — even getting into the paint, something he didn’t do Sunday.

“I feel like I’m always sure of myself,’’ Quickley said. “I made a lot more shots that helped a little bit. Just continue to just lead. Helping the guys. I’ve been around a year. I’ve been in playoff games. Just continuing to spread my knowledge to the new guys, the young guys. Obi and I are doing a great job understanding we have to help these guys and communicate.’’

Last season, Quickley excelled mostly as an off guard and became a fan favorite. But this experiment with Quickley at the point is intriguing, to say the least. The Knicks drafted a point guard in Miles McBride (14 points Monday), re-signed Derrick Rose and agreed to terms with former All-Star Kemba Walker.

“Whatever the team needs from me that’s what I’ll do,’’ Quickley said. “I have the ability to do both, I feel like. If I’m asked to play point guard, I’ll play point guard. If I’m asked to play shooting guard, I’ll play shooting guard. I just have the ability to be a basketball player. That’s a term people forget. People who can go out and pass, dribble shoot and defend. I try not to make the game too hard.’’

During this offseason, Quickley, 22, said he’s working on a midrange game to go along with his patented floater and 3-point marksmanship. Teams started to adjust to Quickley’s float game late in the season so he’s trying to be more diverse.

“Coach JB [assistant Johnny Bryant] was on me today — ‘You shot the floater’,’’ Quickley said. “I had a pull-up opportunity I didn’t take. That’s a lot what I’ve been working on. The midrange game.’’

Last month, Quickley received a big honor in being selected to the U.S. Select Team to scrimmage for a week versus the U.S. Olympic Team. But midweek he was bounced by COVID-19 health and safety protocols, though he didn’t test positive.

“Real tough, especially after getting two days in and playing really good,’’ Quickley said. “It was great being in an environment with great players like that. It’s definitely unfortunate I had to leave early. It was tough.’’

“I know I’m a point guard,” Quickley said. NBAE via Getty Images

During the heat of the summer league battle, Quickley and Indiana’s Chris Duarte, whom the Knicks had targeted in last month’s draft, exchanged words on a couple of possessions.

“It was great,’’ Quickley said. “We were both competing, talking a little trash. We both enjoyed it. I just seen him now, we exchanged words, like great game. That’s what you want, competing against guys who will make you better. He’s a great player and had a great game.’’

“It’s stuff you do when playing — he says something to me and I say something back,’’ said Duarte, who finished with 14 points.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — When the Nets drafted Cameron Thomas, he was billed as instant offense, a microwave scorer with so-so efficiency.

He was as advertised. And then some.

Thomas’ introduction to the professional game came with some bumps and a visible learning curve in Monday’s Las Vegas Summer League opener. But he backed up a tough start with a strong finish, leading a Nets comeback that fell just short 91-84 against Memphis at Cox Pavilion.

“This is my first pro game, so I’m just getting a feel for everything, came off the bench,” said Thomas, who had a team-high 17 points. “So I just had to get a rhythm, get a flow for everything. Once I got a nice rhythm, I felt like I was pretty [comfortable]. Just basketball from there on.”

The Nets fell behind by 16 points in a sloppy, disjointed first half. They committed 10 turnovers and Thomas had just five points on 1 of 7 shooting. He had just a deuce in the third quarter before breaking out for 10 in the final period. Brooklyn stormed ahead to lead with 3 ½ minutes left, but faded late.

“Cam got it going. Carried us with that second unit, him and [Quinndary Weatherspoon],” coach Jordan Ott said. “You see Cam’s skill set; 19 years old against a really good team. … Cam did a pretty good job getting that thing rolling.”

Weatherspoon had 15 points, while Day’Ron Sharpe (eight rebounds, plus-15) looked the part physically.

But Brooklyn’s start was too sloppy to overcome. Memphis’ Desmond Bane had 32 points, while Killian Tillie added another 20. The Nets fell behind by 16 in the second quarter, and shot just 31.3 percent in the first half, 3 of 10 from deep.

“First half was ugly at times. We knew that. That’s why we tried to amp up our pressure. We knew our defense would have to carry us,” Ott said. “We had 10 turnovers in the first half, ended with 18. … Our ball movement got a little bit better. As the game progressed we felt better.”

Alize Johnson (13 points, seven rebounds) and Reggie Perry (game-high dozen boards) were the Nets’ only roster players, and that experience showed. Conspicuously, Nic Claxton isn’t playing in summer league.

“Nic’s been in the gym. Nic’s been working, he’s been with us this whole time,” Ott said. “That was just a discussion, collaborative discussion between him, his people, our people, and they felt the best was don’t play summer league.”

Brooklyn trailed 42-26 with 2:02 left in the half after a Bane free throw, and was still behind 43-33 at the break.

The Nets got within two going into the fourth quarter, and were still down 65-63 after a Sean McDermott layup. They took the lead with a Jordan Bowden 3 and Thomas’ three-point play put them ahead by four.

A Thomas 3 put them up 77-76 with 3:27 to play, but they yielded a 14-4 run.

Still, Thomas’ offensive craftiness bodes well.

“I didn’t know there was gonna be like that wide open with all that space. So, that’s the plus,” Thomas said. “Everything else it was just basketball. … It wasn’t really that much physical, not that much faster. So I felt like I fit in right away. But I just saw so much space, and I was like ‘This is real great.’ ”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A few guys greeted him with a “Whoa, who is that?’’ as he took the field. Hands were extended and introductions made by players he already knew quite well.

“It’s just fun being out there, that’s the stuff you miss,’’ Saquon Barkley said Monday as he took an important step forward in his return from reconstructive knee surgery. “Some of the guys on the defensive side can’t wait to get their hands on me because I do talk a lot of crap when offense and defense is going.’’

No one is putting their hands on Barkley any time soon, but the smile on the star running back’s face revealed some relief that finally, he was back where he belonged. The Giants activated Barkley from the physically unable to perform list and he made his training camp debut in a practice that was not even in full pads. Barkley participated in individual drills, caught passes from Daniel Jones on the side and also caught some good-natured grief from teammates who were thrilled to see him back among them.

By starting this next phase, Barkley has five weeks to show his right knee can withstand the pounding it must be able to take before the decision must be made whether or not to unleash him Sept. 12 in the regular-season opener against the Broncos.

“Yeah, I would say it’s a good time,’’ Barkley said. “I think I know what you are trying to get at with me and getting ready for the regular season. I’m not even thinking about that. I just wanted to be able to get out and practice and just play football with my teammates again, and I’m very fortunate that day was today.’’

Of course you know Barkley has an eye on the opener, even as he takes things slow and steady, and makes sure he listens to his coaches, trainers and Giants medical staff.

“Definitely hopeful,’’ he said.

Barkley went down early in the second quarter on Sept. 20 in Chicago, suffering a torn right anterior cruciate ligament and also damage to his meniscus. After strengthening the area around the knee, Barkley underwent reconstructive surgery to repair the ACL and the partially torn meniscus on Oct. 30. He missed the final 14 games of the season.

He did a great deal of watching two weeks into camp and finally had enough of it. Barkley lobbied for more, and Saturday was told he would indeed get more.

“Got to a point in rehab where running over there against garbage cans and cutting on cones and stuff, it’s all good, but now I get to start reacting off of other athletes,’’ Barkley said.

This will continue to be a slow ramp-up.

“As they keep greenlighting Saquon to do more and more, we’re going to let him do more and more,’’ coach Joe Judge said.

“There’s only so much you can do at a certain point with the trainers and strength coaches on the field by yourself. It’s time to get him moving forward and as long as they say it’s safe for him to do, we’ll keep on pushing.’’

Judge acknowledged Barkley has been “tapping his foot for a while’’ and the time was right to get him in the dance.

Barkley said at one point he had to ask fullback Eli Penny where he was supposed to line up in warm-ups. “Kind of feeling like a rookie out there again,’’ Barkley said.

There will not be any seven-on-seven work or 11-on-11 team-period action for Barkley just yet. The Giants open their preseason with a game Saturday night against the Jets, and Barkley will not play. He might not play in the two remaining preseason games after that, either.

Judge said “theoretically, yeah’’ when asked if he would be comfortable playing Barkley in a preseason game.

“Am I looking to put Saquon into something that’s not going to be in his best interest?’’ Judge said. “Absolutely not, but at some point the doctors say, ‘He’s ready to play,’ and if we have the opportunity to get him in at a certain point, we will. But I’m not going to press that timetable.’’

Barkley said he will do what he is told to do, noting he prepped for his first three NFL seasons with little or no work in preseason games.

As for being ready for the real opener, Barkley said, “I don’t know’’ and then revealed a bit more, sounding relieved he is back on the practice field and confident in what he can show between now and kickoff against the Broncos.

“You guys know how I am as a competitor, I’m pretty sure you guys know what my thought process is,” he said.

His thought process is to play. Five weeks to go.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Jets showed tons of confidence in Bless Austin with every move they didn’t make in the offseason.

Almost as much confidence as Austin — who is surprisingly atop the cornerback depth chart in training camp — has in himself.

“I come to camp looking forward to getting my next contract,” Austin said. “I don’t worry about who’s starting or none of that. I think I’m the real deal. There’s no secret to that.”

So, Austin sounds like so many unshakeable elite cornerbacks. Can he play like one? He says he already has at times in 16 starts over the first half of his four-year rookie contract.

“Clip the tape, press play,” Austin said. “Of course I made mistakes, but there’s also a lot of plays I made on that field that other corners in this league are not making. I’m looking forward to extending my time here on the Jets by making a lot of plays.”

The Jets chose to spend free-agent dollars and draft picks upgrading wide receiver (Corey Davis, Keelan Cole, Elijah Moore), offensive line (Alijah Vera-Tucker and Morgan Moses), quarterback (Zach Wilson) and linebacker (Carl Lawson and Jarrad Davis).

Did they simply run out of resources before getting to cornerback? Or do they believe in Austin and second-year pro Bryce Hall more than the many critics?

“The front office and the coaching staff does a great job of communicating to us where their head is at,” Austin said. “A lot of people forget me and Bryce were highly rated dudes coming out of college. We just fell short to injury. There’s a reason why they didn’t bring a veteran cornerback in here. Not to knock any out there, but they see something in us.”

Austin led the Big Ten in passes defended in 2015 before two ACL tears ended his final two seasons at Rutgers. Hall led the nation in passes defended at Virginia in 2019 but needed leg and ankle surgery as a senior. Both fell from potential second-rounders to sixth-rounders to form the unlikeliest starting duo in the NFL.

“I don’t pay attention to outside noise,” Austin said. “I’m between the white lines and I know what I’m about. Other people in the league know what I’m about as well.”

For all his swagger, Austin doesn’t see himself as a finished product.

“There are so many areas to improve on,” Austin said. “It’s hard for me to look back in the past and see how far I’ve come. I’m just so tough on myself. With new offenses and as this game revolutionizes, I don’t think there will ever be a time I’m comfortable and I’ve got things figured out.”

Austin allowed 41 catches on 59 targets for 369 yards and three touchdowns last season, according to Pro Football Focus. He wasn’t benched as he was as a rookie, but he appeared to be responsible for multiple blown assignments that led to big plays in the secondary.

“Bless has a dog’s mentality in that he is absolutely fearless,” coach Robert Saleh said. “It doesn’t look like he’s bothered by the play before. It’s those attributes — the length, the strength at the line of scrimmage, he’s fast enough — so it’s just a matter of working the technique and understanding where you fit in the defense. He’s shown everything that we want.”

Austin didn’t hang his head after surrendering a leaping touchdown to Corey Davis during Monday’s practice. Tight end Tyler Kroft, a former Rutgers teammate of Austin’s, also separately used “dog’s mentality” to describe Austin.

“When I hear that, the only thing I think is to make sure that doesn’t ever leave [Saleh’s] mind,” Austin said. “Continue to stay consistent and continue to make that my trademark.”

Saleh’s defensive scheme was developed through time with the Seahawks and Jaguars, where All-Pros Richard Sherman and Jalen Ramsey held the No. 1 cornerback roles. Austin stayed around the Jets training facility during the offseason, watched tape of Ramsey and didn’t take many “vacation days.”

So, is it possible he soon could hear his name in that conversation as one of the best in the NFL?

“I’ve learned how you get that done is by taking it a day at a time,” Austin said. “The best ones understand what steps they took and the growth they had to go through. With all the areas I have to work and improve, day by day I knock them down, I’m definitely planning on hearing that at the end of the year.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANSAS CITY, Mo. — There was a laundry list of issues with the Yankees’ ugly 8-4 loss to the Royals on Tuesday night.

They were mostly shut down by Kansas City pitching and saw shaky relief outings by Stephen Ridings and Nick Nelson.

And then there were the season-high four errors — two of which were committed by Kyle Higashioka, who had just four errors in his career before Tuesday night.

“Definitely pretty infuriating,’’ Higashioka said of his miscues. “I hate to make errors like that — especially since one directly led to a run. It’s not acceptable.”

Manager Aaron Boone had hoped his team’s wild 11-inning win on Monday would prove to be a spark, but the reality set in Tuesday. They had to let Nestor Cortes Jr. pitch into the sixth inning for the first time and then go to the inexperienced Ridings as the game unravelled — thanks in part to three unearned runs.

The streaking Rays beat the Red Sox for their fifth consecutive victory, so the Yankees fell to seven games back of first-place Tampa Bay in the AL East.

Even with the defeat, the Yankees have lost just two of their last eight games, despite an injured list that is filled with key players.

Asked why the Yankees might have played such a poor game on Tuesday in the midst of what has been an excellent stretch, Boone said: “I don’t know why. It happens. … Overall, we didn’t play our best tonight.”

Still, they seemed to be in a good spot when DJ LeMahieu’s RBI single gave the Yankees a 4-3 lead in the top of the sixth.

But Salvador Perez took Cortes deep to open the bottom of the inning for the catcher’s second homer of the night.

“I missed with two pitches in the zone,’’ Cortes said of his approach to Perez, who has 29 home runs on the season. “I didn’t execute and he got me. He’s a great hitter.”

Cortes was replaced by Ridings after Emmanuel Rivera’s two-out single later in the sixth. Ridings, pitching in his fourth game in the majors, gave up a double to left-center to Dozier, which scored Rivera from first, putting the Royals ahead, 5-4.

The night got worse for Ridings in the seventh.

He gave up another booming double to left-center, this one by Michael A. Taylor. Hanser Alberto then bunted back to Ridings, who bounced the throw to first. The ball got away from LeMahieu as Taylor scored and Alberto moved to second.

Joely Rodriguez replaced Ridings and Lopez dropped down a safety squeeze, which scored Alberto.

Luke Voit committed the Yankees’ fourth error on an Andrew Benintendi grounder to lead off the bottom of the eighth against Nick Nelson.

After a pair of walks from Nelson sent Benintendi to third, he scored on an Alberto sacrifice fly for the third unearned run allowed by the Yankees in the game.

The Yankees had initially overcome a slow beginning to Cortes’ start after the lefty had pitched well in his prior two outings.

In the bottom of the first, Perez hit his first homer of the night, a two-run shot to left-center with one out, to give the Royals an early 2-0 lead.

The Yankees got a run back in the third when Andrew Velazquez scored on a wild pitch after reaching on his first hit for the team, a double.

Higashioka put the Yankees up 3-2 with a 408-foot, two-run homer in the fourth after a Rougned Odor walk.

Cortes settled in after the Perez homer, at one point retiring 10 in a row.

The Yankees had a chance to add to their lead when they loaded the bases in the fifth on three walks, but with two out, Odor struck out.

After Cortes retired the first two batters in the fifth, Merrifield doubled and stole third. Higashioka’s throw was high and wide, and Odor had to jump over a sliding Merrifield to try to catch it. The ball defected into left field and Merrifield scored on Higashioka’s throwing error, his second of the game, to tie the score 3-3.

Jonathan Davis walked in the sixth and advanced to second on a wild pitch. After Velazquez struck out, LeMahieu singled to right to knock in Davis with the go-ahead run before the Yankees let it slip away.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Mets were a feel-good story early on, weren’t they? Every next-man-up seemed to come through with an unexpected game-saving or game-winning feat, with one of those guys, by the name of Albert Almora Jr., even sacrificing his face by running smack into the wall like a latter-day Pete Reiser.

There was a smoke-and-mirrors aspect to it all and there was some magic in the air, certainly so when Jacob deGrom and the promise of history took the mound every sixth day … or 11th … or 16th … or, well you get the idea.

The fact is, the Mets were able to concoct a record good enough to take residency of first place for 90 consecutive days, beginning on May 8. But all things must pass. So, after dropping out of the lead Friday, then sliding to third place, they were 2 ¹/₂ games back entering Tuesday’s game at Citi Field against Washington. The game was suspended in the top of the second inning, after a 1:57 rain delay, with the Nationals on top, 3-1.

But even when riding high in May, June and the first half of July, nobody in management made the mistake of confusing this group with the 1986 Mets. That was even before the recent downturn, in which the club dropped four straight, seven of eight and nine of 11 largely because of offensive impotence. That’s life.

“Obviously there’s plenty of games left and we have a chance to still compete and win this division,” acting general manager Zack Scott said an hour or so before Carlos Carrasco’s first pitch Tuesday. “That said, we’ve played very mediocre baseball for most of the year.

Carlos Carrasco examines the ball during the first inning in which he allowed three runs. The Mets-Nationals game was suspended in the top of the second by rain and will be played as part of a doubleheader on Wednesday. Jason Szenes

“This recent stretch has been much worse than mediocre. We’d have taken mediocre at this point, but for this stretch it’s been unacceptably bad and we need to be better.”

Remember the Willie-or-Mickey-type debate a few years ago that revolved around who’d you rather have in right field: Aaron Judge or Michael Conforto? Well, no mas. Conforto, not that long ago the Mets organization’s shining jewel, has a .201/.331/.339 slash line on the cusp of free agency.

It’s kind of like Willie or Mickey has become Willie or Don Hahn?

It is not, of course, only Conforto whose numbers on the back of the baseball card seem counterfeit. Before going down to an oblique strain in mid-July, Francisco Lindor could have slid right into a starring role on the Netflix show “Imposters.”

One by one, the Mets have underachieved. One by one, the underachievers haven’t even been mediocre, and there’s that comparatively low bar again that too many players have been unable to surmount.

When the offense malfunctioned early, management fired hitting coach Chili Davis and his assistant, Tom Slater. But Scott does not hold their replacements, Hugh Quattlebaum and assistant Kevin Howard, responsible for the ongoing club-wide malaise. Maybe because they are this regime’s guys.

“The way I look at hitting coaches is that it’s about what they’re doing on a daily basis, how they’re working,” the acting GM said. “The team of hitting coaches has to be able to identify and evaluate what’s not working for a player and what makes a player tick and what puts him on track to be the best version of himself.

The Mets hoped acquiring Javier Baez would be the spark to rally the team. Getty Images

“That work has been going on, I’m satisfied with the level of work that’s been going on. It’s a no-stone-uncovered type of approach. That work is good and I’m satisfied with that. It’s definitely better than what I was seeing early on, when it was clear that we needed to make a change.”

That’s all well and good, but the change was made more than three months ago and the Mets are still not hitting.

“At some point, though,” Scott acknowledged, “you have to have results.”

Translation: It’s on the players.

Lindor is out, Javier Baez is out with some sort of lower back or hip thing, Conforto missed a fair amount of time with a hamstring problem, Jeff McNeil missed more than a month with a hamstring issue, Carrasco missed most of the year with a torn hamstring and Luis Guillorme is on the IL with a hamstring strain. MLB has been hit with a crushing wave of injuries this season, so it is unfair to suggest that Queens is the epicenter of an epidemic, but Scott absolved his medical staff — “the performance team” — of responsibility.

“Most of the time, I’ll be honest, it’s compliance issues,” the acting GM said. “It’s actually following the plan because these are all individuals and control their own bodies and sometimes they are not as compliant as they should be.”

Translation: It’s on the players.

The season is not entirely lost. Yes, the Mets have 13 straight against the Dodgers and Giants when this three-game series with the Nationals ends, but that will be followed by 14 straight against Washington and Miami.

“We’re not going to panic,” Scott said. “It’s baseball, and being in the game for a long time, there’s always a chance.”

Oh, to be mediocre again.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Even the man with everything riding on Daniel Jones knows it’s go-time.

Dave Gettleman admitted as much.

“This is an important year for Daniel and an important year for us,” the Giants’ general manager said on SiriusXM NFL Radio on Tuesday. “What can I tell you? I’m stating the obvious.”

Jones must have a big year to prove he is the franchise quarterback Gettleman thought he would become when he took him with the sixth pick in the 2019 draft. Gettleman went on to say he has “great confidence” in Jones, who is entering his third season in the NFL.

Gettleman has surrounded Jones with more talent, adding two receivers in the offseason — top free agent Kenny Golladay and first-round pick Kadarius Toney (20th overall) — along with veteran tight end Kyle Rudolph. Star running back Saquon Barkley will return. And, after having to learn a new offense each of his first two years in the league, Jones is now in his second year in offensive coordinator Jason Garrett’s system.

Its go-time for Daniel Jones. Robert Sabo for the NY POST

“He’s done some really good stuff in camp so far,” Gettleman said. “You have to remember he switched offenses [after his first year]. It takes time. But I have great confidence in Daniel Jones.”

Consistency has so far eluded Jones, and so has winning. He has won eight starts and lost 18. He had 24 touchdown passes and just 12 interceptions as a rookie, but lost 11 fumbles. He cut down on his fumbles last year, losing only six, but threw just 11 touchdown passes as the Giants’ offense finished next-to-last in the NFL in points per game at 17.5. His passer rating fell, from 87.7 as a rookie to 80.4 a year ago.

Jones will have more weapons this year, but also will face more pressure. As Gettleman said, it’s an important year for him. In other words, it’s time for him to produce.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hamsah Nasirildeen’s first NFL game will include a strangely familiar – and not entirely pleasant – coincidence.

He will be on one side of an in-state rivalry, likely as a starting outside linebacker for the Jets on Saturday. Fellow rookie Kadarius Toney will be on the opposite side for the Giants when the two teams open their preseason schedules.

Just like on Nov. 30, 2019, when Nasirildeen, playing for Florida State, tore the ACL in his left knee over-pursuing a tackle on Toney as the Florida receiver cut back across the field. Enough similarity to create nerves about a repeat scenario?

“Nah, I don’t think like that,” Nasirildeen said. “I honestly just think he’s a good player and I like the way he plays the game, but I don’t concern myself with stuff like that. I’ve got to tackle people every day.”

Nasirildeen has been a quick study in his move from college safety to NFL outside linebacker. So much so that the sixth-round pick surprisingly seems ahead of veteran Blake Cashman for the chance to start opposite C.J. Mosley in the Jets’ 4-3 defense.

“I try to pick his brain every time he talks,” Nasirildeen said of Mosley, who is returning from his own year away after a COVID-19 opt-out. “Even as he is playing, I try to watch how he steals plays and steals opportunities.”

Hamsah Nasirildeen Bill Kostroun/New York Post

It seems it took Nasirildeen longer to get used to the linebacker label – “I’ve said ‘safety’ a couple times,” he admitted – than to earn the coaches’ trust.

“Hamsah looks fantastic. He’s got a lot of energy to him,” coach Robert Saleh said. “It’s a matter of continuing to learn the game and learn the process.”

Nasirildeen returned from the ACL tear to play the final two games of the 2020 season, giving NFL scouts a chance to evaluate his movement after surgery and coaches a chance to understand his commitment. Still, he fell further than expected during the draft and is changing positions.

“It’s the same game,” he said. “Just seeing it from a different perspective. Everything is a little bit closer, happening a little bit faster, so things like my footwork and my eye discipline are a little more key just because of the distance I am from the plays.”

If he and Toney line up face-to-face in tight quarters, there won’t be lingering bad blood.

“He’s out there trying to make a play, I’m out there trying to make a play,” Nasirildeen said. “That’s all we can do.”

Offensive lineman David Moore debuted in Jets practice Tuesday, one day after the undrafted rookie was claimed off waivers from the Panthers. Did the Jets find a steal? The Bears, Browns and Raiders also attempted to claim Moore, according to ESPN, but were lower down the priority list.

The Jets’ Green-White scrimmage at MetLife Stadium last Saturday was a chance for rookies to get adjusted to the stage before facing the Giants.

“Seeing the stadium from the inside for the first time and being on that field was a surreal moment for me,” cornerback Michael Carter II said, “but also I felt like I belonged in that place and I had a job to do. I didn’t feel like it was too big for me to be able to do what I needed to do.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Mets are leaving open the possibility that Noah Syndergaard will fill a bullpen role if he returns to their roster in September.

The former All-Star hurler hasn’t pitched in the majors since 2019 due to Tommy John surgery during spring training the following year.

Acting general manager Zack Scott acknowledged before Tuesday’s game against the Nationals that Syndergaard might not have enough time to build up his arm to work as a starting pitcher this season.

“I think I’ve said this before, that he’s someone that obviously has a lot of talent, has the potential to impact the game,” Scott said before the Mets game against the Nationals was suspended. “And at this point in the year — and you just mentioned the sense of urgency and coming in and contributing in a shorter relief outing, whether that’s a two or three inning outing or whatever it may be, I think getting him to help the big league club is, is the priority when you get down to these last couple months of the season.

Noah Syndergaard Corey Sipkin

“So if we can get him to come back in a relief role faster than he could — which is typically the case, typically you want to stretch a guy out to be a starter, it’s going to take longer rehab. So I think we’re looking at September, getting him back in September, in a role where he can help the club, whether in relief would be a good thing for us to do.”

The 28-year-old Syndergaard has been throwing off a mound for a couple of weeks, including Sunday in Philadelphia, but the Mets have announced no plans yet for him to begin a minor league rehab assignment.

Javier Baez was out of the lineup, but possibly available off the bench with what manager Luis Rojas described as back tightness after he left Sunday’s loss in Philadelphia with what the Mets initially termed hip tightness. Jonathan Villar started at shortstop.

With infielders Francisco Lindor, Luis Guillorme and Jose Peraza already on the injured list, Rojas said either Brandon Drury or Jeff McNeil would be the emergency shortstop.

Jacob deGrom’s planned two-week throwing shutdown from forearm tightness will end later this week. He then will undergo another MRI exam “and we’ll have a plan of care from there,” Scott said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Observations from Giants training camp on Tuesday.

Shane gain

Projected starting left guard Shane Lemieux returned to live 11-on-11 team drills for the first time since suffering a knee injury July 29. That’s significant for a young group of offensive linemen that can use all the practice time together possible.

‘O’ no!

The offense struggled mightily. It committed two turnovers — interceptions of Daniel Jones and Mike Glennon — and lacked cohesion. The first-team offensive line had its problems giving the quarterbacks time, a camp-long issue.

Darnay Holmes Corey Sipkin for the NY Post

Caught my eye

It was a big day for cornerback Darnay Holmes. He picked off Glennon during 7-on-7 drills, broke up a pass in the end zone intended for Sterling Shepard and also had a “sack” of Jones on a blitz in live team drills.

Injury report

OT Nate Solder, WR Alex Bachman and TE Jake Hausmann left practice and didn’t return. Bachman and Hausmann went inside with trainers, while Solder remained on the field, although he stayed on the sideline. WR John Ross, who appeared to hurt his hamstring on Monday, was off to the side during practice, as were fellow WR Kenny Golladay, DB Jarren Williams and C Jonotthan Harrison. Golladay, dealing with a hamstring injury, caught passes in a stationary position. Saquon Barkley took part in individual drills for the second straight day.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lorenzo Carter wouldn’t allow his injury to beat him down. He had a season to prepare for.

When Carter ruptured his left Achilles tendon in Week 5 at Dallas last year, it cost him the rest of his third season in the NFL. But while the injury might have prevented the outside linebacker from playing, it couldn’t stop him from improving.

“I’m a veteran now,” Carter told The Post on Tuesday. “There’s no time to be a step behind.”

The outside linebacker dedicated himself to getting better by watching, studying some of the best pass-rushers in the NFL and talking to different people around the league. He couldn’t afford to not be primed for his fourth season with the Giants, the last year of his rookie contract. Carter couldn’t be on the field with his teammates, but he had the ability to be ready when his Achilles tendon healed.

“That was one thing I focused on this year, being more of a student of the game, understanding everything,” he said. “I see what works for other people and I try to replicate it.”

Lorenzo Carter and Kevin Durant N.Y. Post: Charles Wenzelberg; Getty Images

It remains to be seen what kind of player Carter will be after the first major injury of his career. He gained belief in himself by going to a few Nets games at Barclays Center and watching Kevin Durant play. Durant had the same injury as Carter — they share the same doctor — and returned as dynamic as before.

“It gives me a lot of confidence. Just seeing what he’s been doing. … I was just excited to see him ball, get the chance to go out there and do the same thing,” Carter said. “It just let me know he put the work in. You got to put that work in. It’s going to be hard — it’s always hard coming back from an injury. But you got to step up to the challenge and that’s what he did, and I plan on doing the same thing.”

This would be the perfect year for Carter to break out, because the Giants are in desperate need of productive edge rushers. Kyle Fackrell, their best player at getting to the quarterback from the outside a year ago, wasn’t brought back. Markus Golden was traded to the Cardinals during the season. There are a host of question marks at the position now — from unproven youngsters to players returning from injury to low-risk veterans — and no clear-cut answers.

There were high hopes for Carter after the Giants took him in the third round in the 2018 draft. But he has yet to live up to their expectations. He had 8.5 sacks and 44 tackles in 14 starts over his first two seasons. Then, the 25-year-old linebacker managed just one sack and 15 tackles in four games last season prior to his injury early in the fifth game.

But Carter believes the concern is overblown. The Giants have heard the talk of the lack of pass-rushers. He thinks the team has more than enough talent in the room to get the job done, whether it’s Ifeadi Odenigbo finding his 2019 form (seven sacks with the Vikings), second-round pick Azeez Ojulari making an immediate impact, or any of the many others battling for playing time.

“On the outside a lot of people think we need pass-rushers or it’s a big thing. First, it’s not. We got the guys we need right here,” said Carter, who has been getting first-team reps during training camp and even has been used at times at strong-side linebacker. “We got that chip on our shoulder, where we’re ready to come out here and play some ball.”

Carter can’t wait for the games to begin, to apply what he learned during his recovery time. He thought every day about returning. It made him appreciate the game even more.

“I’m going to take advantage,” Carter said, “of every chance I get.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Zack Britton said he agrees with the assessment of many Yankees fans regarding his performance this season.

“Really just pitching like s–t,’’ Britton told The Post on Tuesday. “I’m beyond frustrated at this point. I’m not getting my body to do what I want it to, like last year and the years before that.”

The trend continued in Monday’s win over the Royals, when Britton couldn’t protect a one-run lead in the ninth in a game the Yankees won in 11 innings.

With Aroldis Chapman on the injured list due to left elbow inflammation, Britton issued a two-out walk to Whit Merrifield, which was followed by a stolen base and a single by Nickey Perez that tied the score.

The left-hander was coming off three straight scoreless outings, but has given up at least a run in eight of his 16 appearances this season, dealing with command issues that might be related to the elbow surgery he underwent in spring training.

“There are a lot of reasons,’’ Britton said of his struggles. “Missing spring training was huge.”

He pointed to his last subpar season, which came after he had Achilles surgery during the offseason.

“I had COVID, then elbow surgery,’’ Britton said. “Missing reps in spring leads to an uphill battle. I’m trying to help the team in high leverage [situations]. That’s my job.”

The results have led Britton to second-guess his decision to get bone chips removed from his elbow during the spring.

He now thinks he may have been better off regaining the weight lost during his bout of COVID-19 and trying to pitch through it.

“In hindsight, maybe it was something I could have pitched with and wouldn’t have felt it,’’ Britton said.

Asked if he thought he’d get back to where he’s been, Britton said he was optimistic he would.

“I’m pretty confident I’ll get there this year,’’ Britton said. “It’s gonna be a grind.”

Britton and manager Aaron Boone pointed to his increased velocity in Monday’s outing and both felt his stuff has been getting better.

Through the first months of his comeback, though, Britton said he was “fighting with his delivery. … At some point I’ll feel normal. I thought I’d feel better by now, so I’m a little frustrated.”

The shaky season has come after the Yankees picked up Britton’s $14 million option for 2022 to prevent the left-hander from potentially opting out of his deal following last season.

The decision meant the Yankees decided to keep Britton for two years and $27 million rather than possibly see him walk.

In his last 11 appearances, Britton has allowed eight runs — seven earned — along with eight walks in 10 innings.

Overall, Britton’s walk rate has skyrocketed to a career-high 6.91 per nine innings. And he has stranded a career-worst 59.3 percent of inherited runners. His ground ball rate slipped from 77.2 percent in 2019 to 71.7 a year ago and 68.4 this year.

Though ERA can be deceiving when it comes to relievers, Britton’s has gone from 1.91 in 2019 and 1.89 last year to 5.65 this season.

Zack Britton Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

But the news isn’t all discouraging. According to Fangraphs, Britton has given up more soft contact — and less medium and hard contact — than in previous seasons.

And opposing hitters’ exit velocity is 82.8 mph, Britton’s best since tracking began in 2015.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@To paraphrase a great baseball man, sometimes you lose, and sometimes it rains.

The skidding Mets’ series opener against the Nationals was suspended in the top of the second inning Tuesday night after a nearly two-hour rain delay at Citi Field, with the Mets trailing, 3-1.

The game will be resumed at 4:10 p.m. Wednesday and be completed as a full nine-inning contest. It will be followed by the regularly scheduled game, which now will be a seven-inning contest.

Carlos Carrasco was tagged for two singles followed by Juan Soto’s three-run home run in the first inning. The Mets recouped one run on consecutive doubles by Pete Alonso (ending his 0-for-21 skid) and Dom Smith in the bottom half of the first.

Carrasco also allowed a leadoff single to Riley Adams in the top of the second before the umpiring crew called for the tarp. The rain delay lasted one hour and 57 minutes before the suspension was announced.

Luis Rojas said reliever Drew Smith would have come in to replace Carrasco to resume Tuesday night’s game if it had been restarted. The manager was undecided on who will start the resumption on Wednesday afternoon, though Rojas said Marcus Stroman will start the nightcap for the Mets, who have lost 15 of 24 since the All-Star break to slip to third place in the NL East.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — When Nets rookie Day’Ron Sharpe checked into the team’s summer-league opener Monday, he made his impact felt in every sense of the word.

“The [coaches] told me I did a great job. The time I had when I was on the court I did a great job,” Sharpe said. “Just keep screen and rolling hard, keep turning around and grabbing rebounds, doing what I’m doing with my game.”

The big center threw his weight around in the paint, and finished with six points, eight rebounds, a steal and a block. He finished his pro debut a team-high plus-14 in just 14:26 against the Grizzlies.

“He could be a great rim protector just his size alone. They felt him right away. Memphis guards, they’d try to get downhill, they’d see him [and] right away pull back out,” summer league coach Jordan Ott said. “That’s a big reason — and screening; offensively he could be a great screener and still be dynamic enough to roll. Great hands.

“And obviously offensive rebounding, you can feel him throwing people. You talk about steps … it’s so obvious, the young guys you could literally see step-by-step development from Day 1 to Day’Ron to know. It’s almost like a kid. I have a nine month old [and] you can see the progress, see these kids, it’s awesome. That’s kind of why we’re here. So exciting to see.”

The most exciting thing for the Nets was when Sharpe came up with a steal and went the other way for a layup.

For a 6-foot-11 center — who has shed 25-pounds the past few months to get down to a svelte 253 — it was an auspicious sign.

“Our scouts talked about his ball skills on the perimeter — I think a little bit at [North] Carolina. But scouting has been going on for a while, so his high school years I believe they say the perimeter skills [were there],” Ott said. “We can definitely see it in practice. It’s probably going to take a little bit to see him, but he’s comfortable out there on the perimeter offensively.”

Sharpe said he always has been able to put the ball on the floor — but it just wasn’t required at North Carolina and likely won’t be needed in Brooklyn.

“I feel like I could dribble a little bit. In high school, my coach let me do what I want, and in AAU he’d seen it in me, so he pushed me to do it more. But right now, the team I’m going to I don’t really have to do that,” Sharpe said. “So whatever I got to play to win the game, that’s the role I take. If it’s going to rebound, blocking shots, I’ll do that. If I had the ball in my hands more I’ll do that.”

Brandon Knight had nine points in Monday’s opening loss, but seven fouls in just 26:20. After having not played last season, it was the 29-year-old’s first game in a year-and-a-half and there was rust.

“A little bit. It’s summer league; it’s a different speed in summer league. It’s obvious if anyone takes time, 16, 18 months off, you’ve got to give them a little grace, throw them into a live NBA basketball action,” Ott said. “But yeah, overall, very good. He’s still trying to lead it, when to be aggressive, when to get off of it. He’s learning his teammates, too at the same time.”

Every Net came through Monday’s game healthy and practiced Tuesday.

The 27-year-old point guard turned down a monster extension earlier in the year and bet on himself, but financially, it backfired – by about $80 million.

Schroder got injured late last season and struggled in the Lakers’ first-round loss to the Suns – the Lakers responded by trading for nine-time NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook and signing a variety of veterans earlier to replace Schroder earlier in the offseason.

Schroder averaged 15.4 points per game on 43.7 percent shooting from the field and 33.5 percent shooting from deep in the 2020-21 regular season for the Lakers. The year prior on the Thunder, the Brunswick, Germany native averaged 18.9 points per game on 46.9 percent shooting from the field and 38.5 percent from beyond the arc.

During free agency, Schroder was the odd man out on the point guard market. Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Lonzo Ball, Mike Conley, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte’ Graham and Derrick Rose all got their money, leaving Schroder with slim pickings.

The Celtics needed a floor general after trading Kemba Walker to the Thunder – he was eventually bought out and signed with the Knicks – and they snagged Schroder to a cheap deal to play alongside Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Clint Frazier began a rehab assignment with Low-A Tampa on Tuesday as he tries to come back from the mystery ailment that has sidelined him since he left a game on June 30.

Manager Aaron Boone said the Yankees have been unable to determine exactly what has caused Frazier’s issues, testing for concussion-related symptoms, as well as vision issues.

“I know he’s in a pretty good place,’’ Boone said before Frazier went 2-for-4 with a double and two strikeouts for Tampa.

But when asked if there is even a spot for Frazier on the roster now that the Yankees have added Joey Gallo, Boone didn’t say yes.

“We’ll see,’’ Boone said. “That’s a ways off to even think about. … I’m not gonna speculate. Our roster is as fluid as it could possibly be. Every time I’m making a plan for the next few days, something gets turned upside down.”

He did note, “We know what Clint is capable [of] and his talent. He needs to get games under his belt.”

Giancarlo Stanton started in left field Tuesday in an 8-4 loss to the Royals at Kauffman Stadium.

Gallo went hitless and struck out three times in the Yankees’ loss as his struggles continue. Since a three-hit game on Aug. 5, Gallo is 2-for-18 with 11 strikeouts.

Boone remains unconcerned.

“He’s gonna strike out,’’ Boone said. “Along with it is a guy, over time, who’s gonna get on a ton, hit with authority and be a great two-way player for us.”

Despite the lack of results, Boone said Gallo is “in the fight all the time. There’s gonna be a stretch when he’s gonna get super hot.”

Luis Severino (elbow surgery, strained groin) is scheduled to make another rehab start Friday and could be back with the Yankees next week, while Corey Kluber is due to make his first rehab start from a strained shoulder on Thursday.

Domingo German (shoulder inflammation) could throw a bullpen session Thursday.

There’s no help coming from Deivi Garcia, who allowed five earned runs in 4 ¹/₃ innings Tuesday for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The struggling right-hander also walked five as his ERA jumped to 7.25.

Boone said there was no update on Aroldis Chapman, on the IL with left elbow inflammation. … Not generally known for their speed or prowess on the basepaths, are tied for the MLB-lead with 20 stolen bases since the All-Star break.

The Yankees have already used 57 players this season, their second-highest total in history (58 in 2014). … Andrew Velazquez started at shortstop for a second straight game after being promoted from Triple-A SWB on Monday. The Bronx native got his first hit as a Yankee with a third-inning double and scored later in the inning.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s no secret the Mets need star shortstop Francisco Lindor back.

Lindor injured his right oblique on July 16, against the Pirates. Before the injury, the Mets were 47-41 and in first place in the NL East. Since Lindor’s injury, they were 9-14 heading into Tuesday. That included their 1-6 road trip against the Marlins and Phillies, which ended Sunday and dropped them to third place in the division.

The Mets returned home deflated, depleted and, at many times, looking lethargic. During the trip, they were just 9-for-59 (.153) with runners in scoring position.

Not only do the Mets desperately need Lindor’s bat and fielding ability, but also they need his exuberance and swagger, which he has shown since the Mets acquired him from Cleveland. The shortstop proved his dedication to the team by dying his hair blue, his ear-to-ear grin is contagious and he is constantly trying to inspire his teammates with pep talks.

Francisco Lindor has been sidelined since July 16. Corey Spikin/NY POST

The 27-year-old might not be on the field, but he hasn’t stopped trying to energize the Mets. He has urged them to make it past the dog days of August.

“Just continue to tell them to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. It’s that time of the year. Welcome to August,” Lindor told The Post. “It’s going to be a tough two months, and the best ones that can play in these two months are the ones that come on top.”

When the Mets acquired Javier Baez from the Cubs before the trade deadline, they didn’t just anticipate a lethal middle-of-the-infield combo of Baez and Lindor. They also saw another high-energy player who could have a similar effect as Lindor on the team.

Baez has shown flashes of that. He hit a home run in his debut, but he was hitting .176/.222/.253 since his arrival. Baez also sustained a hip injury Sunday and is considered day-to-day.

The injury to Baez, however, will not affect Lindor’s recovery.

“Even when Baez was healthy, I felt like I needed to get back. I want to get back. I want to be with the boys, I want to grind together.” Lindor said.

The $341 million man has continued to rehab from his injury. He has been hitting and fielding while continuing to rebuild the strength in his oblique. He is still on pace to meet his expected three-to-five-week timeline.

“He’s still, at this point, I’d say week to week. But yeah, he’s progressing well. I wouldn’t say anything’s different,” acting general manager Zack Scott said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Elijah Moore walks toward you with a smile that remains frozen on his face — and tattoos seemingly everywhere.

You ask him which one is his favorite, and he begins the tattoo tour this way:

“I got my mom’s name.”

Elisa, on the back of his left hand.

PEACE, in the middle, above his stomach.

Jeremiah 2:11, on his left pec.

Mary, on his right pec: “When you think of Mary, you just think of like the mother, you think of the protector besides God,” he says.

Moore, on his right shoulder. Poux, on his left shoulder. “I’m a Moore,” he says, “my mom’s a Poux.”

Forever, under his right biceps, Ambitious, under his left biceps.

He is still looking down as he eyes another one: “This is a clock. It says respect the past create the future.”

He moves to the next one: “My birthday [3:27] with a crown on it,” on his left arm.

Lots more.

“I got an angel right here represents my mom,” he says of the tattoo on his left arm.

“Then I got an angel right here holding the world on his back. I feel like it signifies me and my family. I’m like, I guess, the first one that can open doors to something that they haven’t experienced, and I embrace that.”

Elijah Moore can be found at Jets camp with a smile almost always on his face. Bill Kostroun/New York Post

Pride, on his left lat, a cross on his right lat.

“‘Only the strong can survive,’ and I got a picture of myself [on the right calf]’ that says ‘More than Ball.’ Like, I’m more than just football. That’s kinda how I hold myself.”

Elijah Moore is mature well beyond his 21 years.

“I just want to be remembered more than football,” he tells The Post. “If you guys only remember my name for what I did on the field, then I did something wrong. I want to have an impact on kids and people and just everyone around the world more than just what I do on the football field. I want to know that what I say and what I do in my actions can impact people besides just out there. There’s strength in what you say. So just watching my words and saying the right things to people.

“I know I don’t have the answers for everything, but when I do, just give my input on stuff to make somebody else feel better. That’s kinda just how I move.”

He adds: “You need me, I need you, what I say can help you have a great day. You can have a bad day, I come up to you and say, ‘Everything’s gonna be all right.’ And just because I said that you might have a better day. Your words are what people remember.”

“He’s a playmaker,” coach Robert Saleh said of Moore. Bill Kostroun/New York Post

He is a rookie phenom receiver-punt returner who already appears destined to be remembered for football.

“He’s a playmaker,” coach Robert Saleh says simply.

A playmaker who talks to his mother every day.

“It’s just something that we do,” he says. “You might think it’s messed up, but we don’t live forever. My mom’s my world. I just gotta make sure I check in.”

He wears No. 8 for a reason.

“No. 8’s my grandma’s favorite number. Shout-out to Mimi,” Moore says, and laughs.

His quarterback, who struggled in practice again on Tuesday, can use a shout-out too.

“What people don’t understand,” Moore begins, “that’s probably the hardest job on the field. It takes time. But from what I hear and from when I watch him and the questions that he asks, and I continue to say it over and over again, I’m not worried, because of how he is. I’m blessed to have him as my quarterback.”

So Jets fans shouldn’t worry?

“[Not] at all,” Moore says. “Trust me. Zach’s gonna be good. Zach is a leader. … That’s someone who’s here before everybody and stays later than anybody. I’m probably one of the last ones here too and he’s here when I’m here. Even when you see him mess up, his words after, [are] like ‘I got it, we’re good.’”

One other shout-out goes to Saleh: “He has that friendly, but respect representation to him. When he’s serious, everybody’s quiet, trust me.”

He is far more reluctant to give Elijah Moore, far more than a slot receiver, a shout-out.

“They always say it in the team room, the more spots you play, the more things you know, the longer you’ll be in the NFL,” Moore says.

He enjoys punt returns.

“Another way to score a touchdown,” he says.

He relishes the big stage.

“The more eyes the better,” Moore says.

Elijah Moore shows off his tattoos at his pre-draft pro day in March. AP

He is asked for adjectives to describe himself on the football field: “God-fearing, and that’s it.”

How about adjectives to describe his physical abilities? “There’s a whole bunch, I don’t know. I’m very confident in myself. … I don’t really want to answer that.”

Can he make an impact as a rookie? Still smiling, Elijah Moore says: “You’re gonna have to wait to see.”

Goals?

“Yeah, I got goals, but I’d rather keep that to myself.”

He was 6 when he had this NFL dream: “I told my mom I was going to the NFL. And here we are. By the grace of God.”

I ask him if he is driven to be great.

“Of course. I’m driven to be great — 100 percent,” Elijah Moore says.

Moore than a football player. But some kind of football player.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@First came Cali, the birthday girl, bouncing more than running, until her father smoothly scooped the just-turned 3-year-old off the manicured grass. Next came Cassie, the younger daughter, all of 18 months, giving great effort, but trailing behind with those tiny little steps.

“She’s trying to catch up,’’ Sterling Shepard said.

No, it was not Family Day on a humid Tuesday at Giants training camp. Well, not officially, anyway. Most days are Family Day when it comes to the summer operation Joe Judge is running. His practices are hard, but there is a softness to what happens as soon as the final whistle sounds and the conditioning running is completed.

Hot. Tired. Sweaty. No matter. When the kids come racing onto the field, it is every father for himself.

“They don’t care. They’re like ‘Dad pick me up, Dad run around with me’ and I’m exhausted,’’ offensive lineman Nate Solder told The Post.

This was not the way it was a year ago, when COVID-19 protocols made the Giants’ training facility off-limits to all family members. No one knew exactly what Judge, a first-time head coach, would accept and what was verboten. He considers himself old-school in many ways, and old-school training camp was a two-a-day practice endurance grind; families were kept away for days at a time.

Judge embraces plenty of old-time methods, but this is not one of them.

“It doesn’t matter how tough or stressful the practice was, when you see your little ones and your significant other, it does put it in perspective and change the mood for a second,’’ Judge told The Post.

A post-practice scene at Giants camp is filled with youngsters spilling out from the patio adjacent to the team facility, beelining to their fathers like heat-seeking mini-missiles. Footballs take to the air. Cartwheels and foot-races give off a recess vibe.

That was not always the case. Charles Way, a former Giants fullback, arrived in 1995, when the Giants held camp at sweltering Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, N.J. Players stayed in dorm rooms and after a week, wives and kids arrived on the first weekend.

“Things have changed,’’ said Way, who worked for the Giants and the NFL in player development and engagement and currently is in real estate and asset management.

Joe Judge and his family are a fixture after practice. for the NY POST

“You’ve seen how mental health, especially from the Olympics, have played a real critical role and how teams function and organize their daily schedule. When I played and when I was doing player development, it wasn’t totally at the forefront of people’s minds. They know now it’s part of the overall mental health of a player, to have your family members around when they can.’’

Judge had his family at practice Tuesday.

“You see his family here almost every day,’’ Shepard said. “They’re out here running around and that’s something he really emphasizes. You get to know the people that you’re playing with and what they’re fighting for and you’re able to fight for them because you know them on a personal level.’’

Shepard, 28, is the longest-tenured Giants player, entering his sixth season. He has had a great camp, on the field and off it.

“I can be having a really rough day, a terrible practice, but when you see your kids, they give you a bunch of energy, man,’’ he said. “It’s hard to explain, but yeah, they can make you feel like it’s a bright and shiny day even on your rainiest days.’’

Sterling Shepard with his daughter, Cali. Robert Sabo for the NY POST

Judge welcomes in retired Giants — Way and Justin Tuck were there Tuesday — and the former players always marvel how much less intense and grueling this camp is than the ones they endured. True enough, but it is not as if Judge is running Camp Comfort. The day usually starts at 7 a.m. and ends with a return to the team hotel (where most players stay during camp) nearly 12 hours later.

“There’s something that every family and child gets to feel part of the team just by going out there with their dad afterward and catching a ball or giving him a hug on the field,’’ Judge said. “It’s gonna be a long day. Just that 10 minutes right there is invaluable.’’

Way, after the 2006 season, might have turned the fortunes of the entire franchise around, as he implored then-coach Tom Coughlin to show his players the side of himself he put on display when horsing around with his grandchildren after a training camp practice. Coughlin took the advice to heart and his empathy helped the Giants to two Super Bowl triumphs.

“It’s good to have that balance,’’ Solder said. “You got to remember we’re human beings and we’re complex creatures, we can’t just compartmentalize ‘football player’ and ‘dad.’ It all impacts and affects everything.’’

Everything.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anyone who still lives by the saying “defense wins championships” has never played fantasy football.

From a strategic perspective, the position of defense/special teams is only marginally more important than kickers in most fantasy formats. The predictability from season to season is sketchy — the 49ers were supposed to have one of the best defenses last season but suffered a rash of injuries, the Dolphins came out of nowhere to score the fourth-most points at DST, the Patriots a couple of seasons back had an incredible early run when they seemed to score defensive or special teams touchdowns every week.

The point being, it is hard to both pick the best or top sleeper units. This is part of the reason the Madman often streams DSTs from week to week — picking, among those available on the waiver wire, the best defense that is playing against the worst offense each week.

We prefer to land a DST in the draft that doesn’t force us to automatically depend on a streaming strategy, but if we miss on one we like or end up with a dud unit or hit an inconvenient bye-week dilemma, we have no reservations about audibling to the stream approach.

This means we are not going to spend a draft pick on a DST if there is any position player we want still available — we almost always are going to have something close to 3-4 running backs, 3-4 wide receivers, and at least one quarterback and tight end before we even glance at available DSTs.

One DST to be looking at is the 49ers when the draft rolls around. AP

Because we wait until so late to address DST, that often means top units have been snatched up. But that hardly matters because we don’t particularly care for some of the top-rated units as it is.

When we do get to the point in the draft when we are going to look at defenses, we ideally would want the Rams, Buccaneers and 49ers, but those are rarely available.

So instead, we home in on the Colts (a strong unit in a division with mostly weak or inexperienced offenses), but our favorite target is Washington (which has the benefit of excellent talent and playing in a weak division).

If none of these units are available, we go ahead and pull the ripcord and look for Week 1 matchups in anticipation of streaming throughout the season. For this, we’re looking for teams that have good defensive matchups to start the season. The Chargers, Panthers and Dolphins lead this list.

And if all of those are gone, we look for units that could exceed expectations — like the Giants (because they have young talent) and Cowboys (because an improved offense with a healthy Dak Prescott should help create turnover opportunities on defense — but are ready to dump and start streaming when a better one becomes available or we encounter a matchup we don’t like.

So when your draft kicks off, put your DST cheat sheet on the bench for a while and don’t bring it in until the game is almost over. Offense wins fantasy championships.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sometimes you look for signs. You look for omens. You look for harbingers. And sometimes they mean nothing. Maybe in a few months’ time this 8-6, 11-inning, close-to-five-hours victory the Yankees pulled out over the Royals on Monday night in Kansas City will fade to a blur, and be remembered as just another in the 162-game parade.

Or maybe it’ll mean a little something more than that.

At 1:04 a.m. Eastern Time, Wandy Peralta coaxed Carlos Santana to bounce one to third base. Rougned Odor flipped it over to Luke Voit at first. And the Yankees had a most satisfying victory on a most unusual night.

Say what you will about the ghost-runner extra-inning rule — which, with any luck at all, is entering its final two months of existence. But this sure was a fun, crazy, hard-to-believe, impossible-to-forget tug of war, assisted by, but not exclusively beholden to, those four free runners the Yankees and Royals received in the 10th and 11th (all of whom scored, by the way).

The Yankees won the game despite being the first team since the 1995 Astros to collect four blown saves in the same game. The Yankees won the game despite being the first team in the modern era — that would be the 121 years since 1900, for those keeping score at home — to blow leads in the seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th innings.

This was actually a wonderful pitchers’ duel for most of the night, Jameson Taillon and Carlos Hernandez matching zeroes for six innings. It was a tight, quick game — until it wasn’t. It was a routine game — until it wasn’t.

The Yankees looked bound to lose the game.

Except they didn’t. Remember this one. Circle it. Highlight it in yellow. You may want to remember it.

“So many people did stuff tonight,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “On a scorching-hot night they kept coming.”

It was a night preceded by an afternoon in which the Yankees lost another player — Gleyber Torres landing on the injured list with a sprained thumb — and learned that another, Gio Urshela, wouldn’t be returning from a balky hamstring as quickly as they’d hoped, kept behind in New York for more rehab.

They keep losing players and winning games.

It may not be the ideal formula. But it works.

And so it goes. And on it goes.

“We’ve got a lot of really good players focused on winning, understanding the critical place we are in our season,” Boone had said before the game, giving further voice to the next-man-up mantra that must be a part of every Yankees manager’s playbook. “There’s no other expectations here except to keep winning games. We have a lot of players capable of playing at a very high level.”

Even with a list of absent players that’s almost staggering to behold — Gerrit Cole, Domingo German, Gary Sanchez, Urshela, Torres, Anthony Rizzo, Jordan Montgomery — the Yankees won again. Winning, as a habit, it’s a helpful thing especially at this time of the year. No matter who’s wearing the uniform.

“It was one of the weirder wilder games I’ve ever seen,” said Taillon, who was terrific across six innings, allowing but one unearned run. “Every time we needed a big hit we got one. Every time they needed a big hit they got one.”

Right up to Santana, bottom 11, the tying runs on base, the Royals fans among the 18,477 at Kauffman Stadium on their feet, the not-insignificant number of Yankees fans watching through hands stretched over their eyes.

“We’ve lost some tough games this year,” Boone said, “but the fact that we’ve played in so many I think helped us tonight. There’s a comfort level in playing in them.”

And an even higher one winning them.

“A grind,” said Luke Voit, back from purgatory, who had two huge hits including what looked like the game-winning homer in the ninth.

Even with all the new faces, learning on the fly, these Yankees are not only learning how to play like Yankees, but win like Yankees, too. Good stuff.

The Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves each went 6-2 in their first eight games after the July 30 trade deadline, and both will look to a veteran starter when they collide Tuesday night in Atlanta.

Reds starter Sonny Gray enters Tuesday having struck out at least six batters in five of his past six starts and is getting 11.4 strikeouts per nine innings this season, but has allowed 18 runs across 19 innings in his past four starts.

Those swings and misses should come in handy against a Braves offense that ranks second in the NL in home runs with 1.4 per game and third in the NL in runs per game at home with 5.25, but rates 23rd in the majors in strikeouts per game at home with 9.09.

The Reds had scored at least four runs in 15 straight games prior to their 3-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday despite slugger Nick Castellanos missing 12 of those games.

With Braves starter Drew Smyly posting a 4.71 ERA in his seven home starts and the Braves going 2-5 in those, look for the Reds to continue their playoff push.

The Play: Reds, -105.

The game changed, and it changed quickly. College football players can get paid now. Well, allow me to rephrase. College football players can now be paid out in the open. What would once get you suspended can now earn you a nice little living.

Oh, and the College Football Playoff is expanding. Not now. Probably not next year. But a bigger bracket is imminent. More meaningful games to wager on. More meaningful matchups between programs that rarely cross paths. More of everything.

For as much as college football is changing, the biggest change 2021 will welcome should be familiar. Fans. Full stadiums. Live mascots. Pageantry. Traditions. Elements that make college football the greatest sport on the planet — to watch and to wager on — are back.

With that, let’s look at some of the biggest storylines entering the season

Home-field advantage is back

Gambling on college football games in largely or completely empty stadiums took some getting used to. I hated it, and I am sure you did too.

It did, however, allow underdogs to have their moments. It made a road trip, in many instances, far less daunting. Playing in an empty Happy Valley last year wasn’t kind to Penn State. The same for Wisconsin in Madison and Ohio State in Columbus. In a limited season, none of the three was over .500 ATS at home.

Clemson’s D.J. Uiagalelei AP

Barring the unforeseen, college football will completely welcome back fans and home-field advantages in 2021. Normally, this wouldn’t be a story. You handicap matchups with the environment accounted for. This year, those environments will almost certainly be more amped than usual.

A new crop of gifted quarterbacks

Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields and Mac Jones are gone, yet Clemson, Ohio State and Alabama all will be ranked in the top five when the season begins.

We have an idea who some of the next stars will be. D.J. Uiagalelei showed us glimpses last year for Clemson. Spencer Rattler showcased even more for Oklahoma. Sam Howell for North Carolina posted video-game numbers at times, and he likely will again. All three will be among the most popular wagers to win the Heisman.

But there will be fresh faces in meaningful games — faces we learn early on. Who will be the next Zach Wilson or Joe Burrow? If you have an idea, don’t wait long to pounce. There will be money to be made early before the rest catch on.

Can a non-quarterback win the Heisman again?

It seems likely DeVonta Smith’s magnificent triumph in 2020 will be an outlier. That said, we know now a wide receiver is still capable of winning the Heisman.

Is this finally Georgia’s year?

In a word, maybe. Over the last five years, Georgia has Alabama-ified its roster with five-star recruits. And this fall it welcomes back 20 returning starters.

The offensive line could be the best in the country. The quarterback, JT Daniels, should rapidly develop. The defense should be excellent — perhaps even better than it was a season ago — headlined by a superb line.

Everything is in place for this to finally be the year, including Alabama having to replace so many important pieces at once. But we’ve had this conversation before. Georgia fans know it all too well.

At -400 at BetMGM, there isn’t much value in betting the team to win the SEC East. But I like Georgia to win the SEC at +230. This, to me, is the most gifted and complete football team in the country.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marissa Rohan — the Los Angeles Dodgers ball girl — has been dubbed a “hero” after she tackled a fan who ran onto the field during Sunday’s 6-1 win over the rival Angels.

Rohan, who reps a No. 93 Dodgers jersey on the field, got the job done after a number of security personnel couldn’t catch the intruder. Rohan has worked for the team since 2019, but Sunday’s fan take-down is believed to be her first-ever viral field moment.

Rohan has been reposting messages and support from others to her Instagram Story. She even joked that Sunday was a “rough day at work.”

“Yeah I am not going to stop talking about this lol,” she captioned a news story about her play on Instagram.

The 24-year-old is a senior at Cal State Northridge, pursuing a degree in deaf studies. She is a proud member of Alpha Phi sorority.

Rohan is a former gymnast and softball player, according to past posts on her public Instagram account — where she documents her relationship with boyfriend Justin Fallon, a ticket operations supervisor with the Dodgers.

When she’s not saving the day at Dodger Stadium, Rohan is like any other college student. She enjoys snowboarding, partying in Vegas, snapping the occasional selfie, and hitting the beach with friends.

Bottom line: Don’t try to get past the Dodgers ball girl.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The grass isn’t always greener on the other side.

Free agent point guard Dennis Schroder is seemingly having a tough time with the fallout from his decision to decline the $84 million extension the Lakers offered him in March.

“I think he’s in a state of shock because of what he’s done,” a source told the Boston Herald’s Mark Murphy about how Schroder feels months after his choice.

The 27-year-old was dealt to Los Angeles from Oklahoma City last offseason. He excelled in his starting role with the Lakers and worked well alongside veterans LeBron James and Anthony Davis. However, Schroder thought he could work out a bigger deal.

When the free agency window opened on Aug. 2, teams didn’t gravitate toward Schroder as expected — and the Lakers wasted no time trading for point guard Russell Westbrook from the Wizards, along with a slew of veteran stars, closing the door on a possible Schroder return.

Though the market for starting point guards is slim, the 6-foot-3 point Schroder found a temporary home in Boston, signing a one-year deal with the Celtics for the $5.9 million exception, according to ESPN, following Kemba Walker’s departure to the Knicks.

“The Celtics have pitched Schroder the idea of backing up Marcus Smart next season,” but, “he needs time,” following the “shock” of his Lakers fallout, according to the Boston Herald.

On Tuesday, NBA reporter Jordan Schultz reported that Boston offered Schroder a one-year deal at the taxpayer $5.9 million mid-level exception. However, Schroder reportedly wants the full MLE, which is $9.5M, and a second-year player option. The Celtics don’t want to be pressed to exceed the cap, Schultz reported.

With the Lakers, Schroder averaged 15.4 points, 5.8 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game while shooting 43.7 percent from the field. He’s become a solid two-way player with playmaking abilities and could add depth to the Celtics alongside Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.

The caveat with Boston acquiring Schroder is his desire to be a starting point guard. If he’s brought on behind Smart, it’s possible he could run into chemistry and relationship issues in Boston — something the team has dealt with at the point guard position since Kyrie Irving’s Celtics stint.

After two impressive years of coming off the bench in Oklahoma City, Schroder dismissed the idea of a bench role when he joined the Lakers.

“I did this off the bench stuff already the last two years in OKC. I think with LeBron and AD I can be helpful as a starter in the PG position,” he said in Dec. 2020.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cameron Burrell, a former national champion 100-meter sprinter at the University of Houston and the son of Olympic gold medal-winning parents, has died. He was 26.

No cause of death has been announced.

After claiming a state title at Ridge Point High School, Burrell won the NCAA individual national championship in the 100-meter dash in 2018, something his father, Leroy Burrell, did 28 years prior.

In that same season, the Atlanta native ran the anchor leg for the Cougars in their championship 4×100-meter relay. The team defended its NCAA national championship in that event.

Burrell — the 121st man to break the 10-second barrier in the 100-meter sprint — turned pro after his collegiate career. In May, he was pictured on the cover of Red Bull’s magazine Red Bulletin. Burrell shared the cover image on Instagram with the caption, “If you ain’t seen me lately just know I’ve been working. Now it’s time to show the world my gift.”

Burrell came from an iconic track and field family. His father was the former world record holder in the 100 meters and his mother, Michelle Finn-Burrell, won a sprint relay gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Spain. His aunt, Dawn Burrell, participated in the long jump at the 2000 Olympics in Australia. His godfather, Carl Lewis, won nine gold medals and is one of the most well-known athletes in history.

“My family is extremely saddened with the loss of our son, Cameron, last night. We are going through profound sorrow and ask that all of our friends, extended University of Houston family and the track and field community in the U.S. and abroad allow us to gather with our closest family and friends,” Burrell’s father and longtime Houston track and field coach said in a statement. “We are profoundly grief stricken and thank everyone for the outpouring of prayers and support. We will forward more information when it is available.”

Funeral arrangements are unknown, but the university will announce more information at a later time. The school will have counseling services available to track and field athletes, coaches and athletic department staff members.

The 25-year-old gold medal-winning gymnast recently launched The McKayla Collection on the NFT marketplace OpenSea starting at 15 Ethereum (worth approximately $47,776). She thinks her auction will sell for over $1 million.

“There really has been a gap in sports and capturing iconic moments like that,” Maroney told TMZ Sports at Enso Art Gallery & Studio in Malibu, Calif. “And to put my meme out, I’m just so excited to do that because it’s something that meant a lot to me and it really changed my life.”

The listing includes digital art of Maroney’s “Not Impressed” meme made famous at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London after Maroney won a silver medal.

It also comes with a private gymnastics lesson, a Twitter follow, a meet-and-greet and a signed copy of her upcoming book.

“In honor of the 2021 Olympic Women’s Gymnastics team wrapping up their competitions in Tokyo, I’m releasing my 1/1 Not Impressed meme,” the description of the auction states. “This will be the only one of its kind ever minted.”

NFT stands for non-fungible token, meaning the currency is unique. NFTs are one-of-a-kind pieces of digital art – including trading cards, music, AI or drawings – with intrinsic value that can be collected.

Ethereum is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Initially released on July 30, 2015, it is the most actively used blockchain.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dutch track and field star Lieke Klaver failed to medal at the Tokyo Olympics — but she returned home to the Netherlands with a much larger social media following.

Klaver, who competed in the mixed relay and women’s relay final for the Netherlands, has become a trending topic on TikTok, even without an account of her own.



Since her Tokyo debut, TikTokers have been using her name as a hashtag to gush over her stunning looks. She’s even inspired a trend for social media users to jokingly declare they’re moving to the Netherlands.

The Olympian has become such a hot topic on TikTok that it’s boosted her following on other social media platforms. Klaver reportedly arrived in Tokyo with 275,000 Instagram followers, and exited the Summer Games with close to 500,000.

Klaver, a student at HAN University of Applied Sciences, began running at the age of 9. Now she’s a two-time Olympic finalist, a European Indoor championships gold medallist and a World Championships finalist. She represented Netherlands at the 2019 World Athletics Championships, competing in women’s 4×400 meter relay.

The Adidas athlete, who turns 23 on Aug. 20, specializes in sprint races. She trains nine times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, with Sunday being her rest day, according to her Olympics profile. Three out of her nine training sessions feature strength training, while the rest of her regimen is focus on running, sprinting, stamina exercises and recovery.

At one point in her career journey, Klaver had “no interest in athletics” until her mom “insisted I give [athletics] a try,” she recalled.

“I really wanted to dance but my mother thought, ‘You are always running with your brother so you two can take up athletics?'” she continued. “At first I was focused on the 100m and 200m events, but due to my height my coach said to try the 400m.”

Her Instagram page is mostly filled with track and field and fitness posts, featuring workout videos and team snaps.

When she’s not running, Klaver enjoys spending time with family and friends, hitting the beach, traveling and posting the occasional glam shot.

Maybe it’s time for her to create a TikTok account.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Acting general manager Zack Scott defended the Mets’ medical and performance staff when it comes to the plethora of soft-tissue issues that have spurred a parade of players landing on the injured list in what he also described as a “mediocre” season in Flushing.

Without singling any of them out specifically, Scott assigned some of the injury blame to the Mets’ players for not being compliant with the medical staff’s plans to keep them healthy.

“In some cases, you can have the best plan, and if the plan’s not followed, that’s not going to necessarily yield a good result. Sometimes that’s the issue,” Scott said before Tuesday’s series opener against Nationals. “On the soft tissue [injuries], we’ve talked through each one, but there’s nothing that stood out to me as some egregious mistake in our process, in our treatment, in our training, that led to it.

“I think there are specific examples where it’s clear that something could have been handled differently. Most of the time, to be honest, it’s compliance issues.”

Mets GM Zack Scott Corey Sipkin for the NY Post

Star shortstop Francisco Lindor currently is on the injured list with an oblique injury, and deadline acquisition Javier Baez is day-to-day after leaving Sunday’s game in Philadelphia with hip tightness that has moved to his back. Michael Conforto, Jeff McNeil, Carlos Carrasco and Robert Gsellman also have spent significant time on the injured list with soft-tissue ailments. Brandon Nimmo, J.D. Davis and Jose Peraza were sidelined with hand or finger injuries and ace starter Jacob deGrom is currently on the IL with right forearm stiffness.

Scott added that he wasn’t attempting “to vilify [any] players,” and it is unclear which Mets he was speaking about specifically.

When asked to elaborate on his “compliance” remark, Scottt said: “Actually following the plan. Because these are all individuals and control their own bodies and sometimes they’re not as compliant as they should be. That happens. I’ve seen that happen in the past.

“Going back to the individualized approach. You’ve got to take ownership of your career and your health, as well. It’s really an easy narrative to put it on performance staff or put it on hitting coaches. But that’s oversimplified. This is a partnership with those groups and the players and everybody has to be pulling in the direction.”

The Mets entered this six-game homestand with seven losses in their previous eight games to fall to just one game above .500 (56-55) for the season and from first place to third place in the NL East, 2 1/2 games behind the division-leading Phillies. They had lost 15 of their first 24 games since the All-Star break, and ranked second-to-last in MLB in runs scored, ahead of only the Pirates.

“Obviously there’s plenty of games left, and we have a chance to still compete and win this division,” Scott said. “It’s baseball and … there’s always a chance, so you can’t get too down or too high when things are going well.

“That said, we’ve played very mediocre baseball for most of the year. This recent stretch has been much worse than mediocre. We’d have taken mediocre at this point. For this stretch it’s been unacceptably bad, and we need to be better. But we’re not gonna panic because you can’t do that in this game.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The loss of Gleyber Torres to a sprained thumb made for an opportunity for Bronx native Andrew Velazquez.

The 27-year-old starred at Fordham Prep and said he grew up going to Yankee games.

“This is where my love for baseball began,” Velazquez said of the Yankees on Monday, shortly before starting at shortstop for the Yankees in a wild, 8-6, 11-inning win. “I’m looking forward to putting the uniform on.”

He ended up going hitless, but scoring a run and making several fine defensive plays at short before Rougned Odor pinch-hit for him in the 11th.

Velazquez is from the Morris Park section of The Bronx and was drafted in the seventh round of the 2012 draft by the Diamondbacks and reached the majors with the Rays in 2018 and then played 40 games with the Orioles in 2020 before signing with the Yankees this offseason.

“Just telling my parents I got activated was great,’’ Velazquez said. “I just want to help the team win. They’re rolling now.”

The switch-hitting Velazquez had been on the Yankees’ taxi squad in The Bronx after playing well for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

Velazquez, whose favorite player was Derek Jeter, said Monday becoming a Yankee was something “I kind of felt I manifested since I was a child.”

He often went to games at Yankee Stadium.

“It kind of feels like my [MLB] debut again,’’ Velazquez said, who said after signing with the Yankees this past offseason that he knew he’d play for them someday.

“When I was in kindergarten [at St. Francis Xavier], I said I’d play in Yankee Stadium,’’ Velazquez said in January. “I’m gonna bust my ass to get there again.”

Aaron Boone noted that Velazquez hit well with SWB this season, where he had an OPS of .838 in 277 plate appearances- and liked his speed. Velazquez had 26 stolen bases in 29 attempts with SWB.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — The Knicks’ signing of second-round pick Miles McBride didn’t take up cap space and will put the club in control of the West Virginia point guard for three seasons, The Post has learned.

Because McBride fell out of the first round (36th overall), he’s not eligible for the four-year rookie scale contract. McBride has inked a two-year, $2 million package at the NBA minimum for first-year players with a team option for the third year. McBride will make $925,000 in his rookie season.

The 6-foot-3 point guard has played in two summer-league games, excelling most in Monday’s win over the Pacers.

Playing his trademark tough defense, which had head coach Tom Thibodeau lobbying for the Knicks to draft him, McBride scored 14 points and went 5-for-7 from the field, including 2-for-3 from 3-point range. Scouts like McBride’s ability to stay attached to his man after absorbing contact on picks.

“I like his tenacity, his defensive intensity, he can play on the ball or off the ball,’’ Knicks summer-league coach Dice Yoshimoto said. “I like what we saw. He’s very versatile. He can guard the 1 or 2.’’

McBride, 20, can become an unrestricted free agent in 2024. He averaged 15.9 points and 4.8 assists as a West Virginia sophomore. The Knicks believe he can play both point guard and shooting guard.

McBride shot 41.4 percent from 3-point range in college, but in the summer-league opener Sunday, he went 0-for-4 from beyond the NBA 3-point line — with a few of his shots falling short.

McBride was unhappy to fall into the second round, saying afterward he would make teams “pay’’ for it. The Knicks announced McBride’s signing before summer league, but didn’t release terms.

Knicks center Mitchell Robinson, like McBride, was selected 36th in the 2018 draft. Robinson made more in his first season ($1.5 million) than McBride will, but he is locked in for four seasons. The Knicks just exercised the option on Robinson’s contract, and he’ll make just $1.8 million this season.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — After the Knicks were beaten by the Raptors, 89-79, in Sunday’s summer-league opener, Knicks coach Tom Thiibodeau sat down with second-year players Obi Toppin and Immanuel Quickley for a lecture.

Thibodeau told the 2020 first-round picks they needed to demonstrate more leadership on the UNLV court as they are the veterans of the club, according to a source.

The Knicks bounced back Monday with a 94-86 victory over the Pacers with Quickley and Toppin leading the way. They combined for 54 points in the victory.

Quickley alluded to the leadership he and Toppin need to show on the Summer League team that resumes action Wednesday vs. the Lakers (10 p.m. EST).

“I’ve been around a year,’’ Quickley said. “I’ve been in playoff games. Just continuing to spread my knowledge to the new guys, the young guys. Obi and I are doing a great job understanding we have to help these guys and communicate.’’

After a poor outing in the opener, Quickley reversed himself with a 32-point, eight-assist, one-turnover, two-steal outing. Toppin has been mostly solid while finally getting minutes after a rookie season buried behind Julius Randle at power forward.

Though the Dayton dunker shot 2-of-10 in the opener from 3, Toppin is averaging 23 points in the two contests with rugged, high-energy, athletic play.

Twice vs. Indiana, Toppin turned misses into putbacks – a la Carmelo Anthony. Toppin was 3-of-6 from 3-point land, too, while maintaining his bullyball inside game.

“I feel I’ve done pretty good,’’ Toppin said. “Guys are just finding me in certain positions. I would like to shoot the 3 a little better. Every day is not going to be perfect. I put in a lot of work this summer. I’ve had a lot of guys helping me out – coaches, players, watching film.’’

Toppin and Quickley missed Summer League last year because of the pandemic. After their rookie year, though, Summer League coach Dice Yoshimoto said Toppin and Quickley were back in the gym with coaches two days after the team was bounced in the first round by the Hawks.

Toppin, selected No. 8 last November, actually had a lively playoff after his subpar regular season, drawing “O-bi’’ chants from the Garden crowd.

“I feel like I’m most focused on my role on the team,” Toppin said when asked what he emphasized this offseason. “I feel like I know my role. I know what I have to work on. I have a lot guys helping me this summer.’’

Toppin also was in Vegas last month with the U.S. Select Team, scrimmaging against the U.S. Olympians.

“It was great having an opportunity to come to Vegas and playing against the best players in the world – Dame Lillard, all those guys,’’ Toppin said. “To work with them and pick up little things, they were talking to me about, it helped me tremendously.’’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — Nets hopeful David Duke Jr. figures defense, hustle and hard work is how he’s going to make a name for himself.

Note we said a name for himself, not the name he shares with that other guy.

A week into the NBA Summer League, Duke has drawn attention with his work ethic. The Nets drafted five players, but despite going unselected himself, Duke earned an Exhibit 10 deal, then got the start in Monday’s opener over all but one of those five draftees.

“He earned it. We’re here in summer league, and he brings it every day,” coach Jordan Ott said. “You saw it in the game. That’s what he’s done every day in practice. His defensive mentality we loved. We thought it fit with that first unit, the style of play we wanted to play here in summer league and for our big club: Toughness, aggressiveness.

“We’re out here trying to find guys that want to get after it defensively, and he displayed it every day in practice. He displayed it again [Monday]. He was unbelievable on the point of attack, the ball pressure. … So, we were really happy with the way he played [Monday] and throughout the week before.”

For the Nets, first-round picks Cam Thomas and Day’Ron Sharpe are givens, and Kessler Edwards could join them in the rotation. They picked Marcus Zegarowski and RaiQuon Gray 49th and 59th, but called Duke in the midst of the second round and laid out a path in which the 6-foot-5 combo guard could come to summer league and then fight for a spot in camp.

“It was a situation where I could’ve had my name called,” Duke said. “The Nets, they said you can do that, or go the undrafted route. And you’d basically do this, this and this; be able to go into training camp, fight for a spot. I had a good workout with them, and they were really excited about me.

“Doing this route, being able to determine my own situation, for me it was just about my confidence in myself. It wasn’t so much about getting my name called, I just want the opportunity and a chance. This way, I definitely will [get one], and be able to have things in my hand.”

Controlling what he can control is big to Duke. Though he averaged 16.3 points in his last year at Providence, it’s how he defends that could determine whether he can land a G-League deal, or even a two-way contract. His 6-9 wingspan and 39-inch vertical show he has the tools to guard.

“Definitely, I do feel like it could be something that I can always hang my hat on, just because it’s one of the things that you can control more,” Duke said. “I was blessed with God-given athleticism to be able to defend and I try to use that as my advantage to get into the rotation.

“Coming into practice the last few days, coach was telling me, ‘You can really be one of the better defenders, just try to focus on that.’ And that’s what I’ve been doing. … Control what I can control on the defensive side, rebounding, defending all that.”

He has taken that same approach to the unwanted attention brought on by having the same name as the unrelated David Duke, a convicted felon, neo-Nazi and former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Duke Jr. has been hearing comments about his name since he was in middle school.

“I’ll use this whole thing as motivation to me. One day when you look it up it’s just gonna be me and not the other dude,” Duke said. “If anybody should change his name, it should be him. I should be the one to keep it.

“I feel like it’s a nice name, it kind of flows smoothly. But one day I’m just hoping that when you look it up, it won’t be so much negative around it. We’re progressing as a society and as a country and for me, I just want it to mean something in a positive light.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Joe Judge was encouraged by what he saw from Saquon Barkley in his first training camp practice on Monday. But that doesn’t mean the star running back, working his way back from a torn ACL, is on the fast track now.

The Giants still plan on taking it slow with Barkley. After he took part in individual drills for the second straight day on Tuesday, Barkley’s workload will be scaled back on Wednesday night’s practice in front of fans at MetLife Stadium. Judge also doesn’t expect him to take part in any live team drills during Big Blue’s joint practices with the Browns next week in Ohio.

“Now that’s not a final deal, but I would just say based on what we know from our medical team and where he’s at in his own rehab, we’re not going to try to artificially accelerate and get him involved just because of the competitive nature spiking up,” Judge said.

For now, Judge said Barkley won’t see any “competitive drills” in the short term. On SiriusXM NFL Radio, general manager Dave Gettleman echoed his coach, saying the team has to be “smart” with how fast it brings Barkley along.

Speaking to reporters for the first time since last week’s team-wide fight, tight end Evan Engram said there were no lingering issues after the fracas. Engram had shoved safety Jabrill Peppers after Xavier McKinney hit Corey Clement hard, and fellow defensive back Logan Ryan knocked over Engram with a push in the back, sparking the melee.

“We got in the locker room and we were all laughing about it and chopping it up and talking about it,” Engram said. “It’s like little brothers fighting, literally that’s how it was. We got in the locker room and we made up and we had fun and we all talked it out and it was all good.”

Engram didn’t have a problem with Judge disciplining the entire team by having everyone run sprints and do pushups after the incident.

“That’s just Joe,” Engram said. “We got into it, so we have to pay for it.”

Left guard Shane Lemieux returned to live 11-on-11 team drills for the first time since suffering a knee injury and getting carted off the practice field on July 29. Initially, there was concern it could be a serious injury. But all Lemieux, a second-year offensive lineman, could think about was wanting to get back on the field.

“I didn’t feel sorry for myself at all. It’s not like that,” said Lemieux, who received first team reps, as he had before the injury. “I was worried about, ‘crap, I didn’t get my other one-on-one rep,’ or, ‘crap, I didn’t get in the last team period.’ In my mind I was thinking, ‘I’m missing valuable opportunities to get better at this practice.’ That’s all that was going through my head.”

As it turned out, he didn’t miss much time at all.

Offensive tackle Nate Solder suffered an undisclosed injury during practice and sat out the second half of the workout.

“I’m not going to discuss injuries,” he told The Post. “I’ve got to go in and see the trainers. We’ll see what’s going on.”

Linebacker Ryan Anderson (back) was activated from the reserve/non-football injury list and so was tight end Rysen John from the reserve/COVID-19 list. Tight end Tommy Stevens was waived.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A wave of veteran Giants players have retired since the start of training camp, fueling speculation that Joe Judge’s demanding practices are to blame.

That theory doesn’t sit well with Phil Simms.

“I have to watch a sports station go, ‘that’s old school football, you can’t do that to today’s modern players’,” the former Giants quarterback said on CBS Sports Radio on Monday. “Well, shut up, they’re wrong, you can. It’s team building. It really does bring chemistry to the team. When guys have to run, yeah it’s a punishment, but it’s kind of funny and it brings everybody together.

“Just like the fight did with the Giants, I didn’t look at that as a detriment. And practicing too hard? Oh, come on. Come on. You gotta practice and do things on the field, take a rest, get back on, like it’s a game. And when you do things like that, scientifically it’s been proven, that’s the way to do it. And that is the best way that you can help prevent your team from getting more injuries.

“Does it work out always like that? No. But to think he’s run the training camp too hard is absurd and for people who say it, be quiet. You’re wrong!”

Phil Simms defended Joe Judge on the radio Monday. Getty Images

Judge’s training camp has made plenty of headlines so far. On the first day of padded practice last Tuesday, a late hit incited a team-wide brawl that resulted in quarterback Daniel Jones ending up at the bottom of the pile.

In the last week, a trio of veterans — 29-year-old guard Zach Fulton, 30-year-old offensive lineman Joe Looney and 29-year-old linebacker Todd Davis — all decided to retire. Another player, tight end Kelvin Benjamin, was cut before the first day of training camp was over following a heated on-field dispute with Judge.

Simms, who attended Wednesday’s practice and spoke with the team, believes Judge is preparing his team well for the upcoming season.

“All the good teams, they have one thing in common — they’re physical during training camp,” Simms said. “They have this tool. No matter what we say and how we look at it, football is still a sport about contact, being tough and it’s physical, and those are the teams that usually hang on until the end.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hockey Hall of Fame goalie Tony Esposito, 78, passed away Tuesday, the Chicago Blackhawks announced.

Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz said in a statement that Esposito had a brief battle with pancreatic cancer.

Esposito — brother of Hall of Fame center Phil Esposito — was a five-time All-Star and three-time Vezina Trophy winner. His 423 career wins rank 10th all-time in NHL history in wins (423). He played 15 of his 16 NHL seasons with the Blackhawks, becoming the team’s all-time leader among goaltenders in games played (873), wins (418) and shutouts (74). Esposito was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988 and his No. 35 was retired by the Blackhawks on Nov. 20, 1988.

Esposito was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players by the league in 2017.

“The National Hockey League, the Chicago Blackhawks and the city of Chicago lost a beloved member of the hockey family earlier today with the passing of Tony Esposito,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “From his arrival in the Windy City in the late 1960s through an illustrious playing career and decades as a franchise icon, Tony left an indelible mark — both on the ice and in the community — over the next 52 years.

“It was Esposito’s style, charisma and heart that endeared him most to hockey fans not only in Chicago but across the NHL. ‘Tony O’ was a fierce competitor who also took great pride in being an entertainer, whether it was with his pioneering butterfly style during his playing days or interacting with fans across the League as one of this game’s great ambassadors. The hockey world will miss him greatly.”

The Esposito family called him a “Hall of Fame husband, father, and grandfather.”

“Chicago felt like home from the time Tony first arrived in 1969, thanks to the Wirtz family and those 18,000 Blackhawks fans who treated him like family every night at the Stadium, win or lose or tie,” the family said in a statement.

During an illustrious college hockey career at Michigan Tech, Esposito was a three-time first-team All-American and a leader on the 1964–65 NCAA championship team.

Esposito then embarked on a successful professional hockey career, starting with the Vancouver Canucks in the Western Hockey League in 1967 and got his shot in the NHL for the Montreal Canadiens the next season.

But in 1969, Chicago claimed him on waivers in what was known as the intra-league draft. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league’s top rookie after recording a 2.17 goals-against average and setting a then-modern-day NHL record with fifteen shutouts.

“Tony was one of the most important and popular figures in the history of the franchise as we near its 100th anniversary,” Blackhawks Chairman Rocky Wirtz said. “Four generations of our family — my grandfather Arthur, my father Bill, my son Danny and I — were blessed by his work ethic as a Hall of Fame goalie, but more importantly, by his mere presence and spirit.”

Esposito is survived by his wife Marilyn, sons Mark and Jason, and grandchildren Lauren and Kamryn. His brother, Phil, is 79 and does radio work for the Tampa Bay Lightning, which he helped found.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When it comes to the Giants, MetLife Stadium and the so-far unholy alliance that exists between team and home, the best part of Wednesday night’s Fan Fest event was that no one was keeping score.

It is better for the Giants that way.

The surest way to know Joe Judge is going to be a big success with the Giants is by what his team achieves when it plays directly in front of its fans. His debut season as head coach should come with readily attachable asterisks, especially suited for the 3-5 record Judge attained at MetLife. The global pandemic kept all 82,500 gray seats unoccupied all season and so there were no cheers, no boos, no Cowboys or Eagles supporters infiltrating the scene, no December no-shows alerting co-owner John Mara that the paying customers have gone from hopeful to disgusted to apathetic.

The Giants this summer kept their training camp closed. They should have worked harder — yes, even amid the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape — to put up a few bleachers to allow a few thousand fans to watch them work.

The Giants said just under 29,000 fans attended Wednesday’s Fan Fest event at MetLife Stadium. AP

For this event, they gave out 50,000 free tickets. According to the Giants, just under 29,000 showed up for a two-hour practice — Judge wisely made sure this one was in full pads and not one of those scaled-down “Pro Bowl jog’’ sessions. There were autographs from Super Bowl heroes O.J. Anderson, Ahmad Bradshaw and Mario Manningham. There were parking lots with vehicles and footballs tossed around the blacktop through the humid air.

It resembled normalcy.

“That’s been circled on my calendar,’’ tight end Evan Engram said. “I do miss the fans at training camp every day like in the past. Just being back in the atmosphere and kind of getting a taste of what it’s going to be like come September 12.’’

On that day, the Giants open their regular season at MetLife Stadium against the Broncos, and if that is not a game to finally start establishing some home-field advantage, what is? In 11 seasons playing at MetLife, the Giants have a winning record in two of them: 2012 and 2016. They are 39-49 all-time in the regular season at MetLife — 9-23 in the past four years. Rather than being a kick-ass team at home, they are a kicked-ass team at home.

Judge embraces Giants history, but is not going to be saddled with this.

“In terms of anything that’s happened in the past, it’s not relevant to any game we’re gonna play this year,’’ Judge said.

Sure, the Giants have been nearly as bad on the road (35-53) since 2010. But that is not the issue. Legit teams win at home. In the past decade, the Patriots (84.7 percent), Ravens (75 percent), Packers (74.7 percent), Steelers (71.1 percent) and Saints (69.8 percent) have dominated at home.

Before this open practice, the last time the Giants took the field with their fans in attendance was 592 days ago. It was Dec. 29, 2019, and, naturally, they lost, turning someone named Boston Scott into a scoring machine in a 34-17 tank-job against the hated Eagles — Pat Shurmur’s final game as head coach.

No one loved the shiny newish building when it opened for the 2010 season. It sits off exit 19W on the New Jersey Turnpike — in the parking lot where old Giants Stadium once stood — as a sort of punch line, those massive silver Venetian blinds — the official designation is “louvers’’ — inspiring little in the way of grand design to excite the masses. Yet no one would have cared much about the lack of inspiring aesthetics if the product wasn’t so lousy.

Judge coached last season to an empty theater. It was all so disorienting. The home team ran through the tunnel, barged through the smoke, heard the blaring music and then — nothing.

“You kind of got numb to it after a while,’’ defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence said.

At least what transpired Wednesday night whetted appetites. Logan Ryan, a Jersey native, bounced onto the field and exhorted the crowd. Kenny Golladay played catch with fans in the stands. Lawrence tossed the ball to a fan wearing an Eagles jersey and then playfully motioned for that fan to leave. An “Eagles suck’’ chant ensured, on cue.

Daniel Jones got a nice ovation. Eli Manning, wearing sunglasses, golf shirt and khakis, got a bigger ovation. Leonard Williams, fooling around with the other defensive linemen, caught a pass in the corner of the end zone and then went Hulk Hogan to the fans, who loved it.

Judge had a fun competition scheduled to end the practice — offensive and defensive linemen fielding punts — but it was shelved because of lighting moving into the area. Players before exiting tossed T-shirts into the stands — Leonard Williams was particularly engaging with fans — and Judge, clearly energized, called the evening “unbelievable … outstanding.’’

“Obviously, we missed the fans last year,’’ Lawrence said. “They bring a different type of excitement, a different type of juice. Playing in front of them is just an honor, really.’’

After a one-year hiatus, the honor returns for real. To take the Giants seriously, they have to start turning their house into a home.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Observations from Giants training camp on Wednesday.

Welcome back!

Joe Judge was satisfied with the Giants’ first practice at MetLife Stadium with spectators in attendance at Wednesday’s Fan Fest, saying “the energy was unbelievable and outstanding” and something ”we have to get used to again” after the pandemic-affected 2020 season. “We’re glad they’re back. There was a different feeling in the building,” Judge said.

Toning it down

Giants fans hoping to get their first in-person look at first-round pick Kadarius Toney had to be disappointed that the rookie receiver out of Florida was held out of the open practice for maintenance reasons and only worked individually on the sidelines.

Caught my eye

The fans certainly had their share of fun, while also sounding in midseason form with a couple of booing instances. Dexter Lawrence was having a catch with fans in the stands, when a man in an Eagles jersey caught the ball. He received heavy boos, leading to a chant of “Eagles suck.” Many in the estimated crowd of 29,000 also booed running back Devontae Booker for a fumble in 11-on-11 drills and tight end Evan Engram for a goal-line drop during seven-vs.-sevens.

Medical report

WR Kenny Golladay (hamstring) caught passes out of a Jugs machine and ran on the sidelines but did not practice. OT Nate Solder (shoulder) was in full pads and participated in positional drills after leaving early on Tuesday. LB Elerson Smith (hamstring) stretched with the team at the start but did not practice. S Jabrill Peppers left early to receive fluids, Judge said. RB Saquon Barkley (knee) also was held out.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mets’ pitcher Rich Hill was originally slated to start Thursday, but he went to manager Luis Rojas and asked to pitch a day early.

It did not go as planned.

Taking over for Carlos Carrasco following the suspension of Tuesday’s game, the 17-year MLB veteran survived just three innings and allowed three earned runs in an 8-7 come-from-behind victory over the Nationals Wednesday afternoon, forcing Rojas to go to his bullpen early in the first game of a scheduled doubleheader.

Things went south in the top of the fifth inning. The first three Nationals batters all reached base, including Luis Garcia, who drove in two runs with a double into the gap. That was it for Hill.

“Obviously, I just want to throw the ball better,” Hill said. “Unfortunately, I didn’t do my job in the [fifth] inning. I need to try to make some improvements.”

Rich Hill for the NY POST

Rojas trekked to the mound to pull his starter, and Hill walked off the field visibly frustrated, muttering some harsh words before throwing his hat to the ground in the dugout.

While he has struggled at times, Hill’s work ethic shined once again Wednesday. In a mostly empty ballpark, all could hear the 41-year-old loudly grunt after each pitch. And with one out in the fourth inning, Hill — who has spent half his career in the American League — let down a drag bunt and sprinted to first base, nearly eking out an infield single.

“[Hill] showed the entire team how to win,” Rojas said. “He is a guy that is 41 years old and a veteran. His [game] was a great example [of hard work] in many respects.”

Hill came to New York in a midseason trade from the Rays — serving as a reinforcement for a struggling starting rotation — with big expectations. He said “the main goal is to win the World Series” following his Big Apple debut on July 25.

The Mets have faltered since then. Before Wednesday, the Mets had lost seven of their previous eight games and 15 of 24 since the All-Star break. However, Hill’s desire is the same, even as he and the Mets struggle.

“We have the team to [win a World Series],” Hill said. “We all believe in each other and we continue to keep fighting. It was great to come back for a win.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Observations from Jets training camp on Wednesday.

Corey story

WR Corey Davis had a nice practice, catching two touchdowns in a red-zone period and making another catch in team drills. Davis also drew a pass interference call against Bryce Hall. Davis gets good separation and is a big body in the end zone.

White out

Backup QB Mike White had an ugly day with two interceptions. One was on a deflected ball in the red zone, but the other was on a pass when he just did not see linebacker Jamien Sherwood and threw it right to him. The Jets’ backup quarterback situation bears watching.

Caught my eye

Rookie CB Brandin Echols made a beautiful interception off a pass tipped by fellow CB Elijah Campbell at the goal line. Echols made the acrobatic catch and would have had himself a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown in a game situation.

Zach Wilson’s day

Wilson had a solid day and looked comfortable during a red-zone period. He finished 5-for-9 with two touchdowns and was sacked once. He showed some nice zip on a pass across the middle to Davis.

Medical report

S Marcus Maye left practice briefly, but returned. There were no new injuries and no one returned to practice who has been out.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — The Nets can bring 20 players to training camp, and they’re at that limit. But that doesn’t mean they’re done tweaking the roster.

“Yeah, we’ll always keep that door open. It’s obviously not wide open anymore because we’ve signed a lot of these guys, but I think it’s cracked,” general manager Sean Marks said Wednesday. “We’ve got to continue to tinker with the roster, and just see what happens.

“We’ve seen in the past where other teams make cuts, and so forth, and we’re able to adjust because of that. So I don’t want to say that the roster’s complete: Maybe it’s 90 percent complete, 99 percent complete. But we’ll definitely reserve the right to continue to tinker with this roster.”

Under Marks, the Nets have usually made late pickups. They signed Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot hours before the 2019 opener, and picked up Tyler Zeller in mid-September two years earlier.

“We’ll be fluid. We could potentially keep a roster spot open,” Marks said. “We still have to agree on a two-way position as well. I don’t think we’ll necessarily make our mind up in the next 24, 48 hours.”

Marks acknowledged that he’ll consult his stars on making roster moves. So far, his roster-building has shown a clear intent to shore up the defense by keeping Bruce Brown and adding the likes of Jevon Carter and James Johnson.

“We won’t have addressed all the needs until probably post-trade deadline, and that’s when we’ll really know what we’ve got,” Marks said. “But we wanted to make sure we were deep, make sure we were healthy, and certainly address some of those needs from a defensive standpoint.”

Part of the roster uncertainty is DeAndre Jordan. The veteran did not play in the final four games of the regular season or in any of the Nets’ 12 playoff games. He has been shopped around the league.

“From a GM standpoint if we’re not having calls around the league then none of us would be doing our job. That’s what we do,” Marks said. “Whether the roster looks the same in a month or two I really don’t know. But as it stands now DeAndre is certainty part of this roster.”

Marks — who was in Los Angeles on Tuesday to finalize Patty Mills’ signing — landed the Aussie guard for the mid-level exception, with the second year an option, according to Spotrac. Marks also admitted he was surprised he was able to keep Brown for the $4.7 million qualifying offer, when league sentiment was he’d get double that.

“Absolutely; without a doubt. We certainly thought Bruce would be getting, whether it was an offer sheet,” Marks said. “But at the same time, Bruce made it very clear that the job wasn’t done here, and I respect the heck out of him for wanting to come back.”

DeAndre Jordan Corey Sipkin for the NY Post

Marks also addressed the call to leave Nic Claxton in Brooklyn for individual work.

“We felt, not only from Nic’s side but from an organizational standpoint there were some things that maybe he needed to focus on, and he could do that better on an individual basis working out with coaches,” Marks said. “He’s doing that in Brooklyn.”

The Nets beat the Bucks 97-91 Wednesday as Cam Thomas had a team-high 22 points, as well as four assists.

“It’s definitely an adjustment, but with the real team I’m gonna be coming off the bench anyway so this is just good practice for me to get used to [it],” said Thomas.

Fellow first-round pick Day’Ron Sharpe had 11 points and eight boards (six offensive).

“The other guys are gonna get tired of boxing you out sooner or later. If I keep going hard 24/7, sooner or later somebody’s gonna slip up,” Sharpe said. “Guys don’t want to deal with a guy that’s running after the ball and is nowhere near them.”

The Nets will hire former Magic and Hornets coach Steve Clifford as a consultant, as first reported by ESPN.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For the second consecutive night, rain suspended play at Citi Field.

The Mets and Nationals finished Tuesday night’s postponed contest on Wednesday afternoon, until the rainy weather returned to cancel Game 2.

Marcus Stroman Getty Images

The teams plan to play a doubleheader on Thursday beginning at 12:10 p.m., with the second game coming 30-40 minutes after the conclusion of game one.

The Mets entered the first game Wednesday trailing 3-1, but rallied to win 8-7 and snap a four-game losing streak.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A hit batsman to start the inning. An error that prolonged the game.

Both could have led to a disastrous ninth inning for Zack Britton and the Yankees, but neither did.

Britton shook both of them off and notched his first save of the year, closing out the Yankees’ 5-2 win over the Royals to clinch a series victory.

Britton, who has now posted zeroes in four of his past five outings, rebounded after hitting Ryan O’Hearn with a two-strike sinker leading off the frame. After Rougned Odor botched what should’ve been a game-ending double play, Britton got Carlos Santana to bounce into another twin-killing, closing it out unlike Monday when he couldn’t finish off the Royals.

“I thought he threw the ball really well,” manager Aaron Boone said. “Obviously, he hits the first guy with two strikes, but after that his stuff really ticked up. It looked like his sinker was really good today, and he gets three guys [to hit the ball] on the ground.

“It’s encouraging to see him throwing the ball like that, and hopefully it’s something he can continue to build off of.”

It’s been a roller-coaster season for Britton, mirroring the up-and-down Yankees. He started the season on the injured list due to surgery to remove a bone chip in his left elbow, making his debut on June 12. But after just five appearances spanning 4 1/3 innings, he went back on the IL two weeks later with a left hamstring strain. Upon returning on July 18, Britton struggled initially, giving up runs in four of his first five appearances. Lately, he’s found his groove.

Britton capped a bullpen game that was started by Lucas Luetge and included six different relievers. After the usually solid bullpen allowed seven runs over seven innings in the first two games, it was much better on Wednesday — the Royals managed just one extra-base hit and struck out nine times — ensuring the Yankees’ series victory.

“We kind of embrace it as a bullpen,” said Chad Green, who threw two scoreless innings. “We have a lot of guys who can give us length and give you a lot of different looks. I think we don’t mind doing it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Before the pandemic, children playing Little League baseball often would greet their parents with a hug after games. Now, children sit at a picnic table and acknowledge their parents — standing at a distance — with a wave.

As COVID-19 continues to drastically alter the world, Little League is no different. At the Mid-Atlantic Region tournament in Bristol, Conn., Toms River East of New Jersey is battling not only its competition, but also strict COVID-19 protocols.

“It’s crazy with the parents. We see [the kids] on the field and after the game you want to hug them,” Charlie Frazier Jr., father of Toms River East’s pitcher, center fielder, shortstop and first baseman, Carson Frazier, told The Post. “My wife [Mindy] wants to squeeze Carson so badly. After the game, we go to the back of the complex to a special area. They have to sit on a table and we stand like 10 feet away and they have to wear a mask. You have all the moms yelling, ‘Hey great hit, are you keeping your clothes neat?’”

Toms River East has gone 2-0 so far in the tournament, with wins over teams from Delaware and Maryland to advance to within one victory of the final in the double-elimination tournament. The New Jersey team will face Upper Providence from Oaks, Pa., at 7 p.m. Thursday in the winners’ bracket, with the game broadcast on ESPN.

With a win, Toms River East will play on Saturday (6 p.m., ESPN) for the regional championship. A loss would send them to the losers’ bracket final on Friday (7 p.m., ESPN), which they would have to win to play for the regional title.

All teams that reach the regional finals this year will advance to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. (Aug. 19-29), because no international teams will be included in the field due to the pandemic.

When the Toms River East players arrived in Bristol last week, they were tested for COVID-19 and placed in a bubble, only permitted to see their teammates and coaches. Parents were separated and only allowed to see their children from afar.

“I remember back in the day, the parents would be able to go to the dorm and see how smelly or messy it was,” said Frazier, a brother of former Yankees and Mets star Todd Frazier. “I remember kids trading pins.”

Pins are not being traded this year — one of the sacrifices that have allowed the games to be played. Little League International, the organization overseeing the tournament, put safety first when planning how it would run.

“The Little League Tournament experience is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for all players and families, and we hope that everyone has an enjoyable and memorable time,” Brian McClintock, the senior director of communications for Little League International, told The Post.

“As we work together to keep the players, coaches, and volunteers as healthy and safe as possible through the coronavirus pandemic, we know that parents want to be with their players, but limiting contact and a potential exposure to COVID-19 is a sacrifice we’re asking all families to make as they cheer their players through the World Series.”

The rules were put in place by the 2021 Little League International Pandemic Response Advisory Commission, which was formed in February to advise the organization’s seven tournament divisions on how they could safely conduct their tournaments. National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., also helped draft the protocols.

“It has been a very tough road with protocols. These boys are locked in dormitories. There is not much for them to do. They are bouncing off the walls,” Toms River East head coach Paul Mika told The Post on Monday afternoon. “It is tough for me and the coaches to corral them and keep things focused on baseball, but we are doing a good job.”

While the experience has been emotionally grueling for players and coaches, the adversity has made the children grow stronger. For some athletes, it is their first extended experience away from their parents.

The bubble also has allowed the competitors to focus simply on their task at hand — winning games — and has brought them closer with their teammates and coaches.

“The parents are sitting around with each other and it’s like the kids are growing up,” Frazier said. “They are on their own.”

The athletes may be on their own, but they are doing what they love: playing baseball. So while the restrictions are tough, enduring them is a small price to pay.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Five years after he was dumped by Baylor, Art Briles was front and center in a withering NCAA infractions report Wednesday that ripped him for failing to look into horrific and potentially criminal allegations involving his football players.

Yet the infractions panel didn’t find him guilty of any NCAA violations, and his attorney said he is clear to return to college coaching.

“My client Art Briles has been completely exonerated and cleared of all NCAA violations alleged against him,” the attorney, Scott Tompsett, told ESPN. “As the NCAA Committee on Infractions explained, the conduct at issue was pervasive and widespread throughout the Baylor campus, and it was condoned or ignored by the highest levels of Baylor’s leadership.”

Briles was fired by Baylor after an external investigation revealed in May 2016 that the world’s largest Baptist university had for years mishandled and failed to properly respond to numerous sexual assault allegations by students, including some against football players. Briles has long disputed the allegations against him.

In its 51-page report, the infractions committee didn’t hold back on Briles.

“In each instance, when the head coach received information from a staff member regarding potential criminal conduct by a football student-athlete, he did not report the information and did not personally look any further into the matter,” the panel said. “His incurious attitude toward potential criminal conduct by his student-athletes was deeply troubling to the panel.

“As one panel member observed at the hearing when questioning the head coach’s lack of response to this information, ‘a lot of these things that we’re talking about, they’re not NCAA rules violations . . . (or) university policy violations. They’re felonies. (W)e’re talking about rapes and physical assaults,’” according to the report. “The head coach failed to meet even the most basic expectations of how a person should react to the kind of conduct at issue in this case. Furthermore, as a campus leader, the head coach is held to an even higher standard. He completely failed to meet this standard.”

Still, the panel didn’t find Briles guilty of any rules violations when putting Baylor on four years or probation and imposing recruiting restrictions on the football program.

The one former Baylor employee directly sanctioned by the NCAA was former director of football operations Odell James, who was hit with a five-year show cause order. A representative of James said James, who was on Baylor’s staff from 2004-15, was being improperly punished for declining an in-person interview and was exploring options to challenge the decision.

The NCAA did find rules violations occurred between 2011 and 2016, including impermissible benefits and drug testing violations in the football program, and violations involving the institution’s predominantly female student host program.

But the infractions panel reluctantly agreed with Baylor that the mishandling of various allegations on the Waco campus “did not constitute violations of NCAA legislation.”

The 65-year-old Briles hasn’t coached at the college level since leaving Baylor, where he led the Bears to their only two Big 12 Conference titles while going 65-37 from 2008-15. Baylor had four 10-win seasons in a five-year span from 2011-15, after only winning 10 games once before that.

Five wins from the 2011 season, when the Bears went 10-3 and quarterback Robert Griffin III became the school’s only Heisman Trophy winner, could be vacated because of the use of an ineligible player who did receive impermissible benefits.

Briles insisted many of the allegations against him were false; at one point, he even sued three school regents and a vice president for libel and slander, claiming they falsely stated he knew of reported assaults and alleged gang rapes by players and didn’t report them.

In February 2017, university regents revealed new details in the case, including texts and quotes from conversations alleging Briles ignored sexual assaults by players and failed to alert university officials or discipline athletes. In one alleged gang rape incident in 2013, Briles was shown a list of players a victim had identified.

“These are some bad dudes. Why was she around those guys?,” Briles is quoted in the filing as saying.

Baylor paid Briles more than $15 million after firing him. He later acknowledged making mistakes and apologized for “some bad things” that happened under his watch.

Briles coached briefly in Italy and then at a Texas high school in Mount Vernon.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Gerrit Cole and Jordan Montgomery could be back in the rotation early next week, according to manager Aaron Boone.

Both starters are set to come off the COVID-19 IL this weekend in Chicago and if their bullpen sessions go well, they could pitch as soon as Monday, when the Yankees will play a makeup game against the Angels in The Bronx. A doubleheader against the Red Sox follows on Tuesday, so the Yankees will need plenty of depth after Jameson Taillon and Nestor Cortes are set to go Saturday and Sunday in Chicago.

Luis Severino is scheduled to make a final rehab start Friday with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, so he should be able to make his first start for the Yankees since the 2019 ALCS at some point next week, as well.

“The guys we’re missing right now are large pieces and you can start dreaming on getting some really impactful players back to fortify us for the stretch run,” Boone said before the Yankees’ 5-2 win over the Royals on Wednesday.

Gerrit Cole and Jordan Montgomery Getty Images (2)

Asked if Corey Kluber could be part of that mix in September, with the right-hander set to make his first rehab start Thursday, for Double-A Somerset, after being sidelined since May with a strained shoulder, Boone said, “We’ll see if he’s able to get through and bounce back.”

Boone added he was “definitely hopeful” Kluber would be back at some point next month.

Clarke Schmidt is closer to returning from an elbow strain that has sidelined him since spring training. He made a rehab start for Somerset on Wednesday and allowed a pair of solo homers in 3 ²/₃ innings. Afterwards, he was reinstated from the 60-day IL and optioned to Triple-A.

Gio Urshela (hamstring) did not take part in any baseball activities for two days after receiving a platelet-rich plasma injection, Boone said.

He was scheduled to increase his workload Wednesday after suffering a setback in his recovery from a strained left hamstring.

Gleyber Torres (sprained thumb) needs to be pain free before he can begin baseball activities. … Prospect Oswald Peraza, as well as Estevan Florial, are expected to join the taxi squad Thursday in Iowa for the Field of Dreams game. Peraza, 21, is one of the organization’s top prospects and could be called upon if there’s another injury to an infielder. … Boone said he was unsure if Chapman (left elbow inflammation) would be able to rejoin the bullpen when he’s eligible.

Boone continued to defend Joey Gallo in the midst of his miserable start with the Yankees.

“If you watch the at-bats, it’s not a guy that’s struggling,’’ Boone said before Gallo hit cleanup Wednesday and went 0-for-2 with a pair of walks and scored a run. “I feel he’s on time for the most part and getting off a good swing.”

Boone said Gallo “has probably had a couple he’s fouled off that he was right on. … That happens from time-to-time with everyone.”

Since being acquired from the Rangers at the trade deadline, Gallo is 7-for-47, with four doubles, a homer, three RBIs and 10 walks, to go along with a whopping 22 strikeouts.

The numbers were even worse in Gallo’s last six games, in which he went 2-for-20, with no extra-base hits, six walks and 11 strikeouts.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The requests in my inbox from Utah radio stations to talk about Zach Wilson have been plentiful since April, when it became clear the Jets were drafting the BYU quarterback with the No. 2-overall pick.

I try to do most of them and they are always very nice people. On Tuesday, I was talking to two hosts on The Zone when one asked this doozy, “If you had to bet, will Wilson work out long term with the Jets?”

I felt like saying, “First, let me tell you how the stock market will look in five years, who will win the 2024 presidential election and when Jacob deGrom will actually pitch for the Mets again.”

Some of life’s mysteries are better off being unpredictable. But that does not stop everyone from trying to forecast the future.

That has been the case this week with Wilson. There has been a growing angst among a fan base that has scars from past savior quarterbacks. They have closets with Chad Pennington, Mark Sanchez and Sam Darnold jerseys hanging in them. They hear reports of Wilson throwing interceptions in practice in Florham Park. They see missives from Chicago about Justin Fields tearing up the practice field.

Jets fans are not panicking … yet, but you can feel the tension growing.

I’m here to do my best Aaron Rodgers impersonation: R-E-L-A-X.

Wilson has had 10 training camp practices. That’s it. Predicting his NFL future now would be like predicting a newborn’s career choice. He’s an NFL baby. Let him grow.

Zach Wilson Bill Kostroun/New York Post

Patience has become a dirty word in a sports universe that features debate shows and Twitter. Everyone wants to be the first to pronounce someone the best … or the worst.

Here is the truth: You’re probably not going to know whether Wilson is a good quarterback for a long time. Between 2015-20, there were 20 quarterbacks drafted in the first round. How many of those have been good from the day they started and had very few hiccups? Patrick Mahomes fits the bill. Deshaun Watson has been that on the field but now has off-field issues.

The rest? It’s hard to make a definitive statement. Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray and Justin Herbert are all very promising players but are we 100 percent positive on these guys? I don’t think so.

There are also many examples of players we thought we knew what they were and then things changed. Players such as Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Carson Wentz, Jared Goff and Mitch Trubisky all had moments or seasons that made you think they were The Guy. None of them are still with the team that drafted them.

Jets fans should know this better than anyone. Sanchez looked like the right guy after two trips to the AFC Championship game. Then, things fell apart. Darnold’s future is still being debated.

Let’s also talk about practice “stats,” since some of this angst arises from them. As one of the great Florham Park statisticians myself, let me let you in on a dirty, little secret: Practice stats are dumb. We don’t know the plays they’re running. We don’t know if receivers ran the wrong routes. We don’t know if the coach told the quarterback to be overly aggressive. We have no context.

“We’re not competing to win a game or anything in practice because there’s all different situations we plan for,” Wilson said Wednesday. “They throw us in tougher situations, they throw us in base downs where we got a lot of space where it’s maybe harder on the defense so we’re practicing repetition of all these different situations. You can’t really grade stats or how many touchdowns or how many yards because every play is really what we’re grading.”

Wilson’s first pass in team drills Wednesday was an example. Wilson admittedly tried to fit one into Elijah Moore when he wouldn’t have in a game. Linebacker C.J. Mosley got a hand on it. As he walked back to the huddle, he told his coaches that next time he would throw it to the check-down receiver.

Zach Wilson hasn’t had the greatest training camp, but that’s OK. Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

“I can’t be afraid to make mistakes, especially in practice,” Wilson said. “This isn’t a game; this is where I’m learning what I can get away with and what I can’t.”

Another thing to consider is Wilson’s stock soared at BYU because of his ability to make plays “off schedule” or when things broke down around him. He is able to scramble, roll to his right and make a crazy throw to his left. That is not what training camp is. Training camp is the ultimate “on schedule” experience. The plays are supposed to look like they do in the playbook.

So, let’s give Wilson some time to grow and learn and fail and succeed before we declare we know how his career will go.

Now if someone could tell me when deGrom will pitch again …
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nate Burleson is a crossover star to bet on because he is more skilled as a TV performer than he was as a football player.

That is not meant to be disrespectful about his career as an NFL receiver. After all, spending 11 years in the league is impressive. But with the Lions, for example, he was the No. 2 option after Calvin Johnson, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame this past weekend.

On TV, however, Burleson is quickly becoming Megatron. One day, he will likely lead a Super Bowl broadcast.

Burleson was named Wednesday as a host of “CBS This Morning.” He will remain as an analyst on the network’s “The NFL Today,” while adding more duties on Nickelodeon, which is also owned by ViacomCBS.

For good measure, he will still appear on NFL Network every now and then.

Burleson has not yet reached Michael Strahan’s heights. The former Giant is on the more popular “Good Morning America” and “Fox NFL Sunday.” But Burleson has a chance to do more — and maybe even become bigger than Strahan.

CBS, according to sources, already views Burleson as the heir apparent to “The NFL Today” host James Brown. Brown, 70, has given no indication that he plans to retire soon, but when he does, Burleson is expected to step to the lead chair.

That is significant because, besides the weekly show, it would mean Burleson would host a Super Bowl.

Burleson will still be on NFL Network on occasion, but will no longer appear daily on the fun and popular, “Good Morning Football.” He will not be easy to replace.

He called the “GMFB” crew of Peter Schrager, Kyle Brandt and Kay Adams a family. The foursome became early morning friends for viewers.

A couple of names that likely will be considered to replace Burleson on “GMFB” are DeAngelo Hall and Andrew Hawkins, according to sources.

Whoever gets the job will have to be as committed as Burleson and the crew. Morning shows are only for people who truly want to be on TV. Burleson did it, and now is moving to a larger morning stage.

With CBS, Burleson will also do more of the Nickelodeon games that led to such a success during last year’s wild-card showing. Burleson’s authenticity, which shined through on that broadcast, is what will likely make him a morning success.

Burleson had a nice NFL career. One year, he even had 1,000 yards receiving. But he was a possession guy.

The new deal means, however, that on the TV stage, Burleson is a No. 1 option and he just moved to another level.

The Premier League will kick off Friday in its final year of its current contract on NBC. The network has been using the soccer league to increase its Peacock subscriptions, but it will surely have major competition to keep the rights from ESPN+, Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video and network TV. NBC paid a reported $1.3 billion for six years on its current deal.

That number is expected to skyrocket and the desire to continue airing the Premier League was seen as a large reason why NBC did not retain the NHL.

For the subscription platforms, the Premier League is the most valuable among soccer because it is weekly from August through May, meaning subscribers would be retained — probably in most cases — for a whole year.

The Premier League’s depth also is protected from a situation that ESPN finds itself in after Lionel Messi this week left Barcelona to sign with Paris Saint-Germain.

ESPN just signed a long-term deal with La Liga and, if Messi had remained with Barcelona, you can be assured that his face would have been all over ESPN advertising the start of the season. Instead, there is no Messi and much less buzz.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Baseball gets so much wrong these days. They get this one right. They are playing a regulation game Thursday in Dyersville, Iowa, the Yankees and White Sox meeting on a field adjacent to the cornfield that served as the true star of the movie “Field of Dreams.”

The movie itself, for over 30 years, has been a polarizing one for baseball fans, some of whom believe it embodies every positive value the game has ever possessed, some of whom believe it is straight-up, saccharine, manipulative corn pone.

(EDITOR’S NOTE: Those latter people have no souls.)

Even the haters will undoubtedly tune in to see what it looks like, though, and that’s the point, really: sports and movies have had an undeniable kinship from the start. The very best sports movies inspire the kind of devotion that fuel these kinds of real-life pilgrimages.

Baseball always seems to get the finest stages. Both Shea and old Yankee stadiums were settings for the 1973 classic “Bang the Drum Slowly,” the alternate homes of the New York Mammoths. The women of “A League of Their Own” tried out at “Harvey Field,” which was a fascinating pen name for Wrigley Field.

When Barry Levinson went looking for a home field for the New York Knights before filing “The Natural,” he walked into Buffalo’s old War Memorial Stadium, nicknamed “The Rockpile,” and said: “It was like walking into a time machine. It was like walking right into 1938.” Unfortunately, the Rockpile was reduced to rubble by 1987. So, really, Dyersville is it, the best make-believe field to hold a real-life game.

But there are other sporting places worth the same effort.

There is, at the top, the Hoosier Gym, located in Knightstown, Ind., (and yes, there is a certain perfection to a sacred basketball place in Indiana called “Knightstown,” even if the town was named after a 19th-century civil engineer and not a decidedly uncivil 20th-century coach). I’ve been to Hoosier Gym, located just off Highway 40, which attracts some 80,000 visitors a year, almost all of whom have their mouths agape the entire time they are inside.

After all, it’s probably the most famous basketball court in the world, all due respect to the Garden, the Palestra or Rucker Park. This is where the Hickory High School Huskers played their home games in the 1986 movie “Hoosiers,” where Shooter ran the picket fence. It is one of those old-school gyms so small there is no half-court line (CYO players surely remember the “forward time line” and “rear time line” of such courts) so it might be a stretch to have a regular-season NBA game here.

But wouldn’t you watch an exhibition game between the Pacers and the Bucks, see if Giannis Antetokounmpo could make it from baseline to bucket in three dribbles? I would.

Then there is the Cambria County War Memorial Arena in Johnstown, Pa., which is the functional 4,000-seat home of both the Johnstown Tomahawks of the North American Hockey League and the Pitt-Johnstown Ice Cats of College Hockey East but, for now and forever will be the home of the Hansen Brothers, Reggie Dunlop and the rest of the Charlestown Chiefs of the movie “Slap Shot.”

The NHL plays annual outdoor games now in football stadiums, to help recreate the feel of kids growing up in frontier hockey towns on frozen ponds; you’re telling me they couldn’t devote one regular-season Penguins-Flyers game to be played here, which is 67 miles from Pittsburgh and 93 miles from Philly? Get it done, NHL!

A new entrant for this is Selhurst Park in London, about an hour outside of Heathrow Airport, which is the real-life home of Crystal Palace of the Premier League and also, more relevantly, the fictional home of the AFC Richmond Greyhounds in “Ted Lasso.”

(Folks have looked for years for ways to make soccer a more permanent part of America’s daily sporting culture; I propose a match between NYCFC and the Red Bulls at Selhurst sometime in 2022, and I propose my sports editor send me to cover this spectacular event — especially since I just invented it.)

One last entrant: Notre Dame Stadium. Yes, yes, they already play six or seven real games a year there. But it’s pretty safe to say that “Rudy” has the most famous football footage ever used in a movie. Also, I’ve been there; it is a movie, from Touchdown Jesus beyond one end zone to the Golden Dome to the “Play Like a Champion Today” sign at the exit of the tunnel. Play a Bears-Packers game there someday. That would wake up plenty of echoes, shake down its share of thunder.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@DYERSVILLE, Iowa — What first caught my eye were the wooden bleachers. The seats from which Terence Mann arises to deliver his “People will come” soliloquy. From which young Karin Kinsella falls moments later, requiring the services of Dr. Archibald “Moonlight” Graham — transforming from teenager to senior citizen — to save her life.

“They’re original,” Tom Mietzel, CEO of Go the Distance, which runs the facility, assured The Post later in a telephone interview. Same goes for the farmhouse behind them.

Perhaps if you somehow haven’t seen the 1989 film “Field of Dreams,” or if you watched it and it somehow wasn’t your bag, then setting foot on these grounds — on a movie set, let’s acknowledge — won’t get your geek on. The idea of holding an actual Major League Baseball game here might strike you as cheesy.

If you’re one of the countless people who bought into the film’s messages of hope and redemption and cried at the ending, however? Then Thursday night’s matchup of the Yankees and White Sox at a pop-up ballpark adjacent to the original movie diamond — just through a cornfield, naturally — will serve as a real-life sequel of sorts to the fictional original. Because, in a vacuum, holding a regular-season baseball contest on active farmland isn’t much more absurd than ghost ballplayers emerging from a cornfield.

“When you can hold dreams and memories back from movies, these things mean a lot,” YES Network analyst (and former Yankee, of course) Paul O’Neill said. “It’s such a great idea. Such a cool thing.”

“I would never have imagined they’d play a major league game there,” said actor Dwier Brown, who played John Kinsella in the movie, “and I couldn’t be more excited about it.”

Brown will join his cinematic son, Kevin Costner, the film’s star, in pregame festivities that surely won’t hold back on milking the movie’s most popular elements. Fans will enter the premises via the original field, a tourist site since the movie’s release and success, and walk through the corn to the Yankees-White Sox game. Those corn stalks, cultivated by MLB, will be as tall as 12 feet, which you’ll be able to see through the mesh of the right field wall. Don’t be surprised if the players themselves utilize the corn as an entry point, just like their fictional counterparts.

The new MLB field in Dyersville, Iowa for the Yankees-White Sox Field of Dreams game. MLB

In all, MLB spent more than $5 million to construct and maintain the temporary ballpark, for which plans began last year, only for COVID-19 to cause a one-year postponement. Former Yankees general manager Murray Cook, who specializes in helping baseball put on these events, said he utilized the backstop and bullpen seats, among other supplies, from the Yankees-Red Sox London Series of 2019. The stands will hold 7,911 fans, with Iowans getting access to about 2,500 of them.

“We’ve been trying to find these really cool, iconic locations, places that don’t get to normally experience Major League Baseball,” said Chris Marinak, MLB’s chief operations and strategy officer. “We had one in Omaha, and Fort Bragg, and now our first game in Iowa. This one has a special sort of feeling to it because the movie itself was such a widely appealing movie. Even non-baseball fans watch that movie and love that movie because of that message and storytelling in the movie.”

It should only enhance the site’s appeal that this remains an active farm, growing soybeans in addition to corn. Joe and Catherine Lansing purchased it in 1906 — the barn is believed to go back to around 1860 — and started a family there, although poor Catherine died during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 (talk about the circle of life), and Joe’s grandson Donnie ran the farm in the late 1980s when Sue Reidel, a volunteer for the Iowa film office, approached him with an idea: Universal Studios wanted to film a movie on his land, which they liked because of its look — especially that farmhouse — and because it was large enough to build a baseball field.

“He kind of looked at her and thought, ‘Boy, is she crazy or what?’ ” said Becky Lansing, Don’s wife.

She wasn’t, naturally. The studio performed some construction on the house to make it more film-crew friendly, knocking down some walls (the house scenes were actually filmed there), and Don Lansing relocated to a nearby trailer to let the Hollywood people do their thing. When the film connected with the masses, the Lansings retained the field and turned it into a tourist attraction.

“In the first year, we logged about 5,000 people,” Becky Lansing said. “It continued to double in size, from five to 10 [thousand], 15, 30, 40, 50.”

Other Iowans saw even greater potential in the land, in people’s thirst to connect with this film. In 2012, the Lansings sold it to a consortium of investors (called Go the Distance) led by Denise Stillman, who envisioned turning the field into a hotbed for youth baseball tournaments, with 18 fields added to the original (which wouldn’t get touched). A spark for that plan, Stillman thought, would be to hold a major league game there.

“The Field of Dreams isn’t as much of a baseball field as a feeling,” said Mietzel, who married Stillman in 2016. “It’s a place where family and friends come together. That’s how she got rolling on it.”

As Stillman engaged with MLB officials on this wild-card idea, though, she contracted liver cancer in April 2017. She died in November 2018, and just a few months later, MLB and Go The Distance completed the agreement to hold the Yankees-White Sox game there.

“Much of what we’re doing out here is her vision,” Mietzel said. “This was her dream.”

And for the Lansings, whose family lived and worked here for over 100 years, “The sentiment behind the move is a pretty strong bond for us. Most people look at it as a mecca for baseball and for many other things as well,” Becky Lansing said. “We have the added honor of having had it as a family legacy, which I’m hoping now is secure in the history books of the social fabric of our country.”

The Field of Dreams, boosted by MLB’s presence here, should welcome more than 200,000 visitors this year, Meitzel said, and there’s increased optimism they’ll accrue the necessary funds to put Stillman’s full plan in motion.

As for whether this game will be an MLB one-off or the launch to a tradition, Marinak said: “We’ll see how things unfold this first time around. Obviously it’s a lot of effort to keep the field up, plant the corn again. We’ve got to make the call on whether this is a one-time experience or we can do something more with it. We’ll figure that out after this week.

“But this is a good example of the type of thing we can be doing in the future, an off-the-beaten-path type of game.”

It required quite a path to get here, into the past, into such rich emotions. This will mark a rare occasion in which you root for the Yankees and White Sox themselves, not protected by a script, to live up to their surroundings and fanfare.

The PGA Tour provides the last opportunity for players to clinch their spots into the top 125 in FedEx Cup standings to make the playoffs and lock up playing privileges for the 2021-22 season at this weekend’s Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, N.C.

Hideki Matsuyama and Webb Simpson are the 12/1 co-favorites, with Louis Oosthuizen next at 14/1. Here are some longer shots with a chance to win at Sedgefield Country Club:

Sungjae Im (30/1): Now that the Olympics are behind him, Im can focus on his usual busy PGA Tour schedule again. He has finishes of sixth and ninth the past two years at Sedgefield. While he was way off on the greens last week (-4.6 SG: Putting), he is back on the preferred Bermuda this week.

Russell Henley (33/1): Rates third on the PGA Tour this season for SG: Approach and is eight-best in this field over the last 24 rounds. Henley has made three of four cuts at Sedgefield, with a best of ninth last year. Henley also has been in good form, with recent finishes of 13-19-11.

Charl Schwartzel (50/1): Should come to Greensboro refreshed from three weeks off after posting his best finish of 2021 last time at the 3M Open, with a T-2. While not a regular participant at the Wyndham, Schwartzel has gone third and 14th in his last two appearances at Sedgefield. The South African ranks seventh in this field in Strokes Gained: Putting on fast Bermuda grass greens in his past 24 rounds.

Jhonattan Vegas (50/1): Has three runner-up finishes this year, including two in his last five starts (Palmetto, 3M Open) plus four top 20s (including T-16 at the Olympics) in his last five starts. Not much course success, but his recent form should outweigh the course history. Vegas rates 12th in this week’s field for SG: Approach and fourth for Birdie or Better: Gained over the last 24 rounds.

Rickie Fowler (50/1): Currently sits at No. 130 in the FedEx Cup standings and needs a good week to climb back into the top 125, or he will have to rely on the lifetime PGA Tour money list exemption to maintain his full playing privileges. The putter has started to fire again though for Fowler of late as he rates 15th in this week’s field for SG: Short Game.

Brendon Todd (66/1): He has had a down season and likely just kind of hangs on inside the top 125. Todd, however, has posted his best season performances tee-to-green in two of his last three PGA Tour starts.

Patton Kizzire (80/1): After back-to-back T-3 finishes at the Colonial and Byron Nelson in May, Kizzire hit a dry spell missing three straight cuts. He has, however, made three in a row since. This is the type of event in which a birdie-maker like Kizzire should thrive. In his past 24 rounds, he ranks first in the field in Birdies or Better: Gained. He is a specialist on the Bermuda grass and ranks third in the field for SG: Putting on Bermuda (Fast) greens.

Chez Reavie (80/1): Despite having just one top 10 finish this season, Reavie has made seven of his last eight cuts. He has gained strokes both on Approach and Tee-To-Green in each of his last seven starts. He currently rates 114th in the FedEx Cup standings, so he is likely safe to make the playoffs, but this looks like a spot for him to move up toward the top 70 and make the second playoff event, the BMW Championship.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thought we were turning the corner, but Rico Laraja writes, “There are people that actually bet your picks. So learn how to do this a little better.”

My apologies, Rico. There is a guy that used to be Governor of New York. Let me let him explain. “The serious allegations made against me have no credible basis. Don’t get me wrong, this is not to say there are not 11 gamblers who I truly offended. There are. And for that I deeply, deeply apologize. I take full responsibility for my actions. My sense of humor can be insensitive and off-putting … but the best way I can help now is to step aside.”

Or … take Adam Wainwright again! We’ve played Wainwright (10-6, 3.48 ERA) the last three times he’s pitched and he’s won all three, going seven innings in each. Cards are in the Steel City. Wil Crowe (3-6, 5.47 ERA) throws for the Bucs. Play 20 units on the Red Birds.

They’re Grrreat! The Tigers mauled Keegan Akin for six runs in just three innings and went on to beat the Orioles 9-4. Victory has us at -665 fidrychs.

David Price has made five All-Star teams as a starting pitcher, but had yet to show that form with the Dodgers entering Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia.

Though Price’s record is 4-1, all of those wins have come out of the bullpen. The Dodgers are 2-6 in his starts and he has gone more than 4 1/3 innings just twice. He has a 4.24 ERA with a 1.7 strikeout-to-walk rate on the road, compared to 2.93 and 9.0 at home.

Trade-deadline acquisition Kyle Gibson has won his first two starts for the Phillies, and overall this season has an 8-3 record with a 2.79 ERA with 0.6 home runs per nine innings allowed. Philadelphia also entered the series ranked seventh in the majors in bullpen ERA over the past 30 days; the Dodgers were 13th in that span.

The Phillies entered Tuesday 8-0 in August and 34-21 at home this season (compared to a 25-32 road record), so their playoff push will continue on Wednesday.

The play: Phillies, +105.

LAS VEGAS — A quarterback competition is developing in Patriots camp, and it’s not going to stay under the media radar for long. Sooner or later, rookie Mac Jones will pass veteran Cam Newton in the race to be the starter.

Bill Belichick’s attempt at a bounce-back year appears to be one of the NFL’s most intriguing storylines, beginning with a big decision the New England coach might be forced to make after evaluating his top two quarterbacks in August.

Jones, the 15th-overall pick in the draft, is considered the future and the long-term heir apparent to Tom Brady. Belichick has named Newton the starter, but if Jones continues to develop in the preseason, his future likely will come sooner than initially expected.

The Newton-Jones duel might make the Patriots a bet-on team in the preseason, when quarterback competitions become a high-priority handicapping angle.

“I am high on the Patriots,” said VSiN analyst Michael Lombardi, a former NFL executive who worked in the New England organization from 2014-15. “I think they can win 10 games, and I have faith in Belichick. I know they really like Mac Jones a lot. Will he beat out Cam by Week 1? I don’t know. If they can get anything from the quarterback position, they’re going to be OK.”

Belichick plans to start Newton when the Patriots open the preseason Thursday as two-point home underdogs to Washington, but he may play only one or two series. Jones is the current No. 2, ahead of Brian Hoyer and Jarrett Stidham (who had back surgery recently and is expected to miss three months).

The Patriots played three quarterbacks last season — Newton, Hoyer and Stidham — who combined for 10 touchdown passes with 14 interceptions. New England ranked 27th in the league in scoring offense, with 20.4 ppg.

Jones, who led Alabama to the national championship last season, is a rhythm passer and a good fit for offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels’ system. Newton is more of a read-option running threat, so the Patriots essentially operate two different offenses with Newton and Jones.

“For me in preseason, I look at the coaches’ interest in winning, offensive lines and quarterbacks,” Lombardi said.

Belichick’s team is coming off a 7-9 finish, his first losing season since 2000 and his first regular season with fewer than 10 wins since 2002. The BetMGM win total for the Patriots is 9.5. After beefing up the offensive line and rebuilding the defense, he must find an answer to the quarterback question and seems likely to put more emphasis on preseason games.

A look at some of the best and worst QB rotations heading into the preseason:

Bet-on teams

Bears: First-round pick Justin Fields from Ohio State will get a thorough audition. Fields’ mobility should help him move the ball when the offensive line breaks down, which happens frequently when backups play. Andy Dalton is the starter, and former Super Bowl winner Nick Foles is No. 3, unless he gets traded.

Bills: Josh Allen is rising into the elite category as a starter, so his August action will be limited. He’s backed up by former Bears starter Mitchell Trubisky, Jake Fromm and Davis Webb, a third-round pick by the Giants in 2017.

Josh Allen Getty Images

49ers: Jimmy Garoppolo is the starter, but rookie Trey Lance is having a strong camp and the third-overall pick will see extensive playing time. Josh Rosen and Nate Sudfeld are experienced backups.

Jaguars: New coach Urban Meyer plans to play No. 1 pick Trevor Lawrence along with last year’s starter, Gardner Minshew. C.J. Beathard and Jake Luton are solid backups.

Raiders: Jon Gruden considers himself an expert quarterback coach and will want to evaluate Marcus Mariota and Nathan Peterman behind Derek Carr.

“With Carr and Mariota, the Raiders really have two starters,” VSiN oddsmaker Vinny Magliulo said. “I think the Raiders are one of the teams in the best shape.”

Bet-against teams

Bengals: The backup plan to Joe Burrow, who’s returning from an injury-shortened rookie season, is not promising: Brandon Allen, Kyle Shurmur and Eric Dungey.

Lombardi said, “Who are you going to beat with those guys? A team I think [is] going to be bad is Cincinnati.”

Dolphins: Tua Tagovailoa is followed by Colts castoff Jacoby Brissett and Reid Sinnett, who went undrafted out of the University of San Diego.

“A team that should really be concerned is Miami,” Magliulio said. “You can’t like what you were seeing out of Tua last year.”

Zach Wilson Bill Kostroun/New York Post

Jets: Second-overall pick Zach Wilson is already going through rookie growing pains in practice. There’s a weak cast behind him: Mike White, James Morgan and Josh Johnson.

“I think the Jets [will] be a bad team in preseason,” Lombardi said.

Lions: Rams reject Jared Goff is backed up by David Blough and Tim Boyle.

Rams: Matthew Stafford will not play a snap in the preseason, according to coach Sean McVay. John Wolford is a good No. 2, but Bryce Perkins and Devlin Hodges will play a lot for McVay, who cares little about winning in August.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Simone Biles fired back at a Twitter critic for “twisting my words” about abortion and foster care.

On Monday, the seven-time Olympic medalist asked fans to share their “unpopular opinions” so she could reveal her replies on her Instagram Story.

In response to an Instagram user who wrote, “abortion is wrong,” Biles acknowledged, “I already know this is going to start the biggest argument and may even lose followers.”

Despite that statement, she continued, “BUT I’m very much pro-choice. Your body. Your choice.

“Also for everyone gonna say, ‘Just put it up for adoption,’ it’s not that easy and coming from someone who was in the foster care system TRUST me foster care system is broken and it’s TOUGH especially on the kids and young adults who age out and adoption is expensive … I’m just saying.”

On Tuesday, Biles took to Twitter to clarify her previous comments after she said a critic misinterpreted the 24-year-old’s stance in a since-deleted tweet.

“DO NOT misconstrue my words. That is not at all what I implied,” Biles wrote in response to the tweet. It’s unclear what exactly was shared in the since-deleted message.

“I did NOT say I support to abort rather than to put them through the foster care system. What I did imply is that you should not control someone elses body/decision. Let’s be real what you care about is control…

“I have forever & will continue to support foster kids. AS I WAS ONE. I’ve been an advocate for foster kids and the system but you wouldn’t know that because you don’t follow me, you just like to open your mouth.

“Also if you have a fake account don’t even talk to me. Y’all piss me off to no end. I’m done because you’ll twist my words however it feels fitting to spew hate. Also if anyone is seeing this just know I support you doing whatever feels fitting for YOU.”

Biles has been open about her experience in the foster care system from ages 2 to 5. Her grandfather, Ron Biles, and his wife, Nellie, eventually adopted Biles and her three siblings.

“I know exactly how it is, and I know exactly how you feel being a foster kid,” Biles told USA Today in late July. “I can be a voice for them. I can help them, and I can tell them that they’re not alone and that it’s going to be OK. That you can also still be great in the world. Being in foster care isn’t going to be your only title.”

Biles’ tweets came days after she arrived home from the Tokyo Olympics, where she won a silver medal in the team all-around and bronze in the individual balance beam.

The Athleta-sponsered athlete dropped out of four of the five individual event finals at the Summer Games to prioritize her mental health. She also withdrew from the team all-around final.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Undisputed” host Jenny Taft gave co-host Skip Bayless the business on Wednesday’s episode of the FS1 show.

While discussing HBO’s “Hard Knocks,” which features the Cowboys in its new season, Taft took issue with Bayless over his comment about Dallas head coach Mike McCarthy’s physical appearance.

“I don’t know if Mike McCarthy’s motivational speech [in ;Hard Knocks’] was the most inspiring, but criticizing his appearance — I don’t know if that’s a fair shot for Mike McCarthy, I’m going to leave it at that,” Taft said.

When she attempted to move on with the show, Bayless said, “Thanks, Jenny, appreciate that,” to which she reiterated, “I don’t think it is a fair shot.”

Bayless hit back, “Well, I don’t think that’s a fair shot.”

Taft, who played lacrosse at Boston University, didn’t back down from her argument.

“Is everyone who’s ever coached as fit as you, Skip? I don’t think that’s a fair shot whatsoever,” she said. “I’ve actually had plenty of coaches that have not had the perfect, ideal physique, including my college coach, so I don’t think that’s a fair shot.”

Bayless explained his opinions about McCarthy’s appearance were fueled by “personal preference” and therefore, “I wouldn’t want [McCarthy] to be my head coach.”

Taft then reminded Bayless, “I’m allowed to have an opinion, Skip. I am allowed to say whatever I want to say on this show, as you do too.”

While she previewed sports analyst Chris Brossard’s upcoming appearance on the show, Taft fiercely added, “And maybe I have more to say.”

Twitter users who caught Taft’s dialogue were quick to praise the host on social media and slam Bayless for his “ignorant comments.”

“Damn Jenny Taft pissed. Skip pretty much said she doesn’t have a voice on the show!,” one viewer tweeted.

“Jenny Taft just checked Skip Bayless like he should have been!,” another added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.

Celebrities: they’re allegedly just like us.

Now, be just like them, too — or at least dress like it — with the Free People FP Movement collection that celebs from Addison Rae and Hailey Bieber to Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens are obsessed with.

Spanning leggings, jackets, crop tops and more, the activewear collection has been snapped by paparazzi left and right. Even better, the celebs themselves have sung their praises for the workout gear, posting to their own social media in the outfits, like “The Hills” Whitney Port and real-estate developer and lead of season 12 of “The Bachelorette” Joelle Fletcher.

Another aspect of the FP Movement collection is giving back, as 1% of all FP Movement purchases benefit the non-profit Girls Inc, which works to empower women and girls with fitness and wellness programming and support. After all, if you are going to dress like a celebrity, you may as well act like one and do some philanthropy while you shop.

Since online shopping can be hard, forcing you to rely on studio photography and editing when looking at the clothes, we thought we’d let the star snaps be your shopping inspiration. See how Bieber styles her fuzzy fleece jacket to grab a green juice and take notes on Rae’s periwinkle one-piece ensemble, as she tips her hat to the FP Movement collection.

We hope you get some good karma and feel some star quality when rocking these leggings from the FP Movement collection.

Actress and TV personality Whitney Port shared a photo on her Instagram story wearing the Good Karma leggings in the delicious chocolate color. The “The Hills” star paired it with a matching bra top as well, which we found to be the Square Neck Good Karma Bra for just $48, should you want to take your own mirror selfie in a matching set.

Start your day with a trip to the gym and you may run into Addison Rae doing the same.

The star was snapped by paparazzi wearing the Good Karma Onesie in an amazing Faded Periwinkle color. Since the outfit is one-piece, all the TikTok star needed to do was throw on a pair of white sneakers and a black baseball cap and her look was a done deal.

Celebrities favorite FP Movement jackets

Whether you’re actually on the ski slopes or just cozied up in your room this fall, the Hit The Slopes Fleece is a celebrity must-have.

Especially for model Kaia Gerber, who owns the jacket in both the dark blue Eclipse color and the fun purple Jamming version. Perfect to pair with a full athleisure look or dress up over jeans and a top, the jacket comes in an array of colors, that both you and Gerber can collect.

Forget the slopes and have a blast dancing in the streets like Hailey Bieber back in April.

The model, formerly known as Hailey Baldwin before her marriage to Justin Bieber, was spotted by an Instagram fan account back in April, wearing the Printed Hit the Slopes Fleece Jacket in the Black Toile Combo color. The coat also comes in pink daisies, brown zebra and an array of other fun patterns, all of which can help you feel like the model while also staying nice and comfy all fall long.

GC Images

No, you aren’t seeing double.

Bieber is back on our list and wearing another version of the fuzzy jacket, but this time in a pull-over style. The celeb was spotted by the paparazzi wearing the Victory Red-colored Hit The Slopes Colorblock Pullover, holding a few drinks and donning a black beanie and matching mask.

Since the star’s spotting, the red color is almost sold out on the site, only available in an extra small size. However, if you are a fan of hit pink, you’re in luck as the Haute Pink Combo color of the same style is still in stock in all sizes from an XS to a large.

Celebrities favorite FP Movement tops

Photos via Instagram

Is it the 2000’s again or are Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens playing a trick on us?

This surely is good karma for fans of these celebs, as they both posted outfit pics of themselves in the Good Karma Crop tank tops, Hudgens in an Instagram Live wearing the Red Apple color and Duff in a full outfit of Dried Rose. Both actresses paired their tops with matching leggings, but feel free to “Say OK” to wearing them with jeans or a skirt, because “Why Not” mix and match a bit?

Image via Instagram

Will you accept this tank?

Joelle “JoJo” Fletcher will, as “The Bachelor” contestant and star of “The Bachelorette” was spotted on her Instagram wearing the Happiness Runs Crop in a stunning Azur blue color. Great for a tropical ride on a golf cart like Fletcher or relaxing at home like the rest of us, the stretchy active tank top can be worn to the gym or styled into your everyday outfits, coming in an array of bright and fun colors to choose from.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANSAS CITY, Mo. — After the Yankees put another player on the injured list, they went out and won another game.

Despite making three errors — after committing a season-high four in Tuesday’s loss — the Yankees beat the Royals, 5-2, on a day in which the heat index soared well over 100 degrees at Kauffman Stadium.

“A lot of good things happened today,’’ Aaron Boone said. “Overall, though, we didn’t play very well. We were fortunate to come out of here with a win. We need to play a little better than that.”

For the ultra-positive Boone, those were harsh words, but the results remain solid, even after right-hander Clay Holmes became the latest Yankee to be shelved, placed on the COVID-IL Wednesday.

“We’re kind of waiting to get to full strength,’’ Aaron Judge said. “After the trade deadline, when we made some big moves and were moving in the right direction, it was like, ‘Let’s get it rolling.’ And once again, we were hit with a couple things. This team is resilient. We’re always in the fight. It doesn’t matter who goes down. We’ve seen that over the last couple series.”

Tyler Wade smacked a double in the fourth inning. Getty Images

The Yankees scored three runs in the first and used six pitchers to win their seventh game in the last nine, as they battle for a playoff spot with 20 players shelved.

“There’s so much talent in that room,’’ said Tyler Wade, who had two hits, a walk, a run scored and a stolen base. “Our intensity right now and focus is in a good spot.’’

And once again, it didn’t come easily, as the Royals brought the potential tying run to the plate with one out in the bottom of the ninth thanks to a hit by pitch and an error before the struggling Zack Britton got pinch-hitter Carlos Santana to hit into a game-ending double play.

DJ LeMahieu led off the game with a walk and the Yankees loaded the bases with a lined single to center by Judge and a Joey Gallo walk.

Luke Voit came through with a two-run single to right and Rougned Odor drove in another run with a single to left to make it 3-0.

Lucas Luetge, used as an opener, gave a run back in the bottom of the inning, as the pesky Whit Merrifield singled to start the inning, stole second and moved to third on a wild pitch before scoring on a Salvador Perez groundout.

Wade sparked a two-run fourth with a leadoff double, scoring on a LeMahieu single. And LeMahieu came around to score on another hit by Judge.

Albert Abreu pitched well in relief of Luetge, allowing just a run in 2 ¹/₃ innings.

Left-hander Joely Rodriguez finished the fifth before Chad Green tossed two scoreless innings, striking out three.

Jonathan Loaisiga pitched the eighth and Britton, in the midst of his worst stretch in years, closed it in the ninth for his first save of the season.

“I think we kind of embraced it as a bullpen,’’ Green said of the bullpen game with the Yankees scrambling for starters.

The Yankees would rather not be dealing with the vast array of injuries and COVID cases, but they’re making the best of the situation, according to Luetge, who made his first career start on Wednesday and has pitched well after not appearing in the majors since 2015 prior to this year.

“If anything, it’s given guys opportunities they might not have had in different positions,’’ Luetge said. “It gave us a spark, the younger players coming up here with energy. It makes the older guys feel young again.”

Just in time for the “Field of Dreams” Game in Iowa against the White Sox on Thursday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A day after acting general manager Zack Scott called the Mets’ current stretch “unacceptably bad,” they took a step toward rinsing off the stench.

It required some help from a Nationals roster that was dismantled at the trade deadline, but the Mets gladly accepted it as they snapped a four-game losing streak with an 8-7 comeback win Wednesday at Citi Field.

In the resumption of the game that began Tuesday night and was suspended by rain in the second inning, the Mets erased a pair of three-run deficits to win their first game in a week. The nightcap of the doubleheader was postponed by rain, with another twin bill now scheduled for Thursday beginning at 12:10 p.m.

Brandon Drury continued to come through in the clutch as a pinch hitter, blooping a single past a drawn-in infield in the eighth inning to score Jonathan Villar to put the Mets ahead — capturing their first lead since last Wednesday against the Marlins.

“It shows who we are as an offensive team,” manager Luis Rojas said. “It’s been tough to watch at times, just for the number of days we weren’t doing what we did tonight. … We just gotta keep believing in that’s who we are and keep going game to game with the same approach.”

Villar had reached on an error earlier in the inning while trying to put down a sacrifice bunt. Instead, J.D. Davis, who led off with a double, came around to score the tying run as Nationals reliever Mason Thompson’s throw to first was wild.

Edwin Diaz closed out the win in the ninth as the Mets (57-55) won for just the second time in nine games. They also snapped an 18-game streak of scoring five runs or fewer, which was tied for their second-longest streak in the last 10 seasons.

Beginning with Thursday’s doubleheader — single-admission, with both games seven innings — the Mets still have 10 games left this season against the Nationals (50-63). They will need to take advantage of that in order to climb back into playoff position.

“It’s going to be like this for the next month and a half — very intense games,” said Rich Hill, who volunteered to start Wednesday’s resumption and gave up three runs over three innings as a bridge to the bullpen.

Pete Alonso had narrowly missed out on tying the game in the seventh inning with a shot to left-center field. He was forced to settle for an RBI double off the top of the wall, scoring Brandon Nimmo from first to get the Mets within 7-6. It came after Michael Conforto’s RBI single in the fifth inning scored Jeff McNeil from first to make it 7-5.

Entering the day with a 3-1 deficit, Hill quickly let it grow to 4-1 when he allowed an inherited runner to score on a Victor Robles’ double to left field, which Dominic Smith leapt for near the wall but could not catch.

The Mets began their comeback in the third inning off Joe Ross. Nimmo led off with a double and scored on a single by McNeil to make it 4-2. Alonso then shot a single through the left side before Smith flew out to deep left-center field, allowing McNeil and Alonso to tag up to third and second, respectively.

Conforto came up next and hit a weak ground ball to first base, but it was enough to score McNeil to close within 4-3. Davis then tied the game when he roped a two-out double to left field.

After Hill spotted the Nationals another three-run lead, 7-4 in the fifth inning, the Mets began another comeback for their biggest offensive output since July 19.

“This is what we’ve done for the most part this year, is just fight and find our way into really, really big wins,” Rojas said. “We’ve had a lot of big wins; this is one of them. I think it just shows who we are.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Yankees have been impacted yet again by COVID-19.

Right-hander Clay Holmes was added to the COVID injured list Wednesday after he reported symptoms, and the team was awaiting test results. Brooks Kriske was activated to take his place on the roster before Wednesday’s 5-2 win over the Royals at Kauffman Stadium, though he did not pitch.

The Yankees are already without Anthony Rizzo, Gary Sanchez, Gerrit Cole and Jordan Montgomery, who were part of the most recent outbreak.

Asked Tuesday about the team’s troubles with COVID-19, which has now sidelined 12 players over the course of the season, Zack Britton said it was “frustrating.”

“We don’t know why it keeps happening,’’ Britton said. “We’re over 90 percent vaccinated [as a traveling group]. We did everything we felt we needed to do to protect ourselves.”

Rizzo is the only Yankee who has publicly admitted not being vaccinated, but the team has had at least one other non-breakthrough case.

On getting the vaccine, Britton said: “We knew it didn’t mean you can’t get COVID, but it lessens the symptoms — which it has in some cases and hasn’t in others. Guys are still getting severe symptoms like they never got the vaccine.”

Britton said he has no answers as to why the Yankees have had so many cases.

“It’s hard to say,’’ said Britton, who battled the virus during the offseason. “Guys have been coming to the field, playing baseball. I know guys aren’t going out doing stuff they shouldn’t be doing. … I don’t know why we’re leading the pack and other teams seem not to have any cases. At this point, it’s pretty annoying.”

It’s especially annoying with the Yankees still on the outside looking in at the playoffs.

“We’re trying to win games and have a lot of important guys out,’’ Britton said. “It’s aggravating.”

It’s also another blow to a taxed bullpen that’s without Aroldis Chapman, Mike King and Darren O’Day (all on the IL).

Holmes was acquired in a trade with the Pirates on July 26. In seven appearances since the trade, he’s allowed just five runners and a pair of earned runs in 8 ¹/₃ innings.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@J.R. Smith may soon be a collegiate golfer.

The 35-year-old is enrolling at North Carolina A&T University to pursue a degree in liberal studies and spot on the golf team.

Smith, who spent four of his 16 NBA seasons with the Knicks, is awaiting a decision by the NCAA regarding his eligibility in hopes that he will join the Aggies’ golf team.

Smith entered the 2004 NBA Draft directly out of high school, with the New Orleans Hornets selecting him with the No. 18 pick. He had originally committed to play college basketball for North Carolina.

Speaking to reporters at the Wyndham Championship Pro-Am on Wednesday, Smith said he began golfing 12 years ago thanks to advice from Basketball Hall of Famer Moses Malone. Smith currently has a 5 handicap.

“Knowing that all of the game is pretty much in my own hands, I don’t have to worry about teammates to pass the ball to or receiving passes and playing defense,” said Smith, who last played in the NBA in 2020. “I can just play my game. Just have fun.”

Smith — a two-time NBA champion who made $90 million — said that conversations with Ray Allen and Chris Paul helped him decide to go to college. He will begin taking classes on Aug. 18.

“It’s been a long, long time since I’ve been in school,” Smith said. “I’m excited about these new challenges and I’ll have to really buckle down. … I can’t wait to be a part of the HBCU family and to really be embraced by everybody on campus already has been great.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — Although the Knicks selected Quentin Grimes in the first round of last month’s draft, he wasn’t exactly the featured guy on offense during their first three summer league games at the Thomas & Mack Center.

The 6-foot-4 shooting guard, who led the University of Houston to the Final Four in March, has taken a backseat to the Knicks’ two first-round picks from the 2020 draft — Immanuel Quickley and Obi Toppin.

Cougars head coach Kelvin Sampson noticed Grimes struggling to adjust to the lesser role and to a point guard who isn’t exactly Chris Paul.

“Quentin has to learn he’s not the lead dog,’’ Sampson told The Post after viewing the first two contests. “It’s an adjustment for all these guys. The way you play in college, eventually you’ll get to that. Quickley is a shoot-first, shoot-second, shoot-third point guard. Toppin, you can tell there’s an interest in getting those two guys going. I can tell Quentin was nervous his first game too. Quentin will operate a lot better when you run stuff for him and let him make plays out of that.”

Ironically, the 21-year-old Grimes drilled his first shot on his first touch — a left-wing 3-pointer — but hasn’t seen many go down since.

In the three games, he’s gone 8 of 30 in combined shooting — 7 of 22 from 3. He’s put up nine points, six points and eight points, respectively. On the positive side, he has just one turnover in two games and was a team-high plus-21 in Wednesday’s 91-82 win over the Lakers.

The Knicks (2-1) topped the Lakers with Grimes contributing eight points (on 3-of-9 shooting, 2-of-8 from 3) and nine rebounds. Sampson said before the game he hoped the rookie would be more assertive.

“I thought he was too passive,’’ Sampson said. “In summer league, it’s OK to be a little selfish. Don’t take bad shots but you have to look at your window of opportunity. If you give it up, it won’t come back his way. I know how aggressive he is and how good he will be. You shouldn’t draw conclusions based on summer league games.’’

Grimes, who has a good-looking jump shot taught to him by his father — who played at Louisiana Tech — doesn’t seem worried.

“Really just keep shooting,’’ Grimes said. “You’re not going to make every shot. Some nights it’s not going to be your night, some nights it is. I feel like everybody knows how good of a shooter I am. My teammates know. So all I got to do is stay in the gym and keep shooting, it’s going to fall for sure.’’

Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau and president Leon Rose have yet to comment on Grimes, whom the Knicks picked No. 25 overall on July 29.

Grimes was looking like a one-and-done when he enrolled at Kansas three years ago as arguably the nation’s hottest recruit. He didn’t mesh well with the Jayhawks coaching staff and transferred after his freshman year to his hometown university, where he played two seasons.

“Quentin never said [he’d be one-and-done],’’ Sampson said. “You’re held victim by other people’s opinions. When he left Kansas and came here, the discussions we had was he always felt he needed more than one year.’’

Just as Grimes joined the Cougars, the program took a 10-day summer exhibition tour of Italy — Florence, Milan, Rome, Lake Como. Grimes bonded overseas with the new staff and teammates, Sampson said.

“He flipped over a new sheet and started drawing,’’ Sampson said. “He had the outline of something beautiful and special but it wasn’t finished. He put his pen down and walked away [from Kansas]. Two years later he came back and you turn the lights on and look at the picture. Wow, look at that. Some kids are late bloomers.’’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — Now it’s official, official.

Kemba Walker, The Bronx native who played high school ball at Rice in Harlem, is coming home to run the point for the Knicks, the club finally announced Wednesday morning.

“We are beyond thrilled to bring native New Yorker Kemba Walker back to the city he’s proud to call home,” Knicks president Leon Rose said in a statement. “He’s a tremendous talent whose skill and leadership will be a huge addition to our organization.

“We’ve already seen how well he performs on The Garden stage and can’t wait to witness it on a nightly basis in front of his family, friends and the best fans in the league.”

According to a source, Walker’s new Knicks deal is fully guaranteed at two years, $18 million — no options. Walker gave up about $20.5 million in a buyout with Oklahoma City to become a free agent and sign with the Knicks, who had $8 million-$9 million of cap space left that he grabbed.

Even if it is a fallback option, due to Walker’s recent injury history, the addition could turn into a storybook signing for the franchise should the 31-year-old pan out and lead the Knicks to a second straight playoff berth.

The Knicks released a two-minute video narrated by actor Chazz Palminteri, a Bronx native, that detailed Walker’s illustrious career.

“The game of basketball came naturally to him,’’ Palminteri said, touting Walker’s “rare talent’’ with the “iconic” New York Gauchos on the AAU circuit, winning the 2011 NCAA title at UConn, his game-winning buzzer-beater at the Garden during the Big East Tournament and being drafted No. 9 overall by Charlotte.

Palminteri added Walker went on to “countless clutch buckets and breaking ankles along the way.”

“The résumé speaks for itself,’’ the actor added. “But as they say in a different ‘Bronx Tale’, you got to do what your heart tells you to do. And for Kemba Walker, that means coming back to where it all began.’’

Walker, a four-time All-Star, regressed last season because of an arthritic left knee that needed stem-cell injections before the season. A leading sports orthopedist from Northwestern University recently told The Post that condition for a 31-year-old is tougher to respond to than an ACL surgery.

Walker was only able to play 43 games for Boston and struggled while playing in just three of the five playoff games in a first-round playoff loss to the Nets. Walker averaged 19.3 points last season and 4.9 assists but his shooting percentage dropped to 42 percent.

In a surprising twist, the Celtics replaced Walker by adding veteran point guard Dennis Schroder on a one-year, $5.9 million deal Tuesday.

The Knicks finished last season in fourth place in the conference with a 41-31 record, but several Eastern Conference teams behind them have improved — most notably Miami, Chicago, Charlotte and Washington.

The Knicks feel they have, too, with an upgrade at shooting guard of Evan Fournier over the departed Reggie Bullock and Walker over point guard Elfrid Payton, who signed with the NBA finalist Phoenix Suns.

“Offseason moves were great. We added a guy Kemba Walker who can do it all, somebody I can learn from, compete with to expand my game,’’ guard Immanuel Quickley said after Monday’s summer league game. “I want to be where he is eventually one day.

“So no better guy than Kemba Walker to come in — just like I learned from Derrick Rose, I can learn from somebody else. And Evan Fournier, competitor, shooter — so we added shooting and defense. I think we made great moves this offseason.”

In 2018, the summer before Walker’s free agency when he was with Charlotte, he told The Post speculation of him becoming a Knick never dissipates.

“I’ve been hearing it for years now — the Knicks,” Walker said. “Every time I come home, it’s, ‘When are you coming home to the Knicks?’ MSG is a special place, man. The Knicks are a special team. Of course, I’ve been a Knicks fan growing up, always rooted for the home team. But I really can’t see myself in a Knicks jersey — only because I’ve been in one jersey.’’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jabrill Peppers has a message for anyone who believes Joe Judge has been too tough on the Giants during training camp.

“The guys here, we love him,” the starting safety said before the Giants practiced Wednesday night at MetLife Stadium. “We like coaches who coach us hard, gonna tell us like it is and not sugarcoat anything.

“He’s gonna push you places that you can’t take yourself. I just think if you don’t like to be coached hard, then you’re not gonna like it here.”

Judge drew outside criticism for penalizing the Giants with laps and push-ups following a brawl in practice last week.

Wide receiver Sterling Shepard similarly defended Judge last week, saying, “If you don’t like it, then you’re welcome to leave.”

Jabrill Peppers is the latest player to defend Joe Judge’s hard-nosed coaching. for the NY POST

Defensive lineman R.J. McIntosh, the Giants’ fifth-round draft pick in 2018, was one of three players cut on Wednesday. He appeared in 18 games over three seasons but was inactive for all 16 games in 2020. Wide receiver Derrick Dillon and Cale Garrett also were waived.

The Giants signed 320-pound defensive tackle Elijah Qualls — the Eagles’ sixth-rounder in 2017 — and DT Willie Henry, who appeared in one game last season for the 49ers.

Judge said offensive tackle Nate Solder’s apparent shoulder injury from Tuesday is “nothing much” and “just normal kind of bumps and bruises from what we can tell.” Solder opted out of last season due to COVID-19 concerns and currently is listed as the backup tackle on both sides of the offensive line.

“I think Nate is obviously having a pretty damn good camp for us. We’re pleased with the progress he’s making right there,” Judge said. “So we want to make sure we keep him on the field as long as we can, but obviously we won’t do anything that puts a player at risk.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Henrik Lundqvist’s attempt at an NHL comeback is underway.

After missing all of last season following open-heart surgery, the former face of the Rangers tweeted a picture of his pads Tuesday and wrote, “Back at it, we’ll see what happens.”

For now, the 39-year-old remains unsigned. Lundqvist was not eligible to participate in the opening of free agency last month because he had not been medically cleared, according to TSN. It’s unclear whether he has been cleared.

Lundqvist’s 15-year tenure with the Rangers ended last September when the final season of his seven-year, $59.5 million contract was bought out following the emergence of young netminders Igor Shesterkin and Alexandar Georgiev.

Lundqvist in October signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal to serve as the Capitals’ backup before revealing two months later that heart inflammation would keep him sidelined.

He attempted a comeback in April but ultimately gave up because he said his “heart isn’t quite ready.”

Lundqvist holds the Rangers record for most wins with 459.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Seton Hall has answered former star Myles Powell’s lawsuit, which alleges the team’s head coach and medical staff acted negligently by having him play on a serious injury, ruining his hopes of an NBA career.

The university said Powell’s claims aren’t even worthy of addressing in earnest. Instead, Seton Hall filed a motion that contends Powell’s case has no legal grounds and the school is asking the case be dismissed. The motion is scheduled to be heard Sept. 7 in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.

“[Seton Hall is saying], they don’t even get an answer from us because this lawsuit has no merit,” attorney Rich Lomurro, who is familiar with the case, but not involved in it, told The Post. “It’s not an uncommon tool to use in these kinds of cases.

“You don’t even get your day in court, that’s what they’re saying to Powell. You don’t even get to have your allegations heard.”

Powell, 24, claimed in his suit on July 14 that Seton Hall, coach Kevin Willard and athletic trainer Anthony Testa allowed him to play with a torn meniscus in his knee. They told him, Powell alleges, that it was a minor injury and would not worsen as he played the 2019-20 season. He claims they acted with negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. That season, it should be noted, Powell was the Big East Player of the Year and a consensus All-American, but went undrafted, though he had been projected to be by draft experts.

In its brief, the university, represented by Patrick Papalia of Archer Law, wrote that New Jersey’s Charitable Immunity Act is grounds for dismissal, since it protects schools such as Seton Hall under its umbrella from the kind of liability in Powell’s complaint. Lomurro, a Seton Hall alum, compared it to someone getting hurt at a YMCA. The YMCA can’t get sued by the person even if he or she gets injured while using the charity’s services, negligence or not.

“It is a very strong immunity in New Jersey and cases are commonly dismissed based on the Charitable Immunity,” Lomurro said.

As for fiduciary duty, Seton Hall claims that under New Jersey law, there isn’t fiduciary duty between a school and student or coach and student. Regarding breach of contract, Seton Hall wrote: “Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for breach of contract [the National Letter of Intent] because Plaintiff has not identified any provision of the contract that was allegedly breached, and an examination of the contract reveals that it does not even remotely contain the contractual duties that Plaintiff alleges and claims existed and were breached.”

If Seton Hall’s motion to dismiss is denied, it will then have to address Powell’s claims. If it is granted, Powell and his attorneys can appeal it in New Jersey’s Appellate Division. But they would still need to overcome Charitable Immunity.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In case the Mets’ Friday the 13th hadn’t been bad enough before a pitch was thrown at Citi Field, the reigning World Series champions were waiting in the visiting dugout.

On a day that began with news of Jacob deGrom being shut down for at least two more weeks because of elbow inflammation that had not fully subsided and Javier Baez going on the injured list with back spasms, the Mets ended it by suffering a crushing loss, 6-5 to the Dodgers in 10 innings.

After coming alive in the seventh inning to erase a 4-0 deficit, sending the season-high crowd of 38,395 into a frenzy, the Mets (59-56) still came up short in extras.

“It was tough,” said Jeff McNeil, who hit a key two-run single in the game-tying rally. “Everyone wants to win, but there’s a lot of positives in that game. Being down 4-0 and clawing back, fighting back, we were right there. … We’re going to hopefully play well tomorrow and get some wins.”

Will Smith hit a two-run homer in the 10th inning that would prove to be the difference. Bill Kostroun/New York Post

Kicking off a daunting 13-game stretch against the Dodgers (70-46) and Giants, two of the National League’s best teams, the Mets missed a chance to reclaim first place in the NL East a week after they had lost it, following a Phillies loss to the Reds on Friday night.

Dodgers catcher Will Smith delivered the decisive blow, leading off the 10th inning with a two-run homer off Jeurys Familia to make it 6-4. Familia was pitching for a third straight day but manager Luis Rojas chalked it up to one “misplaced” pitch.

“Fama’s thrown three days in a row in his career several times and his sinker can get even better on the third day,” Rojas said. “We were down to him and [Aaron] Loup for that situation. With the three righties out of the four hitters, we went with Familia.”

The Mets got a run back in the bottom of the 10th off Kenley Jansen as automatic runner Pete Alonso scored on a groundout by Jonathan Villar. But after the Dodgers intentionally walked James McCann to put runners on first and second with two outs, pinch-hitter Tomas Nido — the last man on the Mets bench — swung at the first pitch he saw and flew out to end the game.

Edwin Diaz, also pitching for a third straight day, navigated a scoreless top of the ninth inning while brushing off some distractions, including an apparent green laser pointed at Dodgers slugger Max Muncy from left field. It caused a brief delay, but Diaz was unbothered, punching out Muncy to end the frame.

The Mets began the night with three regulars out of their starting lineup — left-handed hitters Dominic Smith, Michael Conforto and McNeil sat for Kevin Pillar, Albert Almora Jr. and Brandon Drury against Dodgers lefty Julio Urias — but they ended up being the three key figures in the late comeback.

Conforto pinch hit in the seventh and sparked the four-run, two-out rally with a double. He came around to score on a single by Smith, who had pinch hit two innings earlier, to get the Mets on the scoreboard, 4-1.

Brandon Nimmo followed with a walk before the Dodgers intentionally walked Alonso to bring up McNeil, who had entered as a pinch hitter in the sixth. Facing lefty reliever Justin Bruihl, McNeil came through with a two-run single to center field, pulling the Mets within 4-3.

Blake Treinen relieved Bruihl and his third pitch went to the backstop, allowing Alonso to score from third to tie the game at four to the roar of the crowd. But Villar flew out to strand a pair of runners, a missed opportunity to kick off a vital stretch with a big win.

“Guys played their butts off today,” said rookie right-hander Tylor Megill, who gave the Mets a chance by limiting the Dodgers to three runs over five innings. “Unfortunate the way it ended, but the guys played hard tonight.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Yankees need some notes.

Long before they set foot on a movie set in Iowa, Aaron Boone’s guys displayed a proclivity for extreme drama. They honored their identity by raising that bar Thursday night, mounting a ferocious, two-out, ninth-inning, four-run rally against the dangerous White Sox before losing, 9-8, on Tim Anderson’s two-out, walk-off homer off Zack Britton in the inaugural “Field of Dreams” game.

At 63-52, 22-11 in their last 33 games and winners in nine of their most recent 10 series (and trailing their current get-together with the White Sox), the Yankees have arisen despite a slew of COVID absences, most of them breakthrough cases for vaccinated players, as well as their share of traditional baseball injuries. Throw them some credit. Yet as Brett Gardner said late Thursday night, “Where we are in the standings, we’re running out of time.” They remain out of the playoffs, possessing little room for error and far too many more gut-punch losses, each of which prompts a soulful reassessment.

Hence, in the wake of Thursday night’s mix of baseball and cinema, our equivalent of the notes that wormy studio executives provide, unsolicited and undesired, to the talent. Here are five notes, presented in the most passive-aggressive manner possible, except these actually will help improve the product.

1. We don’t think it works when Zack Britton shows up at the end.

The Yankees’ veteran lefty reliever, a model of excellence from 2014 through last year, is really, really scuffling this season after two injured-list stints. No need to dive too deep on the numbers. How about 12 strikeouts and 12 walks in his 15 ²/₃ innings?

While each of the Yankees’ big four relievers — Britton, the currently injured Aroldis Chapman, Chad Green and Jonathan Loaisiga — is responsible for at least one 2021 gut-punch defeat, right now I’d place Britton third on my closer depth chart, behind Loaisiga (who sure seemed like a better option Thursday against the White Sox’s righty-heavy lineup) and Green.

On Friday, Boone told WFAN that he would “evaluate [Britton] as we go forward a little bit as we try to get him back to where we know he can get to.” That evaluation should result in a demotion.

2. We’re concerned that Andrew Heaney just isn’t right for this role.

Slam-dunk here, right? The veteran lefty, acquired from the Angels at the trade deadline to give the Yankees starting-pitching depth — and they needed it all the more after Cole and Montgomery tested positive — owns a 9.00 ERA in three Yankees starts and has surrendered eight(!) home runs in 15 innings. With Cole and Montgomery back aboard and hoping to rejoin the rotation early next week, Heaney looks primed for at least a demotion to mop-up man and quite possibly a designation for assignment.

3. We’d like to recast third base.

Don’t be too hard on Rougned Odor, who had never patrolled the hot corner professionally prior to this current pinstriped crisis. He received the assignment with Gio Urshela on the injured list and DJ LeMahieu physically compromised (right triceps), and he has calculated minus-2 defensive runs saved, as per Baseball Info Solutions. Do you ever feel confident when the ball gets hit to him? Throw in an offensive slump for the streaky hitter (.150/.261/.250 in August), and he isn’t bringing much to a party in need of life. So switch to Tyler Wade, who owns a .643/.706/.857 line for August while bringing his speed game and, while certainly no Brooks Robinson over there (minus-1 defensive run saved), has more experience at the position than Odor.

4. We still don’t understand why you removed Greg Allen from the story.

Big-time outrage by Yankees fans for the team’s call to replace Allen, the switch-hitting blur, with Jonathan Davis in center field, and it struck me as a bit much only because Allen still works for the organization at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Whatever the Yankees saw in the waiver-claim Davis hasn’t surfaced, though. Time to cut bait and bring back Allen to share center field with Gardner, who went deep Thursday night and is at .333/.444/.433 in August.

5. We see something in Joey Gallo.

Yup, his August numbers (.140/.306/280), which also constitute his Yankees numbers, stink, and his biggest hit, a game-winning homer against the Mariners on Aug. 5, would’ve been a flyout in most ballparks. Not that the Yankees are overflowing with options, nor are they about to jettison a player they control through next season, but the outfielder deserves more time. On Thursday night, with the ball flying into the corn in both left and right field, Gallo hit probably the longest non-homer of the night, a first-inning blast to straightaway center field that Luis Robert caught at the wall. He also drew a pair of walks, including a two-out, ninth-inning base on balls that set up Giancarlo Stanton’s go-ahead blast. Let’s keep watching his takes (and his swings) and see if the results get any better.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jacob deGrom’s two-week shutdown has become a four-week shutdown.

The Mets ace underwent a follow-up MRI exam this week that did not show as much progress in his inflamed elbow as the club had hoped, manager Luis Rojas said Friday. DeGrom will now not throw for another two weeks — putting his season in serious jeopardy.

Rojas said deGrom’s MRI showed “slight improvement,” but not enough to allow him to begin throwing again, as had initially been the hope. Whether or not he pitches again this season will largely depend on his next MRI in two weeks. Even if he is cleared then, he would still need a ramp-up period that could take him well into September.

Each case is different, but generally the amount of time a pitcher is shut down is the same time it takes him to build back up to full strength. In deGrom’s scenario, that could keep him out until around the last week of September, with the regular season ending on Oct. 3.

“He’s frustrated. He wants to pitch,” Rojas said Friday before the Mets played host to the Dodgers in the opener of a huge series at Citi Field. “He wants to help the team. There’s nothing he can do. We just have to commit to these two weeks again now and just follow the experts’ indications and the treatment so he keeps improving there. There is some improvement, but they would like to see more, probably. That’s why the two weeks.”

DeGrom, who last pitched on July 7, is not dealing with any ligament damage, according to Rojas. But the two-time Cy Young winner went to Los Angeles on Thursday to get another opinion on his elbow from Dr. Neal ElAttrache, one of the top orthopedic surgeons in sports.

“It’s strictly inflammation,” Rojas said. “That’s what it showed the first time. It’s less of that now. That’s what I’ve been told.”

Coming out of the All-Star break, the Mets pushed back deGrom’s scheduled start because of forearm tightness before placing him on the injured list on July 15. Two weeks later, he threw his second light bullpen session, but the next day was shut down for two weeks after an MRI revealed further inflammation.

While posting a 1.08 ERA through 15 starts of a dominant season, deGrom had mostly pitched through the multiple injuries that plagued him earlier this season — lat tightness, side tightness and shoulder soreness, all of which he said were all due to swinging the bat. But there has still been no indication of what led to deGrom’s current elbow inflammation.

“Right now we’re listening to our experts, our performance staff, working with Jake,” Rojas said. “Guys that have known Jake for years and guys that have been seeing Jake’s images for years, even since he had the [Tommy John] surgery with the team [in 2010]. We’re trusting that. Right now we’re staying with the next two weeks. That’s what we want to see improve. After that, we can talk about what’s going to happen.”

In the immediate future, the Mets will have to continue their playoff push without the game’s best pitcher. They already knew they were going to be without him for the daunting 13-game stretch against the Dodgers and Giants that began Friday.

But now that the hope of an early-September return is no longer realistic, the Mets’ road ahead got even more challenging as they entered Friday a half-game back of the Phillies for first place in the NL East.

“We’ve had a lot of guys go down, right? Significant guys,” Rojas said. “Jacob deGrom is the best pitcher in the game and he hasn’t pitched for us now well over a month. We miss his presence right on the field.

“After hearing this news and Jake telling everyone in the clubhouse what he heard from the doctors, I don’t think that’s going to put the guys’ heads down. These guys are going to move forward the same way they have in the past. We’re just going to get ready. We have this very important series that starts tonight against the Dodgers and I think the guys are not thinking about any other thing other than that right now.”

But the Nets’ guard came into Friday as the highest-scoring rookie in summer league — and as a teenager with the offensive game of an NBA veteran.

“Cam, I mean, I don’t even know where to start,” Nets summer league coach Jordan Ott said. “Ultimate gamer, young guy, finds a way often. … Even just getting to the free-throw line when nothing is there, the ability to get to the free-throw line. For a young guy, it’s pretty incredible.

“I’m not sure the words ‘savvy, crafty,’ [are enough]. Just finds a way. That’s how we phrased it. You can see him step-by-step-by step, and a big jump. Unbelievable down the stretch the shots he hit.”

Thomas was averaging 24.0 points and 9.3 free throw attempts, both tops among all rookies in the summer league. He was fourth overall in scoring, third in free throws taken and second in free throws made (7.3).

It hasn’t taken the 19-year-old long to earn the trust of both his summer league teammates and the coaches, who’ve put the ball in his hands in isolation situations at the end of quarters and to win games.

“For me to be the rook and have so much confidence in me to go out there and win the game for us is big, and it shows how much trust they have in me. I can’t thank them enough,” Thomas said. “I can’t thank my teammates enough for trusting me as well to give me the ball and just clear out 1-4 flat. Do you. Be you.

“It’s been great. All the coaches have been helping me, always encouraging me, always challenging me to be better, always challenging me to do stuff on the defensive end, rebound, and this last game [Thursday’s two-overtime win over the Wizards] just told me to go out there and win the game for ’em. For a coaching staff like that to have that much trust in you to go out there and just say 1-4 flat was kind of cool. It was good.”

On Wednesday, Thomas scored nine of his 22 points in the final 2:45 to lead the Nets past the Bucks. The next night, he poured in 31, including 16 after the third quarter. He tied the score in the first overtime on a 3-pointer with 6.9 seconds remaining, then drilled a one-footed floating 3 to win it in sudden death.

The key, as Thomas alluded to, was improving on the defensive end to earn his way into the rotation once the regular season starts. He already has shown at least some ability to facilitate; he had four assists against the Bucks.

“A lot of the ballhandling duties then went to Cam at times. So just putting him kinda in the fire, see the pressure, how he handles it,” Ott said. “At times it sped them up, but it’s not too often that he gets sped up for a young guy.

“He handled it, he was able to get to a spot. He found it again in the second half. It’s amazing. The first half [he] figures it out, [the] second half, he’s able to dominate.”

The Nets are believed to have interest in Kevin Love if he’s bought out by the Cavaliers. The big man would reportedly have to walk away from between $12 million-$15 million if Cleveland were to consider a buyout, according to the Athletic. … Unrestricted free-agent guard Lance Stephenson held a private workout Friday in Las Vegas in front of league personnel. The Nets were expected to attend, as were the Nuggets, Bucks and 76ers, according to Yahoo.

The Nets announced Friday on Twitter that beginning Sept. 13, Barclays Center employees and guests age 12 and up will be required to show proof of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine to attend events at the arena.

The Nets’ first home preseason game is scheduled for Oct. 8, and the NBA’s 2021-22 season is slated to begin on Oct. 19.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The return of Nerlens Noel wasn’t as surprising as the Kemba Walker shocker. But few figured the Knicks would use their league-high cap space to bring back Noel on a long-term deal as starting center Mitchell Robinson was up for a contract extension.

The Knicks’ center landscape has changed with Noel’s three-year, $31 million signing, though the final year is a team option. Robinson was photographed in a walking boot as recently as late July and the sense around the team is that Noel is a perfect insurance policy in case Robinson doesn’t say healthy again in 2021-22.

Noel had other suitors but he found a niche in New York and didn’t want to give it up.

“it was everything we built last year,’’ Noel said during an appearance this week on MSG PM. “Last year we were a close-knit team and wanted to stay involved with it. There were other opportunities but I want to build on that and get this team to the next level. Guys like Julius (Randle), RJ (Barrett), Derrick (Rose), we had pieces that can really come together. And I’m really confident we can be better.”

Nerlens Noel will return to the Knicks this season. AP

That’s not a widely held opinion because of the improvement Eastern Conference clubs made, such as Miami, Charlotte, Chicago and Washington — to go along with Atlanta’s playoff rise. The Knicks finished in fourth place ahead of all those teams and will come back with a similar core.

Walker is considered a more talented offensive player at point guard than the departed Elfrid Payton – and tons more popular as a Bronx native. But the real issue is how many games Walker will be healthy enough to participate in because of an arthritic left knee that held him to 43 games last season.

“He can bring a lot,’’ Noel said of Walker. “Obviously, we all watched him, the Kemba crossover, UConn days when he was making noise at the Garden. I’m super excited about what he can bring at this stage of his career being a veteran leader. We know what he can bring to a game. He’s a fast, quick, fast-paced point guard. We’ll be able to grow together throughout the year.’’

The Knicks will add Kemba Walker to their roster this season. AP

Noel and Tom Thibodeau connected last season and the former Kentucky center became a key defensive piece because of Robinson’s two injuries – a broken hand, then a broken foot. He was fourth in the league in blocks (2.4 per game). Thibodeau is known as a screamer and Noel ate it up, saying he was “intenser’’ than his college coach John Calipari.

“Me and coach Thibs, we definitely got a special relationship,’’ Noel said. “He lets me be myself on the defensive end and wreak havoc. Some things I tried to be disciplined with, lay back on and be an anchor but I appreciate that side of him. Our relationship grew throughout the year.’’

Whether Thibodeau thinks the same of Robinson is unclear. Last preseason, Thibodeau said the starting center job is up for grabs and that Noel does similar things to Robinson. Robinson won the competition but couldn’t stay healthy.

Robinson has arrived in Las Vegas and is working out with Knicks staffers. His tweet on Thursday lacked syntax but sounded like all was well conditioning-wise.

“I look big asf them weights doing me some good and form looking great thanks Knicks staff,’’ he wrote.

It’s known Thibodeau’s best buddy, Jeff Van Gundy, wasn’t a big fan of Robinson’s when he coached him for the 2019 US Select Team in Las Vegas. Robinson was forced to miss almost the whole week with a sore knee and, according to a source, arrived late.

The Knicks exercised the final-year option of Robinson at $1.8 million. He is now eligible for a contract extension before he becomes a 2022 unrestricted free agent. It might be best for both parties to wait a little bit. Robinson is on his sixth agent.

If the Knicks use Robinson in a big trade (Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard), New York may have to lean more on their new rookie second-round pick, Jericho Sims, a 6-10 center from Texas who has looked good in Summer League so far.

Sims, who started the Summer League 10 of 10 from the field in the first two games, had a highlight sky-high alley-oop dunk in the opener off a lob from Immanuel Quickley. Noel noticed.

“Man, that was great to see,’’ Noel said. “I like what the team did in the draft. Young guys who can do a lot of different things. The alley-oop was something crazy. A lot of props to the kid but I want to give big credit to Immanuel.

“I was working with him last year on how to throw the lob and perfect it. I’ve seen he’s grown a lot this summer and the game has slowed down for him, reading defenses and putting it on the money. I was on him.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The next test in the education of Zach Wilson arrives Saturday, when he faces another team for the first time.

Yes, it’s only preseason. Yes, the Giants will probably be playing mostly young players. But this is still the next step of the journey for Wilson, the Jets’ rookie quarterback.

“I’m excited, it’s going to be good to prepare, just to get back into a season,” Wilson said this week. “It’s crazy how fast it flies by from college to now, preparing with these guys. I feel like we’re learning a lot and we still got a lot of time to just keep learning. We’re learning now, we got a lot of learning this week and when we see these different opponents, it’s going to be great for us.”

Training camp has been up-and-down for Wilson. He has had some tough days against the Jets defense but had one of his best days of practice on Thursday. The No. 2-overall pick is having a lot thrown at him by the Jets, who have no fallback plan. Unlike the Bears, 49ers, Patriots and even the Jaguars, the Jets have no veteran quarterback to turn to if their first-round draft pick is not ready to play.

That has meant Wilson receiving all of the first-team reps and facing the starting defense for most of those snaps. Last Saturday, Wilson struggled a bit in the team’s scrimmage at MetLife Stadium, throwing two interceptions and failing to lead the team to a touchdown. He was hard on himself afterward and the reports of that performance raised some angst among Jets fans. But coach Robert Saleh said he has not seen any signs of Wilson wilting under the pressure.

“He’s not wavering,” Saleh said. “I’m telling you, he’s in a great space mentally, he’s learning every single day. … He is in such a great place and he loves competing, he loved that red-zone competition period we had going down there [in practice this week], because it challenged him mentally. It forced him to make quick reads and quick decisions because there was a clock on the scoreboard, and the ball had to get up and down. He loves, and he’s taking in all of it. We’re really excited about where he’s at.”

Wilson is one of many young players on the Jets roster expected to play big roles this season. That makes the preseason more important for the Jets than most teams. Some teams have talked about not playing their starters in the exhibition season. The Jets need most of theirs to get as many plays as possible.

Saleh said Wilson and the starters will play about two series or a quarter in Saturday night’s game. Both rookies and second-year players have never played a preseason game because the 2020 preseason was canceled due to COVID-19 restrictions.

“We are a very, very young football team and they’ve got to be able to go through the process of pregame and prepping themselves mentally and getting in their own space and getting ready to play a football game and then going out there and playing a couple of drives,” Saleh said. “If you think about it, if you count last year’s group, 30 guys on our roster, somewhere around there, that have never had preseason action. To me, this is a big deal. These moments are priceless, especially for this team.”

The coaches said Wilson is good at tuning out the outside noise. Whatever he does Saturday will surely cause an overreaction, but Wilson knows he can’t pay attention to it.

“I think I really learned it at BYU just because the ups and downs of the journey that come with playing quarterback,” Wilson said. “I understand it’s part of the position and I think there are a lot more pros than there is cons. It doesn’t really tell the story when other people are watching, they don’t understand how detailed and what my reads are, what I’m thinking, what a receiver is doing. They don’t understand any of that stuff and that’s why we keep our circle within us, and we do what we’re supposed to do as far as just learning what we’re supposed to be learning. Just ignoring the outside noise and listening to what my coaches say.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This is what Joe Judge says he likes about his team:

“I like their work ethic,’’ he said. “I like the way these guys show up every day and they work, and you see constant improvement. This is a team that’s got a lot of mental toughness, this is a team that as we’ve challenged them to go ahead and improve, as we’ve challenged them on different things, they’ve responded.

“I like the way they compete in practice. It’s not perfect, we’re far from a finished product, we have a long way to go as a team, but I love their spirit and how they come to work every day, and what they’re doing to improve.’’

In Judge’s view, there’s a lot to like about the Giants. He will find more to like, no doubt, and also new concerns to ponder after Saturday night’s preseason opener against the Jets at MetLife Stadium. That’s the way it always shakes out after these summer practice games. Some good, some bad.

Judge and his coaching staff are not going to learn a whole lot about their starting units, because those players are not going to be on the field much, if at all. Daniel Jones will sit this one out, as will Saquon Barkley and new receivers Kenny Golladay and Kadarius Toney. So, there will be no looking at the new-look offense.

Joe Judge addresses the team. Corey Sipkin

Mostly, Judge wants to continue the evaluation of the bottom portion of their 90-man roster, as five players must get cut by Tuesday.

“It’s not something we’re looking forward to doing, but it’s just something in how the nature of the rules are, that we have to make those decisions,’’ Judge said. “We’ve got to make sure we get a good look at some of these positions where we’ve got a lot of young guys that we have to see step up and play.’’

This is Judge’s second year, but this is the first time he has taken a team as a head coach into a preseason schedule — there were no games last summer because of COVID-19 shutdowns. He has already said he will treat the third preseason game same as the “traditional Game 3’’ when there were four games. Traditionally, coaches played their starters in the first half in the third (out of four) preseason games, and often well into the third quarter. This means for the preseason opener, select starters will take the field against the Jets, but many more will watch from the sideline.

Three weeks of camp offered plenty of opportunity for roster hopefuls to make an impression. There is nothing like a game, though, to really open some eyes. This is why it is a big night for several players. One in particular: Cornerback Sam Beal, who has not played in a game since the end of the 2019 season — he has six games in three years — and faces heavy competition to stick around. He is not a front-runner, at this point, although he might not be viewing his situation that way.

“If you play DB, you should never lose your confidence because every game you go out, you can get beat or you could have the best game of your life,’’ Beal said. “So, I will never lose that competitive side that I have always had. I’ll continue to be competitive and compete every day.’’

After this game, Judge will make the requisite cuts and reassess what he has on the roster. Between now and the start of the real season, players will rise and drop on the depth chart and players from outside the organization will be brought in.

“I tell our guys all the time, when they come in, the depth chart is really blank and as we start practicing and they start putting together things on tape, you start filling in names based off of what they’re doing,’’ Judge said. “That can change every day. It’s really just cumulative. It’s what you do consistently day in and day out. Some guys may flash one day, some guys may flash another day, but ultimately you want to go ahead and measure who’s consistently dependable, who’s productive for you on the field. But in terms of filling those names in, yeah, the answer is as we start practicing, the names start getting filled in. Now, they’re not written in permanent marker, so at any point, based on who is playing, the best get in that spot.’’

The Giants have taken another stab at a veteran offensive lineman. They signed guard Ted Larsen on Friday, hoping for better luck with him than Joe Looney and Zach Fulton, two players who arrived at training camp and then retired soon after.

Larsen, 34, has been around, playing in 137 games, with 88 NFL starts in 10 years. He was out of football in 2020 until he signed with the Buccaneers late in the season, playing in two playoff games. He started 13 games for the Dolphins in 2018 and was originally a 2010 sixth-round draft pick of the Patriots.

The Giants also waived RB Mike Weber and DB Jordyn Peters.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Corey Clement has had some special moments in his four NFL seasons.

The most memorable of those came in Super Bowl LII, when he played a part in the famous “Philly Special’’ trick play that proved to be a catalyst in the Eagles’ victory over the Patriots.

He caught four passes for 100 yards and a touchdown in that game. What stood out, however, was when Clement, on fourth-and-goal in the second quarter, took a direct snap from center and pitched the ball to tight end Trey Burton, who threw a TD pass to quarterback Nick Foles.

“People still have fun with me with that,’’ the 26-year-old running back, who signed with the Giants in May, told The Post. “But I’m looking to build new memories here.’’

That should begin with the Giants’ preseason opener Saturday against the Jets at MetLife Stadium. Clement is certain to get a good share of carries because Saquon Barkley is not expected to play.

Clement is expected to share most of the early carries with Devontae Booker, another offseason free-agent acquisition signed as backfield depth behind Barkley, who’s coming off surgery for a torn ACL that wrecked his 2020 season.

Corey Clement Corey Sipkin

It’s likely Barkley won’t play a down in any of the three preseason games. That will mean added work for Clement and Booker, battling to be Barkley’s backup as the team preps for the Sept. 12 regular-season opener against the Broncos.

“We may be with or without Saquon in the first game, but it doesn’t matter,’’ Clement said. “We understand the task at hand. Whether me or ‘Book’ or whoever else may have the first hand in the first game, we’ve got to be ready.’’

Part of Clement’s lament over his NFL career to date is that, because of injuries, he has been unable to be ready as often as he’d like.

Following his rookie season in 2017, when he produced 321 rushing yards and four TDs before his Super Bowl heroics, he wasn’t particularly pleased at not being given a more significant role on the Eagles in 2018.

He ended up playing 11 games in 2018, rushing for 259 yards and two TDs and catching 22 passes for 192 yards, before missing the final month with a knee injury.

Clement’s 2019 season was cut short when he suffered a shoulder injury that landed him on injured reserve by October. Last season, he was used mostly on special teams, carrying the ball just 21 times for 75 yards and a TD.

He has proven himself to be a dependable receiver out of the backfield. He has caught 37 of the 46 passes targeted for him in his career, which has potential to be a safety-valve upgrade for quarterback Daniel Jones.

But Clement wants more. He wants to prove he’s more than the third-down back he has been typecast as if he’s needed to spell Barkley.

As special an athlete as Barkley is, questions remain about how good he will be when he returns and whether he’ll be able to stay healthy.

That’s why Clement, a native of Glassboro, N.J., and Booker were brought in.

“I saw this as another great opportunity,’’ Clement said. “As I went into free agency, I didn’t know where I was going to be. God opened up another door and said, ‘You get to play back in your home state, New Jersey.’ ’’

Aside from being a Jersey native, his signing with the Giants came with another fun factoid. On Sept. 24, 2017, in his third career game, Clement scored his first NFL touchdown against the Giants in a 27-24 Eagles win in Philadelphia.

Corey Clement talks to Saquon Barkley for the NY POST

“I remember that play like it was yesterday,’’ Clement said. “It’s funny how everything in life makes a full 360.’’

Judge, who was a member of the Patriots coaching staff in the Super Bowl loss to the Eagles, said he has “admired’’ Clement’s game from afar.

“He’s got some experience and I was pleased with the way he came to rookie minicamp being a vet on a trial basis and really attacked it,’’ Judge said. “I liked the way he worked on a daily basis and liked what I saw in terms of him coming in in shape and condition and working on the field. That’s what led us to sign him.”

Clement is now ready to make a name for himself as a Giant.

“I look around this building and see nothing but accolades, Super Bowl [trophies] and history,’’ he said. “We [recently] had Osi [Umenyiora], we had [Justin] Tuck and [Phi] Simms come to talk to us and you understand the legacy they left.’’

Clement wants to be a part of a new legacy of success as a Giant.

“We’ve got what it takes on this roster to take us far,’’ he said. “I feel great about this team. I’m ready to make more moments here.’’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The rest of the Rangers’ front office is beginning to take shape.

President and general manager Chris Drury is bringing on Ryan Martin as his assistant GM. In addition, Drury appointed the Connecticut native as head honcho of the team’s AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, The Post’s Larry Brooks reported on Friday.

Martin comes to Broadway after 16 years in the Red Wings’ front office, 12 of which he served as assistant general manager. Joining Detroit in 2005, Martin started off as director of hockey administration before moving up to handle collective bargaining agreement administration and compliance, salary cap management, player contract research and analysis, and salary arbitration preparation. He was also general manager of the AHL Grand Rapids Griffins, who, under his lead, captured two Calder Cup championships over a five-year span.

Additionally, Martin is coming off his ninth world junior tournament working in player personnel for the United States. He helped the U.S. world junior team to the country’s first gold medal at the event since 2017 in January, while balancing his obligations back in Detroit and the Grand Rapids.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jaromir Jagr has done it all.

He won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992. He has the second-most points in NHL history behind Wayne Gretzky. He was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players by the league.

At 49-years-old, Jagr is still playing for the team he owns in the Czech Republic. He became the majority owner of Kladno in 2011, replacing his father, also named Jaromir.

“Do you know why I’m still playing?” Jagr told The Hockey News in comments published Wednesday. “I have a responsibility to the club, otherwise I wouldn’t fly here and I wouldn’t be making a fool of myself. But if I quit, the partners and sponsors would leave and the club may be done. I have no choice. People don’t understand it, but I don’t care. Only God will judge me. I expect much more from myself, and I also believe that I have it in me.”

Jaromir Jagr believes he must continue to play hockey, even as he nears 50. Getty Images

With Jagr leading the way in his 33rd professional season, the team was recently promoted from the second-tier Chance Liga to the Czech Extraliga, the top Czech league.

“As long as my father breathes, I take the club as my responsibility,” he said. “He held it for 20 years. As a son, I would be embarrassed if I left.”

The Kladno native is still going strong, scoring two goals, 10 assists and 12 points in 19 regular-season games last year and two goals, eight assists and 10 points in the playoffs. Nonetheless, hockey is taking a toll on Jagr’s body and mind.

“It’s not easy anymore, believe me,” Jagr said. “Because mostly during my career, I felt that if I wanted to score a goal, I would score. But suddenly, this doesn’t work.

“At the same time, people still expect it from me, and that’s probably the worst feeling, when people think I can but I know I can’t. Plus, I can’t even tell them. I just know that I will do my best to help the club. I don’t know if anyone can understand my role. I don’t even want to be in such a position, but I have no choice.”

Prior to playing in the Czech Republic, Jagr embarked on a 24-season NHL career. The fifth overall pick in 1990 played for the Penguins, Capitals, Rangers, Flyers, Stars, Bruins, Devils, Panthers and Flames.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Chris Kreider saw it as a sign of normalcy that he was attending Smashfest, an NHL player-driven charity event, Thursday night.

He roamed from table to table and socialized with fans during the fundraising pingpong tournament, which has been hosted by former Ranger Dominic Moore since 2012. Kreider couldn’t help but reflect on how far things have come since the coronavirus pandemic impacted the last two seasons, including the Rangers’ tumultuous 2020-21 campaign that culminated in a front office and coaching change.

“I think that we learned that we have a resilient group, which I think has been a staple of this team for as long as I’ve been here when we’ve had success,” Kreider said before giving his pingpong skills a go at The Loading Dock in Stamford, Conn. “At times, you might be down, but you’re not out and we showed signs of that right from the start of the year for the first two games where we got beat up by the Islanders, didn’t score a goal, and then came back to shut them out.

“Obviously, the response with the Washington games toward the end of the year. The guys who were out, myself included, were kicking ourselves for not being able to play in those games. But it was really cool to see that level of resiliency and that level of battle and fight from young guys.

“That’s got to be the culture of the Rangers.”

The 2021-22 season is set to begin in roughly two months, with a new general manager, Chris Drury, and a new head coach, Gerard Gallant, leading the way. Kreider is confident the Rangers can continue building the winning culture they have been working toward.

Norris Trophy-winner Adam Fox also participated in the event. Kreider made a point to acknowledge how beneficial the 23-year-old Fox has been to the Rangers and how much of an upside the rest of the young players on the team have.

“I think the future is pretty bright,” he said.

Thursday marked the first time in Smashfest’s existence that it was held outside of Toronto.

Instead of an influx of Maple Leafs fans, Rangers faithful poured into The Loading Dock to see Kreider and Fox headline a number of current and former NHL players, including legendary Rangers goalie Mike Richter, former Blueshirt Marty St. Louis and Colin Blackwell, who was taken from the Rangers in the Seattle Kraken expansion draft this offseason.

“We’ve always wanted to do Smashfest in more places because you see the way fans respond to it, they just love being a part of it,” said Moore, who played a combined five seasons with the Rangers after the organization drafted him 95th-overall in 2000. “I obviously have a lot of affinity for my time in New York and Rangers fans. I have a lot of loyalty to Rangers fans here and so do it in Rangers country, to have guys like Foxy and Mike Richter and Marty St. Louis and Kreids. … It’s really special.”

The event has helped fund research into rare cancers and concussions. Supported by the league and NHL Players Association, Smashfest surpassed the $1 million mark in funds raised in 2019, but anticipates another big turnout this year.

Even amid the excitement of the fundraiser, surrounded by his peers in the peak of the offseason, Kreider’s intensity came through when he was asked about the Rangers’ goal of making the playoffs for the first time in four seasons.

“Everyone just wants to punch their ticket to the dance,” he said. “That’s going to be our goal. Regardless of what people think of our roster, people think of what the state of the team is, our goal going into the year is to make the playoffs and that’s obviously at the front of every single player’s mind.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He came in with both feet kicking the door down, you bet he did. When you read the first column Jay Greenberg wrote for the Post, Feb. 22, 1994, it’s not only 100-percent Jay’s voice in the words, you can actually hear Jay’s voice, too, the gravelly lilt of his Pennsylvania upbringing still evident, the joy ever-crackling behind an impish smile.

“I woke up in the city that never sleeps,” he wrote, by way of introduction, “and I couldn’t get back to sleep. On the street below, taxis blared like Dallas Green. In the hallway, doors were slamming, like Ray Handley applying for head-coaching jobs …”

And he was off. It was the first of a few thousand columns Jay wrote in his time at The Post, in the prime of a rich career that also included stops at the Kansas City Star, Philly Daily News, Sports Illustrated and Toronto Sun, among many others.

He will forever be known as one of the best, sharpest, and most-read hockey writers ever, and for that he earned the 2013 Elmer Ferguson Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame. But his enthusiasm and his joy for telling stories in all the games people play transcended the ice. Wherever he was assigned that night – rink, gym, ballpark, stadium, racetrack – he was going to find a story that he’d get a kick out of. And share it with the rest of us in his own style, his own perspective. His own voice.

But that isn’t the thing for which Jay will be best remembered, which was so obvious Thursday as word filtered out that Jay had passed at age 71 after a year-long battle with West Nile Virus. No. His work as a sportswriter was superb, honoring both his roots in the Missouri journalism school and his old-school reporter’s values.

But everyone touched by Jay – every single one of us – admired Jay the gentleman first, followed closely by Jay the journalist. This is not always a kind business. There is much pettiness, much ego, much jealousy, much envy, and endless turf battles. Jay never surrendered to any of that. He was a beacon of kindness and grace, forever willing to offer praise and encouragement. Usually leading with a laugh.

Of all the responses that flooded social media Thursday, the one that struck me most was from another former colleague of mine, Pat Borzi, who works in the Twin Cities now but covered the Yankees for the Star-Ledger for a number of years.

“There was this silly tradition in New York where columnists didn’t smile in their column [pictures]. Jay smiled in his. It fit his personality.”

There was one memory I happily, immediately recalled, too. Jay was notorious for protecting himself from deadline, and invariably he would wander over in the sixth inning of a World Series game, or the third quarter of a football playoff game, and see if anyone had an early notion of what we wanted to write.

One time, at dinner on an off-night between games, I joked with Jay, “You know, even if we have to scramble for earlier editions, we can always get it right later on. And there’s always the internet.”

And for one of the few times, the smile would leave Jay’s face and he grew so, so earnest.

“The guy who buys the paper in Connecticut or Westchester or Miami doesn’t want to hear that we had a tough deadline,” he said. “He wants to make sure we know what we’re talking about. And preferably in proper English.”

That, too, was Jay, who adored both sports and the writing of sports, who admired the language, who never lost the wonder of being paid to write about sports for a living and wanted to make sure others of us who did never lost sight of that, either. I would laugh when I’d catch him following his beloved Pirates or Missouri Tigers on his computer – “I’m an addict, not a fan,” he’d insist.

Mostly, he was a family man, devoted to his wife, Mona, and his daughters Elizabeth and Stephanie. His was a gracious life, and he lived it graciously. Some of us were lucky enough to know him in person. But even if you simply read him, you knew him.

“So when the Post-men rang, they didn’t have to do it twice,” he’d written in that introductory column 27 years ago. “You want me to write a column in New York? You mean someday there might be a deli sandwich named after me?”

We aren’t sure about the sandwich. We know this: Jay’s legacy lives in an awful lot of hearts today, and will forever. It was very good indeed that the Post-men rang for him.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the voice of the movie trailer voiceover guy:

In a world, where reboots have become routine and popular ideas of the past are brought back to life, there is a formula that laid hidden during last year’s pandemic-marred season, quarantined to the background as a madman forged on with his follies. But not just any madman, a Fantasy Madman.

That Madman’s formula is back, a draft value quotient to quiet fantasy discontent, a metric to guide you back to a functional fantasy reality, a tool to help you shed the mask of uncertainty. It’s the DVQ, reborn, ready to lead you out of the basement of fantasy despair and back into the light in a return to normalcy, or the closest degree of normalcy Fantasy Insanity can provide.

The drafts have begun, data collection is ongoing, Excel sheets are myriad and active. This fantasy knight has emerged from the dark with a new, grittier version of his former formula. It’s the second coming of fantasy glory. The rebirth of fantasy madness.

Did we overdramatize a bit in that intro? Most likely. But yes, the DVQ is a bit different than last time you saw it.

We eliminated some evaluations we felt were either unimpactful or redundant. We amplified the disparity in positional projections compared to peers, focused on positional impact based on roster expectations in 12-team PPR formats, added a helping of overall evaluations, included a hint of scheduling impact and sprinkled in a dash of past team or coaching staff tendencies against the average — among some other components.

The end result has the same goal: a DVQ rating that reflects where a player should be drafted. Because there is more disparity in scoring among the top NFL players than at the bottom (the difference between the No. 1 player and No. 5 player is likely larger than any five players anywhere else in the rankings), there is a steep parabolic curve that flattens latter half — it just dips down to zero without mirroring the disparity at the top.

This shows the expected gaps in value when drafting. When you see a big dip in DVQ ratings among available players, that is illustrating a separation in tiers. Fail to get one of the players before the dropoff, and you will be lift to sift through a pool of similar-producing options. This data could help you determine, say, if you reach for a weaker player at a position of need or grab a backup at another position since that player is rated significantly higher.

So you see, the DVQ delivers it all. A basic target range for drafting a player, a tier system based on numerical data rather than colored coded bars like many fantasy providers, all based on a system that equalizes projections based on positional value.

Like Jerry Maguire once said: Help me, help you. That is what the Madman is here for. And the DVQ is our Ambassador of Quan.

The Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners begin a crucial series on Friday, each looking to claw their way back into the AL playoff picture behind starters who have exceeded expectations.

After spending the 2020 season in Korea, Seattle’s Chris Flexen is 10-5 and is pitching his best at home. He was allowed two runs or fewer in 10 of his 12 home starts and the team is 8-4. The ex-Met has a 2.67 ERA and has allowed just four homers and 12 walks in 70 ²/₃ innings at home.

Blue Jays starter Robbie Ray has allowed 23 home runs, tied for fourth-most in MLB, but has overcome that to post a 2.90 ERA. He has not let up a homer in five of his past six starts while posting a 2.30 ERA with a .201 opponents batting average and 11.4 strikeouts per nine innings since June 1.

The Mariners entered Thursday with a 3.97 bullpen ERA and the Blue Jays a nearly identical 3.96, but in the past 30 days the Mariners 3.48 bullpen ERA ranks eighth while the 4.02 of the Blue Jays ranks 19th.

With Toronto entering Thursday having scored four runs or fewer in nine of its past 12 road games and the Mariners staff No. 2 in fewest walks in the AL in August, Seattle will continue its success in Flexen’s home starts.

The play: Mariners, +140.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@First-place Milwaukee visits last-place Pittsburgh.

The Pirates, 28 ¹/₂ games back of the Brewers, have lost eight straight. Mitch Keller (3-9, 5.39 ERA) throws for the home team. His record speaks for itself. The Brewers’ Brett Anderson (4-5, 3.54 ERA) got off to a slow start but has turned his season around. He’s allowed only two runs over his last 16 ²/₃ innings.

The Brews are cruising to a division title and should pad their lead this weekend, but we will “Buc” the trend in the first game — the letdown game — of the series and take the home-dog Pirates for 10 units.

Holy Cornbread! Went with the GuarIndians, and they got their A’s kicked by Oakland. The Athletics used a balanced attack to score 17 runs. Chris Bassitt held the Tribe to three hits, pushing his record to 12-3, and the A’s won, 17-0. Winning streak died hard. Down -615 cornhuskers.

Arthur Smith and Robert Saleh were two of the hot names on the coaching market this offseason. Smith interviewed twice with the Jets and signed with the Atlanta Falcons the day after the Jets hired Saleh. For now, it appears Smith will get the first laugh. Here are the two teams’ outlooks for regular-season wins.

Falcons Over 7

The 28-3 jokes are played out by now, but I’m not sure the wounds the infamous Super Bowl loss created ever fully healed under former coach Dan Quinn. In comes Smith, bringing a celebrated reputation for coaching offense, something the franchise has been seeking since the departure of Kyle Shanahan.

We all probably agree that the Bucs are the rightful favorites in the NFC South, but some wins will be up for grabs. With two games against Sam Darnold and two against Jameis Winston, it’s not impossible that a Falcons team that blew countless big leads last year, including back-to-back 15-point fourth-quarter advantages, can improve enough to be the second-best team in the division. They lost eight games by a touchdown or less and were similar to the Chargers, finding ways to lose.

The list of quarterbacks they face is not exactly daunting outside of Tom Brady. Besides Darnold and Winston, whom they combine to play four times, also on the docket are Daniel Jones, Jared Goff, Zach Wilson, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Jalen Hurts, Tua Tagovailoa and Cam Newton or Mac Jones.

Coach Arthur Smith with quarterback Matt Ryan AP

With improved coaching and better luck in close games, the road map is there for Atlanta to get to 10+ wins and cash the Over, and +225 to make the playoffs is also a good bet.

Jets Under 6

They are the Jets. Thanks for reading, enjoy the games … OK, OK, I’ll expand a bit, but the point stands.

This team won two games last year, and I am the furthest thing from a Darnold fan, but the chances of the quarterback play improving are slim, considering Wilson is a rookie. Not only that, Wilson is going into a division with Bill Belichick, Brian Flores and Sean McDermott, all highly regarded defensive coaches.

In his final season at BYU, Wilson faced Navy and Louisiana Tech and scored 17 points in a loss to Coastal Carolina. This will be culture shock for the young quarterback, who has very little chance to absorb it and lead this team near a .500 record.

The travel schedule is not ideal, either. In the first five weeks, the Jets play the Falcons in London and face the Broncos at altitude. This team is in a total teardown (again), and a four- or five-win season with signs of hope from the young QB is about all you can reasonably hope for.

The division is tough. The Bills are one of the favorites to win it all, the Dolphins won 10 games last year and the Patriots are likely to be much improved and are a coin flip to make the playoffs. It is hard to be a bad team in a good division because you don’t get to play yourself, so your schedule is even harder than your division foes.

New coach, new quarterback, same old Jets, at least for this year.

For the first time since 2015, a non-quarterback won the Heisman Trophy last year. Many of us rejoiced. Given the voting monotony exhibited over the previous decades, this was a moment.

Whether it was the start of a movement or a blip, however, will be decided in the years to follow. For a wide receiver to win, everything had to align. A sensational player on a sensational team delivered a sensational season while playing with a quarterback who never quite captured the buzz necessary to win.

Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith deserved it. But this still is a quarterback award until further notice, and the betting odds as we churn toward the 2021 season reflect that.

Before I make my selections, here are my personal Heisman betting tips.

Quarterbacks will always have the edge: I’ve said it plenty already. You know the drill. While the value in top QBs simply won’t be there, there’s a reason for this. Maybe last season was the start of a magical trend, though it seems unlikely.

It’s never just about the player; it’s about the team: A dazzling athlete on even a good team will struggle mightily to win the award. Excellence isn’t just about the player or the stats. His team must win a lot of games, if not every game. For many gifted players with possible roads to the award, the path often falls apart here.

Oh, and the helmet matters: As much as I would love to tell you that a star player at a middling Power 5 school has a fair shot at this, that simply isn’t the case. You know this. Not only does a team have to be good, but the brand also impacts this heavily.

My favorite chalk

Clemson QB D.J. Uiagalelei (11/1): Trevor Lawrence didn’t win a Heisman at Clemson. It seems reasonable to think (and perhaps expect) Uiagalelei will accomplish this at least once over the next two seasons. A true sophomore, Uiagalelei was allowed ample seasoning as a freshman when Lawrence was unable to play due to testing positive for COVID-19.

Against Notre Dame in his first start, all Uiagalelei did was throw for 439 yards on the road in a 47-40 double-OT loss. He followed it up the following week by throwing for 342 yards against Boston College.

I feel confident in saying Uiagalelei has the strongest arm in college football and might have one of the strongest arms we’ve seen in the last decade. He shouldn’t just produce at Clemson — he has a chance to dazzle.

In terms of garnering buzz, Uiagalelei shouldn’t have to wait long. Clemson plays Georgia to start the season, one of the most anticipated openers in recent memory. A win and sizable performance early on will catapult Uiagalelei above the field. The schedule from that point on is quite frankly one he should dominate. (Clemson’s very favorable slate could be viewed as both a positive and a negative.)

Even with the loss of running back Travis Etienne and some quality pass catchers, the offense should be loaded. The return of wide receiver Justyn Ross is also massive.

If Clemson beats Georgia, Uiagalelei’s 11/1 odds will be long gone. And even if the Tigers fall short, he’ll be right there.

JT Daniels AP

Close behind

Georgia QB JT Daniels (12/1): We don’t have to stray far for our next contender. Daniels, the other QB in the season’s marquee opener, is also a fascinating prospect with better value, though shop the market for the best odds on him.

The journey to this position has not been spotless. Daniels was a standout prospect in high school, played at USC and transferred to Georgia. While the belief early on was that he would thrive from the start, that was not the case last year.

However, once given an opportunity, he showed flashes. Daniels closed with 10 touchdowns and two interceptions in Georgia’s final four games. Surrounded by incredible talent at wide receiver, Daniels has a chance to make these flashes more consistent. And with the possibility of an SEC Championship game against Alabama late in the year, it is fair to reason no player could have a larger late-season spotlight than Daniels.

Bijan Robinson AP

Let’s try a non-QB

Texas RB Bijan Robinson (30/1): By the end of the 2021 season, assuming he stays healthy, Robinson will be one of the faces of college football and one of the sport’s most electric talents.

The arrival of Steve Sarkisian only adds to this intrigue, as Robinson will likely take advantage of an offense that should afford him ample carries and targets out of the backfield.

While he started slowly in 2020, largely due to a lack of touches, Robinson exploded in the back half of the season. In the last two games, he totaled 443 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns.

Texas’ schedule is conducive to much more production, though beating Oklahoma, which has not come easily for the Longhorns, would certainly help this cause. Playing for the Longhorns — a massive brand in a constant game of “Are they back?!?!” — doesn’t hurt his chances either.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was not the kind of green light hitters want to see.

With the Mets and Dodgers tied in the top of the ninth inning Friday in front of a season-high 38,395 at Citi Field, a green light flashed onto Max Muncy’s face, halting play for a few minutes.

Muncy, batting with a runner on second and two out, collected himself before an 0-2 pitch against Edwin Diaz, but before he stepped into the box, his face turned green.

“Come on, jeez,” Ron Darling said on PIX11. “That’s just awful.”

Muncy immediately pointed left and the umpires conferred for several moments. There was no resolution, so Muncy stepped back into the box, and Diaz struck him out to end the inning. The light was not seen again.

“We don’t want that happening in a baseball game. Player safety — everyone’s safety — is always our priority,” said Mets manager Luis Rojas, who was not sure after his team’s 6-5, 10-inning loss if the culprit had been found. “I thought it might have been the best crowd of the season, so for that to happen, it’s just something that you don’t want to see.”

The scene was similar to an incident during a July game at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Red Sox, when a red light began flashing. An MLB investigation found no evidence of a rules violation by either team.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Taijuan Walker didn’t just rediscover his All-Star form Saturday night, he also flirted with history against one of the best teams in baseball.

And the Mets let it all go to waste.

Walker started off by throwing 6 ¹/₃ no-hit innings, but the Mets missed another golden chance to beat the Dodgers, falling in extra innings for the second straight game, 2-1 in 10 innings, at Citi Field.

“We’ve been battling,” Walker said. “We’ve been right there every single time. We just haven’t been able to get that extra run across. We haven’t been able to get that shutdown inning. But these are tight games. It’s a playoff team, playoff atmosphere. We’re right there with them.”

Despite showing they can go toe-to-toe with the Dodgers (71-46), the Mets (59-57) lost another game that was there for the taking. They will now try to avoid a sweep Sunday night, against former Nationals ace Max Scherzer, before heading west to face the Giants then the Dodgers again.

“It’s not going to get any easier,” manager Luis Rojas said. “Tomorrow we have another tough game. We’re going to have a lot of those for the remainder of the season. Playing these games, they make us better. We’re bitter because of the two losses, but they make us better.”

Taijuan Walker threw 6 1/3 no-hit innings, but it wasn’t enough in the Mets’ 2-1 loss to the Dodgers in 10 innings. Robert Sabo

Edwin Diaz, Jeurys Familia and Trevor May all were unavailable because of recent workloads, and Aaron Loup, Miguel Castro and Seth Lugo had pitched earlier in the game, so the Mets turned to Yennsy Diaz to handle the top of the 10th. Diaz gave up a one-out RBI double to Cody Bellinger, scoring automatic runner Corey Seager from second. Diaz came back to strand Bellinger at third by striking out pinch-hitter Justin Turner, but the damage was done.

The Mets went in order in the bottom of the 10th, with James McCann and Brandon Drury striking out and Brandon Nimmo grounding out.

Walker had not allowed a hit entering the seventh inning but lost the no-hitter and the lead on one pitch with one out. Will Smith, who won Friday’s game with a two-run homer in the 10th inning, crushed a solo shot to left field with one out to tie the score 1-1.

The Mets were held in check by the Dodgers’ stud right-hander, Walker Buehler, who entered the night as MLB’s ERA leader at 2.13 and lowered that to 2.09. Michael Conforto took him deep for a 1-0 lead in the fourth, but the Mets mustered just three more hits against him across seven innings. The Dodgers bullpen then retired the final nine Mets in order.

“At the end of the day, we just gotta put up a few more runs,” Conforto said. “It’s nothing crazy. Just a couple more big swings. We’re very capable of that. We feel like we’re getting ready to swing the bats better as we come down the stretch.”

Walker, who recorded a 2.50 ERA across 15 starts entering the All-Star break, posted a 9.86 ERA in his first five starts coming out of it. He began to settle in last Sunday against the Phillies, allowing three solo home runs over six innings in his longest start since June 20.

The right-hander cruised through six innings on 73 pitches Saturday before Smith clobbered an 0-1 slider with one out in the seventh and deposited it into the left field seats to tie the game.

“Just a bad slider,” Walker said.

Walker tried to get out of the inning, but couldn’t, instead putting runners on the corners with two outs — with Rojas getting ejected along the way arguing balls and strikes — before Loup put out the fire.

“It’s definitely frustrating to lose in extra innings both nights, but we’re in both games,” Conforto said. “We’re one swing away from winning both those games. The more we can keep ourselves in those situations — obviously we want to win by three, four, five runs, but when we’re in it till the end, anything can happen.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Likely because it doesn’t know any better, even on a day when MLB tried to do its best — and did pretty well, at that — conspicuous but preventable greed deprived all of a clean sweep.

Thursday’s “Field of Dreams” game — billed as the ultimate in nostalgic, real-time throwback baseball — never had a genuine shot from the moment the teams were introduced wearing their conspicuously Nike-swooshed “old-time” uniforms.

The sale of such Red Chinese slave wage-made jerseys surpassed all other considerations, including the full intent of the event.

The teams’ caps, carrying the New Era logo, were also on prominent, lost-premise display. Most of New Era’s goods are made on the extra-cheap in Third World countries. In 2019, New Era closed its plant in Derby, N.Y., eliminating 216 jobs. New Era has a remaining U.S. facility in Miami, which manufactures MLB’s caps, or so we’re told.

New Era is also full of it. It is suspiciously transparent that New Era relied on U.S. street gangs to set the fashion and color schemes of its caps, many carrying MLB team logos.

For example, in addition to producing team caps in colors favored by Crips and Bloods, it produced Yankees caps with a crown overlapping the “NY,” that crown being similar to the logo of the murderous Latin Kings street gang. What a coincidence!

But after a group of Harlem parents, the Coalition to Protect Our Children, protested such dangerous but calculated sales strategies, New Era claimed ignorance:

“Recently, it has been brought to our attention that some combinations of icons and colors on a select number of our caps could be too closely in association with gangs.”

Who knew?

Yet a New Era commercial showed “fans” servicing their street cred by wearing various colored NFL team caps. The ad cut to a shot of a vandal spray-painting a Raiders logo on an outdoor wall.

Yeah, New Era had no idea.

So New Era caps, even during the “Field of Dreams” game, were given prominent on-field sales status despite zero historical connection with old-time big league baseball.

Also on prominent display Thursday were the FTX logos on the umpires’ shirts, FTX being the official unregulated cryptocurrency of MLB since way back in 2021.

What would these commercial entities have done had MLB said, “Sorry, no logos for this game. This one’s only about good old-fashioned baseball”? Raised a stink that would have left them looking like unconditional pigs?

MLB, even on a day when it pretended to do its best on behalf of The Game, couldn’t take even one day off from its self-evident addiction to money. But to have hoped for better was the kind of reality that only exists on fields seen in dreams.

Throwback ‘Field of Dreams’ game can’t dodge new-age silliness

The “Field of Dreams” game had some fascinating moments, those heard but not seen, and those seen but not heard.

Analyst John Smoltz early stated, “The Yankees miss Aaron Hicks,” perhaps a surprise to Yankees fans given that the center fielder was batting .194, striking out 30 times in 108 at-bats, when he was injured. Last season, while becoming a strikeout artist, he batted .225.

In the ninth, with the Yankees down, 7-4, Brett Gardner batted with one out, runner on first. Gardner is symbolic of baseball in senseless decline, given that he has sacrificed his greatest asset — his speed — to try to be an upper-cutting slugger — the primary reason, as of Friday, he had 72 strikeouts to five home runs and has spent much of the season heading back to the dugout by batting around .200.

And everyone knows it, thus the shift was on, leaving Gardner the opportunity to push one toward third for a single or a double. There was nothing and no one to stop him.

Instead, he struck out, swinging.

Yet YES’s Paul O’Neill recently claimed that with two strikes Gardner is accomplished at “slapping it the other way,” when the gap, to Gardner, has become a store that sells jeans.

And has the White Sox’s Tim Anderson, who ended the game with a home run, finished his self-congratulatory, how-great-I-art trip around the bases, yet? Just what modern baseball needs, another one.

Reader Kenny Kaplan notes that in 1970 Tom Seaver struck out 10 consecutive batters, a record that stood for 51 years until this season, when pitchers of lesser abilities, Aaron Nola and Corbin Burnes, have tied that record.

Now, with strikeouts a nickel a dozen, it’s time MLB renamed the designated hitter the “designated swinger.”

Monday, Twins DH Brent Rooker, hitting .157, struck out four times in four at-bats. Wednesday, Rooker, again the DH, again struck out four times in four at-bats. Consistency is the mark of greatness!

Holy cow! It’s real baseball!

Commentary of the Week: During FS1’s Mets-Phillies two Saturdays ago, another desultory game was 0-0 in the fourth, when the Mets had a runner on first, one out. Don Orsillo and ex-MLB catcher A.J. Pierzynski were calling the game.

D.O.: “Some kind of offense needs to be generated here. Do you consider putting something on here, just try to get something going?”

A.J.P.: “Do they do that anymore?”

D.O. “I’m just throwing it out there.”

A.J.P.: “I did a game the other day, and there were two hit-and-runs — in just one game!”

D.O.: “What?! Next thing you’re gonna tell me is that there was a pitchout.”

A.J.P: “No, there were no pitchouts, and little action. They just wait for a home run. …. There’s hardly any action on the bases, anymore.”

So I’m in a Subway sandwich shop the other day, checking on what they’re using for tuna this week, and who do I run into? Subway commercial spokesman Tom Brady! … Yeah, sure.

Now Gary Cohen has caught Exit Velocity Fever. How he made it this far without sharing such info is a mystery. Meanwhile, ESPN has calculated that the distance of Adam and Eve’s departure from the Garden of Eden was from here to eternity.

If Fox hired David “Big Papi” Ortiz as a studio show novelty act, it has been a waste of our time and their money. 1) Ortiz is not funny. 2) The on-set laughter he produces is totally forced and phony. 3) He has provided no evidence that he has even watched a game since he retired, five years ago.

Quote of the Week belongs to Michael Kay: “In his fine career that he has put together, Aaron Judge has just one walk-off hit. … And it was a walk.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — If the Lithuanian lefty Rokas Jokubaitis didn’t prove he should be on the Knicks roster this season, the rookie combo guard at least showed he’s a solid NBA prospect.

Jokubaitis, selected 34th overall in the second round, has left the Knicks to go back to Spain to be with his Barcelona team. The plan was for Jokubaitis to play three games — and that’s what he did.

In the three games he played, Jokubaitis was provided limited minutes but was super efficient. He’s fast, he can shoot from 3 and has a liveliness on defense — even if he needs to bulk up.

In 29 minutes, the 20-year-old shot 70 percent (7-of-10). He was 3-of-5 from 3-point range and averaged 6.3 points. He did not play in the opener.

Jokubaitis was projected to play his first year in Barcelona in the Spanish League as a stash pick after playing the past three years in the Lithuanian league.

But before summer league started, Jokubaitis said it wasn’t set in stone. Now it is.

Rokas Jokubaitis NBAE via Getty Images

Against Detroit on Friday, Jokubaitis had his best outing. He led the Knicks in plus-minus at plus-8 in the loss and was more efficient than wayward-shooting Immanuel Quickley.

In 12 minutes, Jokubaitis scored eight points on 3-of-5 shooting with two steals. His lone assist came on a lovely lob to Obi Toppin for a stuff on the fastbreak.

On another play, Jokubaitis outraced the Detroit defense for a tough lefty layup in transition. He then drove for a lefty runner from the baseline — another tough shot. He later hit a 3-pointer.

He has done a lot more to improve his future standing than Argentine point guard Luka Vildoza, who signed last May a four-year, $13.6 million non-guaranteed contract.

Vildoza went scoreless in the first two games and sat out the next two with a sore foot. That came after a substandard showing in the Olympics with Argentina. The theory is Vildoza assuredly would be released if Jokubaitis is signed.

Jokubaitis impressed team brass from the first day of summer-league practice in Las Vegas last week with his basketball IQ.

“He’s a very good basketball player,’’ Knicks summer-league coach Dice Yoshimoto said. “He can handle the ball, can play off the ball. Plays hard.’’

Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau has not commented about any of the four 2021 draft picks. Knicks president Leon Rose hasn’t talked to the media in more than a year.

Turns out the Knicks didn’t need starting PG Immanuel Quickley, who sat out with a sore groin. The starting rookie backcourt of point guard Miles McBride and shooting guard Quentin Grimes lit up Vegas with a combined 51 points as the Knicks held off the Cavaliers, 103-94, Saturday night at Thomas & Mack Center. The Knicks moved to 3-2.

Grimes, selected 25th, scored 28 points with McBride adding 23. They combined to shoot 17-of-34 from the field — 11-of-22 from 3-point land. McBride, who fell to 36th, had a rough shooting game in the Friday loss to bounce back with a vengeance with hitting 9 of 14 shots with five assists.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — The Nets may have rescinded the qualifying offer to Reggie Perry, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. At least not yet.

With Friday’s deadline to rescind offers, the Nets pulled the one to their second-year forward, making him an unrestricted free agent in a move first reported by The Athletic and confirmed by The Post. But Perry was still with the Nets and participated in Saturday afternoon’s practice at Clark High School.

The Nets did not make Perry available after practice. As for exactly what their plans are for the forward, assistant Jordan Ott — serving as summer league head coach — punted those questions up the ladder to his bosses.

“We just want to leave that to Sean [Marks, GM] and Steve [Nash, coach],” Ott told The Post. “I’ll say this: He is here, he’s practicing. He’s a Brooklyn Net. He’s part of our summer league team. We coached him just like any other person on our team. We came here to get better. He got better [Saturday]. We all got better. We’re going to continue to coach him every day. That’s what we’re all signed up to do. He’s a Brooklyn Net right now, and we’ll continue to coach him.”

Perry goes into Sunday’s game second on the Nets in rebounding (8.5), steals and blocks, and fourth in scoring (9.5 points). But he’s been wildly inefficient offensively, shooting just 28.6 percent overall and 16.7 percent from 3-point range.

As one of just two Brooklyn roster players in Vegas, he’s been less efficient than Alize Johnson, who has averaged 11 points and eight boards on 66.7 percent shooting. And though being invisible or going unnoticed is great for NFL offensive lineman, it’s a decidedly bad sign for summer league players with NBA experience.

Perry is now an unrestricted free agent. He could theoretically try to latch on with any other team, or eventually be signed straight to Brooklyn’s G-League affiliate on Long Island.

“Yeah, I’m not sure on that one. I think we’ll leave that to Sean’s decision,” said Ott, who has given reports to Marks since the GM left Las Vegas.

“We’re all involved; coaches, front office,” Ott said. “Everyone has a pulse of what’s going on.”

Ott said the experience of coaching in the summer league — being the head coach and having three close games to start — will make him a better Brooklyn assistant.

“We all added responsibilities. And with that, your eyes are opened to what the head coach has to go through. So hopefully that makes me a better assistant in the future, just getting this couple week period as a head coach,” Ott said. “Mistakes are going to happen. It isn’t perfect. It’s easy to talk about after the fact. But the experience has been great. Grateful to the Nets for allowing me to do it.”

The Nets announced a change in their vaccination policy at Barclays Center. Beginning Sept. 13, all guests and employees over the age of 12 must show proof of having received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine.

Up to this point, the Nets had sections for unvaccinated guests and media.

The Nets are holding training camp in California and open the preseason on the road at the Lakers. Their first home preseason game is Oct. 8 against the Bucks in a rematch of the Eastern Conference semifinals.

It’s not the only change Brooklyn is making. Barclays Center will “require” guests to wear masks “irrespective of vaccine status,” according to Atlantic Yards/Pacific Park Report.

The NBA will announce its own policy on players and staff vaccination before the season starts.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When it comes to the nuance and execution of offensive football, take this Giants preseason opener, please.

There is no need to panic or make any definitive statements about what transpired Saturday night. There is also no reason to assuage any fears about the capability of the guys who get paid to protect the quarterback and open holes for the runners.

Anything positive head coach Joe Judge can glean out of the offensive showing of his team in a 12-7 preseason opening loss to the Jets at MetLife Stadium figures to be few and far between. Does this come as a great surprise? Not really. The work of the offense in training camp has often been lackluster and that carried over into this first opportunity under the lights in a game.

Some perspective is in order here.

Daniel Jones was held out. Big-ticket free-agent wide receiver Kenny Golladay is on the mend from a hamstring strain and was held out. Rookie target Kadarius Toney, the first round pick recovering from a slow start to his first NFL training camp after landing on the COVID list, was held out. Sterling Shepard did not play. Saquon Barkley, of course, is not yet ready for this sort of live action.

So, this was not even a reasonable facsimile of the offensive firepower the Giants expect to trot out onto the field Sept. 12 in the season opener against the Broncos. Four of the five projected starters on the offensive line were out there, though, and that group did nothing to make anyone think they are close to the form needed for the real season.

“I think as a team we started slow on both sides of the ball,’’ coach Joe Judge said. “I saw some improvement as we went on, we were able to move the ball a little bit.

“There’s some things we can highlight in terms of the offensive line as far as the direction we have to go. There’s obviously a lot of things we can clean up as well.’’

Andrew Thomas started at left tackle, Kenny Wiggins filled in for Shane Lemieux (still dealing with a knee issue) at left guard, Nick Gates was at center, Will Hernandez was at right guard and Matt Peart took his spot at right tackle.

“I wanted to get those guys some more chemistry on the field against a different opponent,’’ Judge said of why he started his first-team line.

That line went against the Jets’ first-string defense. It was not pretty.

On the second snap, Wiggins was beaten badly by Sheldon Rankins, who put a big hit on quarterback Mike Glennon. On the next play, third down, Bryce Hull whipped Peart for a 7-yard sack. You want to try to extricate something positive out of that third down play? Thomas did a good job escorting Carl Lawson wide and away from Mike Glennon in the pocket. Lawson has been dominating left tackle Mekhi Becton at Jets camp, so this was a good sign from Thomas, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2020 draft.

On the next series, the Giants picked up three first downs but stalled when John Franklin-Myers sped past Wiggins to deflect Glennon’s pass out of the air.

Joe Judge Bill Kostroun

“Good and bad,’’ Wiggins said, assessing his performance. “There’s plays you want to have back every single time.’’

The Giants got into a groove running the ball with Corey Clement and would have put points on the board on the third series, but Clement lost a fumble on the Jets’ 3-yard line.

In three series going against the Jets’ starters on defense, the Giants’ offensive line could not keep Glennon (3-of-7, 20 yards) clean, making life miserable for the 31-year-old career backup. The passing game was anemic.

The second-team offensive line did not distinguish itself. Chad Slade at right tackle was called for a false start. Clayton Thorson, the No. 3 quarterback, was hurried repeatedly. When Thorson did have time, he had some problems. He had Damion Willis running free deep down the right sideline early in the fourth quarter but overthrew him by more than a little. Thorson connected with Willis for a 21-yard touchdown hookup with 7:05 remaining for the Giants’ only points.

The Giants are going to need a great deal of work to fix what ails their offense, especially up front. Nearly five minutes into the fourth quarter, they had mustered only 98 total yards (they finished with 163). As a final indignity, Thorson was sacked in the end zone for a safety with 1:39 remaining.

“You don’t want to end any game with a safety,’’ Judge said.

And you do not want to start any game the way the Giants did in this one.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Saturday night’s performance by rookie Jets quarterback Zach Wilson won’t even be a footnote in his career in the long run, but in the moment it was an encouraging start.

Wilson made his professional debut in the Jets’ first preseason game against the Giants at MetLife Stadium. Wilson did not do anything spectacular, but he also did not fall on his face in the 12-7 Jets win. Wilson showed poise and made good decisions, completing 6-of-9 passing for 63 yards in two series of action.

The No. 2-overall pick out of BYU looked more self-assured and confident than he did a week earlier at MetLife when the Jets held their Green & White scrimmage. He threw two interceptions in that glorified practice, and that created some angst among a segment of Jets fans who have been waiting for an answer at quarterback for most of the past four decades.

“We have so much confidence in the young man,” coach Robert Saleh said. “You want him to stack up as many good days as possible but there’s still youth. He’s still a rookie. There’s still a lot of things that he’s going to learn from. There’s still a lot of opportunities for him to grow.

Zach Wilson Bill Kostroun

“This young man’s potential is through the roof but it’s going to be a process.”

On Saturday, Wilson’s first drive was efficient. He completed two passes to Corey Davis for 18 yards on a 12-play, 52-yard drive that ended with a 30-yard field goal from Chris Naggar. His most impressive throw came on the next drive, a third-and-9 strike from his own 20 to Keelan Cole for 16 yards.

The biggest takeaway from Wilson’s night is the game did not look too big for him. He did not show any signs of nerves in his first game under the lights. He never looked like he was unsure of where to go with the ball or fazed by the Giants rush. It should be pointed out that the Giants played their backups on defense, so while Wilson passed this first test, it will get much tougher from here.

But Wilson looks like he is settling in.

“I think it’s getting more comfortable with everything,” Wilson said. “The offense is all installed at this point, to an extent. Now, it’s just repetition. It’s like, ‘How much can I keep working on the same exact plays,’ and now I’m getting every single different look in practice, and now coming out here it’s great for all of us. We’re starting to settle in.”

It was not just Wilson’s debut with the Jets. Saleh was also on the sideline for the first time as a head coach. Decisions in preseason do not come with the pressure or microscope that they do when the games count, so it is hard to evaluate anything Saleh did. He went for it on fourth-and-1 early in the second quarter, always a popular decision in the preseason, but Ty Johnson was stuffed on the run for a loss of a yard. Saleh also won a challenge in the third quarter.

Robert Saleh AP

The starting defense got off to a good start against a Giants offense that did not have starting quarterback Daniel Jones and other starting skill players, but did have starters on the offensive line. The Jets held the Giants to a three-and-out on their first series. Sheldon Rankins got nice pressure on quarterback Mike Glennon on second down and Bryce Huff sacked him on third down.

“People are sleeping on the Jets,” linebacker C.J. Mosley, who batted away a Glennon pass, said. “If people come with that same mentality, they’re going to get their ass blown out. That’s 100 percent, no matter if we’re at MetLife or anywhere else. They think there’s anything old about this Jets team, it’s not going to end well for them.”

Though the focus was on Wilson when the starting offense was on the field, the running game was impressive. The starting offensive line, which was without left guard Alijah Vera-Tucker, opened up some big holes. Johnson had 33 yards on nine carries. Rookie Michael Carter had 22 yards on seven carries. Tevin Coleman did not play in the game.

The Jets now move on to Green Bay after one more practice in Florham Park on Monday. They will have joint practices with the Packers on Wednesday and Thursday in Wisconsin before playing a preseason game next Saturday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It was 50 years ago this month when Joe Namath, essentially, stopped being Joe Namath. He’d had that bum knee at Alabama. And early in the 1970 season, there had been a wrist injury that halted Namath’s iron-man streak of having played in 77 straight games for the Jets, and cost him seven games.

But it was in Tampa, at old Tampa Stadium, where a then-record crowd of 51,214 people had come on Aug. 7, 1971, to watch an exhibition game between the Jets and the Detroit Lions, that Namath’s destiny as a Jet hit an unmistakable and irretrievable oil skid.

In the first half of that game, which the Lions won 28-24, Detroit’s Mike Lucci was returning a ball fumbled by the Jets’ Lee White. Now remember: It was an exhibition game. But Namath, 28 and still feeling pretty bulletproof, saw Lucci with the ball and decided there was only one thing to do: Tackle him.

“I only know how to play football one way,” Namath said later.

Namath landed wrong. The knee ripped, audibly according to the players on the field. Namath let out a yelp, then a scream. On Aug. 8, he had major knee surgery. At Lenox Hill Hospital’s Einhorn Auditorium — a place Post writer Paul (Dr. Z) Zimmerman later dubbed “Namath Hall” — Joe Willie acknowledged this was a game-changer for him.

“Before, when I hurt my right knee, I had my good left leg to hold me up,” he said. “Now I’ll have to rely on that right leg to hold me up and I don’t know how good it’ll be. I don’t plan on retiring. Everything is up in the air.”

He missed 30 of his next 58 games as a Jet. He was never the same. And 50 years later, his latest successor, Zach Wilson, has endured the daily blare of will he/won’t he, can he/can’t he be the new Next Namath. There have been 50 years’ worth of Next Namaths, with so many of the men who have followed showing aspects of the original without the full package.

How do you build the real Next Namath?

I’m glad you asked that …

You would start with a dash of Richard Todd’s toughness. Yes, few Jets fans look back fondly on Todd’s tenure, but he played through a remarkable assortment of injuries and in what was probably his finest hour, a stirring 16-15 win over Miami in 1981, he played with three broken ribs.

Jets quarterback Ken O’Brien throws the football as Giants’ Lawrence Taylor rushes during a 1988 meeting between the two teams. Getty Images

Add in Ken O’Brien’s 25-game stretch from early 1985 through mid-1986 when he was every bit as good as any quarterback in the game. A combo of getting blasted too often by defenders and his own coach ruined him, but across the 27 games from Week 1 in ’85 through Week 11 in ’86, he threw 48 TDs against 16 picks.

Throw in a healthy dose of Boomer Esiason’s confidence. And maybe half a dash of Ryan Fitzpatrick’s irrational confidence.

And Vinny Testaverde’s arm. Actually, duplicating Vinny’s arm is probably a statistical impossibility, but something close would be awfully helpful.

A couple of gallons of prime Chad Pennington’s poise would go an awful long way. Pennington was hardly a perfect QB, but he was smart and he was excellent in the red zone and you knew he was never going to kill you with a bad decision. His arm wasn’t great even before he got hurt, but he was a winning player.

Yes, we will include a couple of cups of Mark Sanchez in the mix. Look, ultimately he was a frustrating player. But he also led the Jets to back-to-back AFC title games. He won more playoff games than Namath, Pennington and Testaverde combined. That still counts for something around here.

Is that an impossible formula? Maybe. Possibly. Probably. But it’s been 50 years of mixing and matching. One of these days it’ll work out for someone chucking the rock for the NYJ, no?

Vac’s Whack

Is it me or does it feel like Jeurys Familia has been giving up season-altering home runs for the Mets every year going back to the 1973 World Series? I think Joe Rudi got him that time.

Jeurys Familia Robert Sabo

I must say I am quite looking forward to young Mr. Miles McBride learning the NBA ropes from the firm of Thibodeau, Walker & Rose.

Let’s just put it this way: If you are a public figure who may or may not have a skeleton or three in your closet, the best way to ruin your day is to pick up your phone and hear your assistant tell you, “Ronan Farrow is on the line for you.”

Sure, I’d like to see the Yankees keep those ultra-cool retro road uniforms they wore in Iowa the other night. Might be more helpful to the Yankees if they can keep the versions of Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton who played in Iowa the other night.

Whack Back at Vac

Dan Salogub: On the heels of the “Field of Dreams” game, what are the odds Manfred would have Dodgers and Mets in Brooklyn (Maimonides Park)? The Bums in Brooklyn once again!

Marty Carus: How about Knicks-Nets at the 69th Regiment Armory?

Vac: Sign me up for both!

Matt Deakin: Could there possibly be a more appropriate place for Aaron Boone to manage a game than the Field of Dreams? Listening to him day after day telling us that, obviously, this hitter or that pitcher is ready to break out. Obviously he is quite the dreamer and sees what the rest of us don’t.

Vac: Sometimes the readers get all the good lines, you know?

@TFrei: Stick taps for Jay Greenberg. He helped me as I was getting my feet wet. Well, and later, too. What we had in common was that we covered the Devils before they were the Devils — Jay the K.C. Scouts, me the Colorado Rockies. A very nice man.

@MikeVacc: So grateful to see the outpouring of love and memories the last few days for one of the genuinely good people I’ve ever had the privilege to work with.

Alan Hirschberg: Wednesday’s game completed a 53-game stretch during which the Mets got four wins from their starting pitchers. The 1919 White Sox got three wins from their starters in a World Series THEY WERE TRYING TO LOSE!

Vac: I love stuff like this. Though I doubt Mets fans love it quite as much.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the third of a six-part fantasy draft preview series leading up the NFL season, Fantasy Insanity discusses which quarterbacks to draft when. Next week: running backs.

The Madman is suffering from a bit of schizophrenia. We have warring factions doing battle in our head.

On one hand, part of us wants to stick with our old, reliable norm, and draft quarterbacks late in our fantasy drafts. On the other, we are more open to taking QBs earlier in drafts than we used to be, and we like the value of those top QB options.

Whether it is Patrick Mahomes in the third round (if he lasts that long), Josh Allen a round later, Lamar Jackson or Kyler Murray in the fourth or Aaron Rodgers in the fifth — these are all players we are perfectly comfortable drafting.

The only caveat is that there isn’t a running back, wide receiver or tight end we really like available instead. This is a scenario that occurs maybe half the time. The other half, we’re picking QBs much earlier than we have in the past.

Yet, when we don’t go with our a Mr. Hyde approach, we fall back on our safe Dr. Jekyll plan. That we means we’re skipping a lot of the middle-round QB options. We don’t think the Justin Herbert-Tom Brady-Russell Wilson-Dak Prescott group is that much better than what we can get later, when the options at other positions in those middle rounds are better than their corresponding later options.

Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott Getty Images

When we wait, our favorite time to hone back in on QBs is immediately after the aforementioned group is off the board. This occurs most often around rounds 7-8. At that point, we put a target on Matthew Stafford.

Of all the QB shuffling from team to team this offseason, his move is our favorite. He gets an offensive-minded coach in Sean McVay who did wonders with the much less talented Jared Goff. We like the tandem of receivers Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp better than any pair Stafford had at the same time in Detroit.

As the 10th QB off the board on average, we like his chances to crack the top 6-7 in fantasy this season, making him a bargain.

If we miss on Stafford, a checkdown to Joe Burrow, Matt Ryan or Ryan Tannehill is digestible even if not delectable.

Our later-round took a hit when Carson Wentz went down. We like the upside of him reuniting with Frank Reich, having a strong offensive line and a stout running game. But with his injury, and injuries on the O-line as well, we have been forced to audible. Now, we are embracing more schizophrenia, splitting shares between Baker Mayfield, Trevor Lawrence, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Sam Darnold.

We don’t like any of these as our No. 1 QB, but in most cases, we prefer to draft a backup — just in case of injury or to provide a platoon option if our other late- or middle-round QB doesn’t pan out as planned.

Guys we’re avoiding, for various reasons, include Jalen Hurts, Trey Lance, Justin Fields and Kirk Cousins. Some we feel are overvalued, others not guaranteed ample playing time, others just lack confidence in ability, etc.

Let the draft dictate which of the strategic split personalities to employ, and embrace the QB madness.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There is a scene in “And Justice For All” in which an off-kilter judge played by Jack Warden takes a scared-of-flying lawyer played by Al Pacino in a helicopter. It is not until they are midair that the judge explains a game he plays in which he calculates the midpoint for how much fuel he has, then flies beyond it to see if he can return safely.

The now hysterical lawyer spends the rest of the flight imploring the judge to land early. The judge changes the subject until they plop down in the water just shy of the runway; safe, but with a frazzled passenger.

I have thought about that scene in conjunction with this Yankees season. How far could they go beyond the midpoint not playing well and still land safely in the playoffs? They were just 41-40 halfway through a 162-game season — 9 ¹/₂ games out of first place and five behind in the wild card.

They entered the weekend with the AL’s second-best record since then. Yet still were short on the playoff runway — seven out in the division (the Rays were the team with the better record than the Yankees since they were 41-40) and two out in the wild card.

Their pathway to a playoff spot is akin to 1995, when they played inadequately most of the season before a 25-6 close allowed them to sneak in as the AL’s first wild card. That kick was powered by terrific rotation work, and the 2021 Yankees’ already strong pitching performance this year should be fortified in the coming days/weeks with Aroldis Chapman, Gerrit Cole, Domingo German, Corey Kluber, Jordan Montgomery, Luis Severino and perhaps Clarke Schmidt (all with the big assumption of no setbacks or more injuries). It sure would help, as well, if Joey Gallo, Aaron Judge and/or Giancarlo Stanton could carry the offense for a while.

Yankees players celebrate a home run during the “Field of Dreams” game. Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

But the wild-card competition is better now than 1995. Let’s assume the AL East title is unobtainable for the Yankees and that the Mariners are not yet ready to vault into the playoffs. In that scenario, two of four from the Yankees, Red Sox, Blue Jays and the AL West runner-up, either the Astros or A’s, would make it to the postseason. I would think even the second wild card would reach at least 92 wins. Do the Yankees have enough gas left to get there against this competition?

ASTROS

No AL club has an easier remaining schedule (based on winning percentage). Houston has 17 games still against last-place Arizona, Kansas City and Texas. But the final nine games are a home-and-home series versus Oakland sandwiched around three versus the Rays. Even with Alex Bregman (quad) missing the past two months, the offense has thrived overall this season (5.4 runs per game) with Michael Brantley as the lefty DJ LeMahieu (circa 2019-20) — think elite bat-to-ball skills. But it has slowed a bit recently with Carlos Correa struggling in the second half of his walk-year audition.

Second-year GM James Click refurbished a problematic bullpen at the trade deadline, notably with the additions of Yimi Garcia and Kendall Graveman. Will the rotation be good enough? Houston can use a strong ending from veteran Jake Odorizzi.

A’s

Part of Oakland’s magic is improving as the season elapses. The A’s have six of the 32 best second-half records from 2001-19 (there was no All-Star Game in 2020). And they won 15 of their first 23 second-half games this year. They entered the weekend with seven straight wins and 11 victories in 13 games.

Close your eyes Mets fans because the only member of your team who has played as many games as Jed Lowrie this year is Dom Smith — and Lowrie has returned to being a professional hitter. Center-fielder Ramon Laureano was lost for the rest of the season to a PED-related suspension, making trade-deadline acquisition Starling Marte all the more vital (in his first 12 Oakland games, Marte hit .415 and was 9-for-9 in steals). First baseman Matt Olson will be a top-10 MVP finisher, perhaps top five.

Oakland’s run prevention is not just reflective of its spacious home park — its road ERA is an AL-best 3.45. Chris Bassit and Sean Manaea have been two of the majors’ best starters while Cole Irvin, James Kaprielian and Frankie Montas have been above average. Trade-deadline acquisition Andrew Chafin has deepened the pen (Sergio Romo might just successfully throw sliders forever).

The A’s have a difficult schedule that includes four pivotal games Aug. 26-29 at home against the Yankees and are just 22-31 against teams .500 or better.

BLUE JAYS

Arguably no team nailed the combination of free agency (Robbie Ray, Marcus Semien, George Springer) and the trade deadline (Jose Berrios, Adam Cimber, Corey Dickerson, Brad Hand and Trevor Rogers) as well as Toronto. The Jays entered the weekend fourth in the AL East, yet with the AL’s third-best run differential.

Semien and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. are likely top five in the AL MVP race and, after missing most of the first three months this season, Springer has been among the majors’ best players. Toronto was supposed to be a strong offense. What is so encouraging has been the improved pitching (third-best AL ERA in the second half behind the A’s and Yankees) led by a rotation with Berrios, Ray, rookie Alek Manoah and Hyun-jin Ryu.

Perhaps the biggest trade-deadline acquisition was the Blue Jays getting back their true home in Toronto on July 30 for the first time since 2019. They are 9-2 at Rogers Centre, having outscored their opponents 58-32. Only the non-contending Orioles have more home games among AL teams the rest of the way. The Jays have seven games left against the Yankees, four in The Bronx and three in the penultimate series of the year in Toronto.

RED SOX

None of the major AL contenders did less at the deadline — Kyle Schwarber (hamstring) made his Red Sox debut Friday night and will be asked to learn a new position (first base). Austin Davis and Hansel Robles have not elevated the pen.

Martin Perez and Garrett Richards were removed from a suddenly wobbly rotation, which was scheduled to welcome ace Chris Sale (Tommy John surgery) back Saturday almost exactly two years to the day since his last major league outing. The surprise of the AL for most of four months, the Red Sox were an AL worst 3-10 since the July 30 trade deadline.

Lineup depth has become more of an issue, so Boston can really use Schwarber to return with the Red Sox close to as hot as he was with the Nationals before injuring his hamstring. The Yankees will have many regrets if they cannot overtake the Red Sox, losing 10 of 13 so far to them and handing Adam Ottavino and Garrett Whitlock (combined 2.48 ERA in 82 games) for basically nothing but luxury-tax relief in Ottavino’s case.

The Yanks have six more games against Boston, including three at Fenway before the Red Sox close with an Orioles/Nationals layup.

The Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees played one the most unique games MLB has ever seen at the Field of Dreams on Thursday and now they’re off to Chicago for a clash on Saturday between a pair of pitchers who enter in good form.

Yankees starter Jameson Taillon allowed four runs or more in his first five starts away from home, but in his five road starts since the start of July has allowed seven runs (four earned). The Yankees are 4-1 in these games with Taillon giving up two home runs in 31 ²/₃ innings with a 1.14 ERA.

The White Sox counter with Dylan Cease, who has a 2.20 home ERA and three runs or fewer allowed in all 11 of his home starts with opponents hitting .197 with 12.1 strikeouts per nine innings.

The Yankees have allowed four runs or fewer in 10 of their past 14 games; the White Sox have allowed four runs or fewer in 13 of their past 18 games. With the Yankees allowing the fewest home runs per game on the road this season and the White Sox 21st in home runs per game, runs won’t come as easily in Chicago as they did at the Field of Dreams.

The play: Yankees-White Sox total, Under 9 runs.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@We all knew the Red Sox would give way in the AL East, but their precipitous fall from grace has been as quick as Gov. Cuomo’s. They get Baltimore at Fenway Park this weekend to cure what ails.

The O’s Jorge Lopez, no relation to the comedian George Lopez but much funnier earlier this season, has been solid in his two August starts. Georgie (3-12, 5.75 ERA) has allowed only three runs over 12 innings to the heavy-hitting Yankees and Rays. The Sox and the city of Boston have been waiting for Chris Sale to return and he will make his first start since 2019. Sale’s pitch count will be monitored closely. Underdogs haven’t treated us well this week, but we will take the Orioles for 10 units.

Pirates/Brewers was rained out. They’ll play two on Saturday. Mitch Keller will go in the nightcap against Aaron Ashby (13.50 ERA). Sticking with the Pirates for 10 units. On hold at -615 mazeroskis.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CHICAGO — As Tim Anderson came to the plate with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 10th, it would have been easy to wonder if there was going to be a sequel to the Yankees’ “Field of Dreams” nightmare.

Just two nights earlier, Anderson sent a ball into the cornfields in Iowa to send the Yankees to another crushing defeat.

On Saturday, though, Albert Abreu got Anderson to ground to third to finally end the game, as the Yankees held on for a 7-5, 10-inning win over the White Sox at Guaranteed Rate Park.

“This team has heart,’’ Aaron Boone said of what he’s learned after games like this one. “It’s not been easy for us this season, at all. But they’re tough. They compete. We keep grinding away and throwing punches and we’ll continue to do that the rest of the way.”

Saturday’s victory embodied all of that, as they battled the first-place White Sox and took the lead with an Aaron Judge homer off Craig Kimbrel to open the eighth.

But one out away from a win, Chad Green gave up a game-tying homer to Jose Abreu to send the game into extra innings — which is when the real drama began.

Judge singled in extra runner Brett Gardner to put the Yankees up by a run again, and Joey Gallo hit his second homer of the night to give the Yankees a three-run lead — clobbering Chicago closer Liam Hendriks for a second straight game.

Boone, after announcing that the struggling Zack Britton would be used in more low-leverage situations, called upon the lefty to finish it in the 10th, but Britton allowed a run and loaded the bases with just one out before being pulled in favor of the inexperienced Abreu.

The young right-hander entered and got pinch-hitter Seby Zavala to line to first and Anderson to ground to third, where Tyler Wade made the play for the last out — and Abreu earned his first major league save.

“Abreu, coming into that situation, it’s tough to do,’’ said Judge, who is in the middle of a torrid stretch at the plate. “A sold-out crowd on the road, bases loaded. It’s not ideal for a reliever. He showed a lot of guts.”

He believes the same is true of the Yankees as a whole.

“We’re a team that doesn’t give up,’’ Judge said. “We fight ’til the last out. We witnessed that in the cornfield [Thursday] and even here. You’ve got to pull us off that field. … There’s no panic in this team.”

The teams traded runs in the first three innings before Judge’s shot to center in the eighth, one that Gallo called “probably one of the lowest home runs I’ve ever seen hit to center field.”

Judge also had a run-scoring double and a sacrifice fly and is 12-for-29 with three doubles, four homers and 12 RBIs in his past seven games.

The Yankees needed everything Judge had Saturday in what has shaped up to be a thrilling series — and perhaps an October preview if the Yankees can figure out a way to get there.

“I’ve never played in the playoffs, but I assume this is what the playoffs feel like,” Gallo said of the intensity of the past two games.

And that lasted until the final out, as the raucous crowd of 38,477 exploded when Anderson came to the plate in the 10th after replays of his dramatic homer in Iowa were repeatedly shown on the scoreboard during the night.

Gallo was in left field, thinking: “‘Man here we go. Here’s the guy who beat us. But baseball is a hard game. I was confident Abreu was gonna get him out.”

Once again, the Yankees managed to pick themselves up from another demoralizing loss.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Mets were already staring down a challenging schedule by virtue of facing two of the top teams in the NL West for 13 straight games, starting Friday.

Then they got bumped up to play in front of a nationally televised audience Sunday night, ahead of a Monday night game in San Francisco, to the displeasure of at least one Met.

Instead of having a day game Sunday to give them a jump on the cross-country trip, the Mets will be playing on ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball” — delaying their California arrival until well into the early hours of Monday morning before a 9:45 p.m. (EDT) game.

“Hey @MLB @ESPN whose dumb f–king idea was it to change [Sunday’s] game to a night game when we’re travelling to the west coast after,” right-hander Noah Syndergaard wrote in an Instagram post Saturday. “Won’t get in until Monday morning. Take on the 1st place Giants later that evening. Brilliant!”

Noah Syndergaard Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

Syndergaard, who is still rehabbing from Tommy John surgery and subsequent elbow inflammation but has been traveling with the team, also noted the Dodgers have the same grueling schedule with a home game Monday night, calling it “cruel.”

“I know they’re venting about it,” manager Luis Rojas said before Saturday’s 2-1, 10-inning loss to the Dodgers. “I’ve heard the guys throughout the clubhouse say it and repeat it. But I think they’re doing it more as a joke because there’s no way around it. We’re going to do it. Other teams have done this in the past, too.”

Rojas said that while the Mets will arrive late at the ballpark for Monday’s game to allow for extra rest, they won’t fly starting pitcher Rich Hill to San Francisco ahead of the team.

Francisco Lindor (strained right oblique) continued to make progress toward a rehab assignment, taking batting practice from both sides of the plate.

Before Saturday, he had only swung right-handed on the field. He was swinging left-handed when he suffered the oblique injury last month in Pittsburgh.

Rojas, who called Lindor swinging from the left side “a big step,” still declined to put a timetable on his return. Lindor’s next step will be facing live pitching.

“He looked really good,” Rojas said.

Luis Guillorme (strained left hamstring) took batting practice and grounders as well, though he appears to be behind Lindor.

With Javier Baez (back spasms) and Jose Peraza (fractured finger) also out, Brandon Drury is now the Mets’ backup shortstop behind starter Jonathan Villar. Drury has started just six MLB games at short. Rojas also mentioned Jeff McNeil and J.D. Davis as options.

The Mets placed reliever Drew Smith on the 10-day injured list with right shoulder inflammation. Rojas described it as a lat or shoulder issue similar to the injury he battled in spring training, though not as severe. Still, it was going to keep him down “for a couple days,” Rojas said, necessitating the move.

“It shouldn’t be a long stint like it was in spring training,” Rojas said.

The Mets also optioned outfielder Albert Almora Jr. to Triple-A Syracuse and added more bullpen depth, calling up Geoff Hartlieb and Jake Reed.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CHICAGO — Luke Voit isn’t done yet.

With Anthony Rizzo expected to go through his cardiac workup on Monday in The Bronx in advance of coming off the COVID injured list, Voit’s status with the Yankees looks to be shaky again.

“We’ll see how it unfolds,’’ Aaron Boone said of Voit’s role once Rizzo comes back. “Hopefully Rizzo is getting close.”

That was before Voit had one of his most productive games of the season with a homer, two singles and a pair of runs scored and two RBIs in a 5-3 win over the White Sox on Sunday at Guaranteed Rate Field.

Voit called his situation “a tough spot.”

He remained with the Yankees following Rizzo’s arrival before the July 30 trade deadline.

“I’ve done so much for this organization, I didn’t think it was a possibility,’’ Voit said of losing his job at first base after leading the majors with 22 homers last season. “That’s what happens when you only play 30 games at the deadline. That’s the business part of it. I still want to do all I can for the guys.”

Voit seems resigned to the fact he’ll be relegated to pinch hitting and an occasional start at DH when Giancarlo Stanton is in left field — as he was again on Sunday.

But he said his mindset has improved since he initially learned of the trade.

“When it first happened, I had just started playing games again,’’ Voit said of his comeback from left knee inflammation. “I was very frustrated and just in a bad place mentally. … It’s very easy to drift off and go into a bad place.”

But he’s continued to show up early to work on his swing.

“You never know what happens in this game,’’ Voit said.

Because he was rehabbing for most of Rizzo’s time in The Bronx and Rizzo has been away from the team with COVID, Voit said the two haven’t talked much.

“I know he’s a good player and a good dude,’’ Voit said. “He told me the same thing happened when he was in San Diego and he got pushed to the side. We’ve both got to do our jobs.”

Voit said he expects to talk to Boone at some point before Rizzo returns.

“The biggest thing is to focus on the here and now,’’ Boone said of Voit following the game. “We know what a good hitter he is. He had a big, impactful game for us today. There’s no question it’s been a tough year for Luke with the injuries … and not getting traction [at the plate].”

That was especially true going into Sunday, with Voit hitless in the first two games of the series, with six strikeouts.

“I felt like I was in 0-2 counts a lot and swinging at everything,’’ Voit said. “I got in bad habits fighting the knee injury.”

But he added he hasn’t lost confidence.

“I’m capable of doing damage,’’ Voit said. “This year has been a grind for me.”

And there’s no telling how the rest of the season will go.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Mets’ high-leverage arms finally got a night off Sunday, courtesy of the Dodgers running away with a 14-4 win.

But the late-inning relievers in the Mets bullpen put in a heavy workload in the games leading up to Sunday — including Edwin Diaz and Jeurys Familia each throwing three straight days — something manager Luis Rojas will be monitoring as the club continues a crucial stretch of 13 games in 13 days.

“We’re in August, guys are going to throw three in a row, they’re going to take that one day off, bounce back and leave their arm out there for the team,” Rojas said before the Dodgers finished off a sweep of the Mets. “But we still want to be smart because we want to finish with these guys and we want them throwing at their best. We are talking about it. We’re paying attention and we’re realistic if they need a day, they need a day and we’ll give it to them.”

Noah Syndergaard (Tommy John surgery) threw another bullpen session on Friday and “felt great,” Rojas said.

“We’re looking at him probably facing batters the next time,” Rojas said. “I don’t know exactly when that’s going to be.”

Yennsy Diaz Corey Sipkin

The Mets hope to get Syndergaard back at some point in September, with acting GM Zack Scott indicating recently that the right-hander could come back as a reliever.

Javier Baez (back spasms) has yet to do any baseball activities since being placed on the 10-day injured list Friday (retroactive to Thursday). He last appeared in a game as a pinch hitter on Wednesday.

Baez is eligible to come off the injured list next Sunday, when the Mets play the Dodgers in Los Angeles, but Rojas said whether that happens depends on his next few days.

“I still want to see how he progresses with the treatment,” Rojas said. “If he’s not able to do those getting close to that 10th day, then it’s probably not realistic he’s just going to get activated without doing anything.”

Monday’s starter, Rich Hill, flew to San Francisco ahead of the team on Sunday. Rojas had initially said that Hill would fly with the team after Sunday’s game, but the club was not expected to arrive in San Francisco until early Monday morning.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For Carlos Carrasco, this feels like the end of spring training.

It sure looked like it Sunday night, as he was tattooed in his second consecutive poor performance.

The veteran right-hander, who missed the first four months of the season with a torn right hamstring, was supposed to provide a jolt to the Jacob deGrom-less starting rotation. But, so far, he has not produced results anywhere close to the kind of quality innings the Mets had hoped for from the 34-year-old.

This was by far the worst of his four outings, a disastrous two-inning, six-run effort that set the tone in the Dodgers’ 14-4, sweep-clinching rout of the Mets at Citi Field on Sunday night. That came after he allowed four earned runs to the woeful Nationals in a rain-shortened performance. All told, Carrasco has a 10.32 ERA across 11 ¹/₃ innings. He has allowed more hits (18) than strikeouts (12), has a sky-high 1.85 WHIP and has yet to finish the fifth inning.

Carlos Carrasco Corey Sipkin

“It is [disappointing]. I’m a human being, I feel that way,” said Carrasco, who came to the Mets in the Francisco Lindor trade. “I feel pretty much right now like the end of spring training. Tomorrow is another day and I got a lot of work left to do to get better myself.”

Carrasco hasn’t come close to hitting his stride early on in his Mets career. For the two innings he was on the mound Sunday, he was treated like a piñata by the powerhouse Dodgers. He was basically throwing batting practice, giving up three home runs and five extra-base hits. He faced 13 hitters and six of them hit the ball at 100 miles per hour or harder. He put the Mets in an early six-run hole they couldn’t come close to digging out of.

Former Met Justin Turner started the barrage with a two-run shot in the first inning, his ninth in 35 career games against the Mets, and Will Smith added his third long ball of the series two batters later. Carrasco had two outs without any damage being done in the second, but then allowed a Trea Turner double and an opposite-field, two-run shot to Max Muncy.

“Tonight was different, the stuff was different,” manager Luis Rojas said. “The first pitch of the game was really good, he got a swing and miss on Turner. But not a lot of pitches were like that. The fastball didn’t have the zip that we know, the slider was sometimes hanging. And a team like this will take advantage.”

At least when Carrasco was working his way back to them from his hamstring injury, the Mets could imagine him making a difference.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Before the Mets welcomed the Dodgers to Citi Field this weekend — the start of a 13-game gauntlet against the Dodgers and Giants that could make or break their season — Pete Alonso called it a “show-me stretch.”

With three games in the books, the Mets have absolutely nothing to show for it.

After hanging their hat on taking the Dodgers to extra innings in each of the first two games, only to drop both, the Mets suffered a full-on blowout Sunday night to get swept with a 14-4 loss at Citi Field.

Carlos Carrasco got shelled for six runs and three homers while lasting just two innings. The Mets (59-58) couldn’t get anything going against Max Scherzer — despite the Dodgers’ lackluster defense giving them plenty of chances early to get back in the game — and went 0-for-12 with runners in scoring position.

“The guys kept battling, but we couldn’t stop them,” manager Luis Rojas said. “It’s a tough series, not to get one win out of it.”

By the time Max Muncy had hit his second home run of the night in the sixth inning to push the Dodgers’ lead to 9-2, chants of “Let’s Go Dodgers” filled Citi Field. Later, the Mets needed two position players, Brandon Drury and Kevin Pillar, to pitch the ninth inning.

And if all that wasn’t enough, awaiting the Mets (after their cross-country flight late Sunday night) on Monday in San Francisco? The team with the best record in baseball.

The Dodgers (72-46) ambushed Carrasco, who now owns a 10.32 ERA after four starts as a Met. Ex-Met Justin Turner crushed a two-run homer to left-center field before Will Smith added a two-out solo shot for a 3-0 lead in the first inning. It was Smith’s third home run of the series — the first gave the Dodgers a lead in the 10th inning Friday night and the second broke up Taijuan Walker’s no-hitter and tied the game in the seventh inning on Saturday.

Cody Bellinger led off the second inning with a double ripped to the gap and then scored on Trea Turner’s RBI double. Muncy came up next and made it 6-0 with a two-run homer sent 420 feet to left field.

“They hit everything, man,” said Carrasco, who needed 57 pitches to record six outs. “I tried to do my best. I tried to do everything that I could, but it didn’t work this time.”

After the Mets wasted a two-on, one-out scenario in the first inning, a Dodgers error put runners on first and second with one out in the bottom of the second. Carrasco laid down a sacrifice bunt — with manager Luis Rojas not turning to a pinch hitter from his four-man bench — but Brandon Nimmo followed with a groundout to strand runners at second and third.

Even after Carrasco hit for himself, Jake Reed relieved him to begin the third inning and delivered three scoreless innings to help save an already tired bullpen.

The Mets finally pushed a run across in the third inning on a groundout by Jeff McNeil to make it 6-1. An inning later, they loaded the bases with one out, but again missed a chance to put a dent into the Dodgers’ lead, scratching across just one run on Conforto’s groundout that made it 6-2.

“The extra-base hit didn’t happen like it happened on their side,” Rojas said. “We played a couple tight games the first two nights, but the hitting’s gotta show up. That’s the bottom line.”

The Mets got two runs back in the seventh inning off the Dodgers bullpen, but they came on a wild pitch and a J.D. Davis sacrifice fly to get within 9-4. The Dodgers then hung another three-spot in the eighth inning off Geoff Hartlieb before adding two more runs off Drury in the ninth.

“We gotta turn the page,” Rojas said. “It’s just one game.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was a sight the Mets could really get used to seeing. Francisco Lindor in full uniform, lining a base hit to right field, sprinting around first base and diving into second, flashing that trademark smile of his.

The only problem: It was three hours before the Mets would try to avoid a sweep at the hands of old friend Max Scherzer and the Dodgers.

Instead of Lindor electrifying the Citi Field crowd, however, the superstar shortstop was taking yet another step in his road back from a right oblique strain, swinging from both sides of the plate in batting practice, running the bases and exerting himself in fielding drills

“Right now I feel great,” said Lindor, out since July 16, his absence part of the reason the Mets have fallen from their perch atop the NL East, dropping 16 of 28 games without him. “Every step that we have done I have felt great. I’m happy with how the trainers have done things.”

Now for the good news: Lindor believes he’s close to returning. Luis Rojas echoed his shortstop, saying he could be back “sooner than later.”

In fact, the Mets’ manager didn’t shoot down the idea that Lindor could be active when the team returns from its daunting seven-game West Coast trip.

“There is a possibility,” Rojas said.

Lindor said he feels good enough to play, but declined to put a timetable on his return, leaving it up to the team’s medical experts. For now, Rojas and Lindor were coy on whether he can forgo a minor league rehabilitation assignment, or have a limited one, before returning to the Mets.

“He’s put himself in a really good position,” Rojas said. “He should be with us sooner rather than later.”

At the moment, the next step is Lindor facing live pitching and testing the oblique against high velocity, which he is expected to do at some point during the team’s trip which begins Monday night in San Francisco.

“I want to be with the team as much as possible, but at the end of the day the trainers know best,” he said. “Whatever they decide, I got to be on board with it.

“I have to work as hard as I can here so I can show them maybe we don’t have to go two weeks in the minor leagues.”

As for being in full uniform, that had nothing to do with where he’s at in his rehab. That was just the ultra-positive Lindor being Lindor.

“I had nothing better to do,” he joked.

Clearly, the Mets miss him, even if by Lindor’s standards he wasn’t having a big season. His defense was terrific, his leadership was tangible and his bat was coming around. He was had a .333/.489/.500 slash line with a .989 OPS in July before the injury after homering five times and driving in 15 runs in June.

“It sucks,” Lindor said. “I mean, I want to be out there. I get paid to be on the field, not to be a cheerleader in the dugout.”

Perhaps soon, his role will change. Maybe even the next time the Mets play at Citi Field.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CHICAGO — The Yankees have some work to do to make sure they’re still playing in October.

If they get there, though, they’re showing how dangerous they might be — no matter who’s on the mound.

With Sunday’s 5-3 win at Guaranteed Rate Field, the Yankees were just a Zack Britton implosion away from sweeping the season series against the first-place White Sox.

Nestor Cortes Jr. again proved to be one of the Yankees’ most reliable pitchers with six strong innings before four relievers finished the game in a setup that would look considerably different if the teams do meet again.

After the latest edge-of-your-seat victory, Aaron Boone said it was good to “exhale here for a minute.”

He had reason to.

A tired and battered bullpen turned to Lucas Luetge in the ninth and the lefty — normally dependable this season — allowed three of the four batters he faced to reach base before another left-hander, Wandy Peralta, was called upon.

Peralta allowed an RBI infield hit to Tim Anderson to cut the Yankees’ lead to two before getting Cesar Hernandez to ground into a game-ending double play.

“It definitely felt like a big series,’’ Boone said. “As we get more used to having big crowds, they were involved [Saturday] night and today. It felt important.”

Luke Voit gave the Yankees a four-run cushion with a two-run homer in the top of the ninth.

In the bottom of the inning, after Luetge walked Yoan Moncada and gave up a single to Luis Robert, Jake Lamb hit a fly ball to shallow right field that Boone thought would fall in for a bloop hit. Instead, recent call-up Andrew Velazquez, shifted up the middle a bit at shortstop, made a sensational running catch for the first out.

As Boone said, Velazquez, who had just been inserted for defense, “came out of nowhere” to make the catch.

Luetge gave up an RBI double to Zack Collins before Peralta came in to save it.

As much as the lesser-known names in the bullpen have contributed in the absence of Aroldis Chapman — and with Britton struggling — perhaps no one has been a more significant addition to the pitching staff than Cortes.

The lefty used his typical array of odd angles — and a versatile array of pitches — to keep the powerful White Sox lineup off balance.

It was especially impressive considering Chicago is filled with dangerous right-handed hitters.

Voit called Cortes’ performance “unbelievable” and added his repertoire was “disgusting.”

“We really needed it,’’ Voit said. “You just don’t see guys like that anymore. … He’s shimmying, trying to screw with your timing. You go 0-for-3 and say, ‘How did I not get a hit off him?’ ”

Cortes has pitched in various roles for the Yankees and that could continue when — or if — some other parts of the rotation come back soon, as expected.

“He’s in the middle of a really strong year,’’ Boone said. “He’s a big reason why we’re turning this thing around. … He’s pitching really well and we like when he has the ball in his hand.”

With the win, the Yankees moved to 13 games over .500 (65-52) for the first time since the end of the 2019 season.

The lineup was especially effective against Chicago right-hander Lucas Giolito, who needed 101 pitches to get through four innings.

The Yankees took a three-run lead in the second. After Voit’s leadoff single, Rougned Odor hit his 14th homer of the season to make it 2-0. DJ LeMahieu scored on a throwing error later in the inning.

Cortes rolled through five shutout innings until Andrew Vaughn took him deep to left with one out in the sixth, cutting the Yankees’ lead to 3-1.

Stephen Ridings and Jonathan Loaisiga tossed scoreless innings before Luetge ran into trouble in the ninth.

Now, the Yankees head home for an eight-game homestand, still looking to get into the postseason.

“I really feel like with this group, there’s an underlying confidence that’s existed even in the worst of days this year,’’ Boone said. “Maybe not rightly so, but I do believe they believe they’d get it turned around and get rolling.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Zack Britton told Aaron Boone he didn’t deserve to be the Yankees’ interim closer. He was tasked with getting the final three outs Saturday night anyway.

After Chad Green blew the save, offering up a two-out, two-strike, game-tying homer to Jose Abreu, Britton was called upon in the 10th and nearly flushed another win.

Fortunately for the Yankees, Albert Abreu bailed out Britton, notching his first major league save in a dramatic 7-5 win in 10 innings over the White Sox in Chicago.

“’Britt’s going through a tough stretch, a tough time. Even when you’re great like him, this game will do that to you,” Boone said. “You got to be able to battle through it, and we’ll be there and try to support him through this. We know how important a role he’s still going to play for us.”

Before the game, Boone said he would be using Green or Jonathan Loaisiga as his closer until Aroldis Chapman (left elbow inflammation) was ready to return. Britton had blown two of his three save opportunities — he allowed Tim Anderson’s walk-off homer in Thursday’s “Field of Dreams” game — and had struggled immensely during his injury-fractured season. After Thursday’s loss, he spoke to Boone about his problems.

Zack Britton N.Y. Post: Charles Wenzelberg

“I told him I don’t deserve to be out there in the ninth inning,” said Britton, who now has a 6.19 ERA across 16 innings with a sky-high 1.81 WHIP. “Other guys deserve it.”

The 33-year-old Britton’s issues continued Saturday. He retired just one of the four batters he faced, allowing one hit and two walks, and left with the bases loaded and one out. Boone said the Yankees would take a look at Britton physically, but he believes the left-hander is healthy.

“I know no one is going to work harder than Zack at this,” Boone said.

Until Green’s blown save, it looked like the Yankees were going to stay away from the struggling Britton. Boone went to southpaw Wandy Peralta with two on and two outs in the seventh. Peralta got Yoan Moncada to ground out to end the threat and was lifted with two outs in the eighth for Green.

But after the Yankees scored three runs in the 10th, and had already used Green and Loaisiga, Boone called upon Britton. After Moncada flew out, Britton walked Brian Goodwin, allowed a run-scoring single to Luis Robert and walked Andrew Vaughn.

In came the 25-year-old Abreu, who enabled the Yankees to even the series by getting Seby Zavala on a line out and Anderson on a groundout.

“He stepped up there, showed a lot of heart, a lot of guts and did his thing against one of the best lineups in the game,” Aaron Judge said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — Knicks brass couldn’t be more delighted by Saturday’s happenings. The July 29 draft is starting to look as pretty as a pink flamingo.

Turns out the Knicks didn’t need starting point guard Immanuel Quickley, who sat out Saturday’s game vs. Cleveland with a sore groin.

And so debuted the starting rookie backcourt of point guard Miles McBride and shooting guard Quentin Grimes. They lit up Vegas with a combined 51 points as the Knicks held off the Cavaliers, 103-94, at Thomas & Mack Center to move to 3-2.

These aren’t lottery picks. A little more than two weeks ago, Grimes was tabbed 25th. McBride fell to 36.

According to a NBA source, Knicks officials are delighted their draft picks look significantly more polished than during the draft combine in late June.

Grimes scored 28 points with McBride adding 23. The duo combined to shoot 17-of-34 from the field — 11-of-22 from 3-point land. Fifty percent — 50 percent.

“I thought they did a great job — a lot of energy to start,’’ summer-league coach Dice Yoshimoto said. “One thing we talked about after [Friday’s loss to Detroit] was to have energy and intensity to the game. We made a point about being aggressive on both ends of the floor.’’

Grimes, the Houston product, has scored 53 points in the past two games after a slow start to summer league.

McBride, out of West Virginia, had a rough shooting game in the Friday loss (2-of-14) and bounced back with a vengeance. He sank 9 of 14 shots with five assists as he took control of the starting-point guard role from Quickley. McBride sank five of eight from 3-point land.

“I tell him to shoot when he’s open, don’t hesitant, let it fly,’’ Yoshimoto said. “As long as he continues to shoot the right ones, I’m OK with that.’’

No one knows how much Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau will play McBride-Grimes this season, and he has yet to comment on the Knicks’ four draft picks. But The Post reported before the draft Thibodeau pushed for McBride.

As the Cavaliers scrambled back to within three with 2 minutes left, Grimes nailed a clutch left-wing 3-pointer and McBride hit a tough runner off the glass, old school.

Meanwhile, Obi Toppin, the summer league’s fifth-leading scorer and 2020 lottery pick, bulled and skied his way to 21 points (8-of-20 from the field).

Even better, the highlight defensive play came when another Knicks 2021 draft pick, rookie center Jericho Sims, skied in the opening quarter to block emphatically a driving layup by Tre Scott, eliciting one of the loudest roars of the night. Sims, picked 58th, notched eight points and nine rebounds.

The only downer was the Cavaliers’ third pick in the draft, center Evan Mobley, sat out.

As for the McBride-Grimes duo, they may get one more chance at it as the Knicks will finish the summer league with a consolation game vs. Atlanta on Monday at 7 p.m.

That will be intriguing because the Knicks traded their 19th pick for Charlotte’s future first-rounder, and the Hawks went on to select highly touted but baggage-ridden Jalen Johnson with the 20th pick.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LAS VEGAS — With Nets guard Cam Thomas among the highest-scoring players in the Las Vegas Summer League, it begs a simple question.

How did he fall to the 27th-overall pick?

“People always want to doubt me and doubt my ability to score the ball,” said Thomas, before he went out and scored 36 points on 11-for-25 shooting — including 3-for-6 from 3-point range — in a 104-100 win over the Spurs on Sunday. Thomas’ 36 points were the most in a summer league game since 2018. “My progress has been great. I’ve been getting better game-to-game, getting a better feel for the game, feel for the pace. … I think I’m doing real well.”

Late first-round picks like Thomas are not expected to dominate summer league like top picks Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green.

But Thomas has been better than advertised.

How did that happen?

“It’s just confidence, I have a lot of confidence,” the LSU product told NBATV after leading Brooklyn past San Antonio. “Confidence … that’s my best friend, right there.”

“He continued to surprise us,” Nets summer league coach Jordan Ott said following the game, according to NetsDaily. “This is a great experience for the whole group, great experience for Cam to be in so many close games, even in summer league. He has to make the decisions down the stretch. Basically put the ball in his hands. He made big shot after big shot.”

Although scouts told The Post that Thomas’ playmaking and defense will need work for him to become more than just a microwave scorer off the bench, he clearly has an advanced offensive game. Thomas, who is just 19 years old, leads all rookies averaging 27 points and 9.8 free throw attempts per game.

“What gets lost is that a 22-year-old rookie is different than 19 — and a 19-year-old that’s a little undersized is different than a guy that’s physically ready,” Ott told The Post before the game. “His businesslike approach is helping. He’s able to make strides. He is confident; and he should be confident when you put the work in that he has. He should be confident.

“It’s interesting, comparing his first half and second half of all the games. It’s like he figures out the defense, figures out what he’s supposed to do and how he’s supposed to attack. Super interesting to see him progress first half to second half, and then carry us down the stretch in all the games.”

That confidence is what makes Thomas the scorer he is, unafraid of the responsibility of taking big shots.

It’s what got him to Brooklyn.

It may also be how the Nets got him at No. 27, when some projected him to go in the top 20, or even late in the lottery.

Multiple league personnel told The Post there was a narrative circulating around Thomas that his confidence may have come off as cockiness.

“I’m not sure about the process before he stepped foot in Brooklyn. Again, our scouts did a hell of a job evaluating. We were fortunate that he came to us,” Ott said. “The only thing I can see is what we see every single day: That his businesslike approach is helping his progress.”

Former Nets assistant general manager Bobby Marks — who is with ESPN, but also preps prospects for pre-draft interviews — confirmed the rumblings surrounding Thomas.

Marks called Thomas “an interesting player, an interesting person,” and said the guard’s self-assurance may have been misconstrued as hubris.

“What I think was a little bit of a turnoff for certain teams is that there’s a certain sense of confidence, maybe overconfidence, maybe a certain sense of arrogance,” Marks said on Instagram of Thomas, who was raised by a single, military mom. “I just think he has a major chip on his shoulder, because he sees all these players that were ahead of him in the mock drafts heading into the draft. He was projected to go in the 20’s and he went at 27. I just think he’s got a major edge to him in a good way. And every team needs scoring off the bench like we see in Utah with Jordan Clarkson. For a rookie, he’s got — excuse me — a lot of s–t to him, in a good way… He could give Brooklyn some minutes off the bench.”

Marks added, “I really like the kid. He knows who he is. Yeah, he needs to get better defensively but he is one confident young man. As I said the night of the draft, when we get to February and we’re announcing these rising sophomores, rising freshmen to play at the All-Star Weekend, don’t be surprised if Cam Thomas’s name is mentioned among the players. He’s a good one, particularly where Brooklyn picked at 27.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Giants haven’t been extra cautious with Saquon Barkley’s return from a torn ACL just to risk an overexcited Browns player accidentally causing a setback by trying to prove himself to the coaches.

Joe Judge revealed Sunday a plan to take all injured players to Cleveland in advance of joint practices with the Browns on Thursday and Friday, before the teams meet in the second preseason game. That includes rookie receiver Kadarius Toney, whose slow walk through training camp was stalled when he re-aggravated an unspecified injury last week and did not play against the Jets.

It is unclear what Toney’s workload in joint practices will be, but Barkley will be limited to individual drills or rehab separate from the team.

“At this point, the focus is really to kind of get him moving more and more within the football movements,” Judge said. “I wouldn’t anticipate him being in any kind of live drills this week. We’ll see where it goes as we go down further and further when his body is ready for all of football.”

Saquon Barkley Robert Sabo

Barkley came off the physically unable to perform list last Monday and, as Judge put it, “responded well to the volume” in his first week of practice, including a couple strenuous days followed by a lighter day and a ramp-up day.

Joint practices are valuable from an evaluation standpoint, but they also introduce uncontrolled variables. Judge can’t reprimand Browns players for going too hard when adrenaline gets a natural boost from seeing an opposing jersey.

The Giants remain vague about whether Barkley, who hurt his knee last Sept. 20, will be ready Week 1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Guilty, until proven innocent.

Sorry, but this is the way it must be with the Giants and their woebegone offense. Until they do it, the assumption has to be that they cannot.

That it is the middle of August, often a time for football mirages, only means there is another month to wonder and worry about what we see and what we don’t. There is plenty of time to get things right, but sometimes all the time in the world is not enough time.

These are not conclusions or damnations based on the one terrible offensive showcase in Saturday night’s 12-7 preseason loss to the Jets. You know the line about Vegas? Likewise, what happens in preseason openers should stay in preseason openers. So, when fourth-fifths of the projected offensive line, working with none of the running backs, wide receivers or tight ends on top of the depth chart, failed to generate many yards or any points, it can be sloughed off as a clearing of the throat before giving a speech.

It can also be a warning sign that the fix is not in.

Take a look around the league in Week 1 of the preseason. Quarterbacks of all sorts of differing pedigrees dumped the ball off in front of vanilla defenses, completing passes and looking competent. Kyle Lauletta, a former Giants backup, with a passer rating of 118.1 for the Browns. P.J. Walker, 116.9 for the Panthers. Dwayne Haskins, 108.3 for the Steelers. Logan Woodside, 103.2 for the Titans. Drew Lock, 153.3 for the Broncos. Colt McCoy, the Giants’ backup last season, 107.7 for the Cardinals. Even Davis Webb got into the act. The Giants’ 2017 third-round draft pick compiled a passer rating of 103.6 in the Bills’ opener Friday night.

This was functioning. The Giants did not function, evidenced by ridiculous and unsightly numbers from Mike Glennon (3 of 7, 20 yards, passer rating of 50.3) and Clayton Thorson (5 of 16, 72 yards, rating of 67.7).

The counterpoint: Yeah, but when Daniel Jones gets out there and he is throwing to Kenny Golladay, Sterling Shepard, Kadarius Toney and Evan Engram and handing it to Saquon Barkley, it will all look so much different, so much better.

Will it?

Not if the offensive line does not greatly improve and defy the almost laughably low expectations those outside the organization have for this group. Four of the five projected starters (Andrew Thomas, Nick Gates, Will Hernandez and Matt Peart) were on the field for the first 18 snaps on offense, four series. The output: Zero points (a fumble at the Jets’ 3-yard line by Corey Clement was costly), 60 total yards, seven first downs.

“There were enough positives right there to really get a look in terms of what we can do to keep helping these guys and put them in the right position,’’ coach Joe Judge said Sunday, “and maybe some things you want to stay away from in the future in terms of play calling or snaps. But this is the time of year you really find out about that. In practice, you find out about some things. When you see a foreign opponent, you find out a little bit more about it right there.’’

The Giants (31st in the NFL in scoring in 2020) need to find more things the offensive line can do and less that it cannot do.

“I think the preseason games are huge for us, especially with our young offensive line, it gives us reps, it gets us going against other pass rushers and run stoppers,’’ Gates, returning for a second year as the starting center, said. “There’s good and there’s bad. There’s definitely things we need to clean up and things we need to do better, but there’s definitely some things we did a lot better than we did last year.’’

The communication, passing off pass rushers from one offensive lineman to another, was better. But not good enough. The first round of cuts (five per team) will be made early this week and Judge said “there’s a good chance’’ the Giants will sign an offensive lineman, as another body is needed for the two-day joint practice in Cleveland on Thursday and Friday in advance of preseason game No. 2, against the Browns.

A castoff from another team is not going to come in and challenge for a starting job on the Giants offensive line. Other than moving veteran Nate Solder in for Peart at right tackle, there are very few legitimate options from within.

Jones and most, or some, of his main targets will get out there soon enough and it is likely the offensive line gets a boost from that. In the past, an offensive malaise in the summer was waved off as no big deal and then a lousy start to the real season proved it was a big deal. There is no benefit of the doubt here with the Giants, their offense and their offensive line.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Perhaps Tim Tebow should just block out his return to the football field all together.

In his first NFL game since the 2015 preseason, Tebow was barely noticeable on the field — until he went viral for botching a routine block.

During a running play in Jacksonville’s 23-13 loss to the Browns on Saturday, Tebow fell after flinging his body against a defender, and then proceeded to run into his teammate upon getting up.

After years as a quarterback, the former Heisman Trophy winner is trying to make it as a tight end with Urban Meyer’s Jaguars.

But he’s looking like a longshot to make the final roster.

“It’s an uphill battle,” Jaguars offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell told USA Today regarding Tebow’s chances of making the team. “He’s learning a brand new position. But if you’ve ever been around that guy — I’ve only been around him for a few months — you won’t see a guy who prepares, trains and puts more into it than him.

“He’s put in hours upon hours. To be where he is right now, on the field in an NFL training camp, I think speaks a lot to his commitment.”

Tim Tebow Getty Images

Tebow, who turned 34 Saturday, appeared in Saturday’s box score just once, credited with one target in the fourth quarter when he got his hand on a pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage.

Following an illustrious college career as the quarterback for Florida under Meyer, Tebow was drafted with the 25th-overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft.

Tebow last appeared in an NFL regular-season game in 2012 with the Jets, for whom he started two games. After his football career flamed out in 2015, he spent the next five years toiling as an outfielder in the Mets’ minor league system.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Legendary Rangers goalie Mike Richter sees a sturdy foundation within his former team, one that will be anchored by a budding netminder in Igor Shesterkin for the next four years.

Finding a dependable goalie to assume the throne between the pipes from Henrik Lundqvist could’ve been a rebuild-derailing bump in the road for the Blueshirts, Richter pointed out, but Shesterkin immediately presented himself as a reliable option from the moment he was called up in January 2020.

If anything, Richter believes that Shesterkin rising to the daunting task of ushering in the post-King Henrik era made him worth the four-year, $22.7 million extension — which was a record for a goalie on a second contract — he signed this past week.

“Shesterkin was good enough to give them the ability to think that it’s OK not to sign Hank,” Richter told The Post on Thursday night at Smashfest, an NHL player-driven fundraising event. “Otherwise, there was nothing coming in his place, you can’t do it. Those guys don’t come along much. So when you have them, hold on to them, and that’s why it was a wise signing.”

Though Shesterkin’s 26-16-3 record with a 2.59 goals-against average and .921 save percentage in 47 NHL games is just a small sample size, Richter noted that the 25-year-old marinated in the Kontinental Hockey League and ultimately established himself as one of the Russian league’s top goalies.

As far as the concerns regarding Shesterkin’s durability, Richter believes it’s just a part of the adjustment period. Despite being sidelined with a few lower-body injuries last season, Shesterkin has evidently been able to gain the trust of Rangers brass.

“He reads the play amazingly and that’s a common denominator with a lot of these great players,” said Richter, who backstopped the Rangers’ historic Stanley Cup win in 1994. “Whether it’s Brian Leetch playing defense, Wayne Gretzky playing offense or a goalie like Shesterkin or Hank, Marty Brodeur was always very good at that. That’s a real asset and he’s got it. He seems to be ahead of the play often. … I think they got a real winner there.”

Shesterkin is somewhat of a microcosm of what the Rangers are as a team right now: a young, inexperienced squad with promising assets that is still finding its footing. After an overhaul in the front office and on the coaching staff in recent months, as well as losing lineup-staple Pavel Buchnevich, Richter acknowledged it may take some time for the team to stabilize.

But with new president and general manager Chris Drury at the helm, Richter expects the Rangers to be focused on the right things.

“For the organization’s sake, you just hope they can move forward, get stability,” he said. “Here is the hard part, you need to be on the ice playing and winning, and that starts to heal wounds. But the sad part is that there’s so much movement nowadays, with players and coaches, that it’s hard to build something and keep it.”

Richter commended Drury for identifying what the team needed and going out and getting it this offseason. Though there still may be more work to be done, Richter said he likes the Rangers’ current “complexion.” But the key, according to the 54-year-old, will be maintaining their style of play when games get tough.

“You have to have the mindset that you can compete with anybody and beat anybody,” Richter said. “The NHL has such a small space between the top team and the worst team that truly you should be able to compete every night. I don’t think they need to be waiting years to do this.

“I don’t think with the goaltending tandem and just the talent that they have that they’ll be out of too many games, you just have to season it. And believe me, it doesn’t matter what I say, what anybody says, it matters what they do on the ice.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@They are the Yankees. Twenty-seven championships. Large payroll. Lots of stars.

They cannot be the underdog because of that history, those dollars, that galaxy. But at the right juncture of the 2021 season, they have found an underdog spirit. Their contributions are coming from the scrap heap and Scranton as much as the top of the roster; in part because they have had a team that might capture the NL East on the injured list.

They won a game Sunday with a pitching tag team of Nestor Cortes Jr. starting and Wandy Peralta closing and a middle of Stephen Ridings, Jonathan Loaisiga and Lucas Luetge. Imagine if told in March that the Yanks would win a critical August game with that quintet.

They won a game Sunday with Rougned Odor and Luke Voit — de-emphasized and out of starting jobs after the trade deadline — providing the biggest blows, two-run homers that opened and completed the Yankees’ scoring.

They won a game Sunday because Andrew Velazquez, inserted as a defensive replacement at short in the ninth, “came flying out of nowhere” in Aaron Boone’s words to turn what could have been a devastating bloop single by Jake Lamb into the only out Luetge recorded. A lot of Yankees heroes come from out of nowhere these days.

The Yankees celebrate their win over the White Sox on Sunday. UPI

They won 5-3 how they often have won of late, by causing their fans agita to the last pitch. But they won. They also do that a lot now. They improved to a major league best-tying (with San Francisco) 23-11 since July 6. That span includes four “can’t believe they lost it” games — two to the Red Sox, one to Astros and Thursday night amid the Iowa corn to the White Sox.

Yet, the Yankees have found an ability to absorb the worst kind of losses and get off the canvas. They came back in Chicago to take the last two from the White Sox. That Field of Nightmares loss was their only one in six games this year against the runaway AL Central leaders. The Yanks have won 10 of 11 series. And they are getting healthier.

Gerrit Cole is scheduled to return from a COVID absence to start Monday against the Angels and Jordan Montgomery to start one of two games Tuesday amid a vital three-game series against Boston. Anthony Rizzo and Gary Sanchez seem close by and maybe Aroldis Chapman and Domingo German, too.

The Yankees are moving nearer to whole, but they should remember the hole they were in; remember that they have climbed out to within 2 ¹/₂ games of both wild cards, Boston and Oakland, by not just relying on names or stars or what is expected to happen.

“We have done a really good job of guys coming up and holding the fort,” Cortes said.

No one has been more surprisingly important than Cortes. He is doing a lefty version of what Aaron Small did out of nowhere for the reeling 2005 Yankees. Cortes is like one of those inflatable air dancers that flutter about at store grand openings. He bends this way and that, changing arm and body angles and speeds — as Voit mentioned touching pretty much every mph between 70-90. In a high-velocity age, Cortes is providing the Yankees’ invaluable innings with a variety of stuff, a herky-jerky delivery and the confidence of a rock star.

The White Sox, deep in righty mashers, were an MLB-best 35-11 the last two years when an opponent starts a lefty. But Cortes delivered career-highs in innings (six), pitches (98) and tied his best with seven strikeouts. All of it was essential with the Yankee bullpen injured, exhausted or in the non-trust zone.

Nestor Cortes AP

The Yanks, meanwhile, produced three second-inning runs and made Chicago starter Lucas Giolito dispense 101 pitches in four innings. But the Yanks also put men in scoring position every inning from the first to eighth and went 0-for-12 with 10 strikeouts. Joey Gallo, a hero Saturday, struck out in all four at-bats with runners in scoring position. From Voit’s one-out single in the third through the eighth, the Yankees went 0-for-18 overall and didn’t add to their lead despite six walks, a White Sox error, a batter reaching first on a strikeout passed ball, two wild pitches and a stolen base.

But Voit hit a two-run homer in the ninth to make it 5-1. These are the 2021 Yanks, though. They cannot just win easily. Luetge was bad, allowing three of four White Sox to reach in the ninth — his only out produced by the Velazquez play. Peralta, who is emerging as the most reliable lefty on a team with Chapman, Zack Britton and the first-half revelation Luetge, induced a game-ending double play with the tying runs on base.

“We are finding out a lot about other people,” Boone said.

The Yankees, of all things, are finding an underdog spirit.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Taijuan Walker deserved better. On most nights, against most teams and most pitchers, he would have gotten better.

But he was facing the defending champion Dodgers, and a starter, Walker Buehler, whom Mets manager Luis Rojas had described as “electric.” So, Walker did not leave Citi Field a winner on Saturday night. No, he left the ballpark just as frustrated as the rest of his teammates, who had lost a second straight 10th-inning game, this one by the score of 2-1.

Walker had deployed a devastating splitter to keep the Dodgers hitless over 6 ¹/₃ innings. For a while, everyone was dreaming the improbable dream. Could Walker become the second Met ever — and the first since Johan Santana in 2012 — to throw a no-hitter?

“Man, he was nasty,” Michael Conforto said.

Nasty enough for Walker to start thinking about his shot at greatness in the fifth inning.

“You see the scoreboard and stuff,” he said. “I wanted to keep going out there doing what I was doing.”

Unlike Santana, Walker was not hired by the Mets to be some historic figure. He arrived in February with a career record of 35-34. He was a good pitcher, not a great one, a veteran who could give you an honest day’s work and a fair-and-square chance to win a ballgame. He made his first All-Star team this year, in his ninth season, and at $23 million over two years, he looked like one of the best signings in the sport.

But Walker had lost his past four decisions, falling from 7-3 to 7-7. In fact, he hadn’t won a game since July 3. His fade was best defined by his bizarre fielding decision against the Pirates last month, when he turned Kevin Newman’s swinging bunt with the bases loaded into a misadventure of epic proportions.

That tragicomedy was not on Walker’s mind Saturday night. On Friday, word came down that his teammate, Jacob deGrom, would be shut down for at least another two weeks. DeGrom hasn’t pitched since July 7, and it’s conceivable he won’t pitch again in the regular season.

Walker knew his team needed not just an emotional lift, but a physical one, too. The Mets had lost a tough one Friday, and the Phillies and Braves both won Saturday, securing their shared claim to first place. Walker knew he had to be the Walker of the first three months of the season, and not the diminished starter he’d been for the better part of six weeks.

“Yeah, we’ve got to step up every single start now,” he said. “It’s tough hearing that [deGrom] news, just in the clubhouse and everywhere. But we’ve got to do our job and go out there and try to go deep into games and just pick him up while he recovers. And I hope he comes back soon.”

He responded with a vengeance, too, in front of the biggest Citi Field crowd of the year. The Dodgers kept swinging over that splitter, and people everywhere who care about the Mets kept thinking that maybe, just maybe, this night would be one for the books.

Walker engaged his former teammate, Billy McKinney, in a spirited battle to open the sixth, with the Mets holding a 1-0 lead on Conforto’s homer in the fourth. The count was 2-2 when McKinney fouled off four straight pitches (two splitters and two four-seamers) and inspired the Mets’ starter and his catcher, Tomas Nido, to give him a different look. Walker ripped off a back-door slider, and McKinney didn’t have a prayer.

After Walker walked Walker Buehler (say that quickly five times), he got Trea Turner to bounce into a double play. Nine outs out to go. Max Muncy lifted a harmless fly to open the seventh. Eight outs to go. Will Smith stepped in, just as he had in the 10th the previous night, right before he sent a Jeurys Familia sinker sailing over the left-field wall.

The Dodgers catcher took the first pitch, a fastball for a strike. He didn’t take the second pitch. “Just a bad slider,” Walker said. Smith crushed it 444 feet to left center, and that was that. The no-hitter and the shutout were going, going, gone.

Of course, Walker was a bit deflated. What human being in that situation wouldn’t be? He surrendered a hard double to Corey Seager, buckled down to beat AJ Pollock for his eighth and final strikeout, then walked Chris Taylor before Rojas came out to get him.

Walker headed for the dugout to a loud ovation. The fans were acknowledging the obvious in a world without a healthy deGrom:

If the Mets are to stay in this NL East race, Walker must keep pitching as he did on a lost Saturday night that could have been remembered forever.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The game meant more for the undrafted free agents and journeymen desperate to either realize their childhood NFL dream or cling to it yet again.

But when you are the second-overall pick of the NFL draft, when you are the Chosen One for a franchise that has chosen you to take flight on opening day on Woody Johnson’s Jets following a decade of being grounded, the game meant everything to you, and to your franchise, and to Jets fans, because all of them do, and will, from here to eternity, or to the next rookie franchise quarterback.

So this was the first step for Zach Wilson, a baby step in the preseason opener against the Giants, because you crawl before you walk, and you walk before you run, and he must be able to run on Sept. 12 on the road against Sam Darnold and the Panthers.

Head coach Robert Saleh and Wilson’s teammates can talk about his it factor in training camp practices, but you don’t sign off on it until you see it in the games. These preseason games are hardly a fail-safe barometer, but at the very least they can whet the appetite of a championship-starved fan base.

Earlier on Saturday, Justin Fields sure had whet the appetite of Bears fans still scarred over the ill-fated Mitch Trubisky Era with a convincing case for the opening day job over Andy Dalton. Trey Lance lit it up on Saturday night, too. The Jets, of course, preferred Wilson over Fields and Lance, for whatever that is worth at this moment in their nascent NFL careers: LNPTICY (Let’s Not Put Them In Canton Yet).

It turned out to be a good first baby step for Zach Wilson (6-for-9, 63 yards) … no electric wow moments in his two series against the Big Blue reserves, but more importantly, no deer-in-the-headlights moments, and no ghosts, and no turnovers and, most importantly, no injury.

“It was a great experience,” Wilson said after a 12-7 Jets win.

He showed an understanding of what was expected of him, seemed in command of the huddle, didn’t make any shake-your-head decisions … and if he didn’t have the arm talent, he wouldn’t have been the first quarterback selected after Trevor Lawrence.

The off-platform throws that will titillate Jets fans will come, but first things first. Wilson stood in there nicely as a pocket quarterback, displayed that quick release, and a ball that comes out of his hand smoothly and naturally.

There wasn’t a place the target would have been than MetLife Stadium. “This is awesome,” Wilson thought to himself. “I get to play football for a living.”

Saleh and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur got Wilson comfortable immediately by having him roll right and fire a bullet to Corey Davis for nine yards. You saw Wilson’s arm strength and accuracy on a throw across the field to the left sideline to Davis for nine more yards to position the field goal. “A great call by Coach LaFleur,” Wilson said.

He and Davis walked through the locker room door painted “ALL GAS NO BRAKE” together after the game. “That connection’s gonna keep growing,” Wilson said.

The first-string offensive line gave Wilson plenty of comfort on a 16-yard missile over the middle for Keelan Cole. “It starts up front with those guys,” Wilson said.

He followed with a 12-yard slant to Vyncint Smith; a first-down slant for Jamison Crowder that was nullified by a Cole interference; a 13-yarder to Tyler Kroft 1 yard short of the sticks on 3rd-and-14.

“He looked comfortable, especially on third down. … It was a good first day,” Saleh said.

There were plenty of green No. 2 jerseys in the stands, and a good deal of green No. 14 Sam Darnold jerseys, even though Darnold is gone and this was a Giants home game.

In the summer of 2018, this was Darnold (13-for 18, 96 yards, one TD) following his first preseason action against the Falcons:

“I felt pretty good. I put the ball where it needed to be and tried to get it in the hands of our playmakers. There were a couple of plays, especially on the sack, I felt like I could’ve gotten the ball out there. But, you know, live and learn, I guess.”

Darnold became the opening night starter. Wilson is on that Darnold track. The baby started his walk, and he did not fall.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Blue Jays didn’t play in a cornfield, but they did play the bulk of their season in Dunedin, Fla., and Buffalo.

The return to Toronto hasn’t lifted them from their troubling pattern of inconsistency. Every time the Jays look like they’re going to make a run, they don’t. The lineup is there.

The pitching is in place. Are you going to get serious or what? Steven Matz (9-7, 4.28 ERA) pitches in Seattle on Sunday. Matz went through a rough patch but has limited opponents to two runs over his past 10 ²/₃ innings.

Mariners counter with Logan Gilbert (5-3, 4.05) who has surrendered nine runs over his past 16 ²/₃. Play 20 units on the Jays.

Played two sick dogs. Both lay down and played dead. Bosox 16, Orioles 2. Chris Sale was solid in his return but didn’t have to be. George Lopez (seven runs, 3 ¹/₃ innings) was hilarious.

In Saturday’s Post, we looked at five teams to bet against in the 2021 college football season. Here’s the other side of that coin: five teams that figure to be worth a wager this fall.

Boston College

The Eagles should make significant strides in Year 2 of their makeover to a pass-oriented offense under former Ohio State assistant Jeff Hafley. Before he arrived, 59 percent of BC’s total yards came on the ground in 2019, compared with just 26 percent last year. Former Notre Dame signee Phil Jurkovec had a solid first season as the starting quarterback and throws to a talented corps of pass catchers led by first-team All-ACC selection Zay Flowers, who totaled 56 receptions for 892 yards and nine touchdowns in 2020.

Utah

Wagering your hard-earned, pretax dollars on Kyle Whittingham’s Utah Utes has proven a wise investment in recent years. In fact, over the past seven seasons, the Utes are 51-33-1 ATS for a winning mark of 61 percent, a return on investment of more than 15 percent. Some are reporting an August quarterback competition in Salt Lake City, but I would be shocked if Baylor grad transfer Charlie Brewer is not under center when the curtain opens in September. Brewer was hindered by a shaky Baylor offensive line that allowed 146 sacks in his four seasons in Waco, Texas, but he still threw for more than 9,500 yards during his Big 12 career.

Nevada

The Wolf Pack can make a little noise on the national scene out of the gate with September road games against Power 5 schools Cal and Kansas State. The Wolf Pack arguably have the Mountain West’s top offense engineered by the conference’s returning offensive player of the year, Carson Strong, who has thrown for almost 5,200 yards in two seasons in Reno. Romeo Doubs and Elijah Cooks are terrific receivers in any league. Nevada is my dark-horse candidate to win the MWC title.

UTSA

The Roadrunners of Conference USA might return the most experience of any FBS team. Texas-San Antonio welcomes back its top 14 tacklers, top four quarterbacks, top six running backs and six of its top seven pass-catchers from 2020. In fact, the Roadrunners claim 71 returning lettermen and 21 of a possible 22 returning starters. September trips to Illinois and Memphis provide UTSA with a pair of prime opportunities to enhance its national reputation.

Liberty

In just its fourth FBS season, Liberty is playing an exciting and winning brand of football under former Mississippi coach Hugh Freeze. The Flames averaged 38.2 ppg last year and feature a potential NFL first-rounder at quarterback in dual-threat Malik Willis, who threw for 2,260 yards and ran for 944 in 2020. Liberty plays one of the nation’s easiest schedules and has covered 13 of its past 16 games. The Flames’ most challenging games do not come until November when they travel to Mississippi and host Louisiana and Army.

The Cardinals are looking to get within shouting distance in the NL playoff picture and turn to J.A. Happ to give the team a good start Sunday at Kansas City.

In two starts since being traded from the Twins to the Cardinals, Happ is 1-1, giving up three runs across 11 innings, but his struggles giving up the deep ball have continued with surrendering a home run in each start.

Dating to his time with the Twins, Happ has a 7.89 ERA across his last 16 starts with 21 home runs allowed, and opponents are hitting .333 off him.

The Royals send Kris Bubic to the mound, who has done his best work at home with a 3.06 ERA and three home runs allowed in 10 pitching appearances across 47 innings while registering a 6.10 ERA on the road with 14 home runs in 38 ¹/₃ innings surrendered.

The Royals entered the weekend fourth in the AL in home batting average at .259, and the Cardinals’ 3.7 runs per game since the start of June are the fewest in the NL. The Cards’ ascent in the playoff standings will not continue Sunday.

The play: Royals, -105.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rams and Chargers fans commemorated their return to SoFi Stadium with a massive brawl on Saturday.

A viral video showed a male Rams fan in an Aaron Donald jersey being pummeled by at least four others in the stands of the stadium shared by the two Los Angeles teams.

The melee, which left the fan in the Donald jersey bloodied, lasted nearly a minute.

The beginning of the video showed the fan in the Donald jersey arguing with another Rams fan. An unidentified woman in the back then threw beer on the fan in the Donald jersey, leading him to throw what appeared to be the first punch.

It’s unclear what exactly sparked the altercation and whether there were any arrests.

The Week 1 preseason game, which the Chargers won 13-6, marked the return of NFL fans amid the pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Phil Simms had a simple reason for venturing out to Jets practice last week.

“Cause I’m nosy,” the Giants legendary quarterback said.

Simms made the trip to Florham Park last Thursday along with his son, Chris, to watch Zach Wilson and the Jets practice and came away impressed with Wilson and how much the Jets defense challenged him.

“I thought it was truly game-like,” Simms said on Sunday. “They were all over it. The defense was really playing well. Every throw he made was into tight windows. I’m not going to say it was a very good, plus practice. It was a training camp practice that was really hard on the quarterback. He made some unbelievable throws that should have been caught. There was a lot of good and some bad but you need that in training camp.”

Simms was particularly impressed with Wilson’s throws on the move.

“When he moves to throw, he’s tremendous,” Simms said. “I just went, ‘Damn, if I was him, I’d move every play.’ He seems like he doesn’t miss when he is on the move.”

Like many people, Simms had been following the reports on Wilson’s practices and hearing some of the hand-wringing over practices that featured a lot of interceptions. Simms said practice statistics should be made illegal and he liked what Wilson said last week about trying things in practice and that being the place where he is supposed to make mistakes.

“Throwing interceptions in practice sometimes is a good thing,” Simms said. “You have to find the boundaries. You can be Charlie Checkdown and everyone will say you’re doing a good job and taking care of the ball, but you score no points. You have to take chances. You learn. I went through a whole training camp in 1986 where in seven-on-seven, in our scrimmage and in our team drills, I didn’t throw one interception. We play Dallas in the opening game and I took care of that real quick.”

Simms bounced back from that interception and the loss to the Cowboys to lead the Giants to their first Lombardi Trophy that year. He knows what it is like to be a highly scrutinized quarterback in New York. He lived it for 15 years with the Giants.

Wilson is now experiencing it for the first time, with every pass getting dissected. In his preseason debut on Saturday night against the Giants, Wilson went 6 of 9 for 63 yards and led the Jets to a field goal on one of his two drives. Simms was at the game and liked what he saw from Wilson.

“I thought Zach Wilson was very good, very good. Not just good, very good,” Simms said. “He showed great poise. He threw the football with power. He made some really good throws and stayed in the pocket. He did his job. There were a couple of the incompletions where he was too fast on the play. I’m sure he’s saying let’s catch the ball and get rid of it. He knew then and knows now I can take my time there. During the season, he won’t miss that throw.”

While Simms is a believer in Wilson and has been since before the NFL draft, he believes Wilson has the toughest circumstances of any of the first-round quarterbacks.

“I will say this of all the situations for the rookie quarterbacks, I would say he’s going into the hardest,” Simms said. “I think he has the hardest circumstances. The youth of the team, the division, the schedule, a new coach, everything you want to put into it. I think it’s the toughest one. I don’t think there will be much pressure on Trevor Lawrence. It’s Jacksonville, no one pays attention. I think the circumstances are more favorable for Trevor Lawrence to play better than Zach Wilson. That’s my thought right now. It could change.”
