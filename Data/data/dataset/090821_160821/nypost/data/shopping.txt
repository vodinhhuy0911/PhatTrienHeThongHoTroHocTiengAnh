After almost two years of Zoom school, it may finally be time to brush up on your bag lunch game with a bento box.

To get the kids excited for school again — while also making sure they stay as safe as possible — lunchtime can be a game-changer. Packing your kiddos a fun lunchbox can not only get them to eat their fruits and veggies but also help to avoid the crowded cafeteria lines and touching communal trays and keypads when getting a school lunch.

If you haven’t heard of them, bento boxes are a Japanese solution to a boring lunch — “bento” meaning a single portion of something. The lunch boxes are divided into different compartments, keeping food from touching or spilling over, which can be a picky kid’s worst nightmare. Plus, the box is great for portioning out your child’s meal, making sure they get enough nutrients during the school day.

While bento boxes have been around for quite a while in Asia and beyond, they have skyrocketed in popularity, thanks to TikTok, where parents show off just how cute they can package them. Many of the videos feature other fun gadgets, like food picks with stars and characters, rice ball makers for a perfect bite of rice every time and colorful cupcake liners to serve as additional separation inside the box.

While you don’t have to go as all-out as Jessica Woo from the above video, taking the time to cut cute shapes and write sweet notes to your kids may give them the boost they need to get back into the swing of things this school year — especially if they’ve been home since spring 2020.

To get you started on the bento box craze, read below for the best bento boxes as well as food picks, liners and other accessories to make a boring bag lunch a thing of the past.

Amazon

Be it a hot lunch or a cold sandwich, this bento box can do it all.

The OmieBox brand is beloved by TikTok moms and so we wanted to share. Sold on Amazon, the bento box comes with three different compartments and an ice pack to keep fruit and veggies chilled and a thermos compartment to keep soups, noodles and more nice and warm.

You can bet that your kids will love opening their Bentgo boxes to see what surprises you packed for them.

The five-compartment bento lunch box is the perfect size for your kids, with a large area for the main dish and four smaller ones for fruits, veggies, chips and a little sweet, too. The box comes in a variety of adorable patterns as well, including a space theme seen above, unicorns, llamas, sports and more.

Walmart

This bento box comes with a bento bag, too.

This all-in-one set makes packing their school lunch a breeze. First, separate and pack their lunch into the three stackable compartments, keeping food fresh and secure. Top that off with the included silverware and the lid, and place the whole thing into the tote bag, matching whichever color of bento you choose.

Walmart

All eyes in the cafeteria will be on your child’s lunch when they see just how cute it is.

These food picks add the funniest flair to your bento box meals, while also serving as skewers to grab onto slippery grapes or messy veggies. Simply push the picks into your kid’s favorite foods and watch your bento come to life — just be sure to remove the picks before digging in.

Amazon

Turn lunchtime into a zoo adventure with these animal-themed food picks.

The set of 66 skewers is sold on Amazon for just over $10, but the smile on your kid’s face when they open their lunch will be priceless. The picks come in a variety of colors and shapes, featuring frogs, pandas and giraffes as well as flowers, stars and even eyeballs to bring your bento box to life.

Monbento

There’s nothing silly about wanting the most fun lunch for your child.

These Silifriends molds from Monbento are super versatile, as you can mold rice into them for a sushi surprise, freeze fruit for a smoothie bite or even bake tasty treats right into the mold for a pig-shaped cake or fox-shaped muffin bite. The molds are both freezer- and oven-safe, as well as dishwasher-safe for easy cleanup.

SHEIN

Get in on the rice ball trend and shake up their school lunch all at the same time.

This rice ball shaker mold is one of the easiest, mess-free ways to make rice balls for your child’s lunch. All you need to do is add the rice into the three compartments and shake, watching the rice form perfectly uniform balls before your eyes. Add them to a sushi box or decorate with picks or seaweed for a fun and easy-to-eat lunch.

Amazon

If you have a picky eater on your hands, try these fruit and veggie cutters.

Disguise fruits and veggies as adorable animals and shapes with this set of produce cutters. Simply punch through any food to create mini shapes to pack into your bento box and encourage healthy eating in a fun way. Who said you can’t play with your food — especially if it helps them eat right?

Amazon

Cupcake liners aren’t just for dessert anymore.

Divide your bento box even more with the addition of silicone liners. This package comes with super fun shapes, including hearts, stars and roses that you can easily fill with small fruits, cut-up veggies or even a handful of candies if they were well-behaved that day.

Rule your school this Fall with the smartest tech deals guaranteed to ensure you are a class act!

Even if you aren’t a student heading back to school, ’tis the season to splurge on some necessities and upgrade your tech, including tablets for your commute, microphones for your work-from-home setup and staple electronics, including laptops, monitors and printers.

Of course, tech isn’t the only back-to-school category to add to your shopping list. We put together a guide of the best backpacks, dorm essentials and apparel and shoes that are trending on TikTok (the gold standard for this year’s back-to-school season).

Get schooled on the 23 best deals we’ve found to help to propel you to the head of the class below because saving money is always the right answer.

Laptops

The Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop is a more affordable portable option, is notebook-slim and is Alexa-compatible on its PC build. Plus, you’ll save a little more than $50 off for its back-to-school deal.

When MacBooks go on sale, you run.

I’ve had my Macbook Air for five years now and it’s still going strong. It’s wonderful to toss in your backpack, too.

If you’re looking for a new PC to buy, HP’s Laptop 15t-dw300 is part of HP’s wonderful back-to-school sale happening now. Its Fast Charge Technology and customizable, sleek colors are a wonderful addition, too.

As one of the slimmest on the market, Lenovo’s Chromebook Flex is a quality laptop that’s currently on sale for $100 off. And, the 2-in-1 laptop features a keyboard and a touchscreen for productive study sessions.

For less than $400, you can’t go wrong with ASUS’ VivoBook Laptop. As its name suggests, it’s thin and light and compatible with Google Classroom for the new school year.

Tablets

With so many tablets available to shop, snagging one for less than $100 is a steal. Amazon’s Fire HD 10 Tablet is discounted now, featuring access to Spotify, YouTube, Netflix and more.

Although I’ve graduated from college, I am still in awe of the beautiful notes you can create with a tablet and a smartpen. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab allows you to do exactly that and more. With $80 off, it’s one to purchase.

An iPad for just shy of $300? Yes, please. Classic and built to last, Apple’s 2020 iPad is great for an extra study screen or reading on your work commute.

Pritom’s Android 10″ Tablet delivers vivid graphics, a trustworthy battery and a sleek composure for study needs and more.

Headphones

I’m not a big over-the-ear headphone person, but Omen by HP’s Mindframe Prime Headset is a sleek look that seems great for listening to music while taking notes.

Everyone boasts about Apple’s AirPods for listening to podcasts and going on the treadmill, but they’re equally as great for school. From listening to classical study music after class to playing your favorite playlist during gym class, they’re a staple to steal during its sale.

Beats are known for their high-grade performance and comfortable wear, and its Solo3 pair is no different. The sleek headband is a plus, too.

Bose’s QuietComfort 35 Wireless Headphones II are more of a premier-grade set, but are perfect if you’re video editing, working on projects or simply want a quality pair for use outside of class.

If you’re not particularly keen on over-the-ear headphones, Beats’ all-new Studio Noise-Cancelling Ear Buds are comfortable, deliver quality sound and come with a space-saving carrying case.

Printers

As one of your desk’s staples, the HP OfficeJet Pro All-in-One Printer is built to last. Plus, you won’t have to worry about purchasing ink for your entire school year (and then some)!

More affordable than HP’s OfficeJet is its DeskJet All-in-One Printer. If you love the clean look of white printers, you’ll also enjoy half a year’s worth of free ink.

Not your traditional printer per se, but Kodak’s Dock Plus Portable Instant Photo Printer is one of that lesser-thought-about tech that you’ll constantly use. From capturing college memories to developing photos on a pinch for frames, it’s one to shop for.

Desk Essentials

I’ve had Elgato’s Wave 3 USB Microphone for more than a year now, and it’s changed the school-from-home game for me. With an onslaught of Zoom meetings, it’s great for conferencing for class and recording for projects.

My desk is situated behind a window, which means I have horrible glares during video chats. For less than $20, I rode myself of that issue and feel like I’m in a studio for my 30-minute work meetings with this clip-on ring light.

It’s USB-compatible, so make sure you have the proper plug and are careful with the thin wire.

This desk cell phone holder is propped at the corner of my desk and hasn’t moved for three years. It’s unbeatable for checking the time during work breaks and is a problem-solver for FaceTime calls (no more “propping” someone up).

Some people prefer a mouse, and that’s okay. HP has a modern-looking one for less than $15 in honor of the back-to-school season.

I’m not all too techy, but a USB-C hub saved my life. Here’s why: I can plug in my ring light, phone charger, USB microphone and more with this nifty tool that hangs behind my desk. Yeah, it’s that good.

I’ve been seeing these click-clack keyboards all over TikTok, and they’re just too cute. I mean, c’mon, you feel like you’re in a ’60s show and feel like you’re more productive. Plus, it’s practical to have a keyboard, anyway.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He’s “Wild N’ Out” with a bunch of women — and here’s why.

For Nick Cannon, having multiple babies with multiple girlfriends is the father of seven’s way of rebelling against the “Eurocentric” institution of marriage.

“That’s a Eurocentric concept … the idea that you’re supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life,” Cannon, 40, explained Monday on Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club.”

“The idea that a man should have one woman,” the host of “The Masked Singer” continued. “We shouldn’t have anything. I have no ownership over this person.”

Cannon — who welcomed his seventh child, the fourth within a year’s time, in June — said that fathering so many kids is not a decision he gets to make.

Cannon with the 10-year-old twins, Monroe (left) and Moroccan, he has with pop diva Mariah Carey. FilmMagic

“Those women, and all women, are the ones that open themselves up and say, ‘I would like to allow this man into my world and I will birth this child,’ ” the California native insisted. “It ain’t my decision. I’m just following suit.”

The former Nickelodeon star welcomed 10-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with ex-wife and megastar Mariah Carey, 51, in 2011.

Cannon and Bell with their kids on Christmas 2020. Instagram

He has two children — son Golden, 4, and 8-month-old daughter Powerful Queen Cannon — with Miss Guam 2014 pageant winner Brittany Bell, 33.

On June 14, Cannon welcomed twin boys Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir with DJ Abby De La Rosa, 29.

Then, just nine days later, on June 23, he became the father of his fifth son, Zen, with model Alyssa Scott.

And now, Cannon says his aversion to monogamy is rooted in the European history of marriage.

“If we’re really talking about how we co-exist and how we populate, it’s about what exchange can we create together,” he said.

“I understand the institution of marriage, but if we go back to what that was about … [it] was to classify property,” he added, referring to the dowry system — the practice of trading a woman into marriage in exchange for money or property that was popularized in England between the 12th and 18th centuries.

The “Wild N’ Out” star said he doesn’t want “ownership” of any of the mothers of his children. The Breakfast Club

“One father gave another man his daughter for land,” Cannon said. “So when you really get to that concept, it’s like, we gotta change this up.”

Thus, his parade of paramours prevails.

“I don’t want ownership over anybody,” the “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” star said. “I don’t have ownership over any of the mothers. We create families in the sense that we created a beautiful entity.”

But it’s unclear whether the leading ladies of his love life are happy about Cannon’s staunch commitment to non-commitment.

“Every woman in my life that I deal with or [have] dealt with … they know how I feel,” he said.

“And it usually is a concept like, I’m not going around like, ‘Who am I gonna impregnate next?’ Nah,” Cannon continued.

“When you really look at how the family infrastructure is designed, the woman is the one that always leads and makes decisions,” he said.

Bell with her and Cannon’s son, Golden, at the park. Instagram

“Everyone is like, ‘How is he convincing these women?’ … But I’m not. I’m the one in the scenario who has to follow suit on what they decide.”

Cannon, who admittedly grew up in an “unorthodox” home in which both of his parents were absent at times, said he’s extremely active in all of his children’s lives.

“For every single one of my kids, I’m at every basketball game, I’m at every martial arts practice,” he said.

“People don’t understand how I do it, but my children are my priority.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For someone who prides himself on optics, Barack Obama just gave us quite an ugly spectacle.

As the rest of America struggles with uncertain employment status and school reopenings, shifting mask mandates, anxiety over vaccinations and variants, the health of the economy and the citizenry at large, Obama had to go and throw himself a huge, epic, three-day birthday bash on Martha’s Vineyard.

You would think a former president — one who clearly considers himself more intelligent and sensitive than most — would exercise some restraint.

Or at least understand that this was a supremely bad look.

Here were a host of left-leaning eco-warrior celebs, all Obama’s “close friends,” of course, descending on an already understaffed and emotionally depleted Vineyard.

“His birthday party is insane,” one of Obama’s caterers told The Post last week. “What is he thinking?”

Clearly, Obama thought to do whatever he damn well pleased — even after such backlash caused him to effectively cancel his party.

“This outdoor event was planned months ago in accordance with all public health guidelines and with COVID safeguards in place,” Obama spokesperson Hannah Hankins told the press last week. “Due to the new spread of the delta variant over the past week, the President and Mrs. Obama have decided to significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends.”

That, we now know, was a lie.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests, all free to go unmasked, while their 200 servers were reportedly forced to mask up. The tiny island’s residents, meanwhile, endured “a s—t-show” of traffic and sudden road closures enforced by the Secret Service.

Is there a more disgusting display of elitist “Rules for thee, not for me” than this?

Famously close friend David Axelrod — who sat for a hagiographic, three-part HBO Obama doc that premiered last week, who just called Obama an “apostle of hope” in the Washington Post, and the adviser most responsible for getting Obama elected in the first place — was, according to the New York Times, cut from the guest list.

Yes, David Axelrod was uninvited at the last minute so “close friends” such as H.E.R., former “Real Housewife of Atlanta” Kim Fields, Bradley Cooper and Stephen Colbert — to name but a few — could attend.

That is some cold stuff.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests for the birthday bash. Instagram

The uninvited, according to the Times, were “abruptly cut.” It tells you just where the Obamas’ post-presidential priorities are: Hollywood, podcasts, Netflix deals, and socializing with celebrities.

Musician H.E.R. was one of the guests at former President Barack Obama’s 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard. Instagram

There’s not much daylight here between the Obamas and the Markles. Who would have thought?

Consider that Jackie O, the most famous woman of her era, lived a very low-profile life on the Vineyard. Sure, she had an estate, but she did not move about ostentatiously.

Throw a lavish party filled with hundreds of A-listers while America remained gripped by a pandemic?

Jackie would never.

Barack, however, was playing 18 holes with Don Cheadle and getting serenaded by Alicia Keys. He was working it out on the dance floor with Erykah Badu while his guests drank top-shelf liquor and smoked cigars and dined from a menu curated by Questlove.

And the mainstream media cheers this on!

“Even Scaled Back, Barack Obama’s Birthday Bash is the Event of the Season,” said Vanity Fair.

The Obamas’ 200 servers were reportedly forced to mask up. Maciel-Ngre-GLH / BACKGRID

“Danced All Night,” People mag said of Obama. “He Never Stopped Smiling.”

No wonder the vaccine is still politicized. No wonder there remains two Americas, despite Obama’s constant, self-aggrandizing promises to unite us.

On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci went on “Meet the Press” to warn that the Sturgis, SD, motorcycle rally (code for “MAGA crowd”) might be a superspreader event.

Then on Monday, a New York Times reporter went on CNN and quoted a Vineyard resident as saying the Obamas were fine because they invited “a sophisticated, vaccinated crowd.”

Nancy Pelosi said she didn’t go to former President Barack Obama’s birthday because she had “other parties” to go to. Maciel-Ngre-GLH / BACKGRID

That says it all. Even Twitter erupted.

“Of course viruses don’t attack sophisticated people, Muffy!” said one.

Perhaps Obama should have winnowed his list down to his close campaign strategists and loyal staffers — those who, according to the Times, were heartbroken to be thrown over for the likes of Chrissy Teigen, famous for little more than her marriage and her cyber-bullying.

These longtime loyalists, the Times said, “generally credit themselves with helping create the Obama legacy that has allowed the former president to settle in so comfortably with the A-list crowd” and all of them had “been looking forward to the reunion after an isolated year.”

Let them eat cake, indeed.

Machine Gun Kelly and Travis Barker are blood buddies.

The two inked-up rockers announced a second joint album on Monday, revealing their forthcoming music with matching tattoos.

“We’re back for round two,” MGK, whose real name is Colson Baker, captioned a video showing the forearm tats on Instagram. The design reads “Born With Horns,” the name of the LP.

“Born With Horns” will be Kelly’s sixth studio album, following 2020’s “Tickets to My Downfall,” which was also produced by Barker.

The blond rocker loves to mark his music on his body; he has “Tickets to My Downfall” tattooed on his neck, as well as tributes to his favorite performers including the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kurt Cobain, Tommy Lee and more.

Barker, 45, is so covered in ink that he has begun layering up, placing his newest tat on top of many others on his arm. The Blink-182 drummer has been adding designs dedicated to girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian as of late, even letting his boo tattoo “I love you” on his arm.

He also got the words “Don’t trust anyone” added to his neck, potentially referencing ex-wife Shanna Moakler, who has been vocal about her dislike of Kardashian.

MGK, 30, may have similarly celebrated his most recent relationship with permanent ink, with girlfriend Megan Fox making a cameo on his track “Banyan Tree (Interlude).”

“You just got my initials tattooed on you. I just got your nickname tattooed on me,” Fox can be heard saying in the recording, hinting at the couple’s coordinating tats.

The 35-year-old actress proudly showed off her “el pistolero” tattoo — Spanish for “the gunman,” a reference to her beau’s stage name — in November 2020.

Perhaps Kardashian will be next to get inked?

For more than a decade, nearly every season of “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” has ended in the same, sparkly way: with a Neil Lane engagement ring.

But believe it or not, the Brooklyn-bred jeweler almost turned down the opportunity to serve as the franchise’s go-to diamond pro years ago.

“I don’t really watch TV,” Lane admitted to Page Six Style, adding that he was approached by ABC several times before finally signing on in the late 2000s.

“I’d heard about ‘The Bachelor,’ but I didn’t really understand what it was. Then I got involved with the show and I understood it, it made sense,” he continued. “It didn’t seem real at first, but people were falling in love!”

And Lane plays a key role in these romances, showing up with a briefcase full of bling from which “Bachelors” (and “Bachelorette” suitors) can select at the end of each season. Often, these sit-downs — which the jeweler told us last “hours,” despite only a few minutes actually making it to air — turn into impromptu therapy sessions.

“When I’m dealing with these guys, it’s the most emotional thing in their lives,” Lane explained. “They’re about to propose to someone — their princess, their dream girl, the love of their life. They’re the most vulnerable. And they’re looking to me for direction; most of them have never looked at rings before.”

Now, fans of Lane’s work have the chance to score a similar sit-down, thanks to the gem master’s first-ever hotel partnership with Fairmont Hotels & Resorts.

The first 10 couples to book the new “Fairmont Weddings, by Neil Lane” package will receive a private one-on-one virtual consultation with the jeweler; the package also includes a consultation with a Fairmont wedding planner to personalize nuptials according to one of Lane’s six signature styles: romantic, lavish, modern, elegant, rustic and vintage.

Don’t expect Lane to get into wedding planning himself anytime soon. “That’s not my skill set — that’s Fairmont’s,” he told us. “They’ve been doing this a hundred years. They know how to make sure the roast beef isn’t overcooked. I bring stardust. I bring an aesthetic.” Neil Lane

“Partnering with someone with a historical background, it was the perfect marriage,” Lane said. “Like the Plaza, that’s a Fairmont hotel. Think of all the weddings and black-tie events, the Truman Capote [balls] … there’s so much historical reference there. And I like history!”

Indeed, Lane is famous for his old-world aesthetic, which he cultivated by moving to Paris post-college and collecting vintage jewels. But that look wasn’t exactly in vogue when he first set up shop in Los Angeles in the ’80s with his “little bag of jewelry.”

“Hollywood in the late ’80s and ’90s wasn’t the Hollywood it is today,” he clarified. “It was kind of sleepy.”

Three of Neil Lane’s “golden girls” include Renée Zellweger (pictured at the 2001 Golden Globes), Charlize Theron (at the 2004 Globes) and Jennifer Hudson (at the 2007 Oscars). Newsmakers; Getty Images; WireImage

By the early 2000s, however, then-up-and-coming actresses like Renée Zellweger, Charlize Theron and Jennifer Hudson were stopping by to borrow jewels for red carpets and awards shows.

“So many people won their first Golden Globe [wearing] Neil Lane,” Lane recalled.

The jeweler also began creating one-of-a-kind engagement rings for the likes of Madonna, Reese Witherspoon and Portia de Rossi. It wasn’t long before ABC came calling — and to hear Lane tell it, “the rest is history.”

While Lane can’t share details of current “Bachelorette” Katie Thurston‘s ring — if she winds up with one at all — he told us he takes six sparklers to the set each season, and that he “[tries] to bring something new” every time.

“How do I change it up every time? How do I bring different details? I think some of them I make bigger diamonds in the center, sometimes I put more decoration,” he mused. “I’ve added more vintage aesthetics. Sometimes I make it completely modern.”

Of course, some of those multi-carat creations wind up getting returned when “Bachelor” couples break up, per the production’s rules. But Lane said he’s able to separate his handiwork from these high-profile relationships when things go south.

“When I’m making rings — for a couple in my shop or for ‘The Bachelor’ — I’m making them with the idea that they’re going to stay together. I’m meeting people at their most loving moments … I’m in that place with them. And then when they leave, I’m not part of that journey,” he explained.

“I’ve done my best — I’ve sprinkled them with stardust, sprinkled them with love.”

Lila Grace Moss is following in her famous mom’s fashionable footsteps.

The 18-year-old daughter of style icon Kate Moss stepped out in Ibiza for dinner with friends over the weekend, looking like the spitting image of her mother in a short, silky blush slip dress.

With her straight blond locks and dewy, fresh-faced glow, Lila looked just like Kate in her ’90s heyday; bias-cut slip dresses have always been an on- and off-duty style staple for the supermodel.

The 47-year-old catwalker even wore a version by John Galliano when she married Jamie Hince in 2011.

Kate shares Lila with Dazed magazine co-founder Jefferson Hack. She and Hince split in 2015, and she began dating current partner Nikolai von Bismarck that same year.

Lila’s well on her way to becoming a fashion force to be reckoned with; in 2018, she made her modeling debut as the face of Marc Jacobs Beauty. Two years later, she hit the runway for the first time at Paris Fashion Week, opening and closing Miu Miu’s Spring 2020 show.

And in January, Kate and Lila walked the Fendi Couture catwalk together.

Lila — who’s also covered Vogue’s Paris, Japan and Italian editions thus far — is represented by the Kate Moss Agency, the modeling firm her mother founded in 2016.

“There she is, Miss America…”

The 2017 titleholder Savvy Shields shared with The Post her favorite beauty and makeup essentials she wouldn’t leave her throne without during her nationwide reign.

“Sometimes, with stage makeup, people think they need to not look like themselves but in reality, the best stage makeup enhances what you already look like,” Shields, 26, said. “Don’t feel like you have to go darker or with a heavier contour to alter your face, because just warming up your blush tones or going with a deeper link will do the trick.”

And though “beauty pageant” is the traditional phrasing for the annual event, Miss America has evolved into more than just coral-toned blushes and layers of long lashes.

“I’m a collection of everyone I’ve ever met, and it truly expanded who I was,” Shields explains. Her pageantry experience, beginning when she was Miss Arkansas’ Outstanding Teen at 13-years-old, to securing the Miss Arkansas and then culminating in donning the coveted Miss America crown, was eventful — to say the least.

“I presented at the Billboard Music Awards and was on the Red Carpet with Selena Gomez and other people I looked up to,” she said. “I spent Thanksgiving with our troops overseas and traveled to Egypt, Germany and Iceland.”

And, one of her most nostalgic memories from the road: the Auntie Anne’s pretzels in the Charlotte airport, which she said were “the absolute best.”

What’s more, Shields was actively involved with Children’s Miracle Network across the U.S., Miss America’s national sponsor at the time. “It was hands down the best part of my experience,” she said. “I was reminded that these kids have no idea what their future holds, but they’re the wisest, empathetic, strong and courageous humans I’ve ever met, and it was one of the most humbling experiences ever, to see the joy radiating from their faces.”

More recently, Miss America has completely revamped its competition into Miss America 2.0, in which candidates are no longer walking in swimsuits and are expected to focus on charity, giving keynote speeches about their community service initiative instead of prancing on stage half-naked.

“I prepped for about two years before I started competing to get myself in the mindset of giving it my all and making every decision in my life toward this one goal. If it didn’t end up happening, it wasn’t my path, but I gave it my all because it’s my personality.” Savvy Shields

During her pagesnt, Shields graced the audience with her jazz solo to Smash’s “They Just Keep Moving the Line,” the minute-and-a-half dance that led to her preliminary talent win before the final competition. And, props to Savvy, because she danced completely barefoot.

“When competing, it’s important to figure out who you are, what your brand is, and play on your strengths,” she explained. “I was never a technical dancer and I don’t think I’ve ever hit a triple turn. I knew I could never out-trick anyone, but I could outperform them by winking at the judges, making them fall in love with me and showing my personality without the cool tricks.”

Shields, interestingly enough, began competing in pageants because of her “love for dance and performing.” But, she’s always had her eye on the prize — the Miss America crown, that is.

“I’ve had my winning Miss America gown in my closet since I was 13 years old,” she recalls. “I competed in a pageant, before Miss America, that had an evening gown sponsor, so I designed my custom gown then.”

Not only custom but elegant, too, Shields’ dress was a classic velvet beauty that provided a much-talked-about silhouette when she waltzed the stage for evening wear.

“Trends change so quickly, and everyone was wearing a white dress to Miss America,” she explained. “I wanted something a little bit different that was still me and had a classic charm. It was one of the most fun, regal moments of my life — those 15 seconds modeling it.”

Contestants got little more than a few seconds to change between segments. Shields describes the experience as “pure chaos,” recalling that she practically glued her swimsuit underneath her opening number dress racing to get ready backstage between commercial breaks.

“You only have two minutes to change between each competition and you have to hairspray your face — yes, your face so everything stays on — and just grab and go,” she said. “The rush you get is unparalleled.”

What makes the rush easier? The holy grail beauty products Shields lined up backstage that were so quick and easy to use, she once achieved a full glam look in only 16 minutes, her personal record.

“You really have everything down to a science: which lipstick goes with which costume, the exact hairpins you need for each competition, and every outfit laid out for you in order,” she explains.

Today Shields’ lifestyle is a quadruple threat — content creator, artist, blogger and speaker — and, while she is no longer living her life on a stage, she still absolutely adores connecting with people, especially on TikTok.

“My goal is to help women and men find confidence and beauty in themselves through creative expression, mental health or through their lifestyle,” she shared. “I’m thankful for the career I have now and it’s been a huge blessing to work with great brands like Ulta and Google.”

Savvy Shields’ Miss America Makeup & Beauty Products

“I used the Mac x 9 Palette every day,” Shields said. “It gave me a plumy, pretty, warm neutral eye.”

“I always used Kiss eyelashes because you could always find them at the dollar store and you’re good to go,” she said.

“I always used L’Oreal’s Lash Paradise Mascara,” she said. “I still use it to this day and I’ll literally wear it until the day I die — it’s my favorite.”

“The Mary Lou Highlighter is the best, and even with makeup evolving, I still sweep it on my face,” she said.

“I used the Maybelline Fit Me Foundation because I was on the road all the time and would only have access to a CVS or Walgreens,” she said. “I laugh all the time about the lengths I would go to make sure I had my makeup.”

“I love the Benefit Hoola Bronzer for my onstage Miss America looks,” she said. “It didn’t give me a sharp contour, which I loved, because it enhanced my natural features.”

“The Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Powder is my go-to, forever and always,” she said. “I’ll never give that up.”

“I always loved a hot pink blush for the stage,” she said. “It made my makeup look more fun and girly.”

“The lipstick I wore during my crowning moment — which was a beautiful onstage color — was the ColourPop magenta color, which was in between a lipstick and a cream,” she said. “Now, I wear ColourPop glosses all the time.”

“I used the Hot Tools 1” Curling Iron to roll my hair, curl it, and use bobby pins to secure it up,” she said. “It would sit all day through rehearsals.”

“I used the Big Sexy Hair Hairspray for my competitions and prayed it would make my hair last all day,” she said. “It absolutely did, and it was great.”

“The St. Tropez Self-Tanner is simply ‘the good stuff,’” she said. “It made me have a natural glow for Miss America.”

“I love Redken’s Oil for All Hair Oil to put on after showering to help detangle and give my hair a little bit of a shine,” she said.

“Toupee tape was a game-changer for me because the double-stick tape wouldn’t stay on,” she said. “It’s my go-to pageant hack.”

“I used the Sex Kitten Eyeliner because it was more like a marker,” she said. “It was the perfect eyeliner to give me a winged look.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm on a rare illness that was previously only seen in tropical climates, particularly South Asia and northern Australia.

Now, two people are dead and two have recovered after being infected with melioidosis — a disease that had never before been detected on contiguous US soil. Melioidosis has now been seen in Georgia, Kansas, Texas and Minnesota, LiveScience reported. The only other known cases of melioidosis in the US were in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.

None of the four patients claimed to have traveled outside the country prior to becoming sick between March and July of this year.

The CDC “believes the most likely cause is an imported product (such as a food or drink, personal care or cleaning products or medicine) or an ingredient in one of those types of products,” according to the statement released Monday.

Investigators have taken more than 100 samples of soil, water and common products used in and around each patient’s home in order to discover a link between the four cases — but have found no common source thus far. However, genome sequencing of the bacteria has revealed that the four cases are likely somehow related, the CDC added.

About a dozen cases of melioidosis are seen each year in Americans, nearly all of which can be attributed to travel. This is the first time doctors are seeing the illness seemingly originate within the contiguous US.

Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, melioidosis can take several weeks to set in after exposure to the pathogen. Symptoms include cough and shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, intermittent fever and body rashes, the CDC wrote in a message to physicians on how to spot the illness.

Risk factors for developing the disease include diabetes, liver or kidney disease, chronic lung disease, cancer or another condition that weakens the immune system, the CDC warned.

One of the known cases of melioidosis — involving a 4-year-old girl — was recently publicized in Texas. Preschooler Lylah Baker had no known risk factors for the illness when she was sickened in May. Lylah spent a month in the intensive care unit of Children’s Medical Center Dallas, requiring a ventilator and eventually suffering brain damage, according to the Dallas Morning News.

“She was a healthy, typical little girl about to start pre-K in the fall — no underlying health issues previously. I mean just nothing,” Ashley Kennon, the child’s aunt, told the newspaper. “So it was definitely a major surprise to everybody not knowing where [the bacteria] came from.”

Lylah is convalescing at Our Children’s House Dallas.

The CDC is urging doctors to be aware of melioidosis symptoms regardless of their patients’ locations and travels.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Google has rolled out a new internal calculator to explain potential pay cuts to employees who choose to work remotely — and the early results suggests it will penalize its suburban staffers.

Screenshots obtained by Reuters show that Google employees who previously commuted an hour to Google’s Manhattan offices from nearby Stamford, Conn., for example, would see their salaries slashed by 15 percent if they choose to continue working from home.

By contrast, “Googlers” who live within NYC’s five boroughs and choose to work from home permanently would not see their pay slashed at all.

The screenshots also showed 5 percent and 10 percent differences for commuters living in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.

Google employees who move even farther away from the company’s offices have been warned they could face even harsher pay cuts. A worker who left San Francisco for Lake Tahoe, another expensive area of California, would have their pay cut by a whopping 25 percent.

That would mean an employee with a $150,000 salary would suddenly make less than $112,000 per year.

The calculator states it uses US Census Bureau metropolitan statistical areas, or CBSAs. Stamford, Conn., for example, is not in New York City’s CBSA, even though many people who live there work in New York.

News of the Google tool comes amid a broader debate at tech companies about remote work and compensation.

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have all warned employees who plan to leave expensive cities like New York and San Francisco that their pay will be slashed — while smaller tech companies like Reddit and Zillow say they’ll pay the same regardless of where employees live.

Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination, said Google’s pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely, including families.

“What’s clear is that Google doesn’t have to do this,” Rosenfeld told Reuters. “Google has paid these workers at 100 percent of their prior wage, by definition. So it’s not like they can’t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.”

Google, which has about 140,000 employees worldwide, took in $61.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of this year alone.

The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Post and did not address the Stamford commuter issue in a statement to Reuters.

“Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marissa Rohan — the Los Angeles Dodgers ball girl — has been dubbed a “hero” after she tackled a fan who ran onto the field during Sunday’s 6-1 win over the rival Angels.

Rohan, who reps a No. 93 Dodgers jersey on the field, got the job done after a number of security personnel couldn’t catch the intruder. Rohan has worked for the team since 2019, but Sunday’s fan take-down is believed to be her first-ever viral field moment.

Rohan has been reposting messages and support from others to her Instagram Story. She even joked that Sunday was a “rough day at work.”

“Yeah I am not going to stop talking about this lol,” she captioned a news story about her play on Instagram.

The 24-year-old is a senior at Cal State Northridge, pursuing a degree in deaf studies. She is a proud member of Alpha Phi sorority.

Rohan is a former gymnast and softball player, according to past posts on her public Instagram account — where she documents her relationship with boyfriend Justin Fallon, a ticket operations supervisor with the Dodgers.

When she’s not saving the day at Dodger Stadium, Rohan is like any other college student. She enjoys snowboarding, partying in Vegas, snapping the occasional selfie, and hitting the beach with friends.

Bottom line: Don’t try to get past the Dodgers ball girl.

“Misunderstood” no more.

A little over a year after debuting his polarizing under-eye tattoo, Presley Gerber appears to be doing an about-face.

Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber’s 22-year-old son stepped out in Malibu Monday sporting only faint traces of the “misunderstood” tat on his right cheek, suggesting he’s had it removed.

Gerber defended the polarizing design — which was done by celebrity tattoo artist JonBoy — last February.

“If I thought this was going to ruin my face or I didn’t want this, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said on Instagram Live.

“It says misunderstood because that’s how I felt my entire life,” Gerber added at the time. “F—k you if you don’t like it.”

He doubled down on the defense the following month, sharing an Instagram Story that read, “Most and a lot of people can get a face lifts, change genders, lip injections, etc and it’s offensive to say anything in today’s day in age but I get a little face tattoo and now people to love hate me.. Hmmmm? [sic].”

Gerber has multiple other tattoos on his fingers, neck and arms, including a marijuana leaf on his hand and his sister Kaia’s name inked in cursive on the back of his arm.

In April 2020, he also added the number “310” across his torso — in honor of his family’s Malibu area code — as well as a handgun on the front of his right hip, which was placed to look like a partially concealed weapon.

Gerber is just one of the many celebs who’ve opted for laser tattoo removal recently. Pete Davidson — who, incidentally, briefly dated Kaia in late 2019 — famously announced that he plans to remove all of his ink.

Call it arti-couture.

“Motivation” singer Normani is on the cover of Allure’s September issue, and posed for her shoot in a series of edible fashions made from real fruits and vegetables.

In one shot, she’s covered in fresh artichoke leaves that form a living corset, accessorized with a necklace featuring a blinged-out half of the veg.

Designer Laurel DeWitt, who is known for fantastical creations made of metal and chain, crafted the custom piece with help of fantastical fashion stylist Nicola Formichetti.

DeWitt revealed on Instagram that she created the artichoke bodice — as well as a red cabbage top, a pepper bracelet and earrings and lemon earrings — on site at the photoshoot using fresh produce.

“It was such a cool design challenge and not easy,” the designer wrote.

Perhaps Normani’s grocery-store couture served to symbolize her continuing growth as a solo artist; with her debut album still on the way, the former Fifth Harmony member’s career is set to flourish.

Designer Laurel DeWitt posted a close-up of the artichoke bustier, which was custom-made on set for Normani. Instagram

“My purpose in this work that I do is for other people that feel like they have black women figured out. There’s so many layers to us, there’s so many textures, there’s so much that we’re capable of doing,” she told the glossy.

“Yes, I can throw ass. But I can also give you a proper eight-count, and I can do ballet, and I can do contemporary dance. If I want to sing this pop ballad, then you’re going to love it! While you see my black face!”

Don’t be fooled by the rocks that she’s got — because those rocks are worth way more these days.

Back in 2002, Ben Affleck proposed to Jennifer Lopez with a 6.1-carat pink diamond engagement ring from Harry Winston, worth at the time an estimated $2.5 million, swiftly sparking a colored diamond craze.

And just as J.Lo’s career has continued to soar in the nearly two decades since, so too has the value of that rosy, radiant-cut sparkler, according to a trio of Page Six Style’s go-to diamond experts.

“Ninety percent of [pink] diamonds come from one place: the Argyle mine in Australia, which announced its closure in 2020 and stopped production this year,” Ajay Anand, CEO of Rare Carat, told us.

“Since 1983, the Argyle mine has been a major producer of the world’s finest pink diamond supply and the go-to for fancy pink diamonds. The mine yields a rainbow of colors, from pinks to blues to violets and the rarest of all: red,” he continued.

Anand estimates that Affleck would have to fork over around $4 million for the same stone today.

The Clear Cut‘s founder and CEO, Olivia Landau, shared an identical estimate, similarly pointing to the Argyle mine’s closure as a key reason for the ring’s near-doubling in value.

“Although it is unlikely the mine produced many pink diamonds in the 6-carat range, the closing of the mine has driven up the prices of fancy pink diamonds,” the gemologist shared.

And Mike Fried, CEO of The Diamond Pro, puts the magnificent ring’s current value even higher.

“Our fancy color partner has created similar rings to J.Lo’s, most recently two years ago,” he told us. “The cost was roughly $10 million. I’d imagine the price of her ring would be closer to $11 million today.”

Fried emphasized that fancy color diamonds — and pink in particular — are far rarer than colorless ones, and that the sheer size of 52-year-old Lopez’s makes it even more so.

Of course, it’s that one-in-a-million appeal that made the rock a perfect fit for the triple threat in the first place. “He was like, ‘I just wanted you to have something that nobody else would have,'” J.Lo told Diane Sawyer during a 2002 interview, calling the ring “the most magnificent thing I’ve ever seen.”

And now that Lopez and Affleck, 48, have rekindled their romance, the “Argo” director won’t have to look too far should he choose to pop the question again: According to J.Lo’s former publicist, Robert Shuter, she’s still in possession of the pricey piece.

“As far as I know, Jen has never returned the ring,” Shuter told “Access Daily” in May. “So if things move forward with these two, gosh, she’s already got the most beautiful ring I’ve seen. It’s absolutely stunning.”

Stunning — and stunningly valuable.

Celebrities: they’re allegedly just like us.

Now, be just like them, too — or at least dress like it — with the Free People FP Movement collection that celebs from Addison Rae and Hailey Bieber to Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens are obsessed with.

Spanning leggings, jackets, crop tops and more, the activewear collection has been snapped by paparazzi left and right. Even better, the celebs themselves have sung their praises for the workout gear, posting to their own social media in the outfits, like “The Hills” Whitney Port and real-estate developer and lead of season 12 of “The Bachelorette” Joelle Fletcher.

Another aspect of the FP Movement collection is giving back, as 1% of all FP Movement purchases benefit the non-profit Girls Inc, which works to empower women and girls with fitness and wellness programming and support. After all, if you are going to dress like a celebrity, you may as well act like one and do some philanthropy while you shop.

Since online shopping can be hard, forcing you to rely on studio photography and editing when looking at the clothes, we thought we’d let the star snaps be your shopping inspiration. See how Bieber styles her fuzzy fleece jacket to grab a green juice and take notes on Rae’s periwinkle one-piece ensemble, as she tips her hat to the FP Movement collection.

We hope you get some good karma and feel some star quality when rocking these leggings from the FP Movement collection.

Actress and TV personality Whitney Port shared a photo on her Instagram story wearing the Good Karma leggings in the delicious chocolate color. The “The Hills” star paired it with a matching bra top as well, which we found to be the Square Neck Good Karma Bra for just $48, should you want to take your own mirror selfie in a matching set.

Start your day with a trip to the gym and you may run into Addison Rae doing the same.

The star was snapped by paparazzi wearing the Good Karma Onesie in an amazing Faded Periwinkle color. Since the outfit is one-piece, all the TikTok star needed to do was throw on a pair of white sneakers and a black baseball cap and her look was a done deal.

Whether you’re actually on the ski slopes or just cozied up in your room this fall, the Hit The Slopes Fleece is a celebrity must-have.

Especially for model Kaia Gerber, who owns the jacket in both the dark blue Eclipse color and the fun purple Jamming version. Perfect to pair with a full athleisure look or dress up over jeans and a top, the jacket comes in an array of colors, that both you and Gerber can collect.

Forget the slopes and have a blast dancing in the streets like Hailey Bieber back in April.

The model, formerly known as Hailey Baldwin before her marriage to Justin Bieber, was spotted by an Instagram fan account back in April, wearing the Printed Hit the Slopes Fleece Jacket in the Black Toile Combo color. The coat also comes in pink daisies, brown zebra and an array of other fun patterns, all of which can help you feel like the model while also staying nice and comfy all fall long.

No, you aren’t seeing double.

Bieber is back on our list and wearing another version of the fuzzy jacket, but this time in a pull-over style. The celeb was spotted by the paparazzi wearing the Victory Red-colored Hit The Slopes Colorblock Pullover, holding a few drinks and donning a black beanie and matching mask.

Since the star’s spotting, the red color is almost sold out on the site, only available in an extra small size. However, if you are a fan of hit pink, you’re in luck as the Haute Pink Combo color of the same style is still in stock in all sizes from an XS to a large.

Celebrities favorite FP Movement tops

Is it the 2000’s again or are Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens playing a trick on us?

This surely is good karma for fans of these celebs, as they both posted outfit pics of themselves in the Good Karma Crop tank tops, Hudgens in an Instagram Live wearing the Red Apple color and Duff in a full outfit of Dried Rose. Both actresses paired their tops with matching leggings, but feel free to “Say OK” to wearing them with jeans or a skirt, because “Why Not” mix and match a bit?

Will you accept this tank?

Joelle “JoJo” Fletcher will, as “The Bachelor” contestant and star of “The Bachelorette” was spotted on her Instagram wearing the Happiness Runs Crop in a stunning Azur blue color. Great for a tropical ride on a golf cart like Fletcher or relaxing at home like the rest of us, the stretchy active tank top can be worn to the gym or styled into your everyday outfits, coming in an array of bright and fun colors to choose from.

There’s always a bigger fish to fry, unless you’re vegan, and in that case, the following snacks will offer some sizzle.

The foodie finds come courtesy of 32-year-old vegan recipe developer Nicole Vranjican. She features grocery hauls, simple vegan recipes and cook-with-me videos on her YouTube channel, NikkiVegan, which has nearly 160K subscribers.

“I started cooking from a young age with my Norwegian grandmother, so I have a lot of memories in the kitchen with her,” Vranjican told The Post. “It wasn’t until I went vegan that I noticed a learning curve, so I was excited to share my recipes when I made something delicious.”

As a first-generation American based in LA, she taps into classic meals prepared by her mother and grandmother, especially the authentic approach characteristic of her upbringing.

“There aren’t a lot of shortcuts or processed foods in the Norwegian way of cooking, so I grew up with wholesome, delicious and simple meals,” she explains. “The old-fashioned approach to cooking lends itself to veganism and doing your best for the environment, so I focus on whole plant foods as opposed to pricier alternatives.”

It wasn’t until Vranjican became vegan that she grew interested in sharing the whipped-up creations she deemed “very good and delicious.” She aims to share wholesome dishes on the healthier spectrum — even if her viewers don’t subscribe to a completely vegan diet.

“I make vegan recipes seem doable and practical because for me, being vegan is less of a diet and more of a lifestyle,” she said. “It’s delicious, relatively easy and good for the environment.”

Knowing everyone’s food preferences differ, Vranjican doesn’t let that hinder her gorgeously plated creations posted to her YouTube channel, blog and Instagram. Creating new recipes encourages her to have a better nutritional mindset, too.

“I used to have a restrictive, diet-y mentality with food, so learning about plant-based nutrition helped me understand what the food is doing for my body and counting that as a blessing, instead of something to be afraid of,” she said.

Vranjican shared some of her favorite breakfast, lunch and dinner recipes to create in a pinch:

Pictured: Roasted Broccolini Salad with Lemon, Apricots and Kale. Photography courtesy of Nicole Vranjican at Nikki Vegan Blog. Pictured: Easy Baked Potato Taquitos courtesy of Nicole Vranjican at Nikki Vegan Blog.

For breakfast: “I have this blueberry crumble recipe that’s a healthier version,” she shares. “You just pop it in the oven and it’s a great breakfast or brunch option. It’s probably one of my most made and popular recipes. It’s super simple with oats, banana and almond butter as the topping and it’s baked blueberries with coconut yogurt. It feels like a decadent treat and you can customize it with frozen fruit.”

She also enjoys her ‘Best Ever Vegan Pumpkin Muffins‘ as a delicious fall treat. I worked hard to make the texture fluffy and the spices perfect,” she adds.

For lunch: “I love making burritos and throwing whatever leftovers I have in the fridge,” she said. “I’ll roll up hummus, roasted veggies and canned chickpeas into a big tortilla and toast it in a pan.”

For dinner: “My potato taquitos with salsa verde is really good,” she shares. “I also love my roasted broccolini and kale salad with homemade cashew dressing.”

Even though Vranjican’s three-course meal options are the definition of “recipes made simple,” she highlights her favorite vegan snacks you can shop on Amazon below. No need to wheel a cart in the grocery store — simply hit “add to cart” and enjoy food sent directly to your door.

“The packs of everyday dal are so good and come in a bunch of different flavors,” Vranjican said. “You can eat them as a snack or pair them with rice and some broccoli for a nice meal.”

“The Field Roast Vegan Corn Dogs remind me of going to a fair and are just so good,” she said.

“If you give the blueberry muffins to anyone who isn’t vegan, they wouldn’t know,” she said. “They have a perfectly fluffy texture and taste delicious.”

“I love eating these mango chunks frozen because they don’t freeze all the way and taste almost like a sherbert,” she said. “They’re a great summery cold treat, too.”

“I use the frozen cherries to make my chocolate cherry bombs,” she said. “I dip them in vanilla yogurt and vegan chocolate to create a frozen truffle.”

“I’m obsessed with Enjoy Life’s chocolate chips and I use them for everything,” Vranjican said. “They’re the best to use in chocolate chip pancakes or muffins, as well as to make candy.”

Plus, she made dairy-free chocolate peanut butter cups for Halloween and the chocolate was “so creamy and sweet,” she adds.

“The texture of BoomChickaPop and the sweet and salty ratio make BoomChickaPop incredible,” she said. “It’s also ‘accidentally vegan’; I don’t think it’s a classified ‘vegan product.'”

“If you love Nutella but don’t want to do the dairy, Nutiva is the same thing and so good,” she said.

“If you like the texture and taste of Captain Crunch, the Puffins’ Cereal is very similar,” she said. “They come in a lot of different flavors, too.”

“My mom always gets the big bag of Late July’s tortilla chips and it reminds me of being home with her,” she said.

“Simple Mills Organic Seed Crackers are grain-free, have a nice crunch and are properly salted — which is important,” she said.

“If I’m eating cheese and crackers, I cut Violife’s cheese into quarters and it’s great cold or melted, especially for grilled cheese,” she said.

“I like to have a kombucha every once in a while if I’m not in the mood to have a glass of wine,” she said. “It’s fizzy, festive and better than a glass of water sometimes.”

“I drink the chamomile tea with lavender almost every day,” she said. “It’s very calming for nighttime and soothing for during the day to help with anxiety.”

“My friends and I did a blind taste test for coffee creamers and the Silk Soy Creamer was our favorite,” she said. “I always mix it into my cup.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The infrastructure bill the Senate passed Tuesday discriminates against white people at every turn.

Americans are enthusiastic about spending money on physical infrastructure — bridges, roads, broadband. But this racist bill hands out jobs and contracts and locates projects based on race, not merit. Minority businesses and neighborhoods hold the inside track. If you’re white, you’re low-priority.

The bill includes grants to install solar or wind technologies and generate jobs in areas decimated by closing coal mines or coal-fired electric plants. Here’s the catch: When contractors bid, the bill says minority-owned businesses will get selected first. Bad news for small-time white contractors in depressed areas.

The same is true for the bill’s proposals to improve traffic patterns in cities. Contractors and subcontractors get priority only if they’re owned by minorities or women. White male business owners can take a hike.

Americans should be outraged — but not surprised. After all, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act, passed in March, also put into place an ugly system of discrimination against whites. It offered debt relief to black farmers, but not white farmers. Another provision offered billions in aid to minority-owned and women-owned restaurants, but told struggling restaurants owners who happened to be white men that they had to go to the back of the line.

The injustice was obvious. White male farmers and restaurant owners sued, claiming the anti-white provisions are unconstitutional. So far, these challengers are winning. In every case, federal judges have halted the race-based programs in the American Rescue Plan Act until the challengers have their day in court. Politico reported last week that Biden’s Justice Department may fold without a fight on the black-farmer debt relief cases, because the law isn’t on the administration’s side.

The infrastructure hides discriminatory policies behind popular public works projects. EPA/JUSTIN LANE

You would think Democrats and the Biden White House would get the message. Instead, they’re doubling down on rigging legislation and divvying up taxpayer dollars to benefit minorities and shortchange whites.

Chances are high the infrastructure bill’s hodgepodge of anti-white discrimination will be struck down by federal courts. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution bars government from trying to even the score by discriminating against whites and in favor of minorities. The justices warned against creating “a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations” to correct past injustices. That’s precisely what this infrastructure bill does.

The bill’s backers would have you believe that obsolete airports, dilapidated public works and deteriorating roads and public spaces are evidence of racial injustice. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY) rails that “our infrastructure is racist” and calls on the Congress to pass a bill that “puts the needs of underserved and disadvantaged communities at the fore.”

That’s code for minority communities. But the truth is, there are plenty of poor white people in this country, too, and poor, predominantly white communities that could benefit from a bold federal infrastructure initiative. Race and ethnicity should have nothing to do with it. Locate the projects and put the funds where the economic need is greatest, regardless of race.

West Virginia has the lowest average income in the nation and ranks 46th in internet connectivity. Maine ranks 36th out of 50 states for income, and 34th in broadband connectivity. People in these states could really benefit from federal broadband assistance. Here’s the hitch: The infrastructure bill tilts the grant scale in favor of states with high minority and non-English-speaking populations, instead of considering only economic need and existing broadband capacity. Because Maine and West Virginia are 94 percent white, they’ll get less.

Polls show that Americans favor fixing roads, bridges, tunnels and airports. They know that good infrastructure promotes economic growth. But they’ve been kept in the dark about the fine print in the bill. Under the guise of upgrading the nation, the bill unfairly treats whites like second-class citizens.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She gave them a false sense of immunity.

A German nurse is being investigated for allegedly injecting thousands of people with a placebo instead of the coronavirus vaccine.

Based on witness testimony, police investigator Peter Beer said there was “a reasonable suspicion” that the rogue medical professional had administered shots of saline solution to up to 8,600 patients who were slated to receive the COVID jab, Reuters reported.

“I am totally shocked by this episode,” Sven Ambrosy, a local councilor, said of the alarming switcheroo, which reportedly occurred in March and April in Friesland in northern Germany.

It’s unknown why the shot-blocker — reportedly a Red Cross nurse — had injected people with blanks; however, she had reportedly broadcast anti-vax views on social media, investigators reported.

And while the faux jab was harmless, it may have disproportionately affected elderly people, who are at a greater risk of contracting the virus.

In order to prevent casualties from the fake shots, authorities are imploring thousands of people to get a second jab.

“The district of Friesland will do everything possible to ensure that the affected people receive their vaccination protection as soon as possible,” Ambrosy wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post.

Unfortunately, the nurse isn’t the first medical practitioner to express anti-vax views. In June, a Texas hospital suspended 178 employees for two weeks without pay for refusing to get the coronavirus vaccine.

“Bridgerton” fans can now dress the part.

Hill House Home, the brand known for its viral “nap dress,” has partnered with Netflix, Shondaland and Phenomenal on a limited-edition line of lounge frocks fit to woo a Duke.

The launch offers three nap dresses priced at $125 each, including two colors of the classic “Ellie” style featuring custom prints by Diane Hill, a black female artist based in London whose work is inspired by Chinoiserie.

The third “Nesli” dress features a new “Whistledown Trellis” print by Hill House Home exclusive to this collaboration.

There’s also a duo of $40 hair accessories, which are handcrafted in Italy and available in both pink and blue.

While the Shonda Rhimes-produced show has sparked an obsession with “Regencycore” looks like corsets, empire waists and pearls — even prompting “Bridgerton” superfan Kim Kardashian to seek out her own corset from the set — the nap dress is designed for comfort and lounging.

Sarah Jessica Parker always makes a statement at the Met Gala, whether she’s showing up in a meme-worthy headpiece or hitting the red carpet in a divisive dress.

But at this year’s American fashion-themed event, the ever-stylish “Sex and the City” star might be MIA — along with her BFF, Andy Cohen.

“I’m taking a year off,” Cohen, 53, told “Access Hollywood” on Tuesday when asked about his plans for the September shindig.

“My date is filming this year. She’s filming ‘And Just Like That…,'” he added.

Parker, 56, has attended the Met Gala with Cohen no fewer than five times in the past, and when the 2020 ball was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pair still celebrated together — from a safe distance, of course.

Sarah Jessica Parker is always one of the Met Gala’s most anticipated guests — and her date is always BFF Andy Cohen. Getty Images

This year’s gala is set for September 13, with Timothée Chalamet, Billie Eilish, Naomi Osaka and Amanda Gorman hosting. All guests will be required to show proof of vaccination, and must remain masked while indoors.

The event usually takes place on the first Monday in May, but the first Monday in September is Labor Day — and as one insider told us, “Even Anna Wintour can’t change a federal holiday.”

SJP has been hard at work filming the much-anticipated “Sex and the City” reboot this summer, so perhaps her shooting schedule conflicts with the big night.

But one thing’s for sure: Even if she skips the Met to work, we’re sure Parker will still make headlines with her outfits.

From Skims to swims?

Kim Kardashian tweeted a cryptic message on Monday, suggesting her shapewear empire might soon expand to include swimwear.

After a fan tweeted “S W I M B E R L Y,” the reality star replied, “S O O N C O M E,” seemingly confirming a plan to dive into bikini waters.

Further fueling the theory, the official Skims Twitter account chimed in with a series of black hearts.

Kardashian, 40, could be planning to offer swimwear under the same name, as her 2019 Skims trademark application included swimwear, swim caps and beach cover-ups.

Fans were excited about the prospect of the new line, as one commented, “don’t know what’s you [sic] up to but I know it’s gonna be great.”

“I was seriously thinking about how I wish ya’ll had swimwear,” another replied.

While Kardashian has yet to design her own suits, she regularly sets pulses racing with her bikini-clad Instagram posts – whether she’s sporting a thong on the beach or slipping into a string bikini for a hot tub dip.

Kim Kardashian has been soaking up the summer – and posting a slew of swimsuit photos. Instagram

Her sisters are no stranger to sexy swims either, with Khloé Kardashian already having expanded her Good American brand to include bathing suits in a variety of styles and sizes.

And it seems Kylie Jenner is on the same wavelength as her older sisters when it comes to business decisions; the Kylie Cosmetics founder filed to trademark Kylie Swim in May. Perhaps Kim and Kylie will take their nearly-twinning bikini snaps a step further by teaming up on a launch.

Could Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner both be releasing their own swimwear? Instagram

The potential addition to Skims also comes in the midst of a major rebrand for Kim’s KKW Beauty. The makeup mogul, who temporarily shut down the site on August 1, also filed to trademark the name SKKN in March, perhaps as part of the overhaul.

However, she was issued a cease-and-desist letter in July over competition for the name and may be planning something totally surprising for fans.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Biden is pursuing a new career as a self-taught artist and plans to ask as much as $500,000 each for his abstract expressionist paintings during an upcoming solo exhibition at Manhattan’s Georges Berges Gallery.

His lawyer didn’t return a request for comment on the newly surfaced video.

Celebrities: they’re allegedly just like us.

Now, be just like them, too — or at least dress like it — with the Free People FP Movement collection that celebs from Addison Rae and Hailey Bieber to Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens are obsessed with.

Spanning leggings, jackets, crop tops and more, the activewear collection has been snapped by paparazzi left and right. Even better, the celebs themselves have sung their praises for the workout gear, posting to their own social media in the outfits, like “The Hills” Whitney Port and real-estate developer and lead of season 12 of “The Bachelorette” Joelle Fletcher.

Another aspect of the FP Movement collection is giving back, as 1% of all FP Movement purchases benefit the non-profit Girls Inc, which works to empower women and girls with fitness and wellness programming and support. After all, if you are going to dress like a celebrity, you may as well act like one and do some philanthropy while you shop.

Since online shopping can be hard, forcing you to rely on studio photography and editing when looking at the clothes, we thought we’d let the star snaps be your shopping inspiration. See how Bieber styles her fuzzy fleece jacket to grab a green juice and take notes on Rae’s periwinkle one-piece ensemble, as she tips her hat to the FP Movement collection.

We hope you get some good karma and feel some star quality when rocking these leggings from the FP Movement collection.

Actress and TV personality Whitney Port shared a photo on her Instagram story wearing the Good Karma leggings in the delicious chocolate color. The “The Hills” star paired it with a matching bra top as well, which we found to be the Square Neck Good Karma Bra for just $48, should you want to take your own mirror selfie in a matching set.

Start your day with a trip to the gym and you may run into Addison Rae doing the same.

The star was snapped by paparazzi wearing the Good Karma Onesie in an amazing Faded Periwinkle color. Since the outfit is one-piece, all the TikTok star needed to do was throw on a pair of white sneakers and a black baseball cap and her look was a done deal.

Especially for model Kaia Gerber, who owns the jacket in both the dark blue Eclipse color and the fun purple Jamming version. Perfect to pair with a full athleisure look or dress up over jeans and a top, the jacket comes in an array of colors, that both you and Gerber can collect.

Forget the slopes and have a blast dancing in the streets like Hailey Bieber back in April.

The model, formerly known as Hailey Baldwin before her marriage to Justin Bieber, was spotted by an Instagram fan account back in April, wearing the Printed Hit the Slopes Fleece Jacket in the Black Toile Combo color. The coat also comes in pink daisies, brown zebra and an array of other fun patterns, all of which can help you feel like the model while also staying nice and comfy all fall long.

No, you aren’t seeing double.

Bieber is back on our list and wearing another version of the fuzzy jacket, but this time in a pull-over style. The celeb was spotted by the paparazzi wearing the Victory Red-colored Hit The Slopes Colorblock Pullover, holding a few drinks and donning a black beanie and matching mask.

Since the star’s spotting, the red color is almost sold out on the site, only available in an extra small size. However, if you are a fan of hit pink, you’re in luck as the Haute Pink Combo color of the same style is still in stock in all sizes from an XS to a large.

Is it the 2000’s again or are Hilary Duff and Vanessa Hudgens playing a trick on us?

This surely is good karma for fans of these celebs, as they both posted outfit pics of themselves in the Good Karma Crop tank tops, Hudgens in an Instagram Live wearing the Red Apple color and Duff in a full outfit of Dried Rose. Both actresses paired their tops with matching leggings, but feel free to “Say OK” to wearing them with jeans or a skirt, because “Why Not” mix and match a bit?

Will you accept this tank?

Joelle “JoJo” Fletcher will, as “The Bachelor” contestant and star of “The Bachelorette” was spotted on her Instagram wearing the Happiness Runs Crop in a stunning Azur blue color. Great for a tropical ride on a golf cart like Fletcher or relaxing at home like the rest of us, the stretchy active tank top can be worn to the gym or styled into your everyday outfits, coming in an array of bright and fun colors to choose from.

If you’ve got it, flaunt it — and Blake Lively definitely does.

The 33-year-old actress promoted her husband Ryan Reynolds’ new movie, “Free Guy,” with a cheeky Instagram pic on Thursday.

Blake Lively bared her booty in a floral bikini to promote husband Ryan Reynolds’ latest project. Instagram

Lively posed poolside in a floral thong bikini for the saucy shot, quipping in her caption, “Go see @freeguymovie this weekend or you’ll be bummed.”

Reynolds, 44, promptly reposted the photo to his own Instagram Story.

Lively also supported her hubby at the “Free Guy” premiere last Wednesday, clad in a backless pink sequin gown by Prabal Gurung featuring sexy cutouts that framed her famous curves.

“What a huge night for #FreeGuy. And what a huge night for @blakelively because this means we’re Instagram official,” the “Deadpool” actor joked on Instagram after the event. “I know how important that was to her.”

Despite the New York City premiere marking the couple’s first red carpet outing in a year and a half, Lively and Reynolds have been keeping fans in the loop about their life at home during the pandemic.

The pair share three daughters: James, 6, Inez, 4, and Betty, 1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was not the kind of green light hitters want to see.

With the Mets and Dodgers tied in the top of the ninth inning Friday in front of a season-high 38,395 at Citi Field, a green light flashed onto Max Muncy’s face, halting play for a few minutes.

Muncy, batting with a runner on second and two out, collected himself before an 0-2 pitch against Edwin Diaz, but before he stepped into the box, his face turned green.

“Come on, jeez,” Ron Darling said on PIX11. “That’s just awful.”

Muncy immediately pointed left and the umpires conferred for several moments. There was no resolution, so Muncy stepped back into the box, and Diaz struck him out to end the inning. The light was not seen again.

“We don’t want that happening in a baseball game. Player safety — everyone’s safety — is always our priority,” said Mets manager Luis Rojas, who was not sure after his team’s 6-5, 10-inning loss if the culprit had been found. “I thought it might have been the best crowd of the season, so for that to happen, it’s just something that you don’t want to see.”

The scene was similar to an incident during a July game at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Red Sox, when a red light began flashing. An MLB investigation found no evidence of a rules violation by either team.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“American Idol” star Syesha Mercado is raising her voice against the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office after they seized her 10-day-old baby daughter in a harrowing moment captured in a now-viral video.

This is the second child that authorities have “forcefully and legally kidnapped” — as she describes it — under unclear circumstances in the past five months from the 34-year-old Sarasota, Florida native, who finished in the top three during the seventh season of TV’s long-running singing competition.

Deputies surrounded an SUV that Mercado, her newborn baby and her partner, Tyron Deener, were driving in Wednesday morning to conduct a surprise roadside welfare check, as captured in disturbing footage with more than 2.1 million views as of Saturday afternoon. Police then took custody of the infant to bring her to a hospital for a physical, presumably due to prior — still hotly disputed — allegations of malnutrition concerning the couple’s then 13-month-old son.

Mercado and Deener, 36, posted the incident on Instagram with the caption, “THEY TOOK OUR BABY AGAIN!.” The hour-long video shows multiple police vehicles flashing lights while two male deputies serve the couple with a court order to turn over their baby.

“Do you not feel anything? You guys, I’m human. This is my baby. My babies is days old — and you’re taking my baby away from me,” a crying Mercado can be heard saying in the chilling clip before starting to sob as four female child protective services caseworkers stand their ground.

The singer-actress — who starred in Broadway’s “The Book of Mormon” in 2014 — and Deener attempt to explain to authorities that they are “compliant and following every law,” adding that their daughter had already been seen by physicians just a day prior.

“You are traumatizing my baby. How could you guys do this?,” a distraught Mercado screams as her daughter is taken from her arms and placed alone in the back seat of a city vehicle. “… You have no heart. This is so wrong. I have the key to this city … I’ll hold it together. I’m strong.”

Mercado was indeed presented a key to the city of Sarasota during her “American Idol” hometown visit on May 9, 2008, which was proclaimed “Syesha Mercado Day” by local officials. She eventually finished third behind David Archuleta and that season’s winner, David Cook, on the show. She went on to headline the 2009-2010 national tour of “Dreamgirls,” which launched at Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater, opposite future 2021 Tony nominee Adrienne Warren, who stars as Tina Turner in “Tina” on Broadway.

A decade later, Mercado had to breastfeed her crying baby and provide authorities with a bottle of breast milk on the shoulder of a busy road, The Root reported.

The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office and Florida Department of Children and Families have not responded to The Post’s repeated requests for comment. The last listed professional representative for Mercado said “she’s not really working right now” but expressed concern about her situation. Attempts to contact her directly have been unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, her infant is still in protective custody, according to activist Donisha Prendergast, 36, founder of the We Have the Right to be Right social justice organization, who is advocating for the couple.

Five months earlier, Mercado and Deener’s 1-year-old son, Amen’Ra, also was placed into the system after Mercado’s breast milk supply started to run dry, and the boy would not accept other fluids, FOX Tampa Bay reported at the time. They took Amen’Ra to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg on Feb. 26 for help.

While there, Prendergast’s organization alleges that the little boy was examined by Dr. Sally Smith, the controversial subject of a 2020 USA Today Network investigation after she was accused of being “too quick to diagnose child abuse,” which Smith has denied. Investigators reviewed hundreds of Smith’s cases and found more than a dozen instances where charges were later dropped — but the caregivers names were left irreparably smeared forever.

Dr. Smith did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Almost two weeks after Amen’Ra was admitted, CPS and armed Pinellas County Police officers reportedly ordered Mercado and Deener out of the hospital amid allegations of “trespassing” and “severe malnutrition.” Their son was discharged in late March and immediately transferred by CPS into foster care.

During the ongoing fight to get their son back, the couple asked that all caseworker interactions be facilitated through their lawyer, said Deener, a youth service professional who works in the foster care system. When CPS investigators showed up at their home upon learning Mercado gave birth to her daughter without alerting them, they were refused entry and referred to said attorney. That’s when the agency reportedly received approval to conduct a welfare investigation and remove their newborn.

“My baby is healthy and happy,” a desperate Mercado is heard telling them during the roadside seizure. “All you had to do was call the attorney. We have all the paperwork.”

Prior to this week’s events, the parents had launched a GoFundMe — titled “The Legalized Kidnapping of Black Babies Through CPS” — and more than $327,000 has been raised as of Saturday, surpassing their posted $200,000 goal to cover legal bills.

“I am a pregnant, breastfeeding mama who went to the hospital with the intention to get my [son], Amen’Ra, some fluids while transitioning from extended breastfeeding to being bottle-fed,” Mercado’s crowd-sourcing campaign pitch reads. “On March 11 … Amen’Ra was forcefully and legally kidnapped from us by CPS, who claim we refused a B-12 shot that was a matter of life and death, which is an absolute lie.”

However, authorities did tell local media outlets that medical staff reported Mercado and Deener for turning down a B-12 intramuscular shot, as recommended by hospital doctors, a claim that Mercado adamantly denies.

“We never refused a B-12 shot, and at no point was he on the verge of death,” she said before her second child was taken into custody. “Our [son] has since been placed with a white foster family without interviewing qualified relatives or friends of our family for placement while they investigate. We are given limited information and presently only have weekly zoom visitation for an hour with … no court order stating these visitation limitations.”

Mercado has vowed to keep fighting.

During her time on “AI,” The Post took note of her survival skills: “In the ‘Idol’ dictionary under ‘drama’ lies Syesha’s week in Hollywood. The uber-talented singer spent the whole week on vocal rest to overcome a strained throat, cold and myriad of other complications. But when time came to fight for her spot in the competition, one of the most determined contestants in show history knocked it out the box.”

Paris Hilton knows how to splurge in style.

While the “Cooking With Paris” star, 40, has a closet full of designer duds, she revealed her “biggest splurge” to date is a custom pink Hermès Birkin bag covered with crystals.

Hilton gave fans a glimpse into her extensive wardrobe Thursday for an Elle closet tour, recounting her most memorable — and expensive — outfits and accessories.

“For my biggest splurge, this is a custom-made Birkin bag,” she said, holding up the rare Rose Tyrien-colored purse. “I love Hermès, and I love this bag.

“If I was a bag, this would be me,” the entrepreneur and DJ added of the design, which is covered in “over 60,000 Swarovski crystals.”

While Hilton said she “can’t remember how much it cost,” the bag’s value was estimated at $65,000 when she purchased it in 2018.

The coveted carryall filled a long-empty space in her closet, as a group of teenagers known as the Bling Ring robbed Hilton of 20 precious Birkins in 2008.

“Since the Bling Ring broke into my house and stole my Birkin collection, I had been searching for this rare Rose Tyrien-colored Birkin,” she told Purse Blog in 2018, revealing she “finally found it” at Privé Porter, a leading reseller of Hermès bags in Miami.

Hilton showed off her sparkly splurge at LAX in 2018 with then-fiancé Chris Zylka. GC Images

Michelle Berk, founder of Privé Porter, told the outlet that the bag includes five different sizes of crystals, all applied by a female craftsman.

“For the crystals, it took her 60 hours to put 30,000 crystals on it,” she said. “Think about that: It takes an Hermès craftsman around 45 to make the bag itself.”

The piece now holds a place of pride in Hilton’s wardrobe, along with iconic outfits ranging from her “ode” to Britney Spears’ “Toxic” outfit to the white dress she wore when her fiancé, Carter Reum, proposed in February.

And while it may be her biggest splurge, the rare design is far from the only Birkin she’s toting these days. The star went on another Privé Porter shopping spree in March, even treating her Chihuahua, Diamond, to her own $5,500 Hermès Kelly bag.

Timing is everything in life.

Sandra Lee has gotten engaged to her boyfriend Ben Youcef, and the beaming couple hit the town in Paris to celebrate, with a besotted Lee showing off her dazzling new engagement ring, multiple sources sources told The Post.

Photos of the lovebirds reveal that Lee, the former girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and her hunky beau have made it official — as there was no mistaking the significance of a giant jewel on Lee’s left ring finger.

Youcef, an interfaith leader, actor and producer, sported a band on his wedding finger.

Lee was seen sporting the sizable new bling just days after Cuomo announced his resignation following a series of scandals — and a damning report by state Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of sexually harassing several women — that have plagued his third term as governor.

Lee and Youcef bolted to the City of Love after she was left devastated by the events of the past week, when Cuomo resigned as governor amid a sex harassment scandal, Lee’s friends said.

The two could be seen outside Parisian hotspot L’Avenue on Saturday night, sharing an embrace before heading in for dinner.

Lee, a 55-year-old lifestyle guru, wore a white summer dress while Youcef, 46, had on jeans, a leather jacket and a white T-shirt emblazoned with the logo “Fear of God.”

A source close to Youcef told The Post: “Ben really wanted to distract Sandra from all the news, so he whisked her away to Paris. He knows how hard this has been on her and he wants to make sure she feels loved and supported.”

The source added: “Ben is incredibly protective of Sandra. They’re soulmates and head over heels in love.”

The pair traveled to Paris after spending time in St. Tropez in the South of France.

Lee and Cuomo never got engaged during their 14 years together, although she was married previously to former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz from 2001 until 2005.

The source said their friends have been rooting for them since they met in the spring in Los Angeles.

As The Post reported, Lee has felt “betrayed” by Cuomo, most recently for what she claims was him taking credit for legalizing same-sex marriage in New York during his resignation speech when she was the one who urged him to push the legislation forward.

Cuomo’s cheating during their relationship, which he denied, was considered an “open secret,” former Cuomo staffers told The Post in April.

She met Youcef after moving to Malibu, Calif., and leaving behind the home she shared with Cuomo.

She solidified her move to the West Coast after selling her Mount Kisco home — named “Lily Pond” — for $1.85 million last October.

Youcef, a divorced dad of two, was discovered by Steven Spielberg and went on to appear in his 2005 movie “Munich.”

He has since appeared in a number of TV shows.

A rep for Lee declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2013, Becky G made history by becoming the youngest-ever CoverGirl spokesperson at the age of 15. Now, less than a decade later, she’s at the helm of her very own beauty brand, Treslúce.

“As a young Latina businesswoman, I realized I don’t just want to be the pretty Latina face of something. I want something that’s ours, something that we own, something that’s made by us and for us,” the 24-year-old “Fulanito” singer told Page Six Style.

Treslúce gets its name from a mashup of two Spanish words. There’s “tres,” the number three — a symbolic numeral representing the mind, body and soul — followed by a conjugation of “lucir,” which means “to shine.”

“It’s just such a spiritual representation of how I identify with makeup; not just being an expression of what’s on the outside, but also from within,” Becky explained of her inspiration. “Makeup, for me, has always been kind of this intimate process of transformation to a brighter version of myself.”

Becky G recently launched her own makeup line, Treslúce Beauty. Treslúce Beauty

The Mexican-American star, who said she’d “for sure” be a makeup artist if she wasn’t a musical artist, fell in love with cosmetics as a young age, and recalls frequently borrowing from her mom’s stash of beauty products.

“I had a young, cool mom who wasn’t like, ‘No, you’re too young for makeup,'” Becky explained. “She was all about [us] learning to express ourselves.”

And there are countless ways to do just that with Treslúce Beauty’s hero product, the “I Am” eyeshadow palette ($30), which is packed with 18 vivid matte and shimmery shades formulated with Mexican blue agave.

“I wanted to infuse little things that meant so much to me. And the blue agave is actually from Jalisco, Mexico, where my grandparents are from,” Becky shared of the unconventional ingredient. “I love tequila, so that’s probably where it came from too!”

Treslúce Beauty “I Am” Shadow Palette ($30)

In further nods to her roots, the palette’s packaging features a third eye design by Mexican artist Monica Loya, while the shade names — a mix of adjectives in both English and Spanish, including “divina,” “fuerte” and “unstoppable” — are meant to serve as affirmations.

And considering that her debut single was titled “Becky From the Block,” it shouldn’t be too surprising that the Latin Grammy nominee looks up to Jennifer Lopez as her personal beauty (and business) hero as she continues to build her own brand.

Treslúce Beauty launched with an eyeshadow palette, lashes, makeup brushes and colorful gel liner pencils, with prices topping out at $30. Treslúce Beauty

“She’s not just a great performer; she’s an actress, she’s an executive producer on a lot of the film and TV stuff that she does, as well as a fashionista, as well as a beauty brand owner. And on top of that, she’s a mom,” Becky said.

“So the possibilities are endless. When people ask me, ‘Where do you see yourself in five years?,’ it’s always like … I don’t know! Of course I have goals in mind. But I’m also only 24!”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rams and Chargers fans commemorated their return to SoFi Stadium with a massive brawl on Saturday.

A viral video showed a male Rams fan in an Aaron Donald jersey being pummeled by at least four others in the stands of the stadium shared by the two Los Angeles teams.

The melee, which left the fan in the Donald jersey bloodied, lasted nearly a minute.

The beginning of the video showed the fan in the Donald jersey arguing with another Rams fan. An unidentified woman in the back then threw beer on the fan in the Donald jersey, leading him to throw what appeared to be the first punch.

It’s unclear what exactly sparked the altercation and whether there were any arrests.

The Week 1 preseason game, which the Chargers won 13-6, marked the return of NFL fans amid the pandemic.

There’s no crying in casting.

Oscar-nominated actress Debra Winger quit the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own” because Madonna was cast in the women’s baseball dramedy.

According to the Telegraph, Winger was starring in the role of Dottie, which was eventually taken over by Geena Davis.

Serious actress Winger even trained with the Chicago Cubs for three months, but when director Penny Marshall cast Madonna, Winger felt Marshall was making fluff — “an Elvis film.”

“The studio agreed with me because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract. In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court,” she told the Telegraph.

She added, “As entertaining as [the finished film] was, you don’t walk away going, ‘Wow, those women did that.’ You kind of go, ‘Is that true?’”

She said the other stars didn’t train as much as she did, but Davis “did OK.”

“I certainly don’t begrudge any of them,” said Winger, 66.

As far as Madonna’s performance? “I think [her] acting career has spoken for itself,” Winger reportedly said.

Davis went on to get a Golden Globe nomination for the role, while Madonna picked up a nomination for Best Original Song. The film also stars Tom Hanks and Rosie O’Donnell.

Winger, most famous for her roles in “An Officer and a Gentleman” and “Terms of Endearment,” also spoke about quitting Hollywood back in 1995.

“I stopped because I ceased being challenged,” she said, adding that playing the supportive wife and mother got “pretty boring.”

Over the years, the actress has come back for various indie films like 2008’s “Rachel Getting Married.” Most recently, she acts in Apple TV+’s “Mr. Corman.”
