She’s airing corporate America’s trash online.

A New York City influencer is exposing the country’s decadent excesses by exhuming mountains of perfectly salvageable food and other goods from garbage cans in the Big Apple. Clips of her damning dumpster dives are amassing millions of views on TikTok and Instagram.

Anna Sacks — who goes by “thetrashwalker” on social media — documents her unconventional scavenger hunts, which take her everywhere from multinational giants to local Big Apple spots like a refuse-seeking Roy Chapman Andrews. Once at a trash receptacle, the 30-year-old eco-warrior sifts through the garbage pile with puncture-proof gloves in search of reusable goods, which she then loads into a shopping cart and takes home.

“It’s very meditative for me,” the Upper West Sider told The Post of her routine in which she goes through her neighbors’ and nearby retailers’ trash bags three or four times a week, sometimes for four hours at a time. It’s the former investment banker’s new way of living — sleeping on the bed sheets she snagged from a garbage bag (after washing them) and drinking coffee she makes from the unsealed containers that CVS routinely tosses.

Armed with a pushcart, two reusable bags and a pair of gloves, the redhead digs through discards, looking for items she can use: canned goods, pottery, cosmetics and furniture. Along the way, she’s scored mint vintage clothes, Tiffany champagne flutes and pricey Le Creuset cookware, posting pics of her newfound treasures.

In her most recent video with 2.5 million views, the trash-tivist uncovers a Halloween-esque treasure trove of Twix, Snickers and other candy bars in a CVS trash can.

“It’s all past the best-buy date, but it’s like a month past,” laments the New York native on camera. “I am still going to enjoy this.”

Another CVS-cavation from March shows how the pharmacy chain deliberately ripped open perfectly good protein bars and squeezed out the contents of toothpaste tubes.

But Sacks hopes to do more than save money: She’s hoping to change the world. Now a full-time waste consultant, she’s taking big companies to task for wasteful practices. Her change.org petition urging CVS to “Donate, Don’t Dump” has nearly 500,000 signatures.

“As long as it’s made, it should be used,” the garbage pail-eontologist, who boasts almost 250,000 followers on TikTok, told the Guardian “It’s so gross that this is what they like to do, as a corporation, rather than help people.”

And it’s not just multinational corporations that are letting good-as-new items go to waste. The environmental crusader has also found edible — and expensive — fresh meals and smoothies that were discarded by Maison Kayser, Juice Press and other ritzy New York City food firms, as seen on her social media accounts.

Meanwhile, a trash walk around Upper West Side public schools over the summer uncovered Himalayan-high mounds of school supplies, unopened clothing, excess bread and less-than-a-day-old Dunkin’ Donuts confections and single-use Party City paraphernalia.

It wasn’t seeing trash bags piled on city sidewalks that inspired Sacks to dumpster dive, though. After quitting her well-paid job behind in August 2016 after two years, she enrolled in Adamah, a seven-month Jewish farming program in Connecticut.

“I had difficulty spending long hours and working weekends on deals without a strong ‘why’,” she told The Post. “It was through farming and learning about composting that showed me a different way. It made so much sense to me.”

After returning to her native Upper West Side, Sacks took a master composting course at the Lower East Side ecology center, began volunteering with a food rescue, and taught Hebrew on the side for cash. She eventually moved on to work with Think Zero LLC, a consulting firm that helps corporations cut waste, where she learned about the trashy habits of modern-day life.

Sacks says our culture of throwing things away has resulted in both consumers and businesses generating obscene amounts of waste. Many retail workers are even ordered to purposefully destroy unsold or returned merchandise: One of her TikTok followers claimed that they had been told to slice up a chair with a box cutter while working at an office supply purveyor.

In order to mitigate the wasteful dystopian phenomenon, the Trashwalker advocates putting pressure on corporations to give their goods to those in need.

“The solution is not to dump it in the trash,” the human “Wall-E” told NowThis in a 2019 interview. “The solution is to donate.”

And it appears that Sacks’ campaign is paying dividends. In 2019, Sacks sent an email to Larry Merlo, the now-former CEO of CVS Pharmacy at the time, inquiring why they were throwing away items rather than contributing them, the Guardian reported. This resulted in the company getting the green light to donate items from certain manufacturers. Meanwhile, she sparked an investigation after sharing a fellow dumpster diver’s account of a live Petco parrot that had been thrown in the trash.

However, getting corporations to change their ways has proven to be an uphill battle. Last year, the plucky gal accompanied The Post on an excursion to the dumpsters of seven Manhattan Starbucks stores, which revealed that the coffee company hadn’t fulfilled its 2016 pledge to donate 100% of its unsold food by 2020.

“It’s very easy for companies to make public sustainability goals for which they receive positive press and which they highlight in their [corporate social responsibility] reports, but then not follow through with them,” Sacks told The Post.

Often, the massive size of the companies makes it logistically difficult to coordinate and donate recycling efforts.

At the very least, Sacks hopes her refuse forensics will inspire people to be more mindful about the amounts of waste they produce.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The world’s oldest industry is also one of today’s better-paid ones.

Top creators on subscription service OnlyFans rake in hundreds of times more money than the average Brit who followed a more traditional career path, a new report has found.

MrQ, a UK-based gaming software website, crunched the numbers on the best paid OnlyFan users and compared their income to existing data regarding what more customary professionals also make: Those who make a name for themselves on the adult content platform, researchers found, bring in a far better income than those who stick to well-traveled job paths like doctors, lawyers and teachers.

The most popular OnlyFans user, gem101, makes over $29.4 million while the 10th most popular, capriceG92, rakes in $4.3 million annually.

To calculate these findings, researchers looked at creators’ subscription costs and subscriber numbers to calculate estimated monthly and annual incomes. The 20% cut that OnlyFans takes from its users was also factored into findings.

An analysis by MrQ found that gem101 is the highest-paid user on OnlyFans. OnlyFans

“Among the most popular accounts with listed subscribers, gem101 ranks as the highest earner, with an estimated [$29.4 million] in annual income, earning an eye-watering [$2.49 million] each month,” a release for the analysis stated. “This comes from a $29 subscription charge per month and 102,800 subscribers to the account.”

By comparison, after 20 years in the field, English doctors — the top paid industry — will only bring in an average income of $109,000. The second best-paid professionals, lawyers, never even hit an annual average take-home of six digits: After 20 plus years of work in the industry, their income average tops out at $90,000 annually.

“While boning up on hard subjects at university might earn a decent amount as doctors at the pinnacle of their career will earn an average of a little over [$109,000] annually (around [$9,152] a month), top models like gem101 earn more than 22 times as much in one month alone,” report authors wrote. “That’s nearly 270 times as much a year.”

And what average income workers take home looks even more meager in comparison.

“A marketing professional earns just [$55,391] while a teacher earns [$48,467] and a journalist earns [$52,620],” researchers offered in stark contrast.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One young couple has taken vintage shopping to an extreme.

British couple Ruth Shelley, 28, and her partner, Robert Oestmann, 27, have sworn off modern-day amenities. Well, most of them, anyway.

The young couple has reverted back to 1930s pastimes, technology and fashion. Shelley and Oestmann own a vintage car and wear vintage clothing and decorated their home to match their 1930s aesthetic. They also do not watch TV and instead listen to wartime music on a gramophone.

Their favorite recipe: A depression-era meatloaf made with tomato soup.

The couple has credited their lifestyle to benefitting their relationship, allowing the two to be “present in the moment as opposed to glued to Netflix or on our phones” they told Caters News Agency.

Shelley, a research historian, explained that, as a unit, they are captivated by history and try to implement as many 1930s lifestyle choices as possible into their lives.

She did, however, acknowledge that it does turn some heads.

“This style isn’t something you could wear if you are shy, as we do get stared at a lot. We don’t mind at all and it’s often positive feedback.” Shelley said. “The elderly love it as it’s like a flashback for them. Sometimes people stop us and ask for photos, which is totally fine.

“Robert and I dress like this all of the time, as we are in love with the style,” she continued. “Robert mainly wears a suit and flat cap, whereas I may wear clothing from the 1930s to 1940s.”

Oestmann, a whiskey salesman, explained where his preferences stem from.

“As a kid, my grandparents used to watch a lot of old films,” he said. “They were inspirational — as I grew older I began reading a lot of books and my style stems from stuff like that.”

He added that he had certain qualms with modern-day fashion. “I also didn’t like the sound modern synthetic clothes make when I was walking. Our wardrobe is unique and different to today’s extremely casual.

“There is nothing wrong with casual, but it’s not for me,” he said.

As the designated chef, Oestmann tends to cook the couple’s meals — and prefers “Depression Era Meat Loaf,” a 1938 staple.

“I love playing around with new recipes to me but they are actually very old. I am originally from British Columbia, Canada, so this recipe gives an insight into the lives of a rural Ontario, Canada, community. It is a simple, basic meatloaf recipe that uses tomato soup,” said Oestmann. Shelley clarified that she actually likes to bake more than cook. “I prefer baking so make my own bread or welsh cakes on a griddle.”

Along with their culinary hobbies, the couple tends to use their leisure time “[to] listen to music and dance, go on walks or cycle on original vintage bicycles. Sometimes we ballroom dance to 1940s music.”

Their listening habits come strictly from the gramophone.

Shelley added that, although their home and lifestyle are rooted in the 1930s, they do embrace one modern convenience: cell phones.

“We both have smartphones, as they are useful when you’re alone to contact people,” she said. “But Robert would ditch his phone within a heartbeat.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She keeps raising the bar.

Edith Murway-Traina — who celebrated her 100th birthday on Sunday — is now recognized by Guinness World Records as the oldest competitive female powerlifter.

“I’m kind of annoying,” the wisecracking Tampa-based great-great-grandmother told The Post. “Tell me I can’t do something, and I will prove that I can. That’s more or less or my attitude.”

But the spry centenarian isn’t just looking to prove naysayers wrong; she thrives on the roar of the crowd.

“I love to hear the applause,” she said. “What better [thing] is there than feeling like you accomplished something and to hear everyone applaud and make you feel like you’ve done something powerful and important?”

In September 2019, Murway-Traina broke the record for oldest powerlifter by hulking upwards of 150 pounds at 98. Her inspiring achievement is marked in the 2022 edition of the “Guinness World Records” book, out next month. She stopped working out due to the pandemic, but she’s now back at the gym three times a week with her trainer, preparing for another competition in November.

“The doctors insisted I stop lifting or going to the gym because of the virus, so I backed off for a while,” she said. “Now I am starting from scratch and seeing what I can accomplish.”

A mother of five (four of whom are still living), grandmother of 11, great-grandmother of 10 and great-great-grandmother of two, Murway-Traina has long been physically active. She used to be a dance instructor, and always wanted to be like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. She and her friends would put on line dancing shows together.

“We thought we were pretty bright,” she quipped.

At 91, she discovered a new passion when she reluctantly accompanied her friend Carmen Gutworth to the gym.

“She didn’t want to go by herself,” Murway-Traina recalled. “She dragged me kicking and screaming all the way, so that’s more or less how I got there. I saw all these other ladies lifting weights, and it looked interesting. I picked up a couple of weights and had to prove to myself that I could accomplish this.”

Then she got into heavy metal, lifting larger and larger weights.

“When you pull a bar up and you lift it, there’s a certain power that you experience that is only yours. It belongs to you,” said Murway-Traina, who eventually started competing in senior games — and winning.

“The first time she went out and went to a seniors game, she surprised everybody. She got medals and the applause,” her daughter Honey Cottrell told The Post. “She doesn’t really brag about it. All of a sudden we heard she was a record holder. She’s very honored.”

Born in the Bronx to an Irish mother and Latvian father who worked in the Garment District, Murway-Traina was raised near the Grand Concourse. She worked various jobs including bookkeeping in the garment industry and then clerical roles for Grumman Aerospace, which produced much of the military’s aircraft. The latter produced a brush with a high flying hero. One day at work, she recalled that she was toiling near a test pilot and she asked to borrow two paperclips, which he politely handed over.

“He was known as Chuck Yeager. That’s my story, and I am sticking with it,” said Murway-Traina.

The spunky matriarch has outlived two husbands and still lives on her own. She quit smoking years ago and has two martinis a year: one on Christmas and another on her birthday. When it comes to nutrition, Murway-Traina is reluctant to dispense advice, saying she ate “whatever mama put in front of [me] . . . If mama tells you to do it, then you do it.”

Her other secret to longevity: laughter and good-natured ribbing.

“I have a couple of friends sitting here making fun of me. That’s how I keep going. If I can make someone smile and laugh, that feels pretty good.”

She also has good genes: One grandfather also made it to the centenarian club, living to age 102.

“I didn’t expect to be in that category [too],” she said. “But since I got here, I feel pretty good about it.”

For the big birthday, Murway-Traina had a small gathering where she wore a gold dress to mark the golden milestone and line-danced with friends to “New York, New York.” And although she hopes to add another trophy to her collection in November, she’s grateful for every new day.

“There’s nothing more that I can ask for than to open my eyes in the morning and know God gave me another day.” she said. “You can’t ask for more than that.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There’s a big stink over celebrity shower habits — but experts say there might be more to this soap opera than meets the naked eye.

Jake Gyllenhaal recently became the latest in a smelly string of A-listers — from O.G. anti-deodorant duo Matthew McConaughey and Cameron Diaz to modern “wait till you see the dirt” proponents Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis — who are freaking out fans by admitting they embrace the funk.

“More and more I find bathing to be less necessary,” Gyllenhaal, 40, told Vanity Fair last week. His aromatic admission came virtually unprompted as the outlet had asked about his experiences in NYC as a “water town” — all tied to Gyllenhaal’s appearance in Prada’s ad for their Luna Rossa Ocean fragrance.

So, what emboldened celebs to share advice on bathing rituals — or lack thereof — with the washed masses? The annals of digital media point to a May 9, 2019 viral origin tweet by Aussie culture critic Sophie Weiner, who doesn’t think it’s “gross” to skip soap on most body parts.

Weiner’s proclamation proved contentious — with more than 10,500 retweets. Perhaps not coincidentally, Taylor Swift, 31, revealed on “Ellen” just a week later that she doesn’t — gasp — wash her legs in the shower.

One day after Swift’s confession, professional stink-raiser Yashar Ali, 41, sought to stir up controversy on Twitter by launching a racially charged bathing discourse: “What is going on with white people confessing on Twitter that they don’t wash their legs, feet, etc. in the shower and just let the water flow do the work?”

However, the dirty-or-not debate dribbled out — until Twitter user @letsassume relaunched it with a now-viral “confession” on March 23, 2021: “I only started washing my legs after the ‘white people don’t wash their legs’ discourse,” said the white woman from Baltimore. The tweeter’s admission garnered nearly 44,000 likes and 15,600 retweets.

Since then, stars such as Gyllenhaal, Kristen Bell, 41, and Dax Shepard, 46, have proudly come forward to (un)shower praise on a status pioneered by “baby wipes” legend Brad Pitt, 57. The movement has become so strong, in fact, that some stars have been forced to come forward in their own defense. “I’m not starting any trends — I shower, trust me,” Jason Momoa, 42, said Monday, adding “I’m Aquaman. I’m in the f–king water.”

Fellow Hawaiian Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson also felt the need to clarify that he bathes — and often: “I’m the opposite of a ‘not washing themselves’ celeb,” Johnson, 49, said, adding that he hits the showers up to three times per day.

Well, turns out there are certain benefits to bathing less, according to Dr. Julie Russak, a private practice dermatologist in Manhattan.

Dermies generally “don’t recommend a prolonged bath or daily showers,” Russak told The Post. Hot showers and lathering up with bath soaps “really removes and destroys the skin’s microbiome,” which plays a role in protecting the skin and is “also extremely important in overall health of the body.”

There’s still the matter of good hygiene, and “waiting for the stink” — as parents Bell and Shepard have suggested — may not be the right indicator that bath time is nigh.

Celebrities can’t stop admitting they’ve de-prioritized bathing — to the disgust of many fans at home. But are there benefits to bathing less? FilmMagic, Photo by Taylor Hill/FilmMagic, http://www.BFA.com

“You also have to still think about all the bacteria and [toxins] that accumulate on the skin,” Russak said. “When the body sweats … it’s all a natural way of removing toxins.” Still, you don’t want to leave that sitting on top of your skin too long, encouraging pimples, folliculitis and other skin infections.

“There has to be a healthy balance,” Russak warned. Here, we ponder whether these unwashed hall of famers have found it in their sparse shower routines.

Taylor Swift

“When you shave your legs, the shaving cream is like soap, right?” Swift asked Ellen Degeneres. The two women ultimately decided at the time that, indeed, shaving does count as bathing. Then the singer was asked to clarify whether her legs are ignored when she’s not shaving.

“I kind of always shave my legs,” the 11-time Grammy winner said. Surprised by Swift’s diligent shaving regimen, Degeneres, 63, said, “You must be hairy.”

Fans were incredulous — both that Swift shaves daily and that shaving cream is equivalent to a good sudsy lather. “How is shaving cream like soap tho, lol,” one doubtful viewer dissed.

However, Dr. Russak was less than scandalized, agreeing that shaving is usually enough to do the trick. But for a better shave — and thus better clean — it’s important to exfoliate first and loosen up the dead skin cells. “If you don’t, you may become more prone to ingrown hairs,” said Russak, who is a big fan of dry-brushing her legs before a shower.

Meanwhile, Twitter is now snarking that shower habits played a role in her breakup with a certain famous ex who is rumored to have inspired the hit “Shake it Off.”

Jake Gyllenhaal

“I do believe, because Elvis Costello is wonderful — that ‘good manners and bad breath get you nowhere,’ ” said Gyllenhaal in his candid interview. “But I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.”

Gyllenhaal’s comments splashed onto social media as fans came to both decry and defend the actor, including one steamy response: “Guys idc if Jake Gyllenhaal and Mila Kunis aren’t showering, I’ll still f–k them … in fact makes them hotter little bit.”

But are humans really self-cleaning machines? “Your body sheds dead cells, millions and millions everyday,” Russak told The Post. But modern life — from clothing to air pollution — has interrupted our body’s naturally evolved cleansing processes. In that way, showering is perhaps even more important now than when early humans lived outdoors and “were naked all the time,” she suggested.

Mila Kunis & Ashton Kutcher

If you see something, soap something.

It was on Dax Shepard’s podcast “Armchair Expert,” with co-host Monica Padman, that Mila Kunis, 37, came clean about how she “wasn’t that parent that bathed my newborns,” of children Wyatt Isabelle, 6, and Dimitri Portwood, 4.

Husband Ashton Kutcher, 43, then elaborated, “If you can see the dirt on them, clean them. Otherwise, there’s no point.”

Their meme-worthy comments spawned several viral responses. “When ashton kutcher and mila kunis kids walk into class,” read one tweet with nearly 93,000 likes, attached to an image of Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen in “Twilight,” making a distinct pee-yew face while seated in a classroom.

Grime is a sure sign that a bath time is necessary, Russak agreed, adding that it’s also especially important after vigorous exercise. If you’re the sort who exercises daily, like Russak herself, a quick rinse post-workout is recommended, and using soap “only in the areas that have higher concentrations of sweat accumulation,” she said.

Kristen Bell & Dax Shepard

“I’m a big fan of waiting for the stink,” admitted “The Good Place” star Kristen Bell, 41, of her two children Lincoln, 8, and Delta, 6, on a recent episode of “The View,” appearing alongside husband Dax Shepard, 46.

In a follow-up question to Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” interview with Kutcher and Kunis, Bell added, “I don’t hate what they’re doing. I wait for the stink.”

Dr. Russak agreed: “I think we are over-bathing our children,” leading to overly sensitive skin in kids, whose dermis is already much more delicate than that of adults. She also shared that her son, who had severe eczema as a child, was allowed to shower just twice a week, and only use the gentlest soaps — to “protect his microbiome.”

Cameron Diaz

At the forefront of the pro-B.O. brigade, Cameron Diaz, now 48, told E! News in 2014 that she hasn’t used antiperspirant “for almost 20 years.”

“It’s really bad for you,” she claimed. “Just trim your armpit hair so it doesn’t hold onto the scent.”

Diaz is onto something. Sweat is our body’s “natural way of detoxifying,” said Russak. “We do need to sweat.” Deodorant — as opposed to antiperspirant, which blocks the sweat glands — is good to help control the bacteria that causes stink.

Body odor is a good indication it’s time to hit the shower. “When you smell, it’s time to take a shower,” said Dr. Russak. The bacteria that causes B.O. occur alongside the same ones that can cause infections. That said, it’s okay to skimp on soap much of the time, focusing primarily on the odor-producing areas.

Matthew McConaughey

Ever the bona fide cowboy, Matthew McConaughey, 51, has long reportedly been on the side of stink in the great deodorant debate.

“I just never wore it,” he professed in an early interview. “No cologne, no deodorant.”

He insisted the “women in [his] life” were down with the funk. “Including my mother, [they] have all said, ‘Hey, your natural smell smells, one, like a man, and, two smells like you.’ ” The number of women in McConaghey’s funky fan club who were directly related to or in a romantic relationship with the actor was not specified — but Kate Hudson sure doesn’t agree. The “Fool’s Gold” co-star allegedly begged the actor to use her natural salt rock deodorant while on set.

Julia Roberts

Julia Roberts’ blabbing bodyguard once told reporters that the mega-star and her “hippie” husband Daniel Moder shower less to “save water,” they claimed. FilmMagic

Julia Roberts, 53, allegedly credits her scant showering habits with concern for the environment. While the actress herself hasn’t spoken publicly about her hygiene, a 2013 tabloid reported Roberts’ bodyguard said that she “likes to save water — she’s really green.”

“She likes the smell of her natural oils,” the blabbing insider added. “She also says that she can’t wash her hair too often because it’s dry.”

Her husband, Daniel Moder, 52, is “as much of a hippie,” the guard added. “Those two are the farthest thing away from Hollywood glamour. They’re grunt all the way.”

Steve Jobs

It’s not all about movie stars: The late Apple founder Steve Jobs was known for his lifestyle quirks, one of which was revealed in the 2011 book “Steve Jobs” by Walter Isaacson. In it, the biographer claims that Jobs, as a student at Reed College in the early 1980s, held an unsubstantiated belief that a fruit-based diet would somehow eliminate his need for showers.

As a result, his stench was allegedly so bad that the young prodigy was relegated to the night shift at Atari, where he helped the company launch a video game revolution.

Jobs’ faith in fruit would come to betray him in the end after he refused treatment for pancreatic cancer on the basis that diet alone could cure his disease. Jobs passed away on Oct. 5, 2011.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@World War I was much worse than the coronavirus pandemic, according to Sarah “Betty” Spear.

Spear should know, having experienced both. She turned 108 on Wednesday, celebrating the milestone with family and friends in south London.

“The first world war was the worst thing; [COVID-19] is nothing in comparison,” she remarked in an interview with South West News Service.

Spear was born in Ireland in 1913, nearly a year before World War I began. When the war ended, Spear was 5.

She moved to London at the age of 18 and became a nurse. According to SWNS, she practiced medicine in Carshalton, a historic suburban village in south London.

“I don’t think the [National Health Service] have coped very well during [COVID-19],” Spear told SWNS. “People are not so friendly anymore.”

In 2020, Spear was unable to see her family while she stayed at her nursing home due to coronavirus restrictions, but this time around, she was able to have a small gathering with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was admitted into St. Judes Nursing Home a year prior after living in an apartment in Sutton for an extended period.

Spear has outlived her husband, whom she married in 1947 at the age of 34, which notably took place two years after World War II concluded. She’s also outlived her daughter Anne.

“She’s been through a lot, you know, because she lost her daughter. She stopped working at 90 and then quit smoking when her daughter – my mum, passed,” Spear’s granddaughter, Jane Welch, 50, told SWNS. “Two years later she fell down a flight of stairs from top to bottom and broke her hip – she’s a tough nut. … She’s been through the wars and always comes out fighting, and I’m very proud to have her as my grandmother.”

At her party, Spear spent time with close relatives and was honored with a dove release, according to SWNS. A pink-and-white floral cake was brought in, and there was also live entertainment and gifts.

The British news agency also claims Spear received a birthday letter from Queen Elizabeth II and a personal visit from Sutton Mayor Councillor Trish Fivey.

Spear credits her longevity to drinking strong tea, “hard work and a tipple of whisky once a week,” according to SWNS.

Her 16-year-old great-granddaughter Ella disagreed with that theory when she spoke with SWNS, saying, “She’s very strong-willed, so I think that’s probably what got her here. Not the whisky.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Massachusetts boy whose infectious “Aquaman” fandom prompted a call with movie star Jason Momoa has died of brain cancer at 8 years old.

The viral superfan, named Danny Sheehan, passed away Sunday after a courageous four-year battle with pineoblastoma — a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. The boy’s parents, Dan and Natalie Sheehan, announced his passing on the family Facebook page, 4TheLoveOfDanny, Boston ABC affiliate WCVB reported.

“Just after midnight, while in our arms, Danny took his last sweet small warm breaths and took flight,” they wrote in the heartrending tribute. “Surreal and utter heartbreak can’t even begin to describe this feeling inside.”

They added, “We will be so sad, but you can send us rainbows and butterflies and ladybugs to say hi. We will snuggle again soon.”

This marks a tragic end for the superhero die-hard, who had gone viral in November after he was filmed excitedly unwrapping an Aquaman figurine that he had received from a Christmas photographer.

Jason Momoa (left) was a real-life superhero to Danny Sheehan, who had battled pineoblastoma — a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer — since 2017. Momoa has since paid tribute to his biggest fan’s passing on Instagram, writing: “I just found out this heartbreaking news. All my Aloha to this beautiful Ohana Love u baby boy rest in [peace].

“Oh my gosh, my favorite one!” Sheehan exclaimed in the adorable clip. “AQUAMAAAAAAAAAAN!!!”

Danny Sheehan’s love of Aquaman prompted a video call with Jason Momoa, the actor who played the sea-dwelling superhero in “Aquaman” and “Justice League.” Facebook

The enthusiastic clip caught the attention of Momoa, who plays the sea-dwelling superhero in the DC flicks “Justice League” and “Aquaman.” The 41-year-old movie star decided to FaceTime his eager young fan, who said he was “so excited” to be talking to his hero.

The talk concluded with Momoa promising to gift Danny one of his tridents — which the boy received before he died — and inviting him to the set of “Aquaman 2” which began production in London last month.

Momoa has since paid tribute to his biggest fan’s passing on Instagram, writing: “I just found out this heartbreaking news. All my Aloha to this beautiful Ohana Love u baby boy rest in [peace]. You will live in my heart I dedicate aquaman 2 to you lil angel.” The “Game of Thrones” actor included a pic of a mural that the Marshfield Boys & Girls Club had unveiled this past June in honor of Danny’s love of “Aquaman.”

Sheehan’s legions of social media fans also expressed their condolences.

Momoa gifted Sheehan a trident and other items before the young boy died. Facebook

“Deeply saddened at the loss of such a happy fun loving kid,” wrote one crestfallen supporter on Facebook. “We are all better people for having known him and his indomitable spirit…May He Rest In Peace!”

Another added, “I am so sorry for your loss. Like many I’ve never had the privilege of meeting Danny but I can say I was touched by his special soul. I hope he is now swimming with the dolphins.”

This past June the Marshfield Boys & Girls club unveiled a mural inspired by Sheehan’s love of “Aquaman.” Facebook

The Marshfield Police Department, which made Sheehan an honorary police officer in 2019, uploaded a video homage to the deceased Aquafan on its Facebook page.

“We are beyond thankful for our friends, family and community, which have lifted us up over the past four years,” wrote Danny’s mom Natalie in a statement. “Our hope is that Danny will always be remembered, his name will continued to be spoken, and his laughter will forever echo in peoples’ minds.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thick smoke that held down winds and temperatures in the zone of the largest single wildfire in California history cleared Monday from scenic Northern California forestlands, allowing firefighting aircraft to rejoin the battle to contain the massive Dixie Fire.

The newly clear skies will allow more than two dozen helicopters and two air tankers that have been grounded to fly again and make it safer for ground crews to maneuver.

“With this kind of weather, fire activity will pick up. But the good thing is we can get aircraft up,” said fire spokesman Ryan Bain.

Winds were not expected to reach the ferocious speeds that helped the blaze explode in size last week. But they were still a concern for firefighters working in unprecedented conditions to protect thousands of threatened homes.

Fueled by powerful gusts and bone-dry vegetation, the fire incinerated much of the small community of Greenville last Wednesday and Thursday. At least 627 homes and other structures had been destroyed by Monday and another 14,000 buildings were still threatened in the northern Sierra Nevada.

Damage reports are preliminary because assessment teams can’t get into many areas, officials said.

The Dixie Fire, named for the road where it started nearly four weeks ago, grew to an area of 765 square miles by Sunday evening and was just 21% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It had scorched an area more than twice the size of New York City.

With smoke clearing out above eastern portions of the fire, crews that had been directly attacking the front lines would be forced to retreat and build containment lines farther back, said Dan McKeague, a fire information officer from the U.S. Forest Service.

The blaze became the largest single fire in California’s recorded history, surpassing last year’s Creek Fire in the the state’s central valley agricultural region.

The Dixie Fire is about half the size of the August Complex, a series of lightning-caused 2020 fires across seven counties that were fought together and that state officials consider California’s largest wildfire overall.

The fire’s cause was under investigation. The Pacific Gas & Electric utility has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines. A federal judge ordered PG&E on Friday to give details by Aug. 16 about the equipment and vegetation where the fire started.

Gov. Gavin Newsom surveyed the damage in Greenville over the weekend, writing on Twitter that “our hearts ache for this town.”

“These are climate-induced wildfires and we have to acknowledge that we have the capacity in not just the state but in this country to solve this,” Newsom said on CNN.

Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists have said climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.

Northwest of the Dixie Fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, hundreds of homes remained threatened by the McFarland and Monument fires. About a quarter of the McFarland Fire was contained and about 3% of the Monument Fire was contained.

South of the Dixie Fire, firefighters prevented further growth of the River Fire, which broke out Wednesday near the community of Colfax and destroyed 68 homes.

Smoke from wildfires burning in the U.S. West continues to flow into parts of Colorado and Utah, where the air quality in many areas was rated as unhealthy. Denver’s air quality improved on Sunday, but the smoke wafting into Colorado and Utah has made the air there and in Salt Lake City among the worst in the world.

California’s fire season is on track to surpass last year’s season, which was the worst in recent recorded state history.

Since the start of the year, more than 6,000 blazes have destroyed more than 1,260 square miles of land — more than triple the losses for the same period in 2020, according to state fire figures.

California’s raging wildfires were among 107 large fires burning across 14 states, mostly in the West, where historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@McLEAN, Va. — It came as a surprise to Mottrom Drive resident Beau Fitzpatrick that he lives on a street named for a Confederate soldier.

“Really? I always assumed it was named for an apple, or apple juice,” he said, referring to the Mott’s brand of apple products.

In fact the street in McLean, Virginia, not far from the nation’s capital, is named for Mottrom Dulany Ball, a captain in the Fairfax cavalry who was among the first Confederate officers taken prisoner in the Civil War. He became a Republican after the war and later a founding father of Alaska.

Mottrom Drive is among scores of side streets identified last year by a Fairfax County commission tasked with ferreting out forgotten names of the Confederacy. Northern Virginia, which saw some of the biggest battles of the Civil War and for decades was an indisputable part of the South, is now one of the wealthiest regions in the country with waning ties to its Southern roots.

As such, it has been swifter than other spots in the South to rid itself of Confederate names and memorials that dominated the region. A database maintained by the Southern Poverty Law Center shows nearly 2,300 roads, schools and monuments linked to the Confederacy spread across 23 states. In recent years, fewer than 400 have been removed or renamed.

In northern Virginia, the trend began in 2017, several years before the most recent wave of name changes. Fairfax County’s former J.E.B. Stuart High School — named after the Confederate general — is now called Justice High.

Fairfax and Loudoun counties are also continuing to pursue changes for names of major highways running through their territory. In Fairfax, the effort is focused on Lee Highway and on Lee-Jackson Highway, which are named for generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Loudoun County solicited the public for new names for John Mosby Highway, named for a Confederate cavalry commander who conducted raids throughout northern Virginia, as well as Harry Byrd Highway, named after a 20th century politician who led the state’s massive resistance campaign against federal demands to desegregate public schools.

This Monday July 26, 2021 photo shows a sign for the Lee Jackson highway in Fairfax County, Va. AP

But the counties are taking a different approach to the many side streets in the region that also carry Confederate names, both well known and long forgotten.

Fairfax is leaving it up to residents to seek a name change on those streets identified by its history commission. So far, not a single street has come forward with a petition to do so.

Jeff McKay, chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, said he doesn’t see the inaction as an endorsement of the Confederacy.

“We’ve raised awareness about where these streets are, and we’re leaving it up to the petition process” to allow those who are motivated to press for a change, he said.

This Monday, July 26, 2021 photo shows a sign for Lee Highway in Fairfax County, Va. AP

He said he suspects a majority of county residents oppose naming streets for members of the Confederacy, but that doesn’t necessarily translate into wanting to change your own street name. He acknowledged it’s a hassle to do so, requiring changing the plats on file with the county and a whole host of address-change notifications a resident must make to all the banks, businesses and utilities with whom they conduct their daily affairs.

Neighboring Loudoun County, meanwhile, is not leaving the decision up to its residents. County staffers in Loudoun identified a smaller number of side streets, fewer than a dozen, that are linked to the Confederacy.

A formal vote on whether to change the names is scheduled for September, but at a meeting this month, a majority of board members made it clear they intend to change all of the names. Indeed, they sent county staff back to find out how much it would cost to do even deeper research to identify even more streets that might possibly carry a Confederate or segregationist connection that has thus far gone undetected.

Koran Saines, a county supervisor who supports the name changes, said the issue is a simple one.

“You’re a part of the Confederacy, you should not be recognized with the honor of a street name. I’m sorry to tell you that. If the Confederacy had their way, three of us would not be sitting here,” said Saines, one of three African Americans on the board of supervisors, at a July 6 meeting.

On Early Avenue in western Loudoun County, longtime resident Bertie Jones is unhappy with the change.

This Monday, July 26, 2021 photo shows a sign for Harry Byrd Highway in Loudoun County, Va. AP

“I think it’s a crock of bull,” said Jones, who has lived on the street since 1965.

Jones said she knows that her street is named for Confederate Gen. Jubal Early, who led a campaign through Union territory in 1864, demanding ransoms from towns to avoid setting them ablaze and menacing the nation’s capital. But she’s not particularly bothered by it.

“Does this mean that everyone with the last name Early is going to have to change their name? It just makes more division than anything,” she said.

And back in Fairfax County, Fitzpatrick said he doesn’t see a need to rename Mottrom Drive. He said he understands the rationale for changing major highways named for prominent Confederate figures, but doesn’t see the point in erasing an already forgotten figure from a rarely traveled side street.

“I feel like there’s a middle ground,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@COPENHAGEN – Mineral exploration company KoBold Metals, backed by billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, has signed an agreement with London-listed Bluejay Mining to search in Greenland for critical materials used in electric vehicles.

KoBold, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to hunt for raw materials, will pay $15 million in exploration funding for the Disko-Nuussuaq project on Greenland’s west coast in exchange for a 51% stake in the project, Bluejay said in a statement.

Shares in BlueJay traded 26% higher on the news.

The license holds metals such as nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum and the funding will cover evaluation and initial drilling.

KoBold is owned by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.

Other KoBold investors include Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz and Norwegian state-controlled energy company Equinor.

BlueJay said previous studies found the area in western Greenland has similarities to the geology of Russia’s Norilsk region, a main producer of nickel and palladium.

“This agreement is transformative for Bluejay,” said the comany’s CEO Bo Steensgaard. “We are delighted to have a partner at the pinnacle of technical innovation for new exploration methods, backed by some of the most successful investors in the world.”

An unlikely marriage of two good ol’ American favorites, it’s a starting lineup of one juicy beef hot dog smothered in Fieri’s own bacon jam, “enveloped” in flaky pie crust and then topped with an apple mustard drizzle, demerara sugar and apple pie spice.

On Thursday, fans at the much-anticipated cornfield game will be the first murderers’ row to sample the Food Network host’s concoction.

For those looking to take a swing at the reci-pie, Fieri advises “getting your bacon nice and crispy, and then cooking it down with a little brown sugar, a little honey and apple cider vinegar.”

As for what goes around the dog, “I imagine you probably have an awesome apple pie filling that your grandma used to make, but if you want to get that canned stuff, it’s fine to use in this,” he said.

Then it’s crucial to stretch out the top pastry layer before popping these pie dogs in the oven at 350 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes.

Going “50-50” with apple pie filling and mustard is also pivotal to the pastry.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PARIS — France took a big step Monday into a post-pandemic future by requiring people to show a QR code proving they have a special virus pass before they can enjoy restaurants and cafes or travel across the country.

The measure is part of a government plan to encourage more people to get a COVID-19 vaccine shot and slow down a surge in infections, as the highly contagious delta variant now accounts for most cases in France. Over 36 million people in France, or more than 54% of the population, are fully vaccinated.

The special pass is issued to people who are vaccinated against COVID-19, or have proof of a recent recovery from the virus or who have a recent negative test. The measure also applies to tourists visiting the country.

In the southern city of Marseille, several restaurant owners had decided not to check clients for the pass, an Associated Press reporter saw on Monday. Many consider it is not their job to enforce the measure.

People without a pass where it is required risk a fine of $158.50. The government said that for the first week of implementation, police controls will not lead to sanctions for non-compliance but instead will be an occasion to explain the law.

In hospitals, visitors and patients who have appointments are required to have the pass. Exceptions are made for people needing urgent care at the emergency ward.

The pass is now required on high-speed, intercity and night trains, which carry over 400,000 passengers per day in France, Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said Monday. It is also required on long-distance travels by plane or bus.

“We’re going to enforce massive controls,” Djebbari said.

Paper or digital documents are accepted.

Meanwhile, the Paris Saint-Germain soccer club will be allowed a capacity crowd for its first home game of the season against Strasbourg in the French league on Saturday. PSG said the Paris prefecture has approved 49,700 fans at Parc des Princes stadium, with spectators expected to show their virus passes.

Polls show that most French support the health pass.

Immediately after President Emmanuel Macron announced the measure on July 12, more than 1 million people in France made vaccine appointments in less than a day. Since then, at least 7 million people have received their first shot.

Yet the measure has prompted strong opposition from some people who say it compromises their freedoms by limiting movements and daily activities outside the home.

On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators marched in Paris and other French cities for a fourth consecutive week of protests against the measure.

The virus pass has already been in place for last month for cultural and recreational venues including cinemas, concert halls, sports arenas and theme parks.

The law also requires French health care workers to be vaccinated against the virus by Sept. 15.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s going to take a lot of wall to display a fish like this.

A fisherman in Missouri not only set a new state record but has qualified for a new world record after catching a massive carp. This fish wasn’t caught with a rod and reel, however.

Matt Neuling was bowfishing at Lake Perry on July 24 when he shot a 125-pound, 5-ounce carp. He was out with a friend when he scored the massive fish, the Missouri Department of Conservation.

Neuling explained to the MDC, “I was out with my buddy early that morning when we both shot what we thought was a 30-pound grass carp. My buddy’s arrow pulled out, but mine shot straight through and stayed in there.”

He continued, “We just couldn’t believe it. We knew what type of fish it was, but we had never seen one that size. This thing is a straight-up monster. A five-gallon bucket could easily fit in its mouth. If my buddy wasn’t with me, there was no way I could have pulled it out of the water.”

The fish was weighed on a certified scale and is the eighth record-breaking fish for the state this year. Not only does it set a new Missouri state record under alternative methods, the catch also qualifies for a new world record.

“It’s just crazy,” Neuling said. “You know, I set that goal of breaking a record every time I go out to fish, but I never would have thought I’d be breaking a record with this fish.”

MDC Fisheries program specialist Andrew Branson said, “When fish get this size, we estimate it to be at least 10 years old. Bighead carp are an invasive fish from Asia. This particular fish is an example of just how well an invasive species can thrive if given the opportunity. We encourage people to harvest these fish to help remove them from our waters.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He’s “Wild N’ Out” with a bunch of women — and here’s why.

For Nick Cannon, having multiple babies with multiple girlfriends is the father of seven’s way of rebelling against the “Eurocentric” institution of marriage.

“That’s a Eurocentric concept … the idea that you’re supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life,” Cannon, 40, explained Monday on Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club.”

“The idea that a man should have one woman,” the host of “The Masked Singer” continued. “We shouldn’t have anything. I have no ownership over this person.”

Cannon — who welcomed his seventh child, the fourth within a year’s time, in June — said that fathering so many kids is not a decision he gets to make.

“Those women, and all women, are the ones that open themselves up and say, ‘I would like to allow this man into my world and I will birth this child,’ ” the California native insisted. “It ain’t my decision. I’m just following suit.”

The former Nickelodeon star welcomed 10-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with ex-wife and megastar Mariah Carey, 51, in 2011.

He has two children — son Golden, 4, and 8-month-old daughter Powerful Queen Cannon — with Miss Guam 2014 pageant winner Brittany Bell, 33.

On June 14, Cannon welcomed twin boys Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir with DJ Abby De La Rosa, 29.

Then, just nine days later, on June 23, he became the father of his fifth son, Zen, with model Alyssa Scott.

And now, Cannon says his aversion to monogamy is rooted in the European history of marriage.

“If we’re really talking about how we co-exist and how we populate, it’s about what exchange can we create together,” he said.

“I understand the institution of marriage, but if we go back to what that was about … [it] was to classify property,” he added, referring to the dowry system — the practice of trading a woman into marriage in exchange for money or property that was popularized in England between the 12th and 18th centuries.

The “Wild N’ Out” star said he doesn’t want “ownership” of any of the mothers of his children. The Breakfast Club

“One father gave another man his daughter for land,” Cannon said. “So when you really get to that concept, it’s like, we gotta change this up.”

Thus, his parade of paramours prevails.

“I don’t want ownership over anybody,” the “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” star said. “I don’t have ownership over any of the mothers. We create families in the sense that we created a beautiful entity.”

But it’s unclear whether the leading ladies of his love life are happy about Cannon’s staunch commitment to non-commitment.

“Every woman in my life that I deal with or [have] dealt with … they know how I feel,” he said.

“And it usually is a concept like, I’m not going around like, ‘Who am I gonna impregnate next?’ Nah,” Cannon continued.

“When you really look at how the family infrastructure is designed, the woman is the one that always leads and makes decisions,” he said.

Bell with her and Cannon’s son, Golden, at the park. Instagram

“Everyone is like, ‘How is he convincing these women?’ … But I’m not. I’m the one in the scenario who has to follow suit on what they decide.”

Cannon, who admittedly grew up in an “unorthodox” home in which both of his parents were absent at times, said he’s extremely active in all of his children’s lives.

“For every single one of my kids, I’m at every basketball game, I’m at every martial arts practice,” he said.

“People don’t understand how I do it, but my children are my priority.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For someone who prides himself on optics, Barack Obama just gave us quite an ugly spectacle.

As the rest of America struggles with uncertain employment status and school reopenings, shifting mask mandates, anxiety over vaccinations and variants, the health of the economy and the citizenry at large, Obama had to go and throw himself a huge, epic, three-day birthday bash on Martha’s Vineyard.

You would think a former president — one who clearly considers himself more intelligent and sensitive than most — would exercise some restraint.

Or at least understand that this was a supremely bad look.

Here were a host of left-leaning eco-warrior celebs, all Obama’s “close friends,” of course, descending on an already understaffed and emotionally depleted Vineyard.

“His birthday party is insane,” one of Obama’s caterers told The Post last week. “What is he thinking?”

Clearly, Obama thought to do whatever he damn well pleased — even after such backlash caused him to effectively cancel his party.

“This outdoor event was planned months ago in accordance with all public health guidelines and with COVID safeguards in place,” Obama spokesperson Hannah Hankins told the press last week. “Due to the new spread of the delta variant over the past week, the President and Mrs. Obama have decided to significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends.”

That, we now know, was a lie.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests, all free to go unmasked, while their 200 servers were reportedly forced to mask up. The tiny island’s residents, meanwhile, endured “a s—t-show” of traffic and sudden road closures enforced by the Secret Service.

Is there a more disgusting display of elitist “Rules for thee, not for me” than this?

Famously close friend David Axelrod — who sat for a hagiographic, three-part HBO Obama doc that premiered last week, who just called Obama an “apostle of hope” in the Washington Post, and the adviser most responsible for getting Obama elected in the first place — was, according to the New York Times, cut from the guest list.

Yes, David Axelrod was uninvited at the last minute so “close friends” such as H.E.R., former “Real Housewife of Atlanta” Kim Fields, Bradley Cooper and Stephen Colbert — to name but a few — could attend.

That is some cold stuff.

The Obamas hosted hundreds of guests for the birthday bash. Instagram

The uninvited, according to the Times, were “abruptly cut.” It tells you just where the Obamas’ post-presidential priorities are: Hollywood, podcasts, Netflix deals, and socializing with celebrities.

Musician H.E.R. was one of the guests at former President Barack Obama’s 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard. Instagram

There’s not much daylight here between the Obamas and the Markles. Who would have thought?

Consider that Jackie O, the most famous woman of her era, lived a very low-profile life on the Vineyard. Sure, she had an estate, but she did not move about ostentatiously.

Throw a lavish party filled with hundreds of A-listers while America remained gripped by a pandemic?

Jackie would never.

Barack, however, was playing 18 holes with Don Cheadle and getting serenaded by Alicia Keys. He was working it out on the dance floor with Erykah Badu while his guests drank top-shelf liquor and smoked cigars and dined from a menu curated by Questlove.

And the mainstream media cheers this on!

“Even Scaled Back, Barack Obama’s Birthday Bash is the Event of the Season,” said Vanity Fair.

“Danced All Night,” People mag said of Obama. “He Never Stopped Smiling.”

No wonder the vaccine is still politicized. No wonder there remains two Americas, despite Obama’s constant, self-aggrandizing promises to unite us.

On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci went on “Meet the Press” to warn that the Sturgis, SD, motorcycle rally (code for “MAGA crowd”) might be a superspreader event.

Then on Monday, a New York Times reporter went on CNN and quoted a Vineyard resident as saying the Obamas were fine because they invited “a sophisticated, vaccinated crowd.”

Nancy Pelosi said she didn’t go to former President Barack Obama’s birthday because she had “other parties” to go to. Maciel-Ngre-GLH / BACKGRID

That says it all. Even Twitter erupted.

“Of course viruses don’t attack sophisticated people, Muffy!” said one.

Perhaps Obama should have winnowed his list down to his close campaign strategists and loyal staffers — those who, according to the Times, were heartbroken to be thrown over for the likes of Chrissy Teigen, famous for little more than her marriage and her cyber-bullying.

These longtime loyalists, the Times said, “generally credit themselves with helping create the Obama legacy that has allowed the former president to settle in so comfortably with the A-list crowd” and all of them had “been looking forward to the reunion after an isolated year.”

Let them eat cake, indeed.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A pair of tattooed brothers were arrested for the fatal shooting of a 29-year old Chicago police officer over the weekend, cops said Monday.

Emonte Morgan, 21, was busted on charges of first-degree murder for killing Officer Ella French on Saturday night. His brother Eric Morgan, 22, was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and obstruction of justice, according to the Chicago Police Department.

The brothers and a third woman were stopped by French and her partner around 9 p.m. Saturday.

Suddenly, gunfire erupted from the vehicle, police said. Officers returned fire, injuring one of the vehicle’s occupants. Police did not give a reason for the traffic stop.



“This is the first step towards justice as we work to honor our fallen officer and her partner,” Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said at a press conference Monday evening.

French’s partner was taken to the hospital with serious gunshot wounds but is “improving incrementally,” Brown said.

Chicago Police Officer Ella French was shot and killed during a traffic stop on August 7, 2021.

The young woman in the car with the brothers has not been charged, due to lack of evidence, he said.

The gun used “was the product of a straw purchase,” Brown said, and was illegally purchased through an Indiana man, Jamel Danzy, 29, who purchased it legally in Hammond, Indiana, and knowingly provided it to another individual in Chicago who was not permitted to own firearms, Brown said.

Danzy was charged by federal authorities Monday.

Brown said traffic stops like Saturday’s are beneficial for keeping guns off the streets. This year alone, he said, 7,536 guns have been recovered by CPD, a 23 percent increase from the same period last year.

“But for the brave conduct of our police officers trying to protect the people of Chicago and recovering an illegally possessed gun, what ended up being an illegally bought gun, but for these types of traffic stops our cities wouldn’t be safe.

“Criminals with illegal guns are driving [up] crime here and everywhere in this country. And officers put themselves in harm’s way stopping suspects like this so that we can all sleep safely in our homes at night.”

French is the first Chicago police officer killed since Lori Lightfoot became mayor of the city in 2019, but the city’s cops have faced a surge of gunfire in the past two years.

In total, 11 people were killed and 73 were shot across the city over the weekend, Chicago police said.

Jessica Alba honestly looks like she’s having a relaxing holiday.

The actress-turned-business maven, 40, was snapped soaking up the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, along with her husband, Cash Warren, 42, preparing for a day of snorkeling. Both looked fit and tan carting their undersea equipment around the beach.

The pair met in 2004 on the “Fantastic Four” set and tied the knot in May 2008. They share three children: daughters Honor Marie, 13, and Haven Garner, 9, and son Hayes, 3 — none of whom appeared with them on the beach.

Perhaps the two needed some alone time. The “Dark Angel” star recently admitted on Katherine Schwarzenegger’s Instagram show “Before, During, and After Baby” that she has to work to keep the spark in her marriage with Warren alive, copping to feeling like a “roommate” to him.

“It’s all rosy for 2 1/2 years. But then after that, you become roommates,” she explained. “You’re just going through the motions. You have the responsibilities. It’s a lot of, like, checking the boxes, right?”

Alba recently admitted she sometimes views Warren more like a roommate. HEM / BACKGRID

Alba said that initially the couple was diligent about weekly date nights with no talk about kids or responsibilities but “that stops, because of whatever.”

The Honest Company founder also confessed to sometimes taking Warren for granted.

“We have, like, obviously the friendship, the comfort of, like, ‘You’re not going anywhere,’ and so sometimes you don’t treat those people the best, right? You don’t consider their feelings in the way that you would consider other people’s feelings,” she said. “So that is something that I think is a constant one to work on.”

Alba acknowledged that she doesn’t have the answers to a happy marriage.

“If you’ve figured it out in your relationship, let me know,” she joked.

At least the pair’s social life is going strong: They partied all night in Miami in May to celebrate Honest Company’s billion-dollar valuation.

The Cajun chicken wasn’t the only thing that was a little bit spicy at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night.

Claudine De Niro caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant, we’re told, by confronting a woman who she accused of taking her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number.

Sources say that the unnamed woman chatted with the Oscar winner around 11 p.m. at the Sag Harbor eatery, and he gave her his details before she said her goodbyes.

And we’re told that De Niro — who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — later stormed over to where the woman was sitting on a sofa in a hallway and demanded, “Why did you take his number? Don’t you know he’s my boyfriend?”

We’re told that the woman stayed seated next to a pal and barely responded, while De Niro stood over her and continued to berate her for some time.

Sources say that a pal of the woman was sufficiently concerned to move the restaurant’s management to ask Claudine to leave — which, we’re told, De Niro assured the pal that they would not. She was correct, and De Niro eventually walked away by herself and headed into the bathroom.

But a source close to De Niro told us she wasn’t being a jealous girlfriend — it was all about business.

The insider said that both De Niro and her foe are real estate agents and that De Niro was mad that the woman had wanted Gooding’s business — not good lovin’.

“It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

The source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

It’s not, of course, the first time Gooding’s got mixed up in some trouble with women.

The “Jerry McGuire” star has been charged with six counts of misdemeanor forcible touching and six counts of third-degree sexual abuse stemming from three alleged incidents. He has pleaded not guilty.

It’s also not the first time the pair have made a spectacle at a fancy spot.

Page Six reported in June 2019 that Gooding was spotted at the sceney Bowery Hotel loudly complaining about one of his accusers.

Le Bilboquet didn’t comment.

Ice-T’s wife, Coco, had strippers taking notes when she hopped on stage and danced at Sapphire on the Upper East Side Sunday night.

Ice-T co-hosted a “post-COVID” party at the Manhattan jiggle joint with film producer Noel Ashman — who also DJ’d, we hear — and Coco hit the stage when he played “I’m in Love with the Coco” by O.T. Genasis.

“Every stripper stopped dancing and started staring at her on stage. They all then gave her a high-five. It was really funny. Ice-T told him what to play, and they were going back and forth with the songs,” a spy told Page Six.

Unlike the strippers, Coco was “in her normal Coco clothes — a revealing top and tight pants,” the source said.

Ashman played music from two iPhones and an obsolete iPod, we’re told. When he played popular tracks like “Billie Jean” by Michael Jackson, and “I Want You Back” by The Jackson 5, Ice-T jokingly announced, “‘Anyone who doesn’t know this should leave!,'” the partygoer said.

When Ice-T, 63, wasn’t having fun with the crowd, the rapper-turned-“Law & Order” star was asking “all the girls who are not strippers to show their t–s,” the source said, and “a lot of them did.”

The club was so packed that security had to usher in Ice-T and Coco through a back entrance.

Old-school hip-hoppers like Treach and The Kangol Kid were also on the scene. At one point in the night, Ice-T and Treach honored late rap legends DMX and Biz Markie, which then turned into a spontaneous concert.

“They performed about four songs each including ‘O.P.P’ and ‘Colors.’ Treach went on stage with a huge wad of 20s and started spraying the crowd,” an insider said.

The evening ended a little after 4 a.m. with “everyone plastered,” we’re told.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Carnival rides are taking to the high seas.

Carnival Cruise Line’s newest and largest-ever vessel launched out of Florida’s Port Canaveral on July 31, becoming the first-ever cruise ship to set sail with an onboard roller coaster, Bolt.

The landmark cruise creation features an 800-foot-long track marked with twists, dips and a hairpin turn around the ship’s tunnel, industry news site Cruise Critic reported. The attraction is positioned approximately 20 feet above the ship’s 18th deck — specifically, above a miniature golf course and jogging track — and 187 feet above sea level, according to Attractions Magazine. The speed is controlled by riders, who can make it go up to 40 miles per hour.

Due to its unique location on top of a cruise ship, engineers had to get creative in making the attraction functional. It does not use gravity like most roller coasters, but rather electricity. The motorcycle-like cars (only two people can ride Bolt at a time) allow riders to go faster by turning the right handlebar back, like a throttle, or pushing a button by the left handlebar for an extra boost.

For riders who choose to go as fast as possible, the Points Guy says the experience only lasts about 20 seconds. The experience costs $15, a separate fee from the cruise’s ticket price which, the Points Guy said is worth it for thrill-seekers, but certainly not everyone.

“It was certainly more exciting than I expected, but because you (or your driver) can decide how heavily to use the throttle, it’s also a great experience for people who aren’t afraid of heights but prefer a slower-paced ride,” the reviewer wrote of his time aboard Bolt. “So, is it worth the $15 price tag? It’s not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ answer. I likely wouldn’t pay it, but if you’re someone who likes the bragging rights that come with exclusive experiences or if you’ve got thrill-seeking kids, it might be money well spent.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Blythe Grossberg had been working with a 14-year-old student named Lily on a paper about “Romeo and Juliet.” Grossberg, a writing tutor and learning specialist, was satisfied with the completed assignment, in which Lily argued that 13-year-old Juliet should have married neither Romeo nor her parents’ choice, the handsome and wealthy suitor Paris.

Lily’s mother, Lisa, a banker who spent much of her time sailing off Nantucket, Massachusetts, did not care for the essay’s central thesis.

“My daughter doesn’t know anything,” Lisa said to Grossberg. “I mean, what does she know about love? For her to write that Juliet shouldn’t have married Romeo, it shows her youth, doesn’t it? Her teacher will tear this to shreds. To shreds!”

This incident, which led to Lisa badly rewriting her daughter’s paper in between finalizing multimillion-dollar business deals, is just one example of the pushy cluelessness of the parents Grossberg encounters as a teacher of the children of New York’s upper crust.

In her new book, “I Left My Homework in the Hamptons: What I Learned Teaching the Children of the One Percent,” (Hanover Square Press, Aug. 17), Grossberg notes that for the 1 percent, their children’s pre-college education has just one purpose: getting them to the Ivy League at literally any cost. Grossberg, a Harvard graduate with a doctorate from Rutgers, has tutored for almost 20 years, and keeps her rates set between $125 and $175 an hour. Some tutoring companies charge anywhere from $300 to $800 an hour.

“The college-admissions process is the drawn-out Super Bowl of high-stakes parenting. There is winning and losing and nothing in between,” she writes. “There is endless strategy and conniving. And the outcome — which college a kid gets into — is a referendum on the entire season, meaning their entire upbringing.”

The intense academic pressure on these children of the 1 percent — the average annual income of families at the private schools where she taught is around $750,000 — often begins when they have barely learned how to walk.

“When I work at a tony Manhattan private school, pre-kindergartners in formal clothing show up with their extremely well-dressed parents to interview for kindergarten spots. It seems like a lot of pressure for a preschooler,” Grossberg writes.

“I see parents yelling at their kids outside the school — I am never sure if that is pre- or post-interview. The parents, in their power suits or designer dresses and heels, look steely and determined.”

Discussing a student named Sophie (Grossberg changed names and sometimes created composites of several people), the writer notes that the team-building effort to get her into an Ivy League college began in ninth grade.

“To [these] parents, every kid is Tom Brady. Every kid is destined for greatness, if only they can find the right team,” Grossberg writes. “If a kid isn’t heading for Yale, it’s because the team isn’t right.”

Sophie was diagnosed early with language-based learning difficulties. Her wealthy parents hid them from the girl’s school for fear that her poor performance would lead to her losing her spot, spending large amounts of money to skirt the issue.

“They had gotten her into [a prestigious school] in kindergarten, and they wanted her to stay put,” Grossberg writes. “They had already spent $20,000 on a school consultant, and Sophie had been tutored as a 5-year-old to take the modified intelligence test that the school used for admission.”

Throughout Sophie’s school years, which saw her parents spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on private tuition, she passed most classes with the help of tutors. Her parents kept her reputation and placement intact by unfairly blaming any difficulties on her teachers, creating “smoke and mirrors around her daughter’s academic performance and the real reasons behind it,” writes Grossberg.

Before being hired to work with the ninth-grader, Grossberg had to be vetted by the girl’s college-consulting team, as if applying for a high-pressure corporate job.

“We are trying to balance Sophie so she is stretching herself but is still successful,” a consultant named Noelle told her. “We are trying to help Sophie really reach.”

To do this, they signed Sophie up for summer courses at Columbia — a few STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) courses and obscure history classes, and one in playwriting “to make her seem well-rounded.”

For some of these kids, though, grades and test scores don’t really matter as long as their parents can write checks.

A student named Trevor suffered from dyslexia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and got poor scores on his standardized tests despite working with tutors. But that didn’t stop him from securing a placement in the Ivy League, as his father “made a beeline to the development office,” according to one of his other tutors.

“[The dad] kept writing checks,” the tutor told Grossberg, “and the [university’s} development office kept looking at them and saying, ‘Bigger, more zeros.’ Finally, they got to a place where they could all be happy, and Trevor was in.”

Trevor, who would sometimes steal bongs and vape pens from a store on Third Avenue in high school, went on to become an analyst for a major Wall Street bank.

And while Grossberg has seen educational strategies far removed from the average experience, the same could be said for the lifestyles of her students and their families — including wealthy parents who only engage with their children from a distance.

“To [these parents] every kid is Tom Brady. Every kid is destined for greatness…” Blythe Grossberg

“Lily has friends who don’t even know where their parents are at night,” Grossberg writes, “and there are parents who call their kids at 10 p.m. to tell them they’re in another city and won’t be back that night.”

In one case, Grossberg had never even met the mother of one of her tutoring students, and was surprised to see the woman one day at the family’s Fifth Avenue duplex. But when she tried to engage the mother about her daughter, Grossberg was interrupted by photographers. The mom was not there to finally discuss her daughter’s education, but to star in a Christmas photo shoot for a national magazine.

Still, there is one instance where Grossberg will hear from a parent every time — if a student receives any grade less than an A.

“One mother, whose son received a B+ in a math course, called the school, bubbling over with rage,” Grossberg writes. “ ‘We have sacrificed for years to send our son to your school,’ she told the head of the school. ‘And it wasn’t to get Bs! It was to get into the Ivy League!’ ”

Grossberg describes the kids as being “like the teddy bears made by Prada — fluffy and cute yet also stylish,” but also notes how they can get into more expensive trouble than most kids.

“Two of [one student’s friends] are in hock to a bookie for debts related to online gambling. No matter, of course,” Grossberg writes. “They fret for a bit and then sell an $800 pair of shoes for the $400 to pay off the menacing bookies.”

But while the progeny of the 1 percent have incredible advantages, there is a pronounced downside to having so much riding on your success as a child.

“For years, poverty, discrimination, and trauma have been known risk factors for adolescent mental health. For the first time in 2018, another factor joined the list: high-achieving schools,” Grossberg writes. “Children raised in high-pressure schools run the risk of psychological disorders and substance abuse . . . this means the children of the one percent are subject to risks even in the context of what looks like benign, supportive environments.”

Grossberg sees that the answer to this is simple, but unlikely to transpire: Uber-rich parents should just let their children develop lives naturally like the rest of us, without having to follow such a rigid path to the Ivy League.

“I have never understood why the children of the affluent are not allowed to chart their own course through life,” Grossberg writes.

“Many of them will have the freedom and money to choose, in theory, any path they want, but they are instead steered toward a limited roster of choices. In these kids’ lives, every moment is transactional.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Never has there been a teensier tot.

The smallest baby the world has ever known defied fate and, after spending over a year at Singapore’s National University Hospital, has finally gone home to her family.

Little Kwek Yu Xuan was born via emergency C-section weighing about as much as a softball — just 7.5 ounces, or 0.4 pounds — making her by many accounts the lightest baby ever delivered. It also meant her likelihood of survival was limited. Despite her fragile entrance into Earth, the hospital announced this weekend that she had been discharged, CNN reported.

The bitty tot is still battling chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension but has, at last, been turned over to the care of her parents, Kwek Wee Liang and Wong Mei Ling. Her 4-year-old brother currently lives in Malaysia with their grandfather.

Born in Singapore in June 2020 nearly four months premature, Yu Xuan has put on a miraculous amount of weight in the 13 months since her early arrival, coming in at 13.9 pounds. While still underweight for a 14-month-old, she’s come a long way considering her record-breaking birth size, which contrasts starkly to the average weight of a newborn, 7.5 pounds.

Other previous contenders for the title of Tiniest Infant include Saybie, the current Guinness World Record holder, who was born at 8.6 ounces in December 2018 in San Diego, and an 8.1-ounce boy born in Cologne, Germany, in 2016.

Yu Xuan’s successful battle for life made her “a ray of hope amid turmoil” at the hospital during the dark days of COVID-19 in which she was born, the National University Hospital wrote in a statement to CNN. She required “multiple treatments and machines” to finally make it home this month, but managed to be “active, cheerful and responsive” during the challenging first year of her life.

“Against the odds, with health complications present at birth, she has inspired people around her with her perseverance and growth,” the hospital wrote.

In a Facebook post, the facility added, “We are happy for the little fighter and her family, and proud of the care provided by our team. Our best wishes to Little Yu Xuan as she continues to grow, thrive and beat the odds every day.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An Australian girl who died in a freak magpie attack is being remembered by her bereaved family as a “stunning little ray of sunshine.”

“The joy Mia brought to all of our lives cannot be described in words, but is certainly felt in all of our hearts,” reads the GoFundMe page, which was created by the girl’s aunts to help parents Jacob and Simone cover the cost of her funeral. So far, the fund-raiser has garnered over $110,000 (in Australian dollars).

The tragic incident occurred Sunday afternoon after Simone was accosted by one of the Oreo-colored birds while carrying the 5-month-old through Glindemann Park in Holland Park West in Brisbane, Queensland, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. The mother reportedly tripped and fell while trying to avoid the dive-bombing bird, causing baby Mia to sustain critical head injuries. The tot was rushed to Queensland Children’s Hospital, where she unfortunately died.

The tragedy comes after Brisbane officials removed several magpies from the park in an attempt to curb aerial assaults, which generally occur during the breeding season between July and December, ABC reported.

“Swooping season only occurs when the male magpies are defending the chicks in the nest,” said Sean Dooley from BirdLife Australia. “While it’s only the male magpies that swoop and only 10 percent of males do swoop … the consequences, especially when people are caught unaware, can be truly terrifying and devastating.”

Suffice it to say, the infant’s family and admirers were crestfallen over her passing.

“Beautiful she was, and loved by all who got to meet her,” wrote Mia’s devastated aunts Sophie and Katie in the fund-raiser description, adding that “Mia was and forever will be the light of Jacob and Simone’s lives.”

A bereaved donor seconded their sentiment in the comments section, writing, “My heart is broken, I cannot imagine the pain you are all going through after such tragic circumstances. I’m so sorry with all of my heart. “

“Sending my condolences and heartfelt thoughts to your family at this very sad time,” added another.

Meanwhile, a witness to the horrific scene praised Mia’s father Jacob for quickly phoning emergency services while trying to do “everything he could” to save his daughter’s life, the Daily Mail reported.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time a Glindemann park-goer has been dive-bombed by magpies, with many blaming one angry bird in particular.

“‘There’s a particularly aggressive one who nests every year in the large gum tree at the end of Glindemann Park,” a visitor wrote in a local Facebook group July 31. Indeed many locals reported run-ins with the ferocious featherbag, with one woman reporting that it “nipped my left ear the past two years and drew blood.”

In fact, the flyby peckings have gotten so bad that the park erected signs advising visitors to wear hats and carry umbrellas to protect themselves against the swooping squawkers. They’ve added more markers since Mia’s untimely death.

Alas, the incidents aren’t limited to Brisbane. This past October, a Melbourne man had to undergo surgery after one of the ornery avians nearly plucked out his eye in a scene straight out of Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@MATHURA, India, Aug 10 – After an evening walk under overcast skies with rains not far away, elephants rescued from circuses and temples in India are treated to a feast of their favorite fruits and vegetables to celebrate World Elephant Day.

A lavish spread of watermelons, bananas, papayas and pumpkins is laid out for the Asian elephants at a sanctuary near the banks of the Yamuna River, on the outskirts of the ancient holy city of Mathura.

The center observes a week of events surrounding World Elephant Day, which falls on Aug. 12.

Most of the 28 elephants at the center suffer from chronic illness and various ailments ranging from abscesses, cataracts, blindness and joint pain, the result of years of abuse in captivity, said conservationists with Wildlife SOS, which operates the sanctuary.

“World Elephant Day is there to promote awareness about the plight of elephants in India and around the world, and what they actually go through and why their population is declining,” said Shirina Sawhney from Wildlife SOS, which also runs India’s only elephant hospital.

Elephants are an important part of Indian culture and are often seen during festivals and processions in the country’s south. They are also used in the north and west as tourist attractions at several forts and palaces.

But while revered as cultural and religious icons, elephants are also ill-treated by unschooled mahouts and often fall victim to electrocution, poaching, train accidents and poisoning.

The number of wild Asiatic elephants, primarily found in India and parts of South and Southeast Asia, has fallen to under 50,000, just 15% of its historic average, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new travel guidance Monday, adding several countries to the “Do Not Travel” list.

The advisories warn against travel by unvaccinated travelers unless their trips are necessary.

The government has maintained a strict observance of the pandemic situation across the globe, adding new nations to the list as their numbers climb in the face of the delta variant.

Health officials added Israel, Thailand, French Polynesia and several other countries to its list of “Level 4: Very High” risk travel destinations. At the same time, the U.S. State Department issued a Level 4: “Do Not Travel” advisory for Iceland and France.

“If you must travel to these destinations, make sure you are fully vaccinated before travel,” the CDC warning states.

The list of Level 4 destinations includes 73 countries, such as Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia and others.

The list of Level 3: “High” risk nations is almost twice as long and includes many popular travel destinations, including Jamaica, Italy, Croatia, Barbados, the Bahamas and more.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There’s a new flesh-eating flower in the plant kingdom.

The carnivorous cutie is the first of its kind identified in 20 years — despite the white flower’s prevalence throughout the Pacific Northwest.

Sean Graham, a botanist with the University of British Columbia, told NPR, “We had no idea it was carnivorous.”

The flower, called a western false asphodel, was first documented in 1879, but scientists had no idea the plant consumed meat until now.

“This was not found in some exotic tropical location, but really right on our doorstep in Vancouver,” Graham added. “You could literally walk out from Vancouver to this field site.”

Researchers had been working on an unrelated study when they noticed the asphodel, Triantha occidentalis, exhibited a genetic deletion that’s seen in other carnivorous plants. Scientists also noted that the flower had features which could be used to trap food.

“And then they have these sticky stems,” explained Graham, whose study on the western white asphodel was published Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “So, you know, it was kind of like, hmm, I wonder if this could be a sign that this might be carnivorous.”

“I suspect that there might be more carnivorous plants out there than we think,” said botanist Sean Graham. Qianshi Lin

There are less than 1,000 known species of carnivorous plants, which often appear in sunny and wet climates, with a soil that is scarce in nutrients — thus their evolution towards eating meat.

To prove the flowers were drawing nutrients from insects, researchers tracked the Triantha plant’s uptake of nitrogen-15 isotopes that began in laboratory fruit flies, which scientists had placed on the plant’s sticky stem.

Results showed that half of the plant’s nitrogen composition after feeding had come from the flies.

They additionally discovered that tiny hairs on the stem produce a digestive enzyme found in other carnivorous plants. It’s the first known example of such a plant using its stalk to trap and consume insects.

Said Graham, “I suspect that there might be more carnivorous plants out there than we think.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SYDNEY, Aug 10 – On the sands of Bondi Beach, one of Sydney’s wealthiest suburbs, surfers and seaside walkers jostle for space, while joggers clog the nearby promenade and fitness buffs huddle around public exercise equipment.

To the west, where COVID-19 infections are greatest, stores sit shuttered on empty streets as some of Australia’s most migrant-heavy neighborhoods endure heightened lockdowns, enforced by high-visibility policing backed up by the military.

About three-quarters of New South Wales state’s nearly 5,000 active cases come from nine Sydney local government districts, urban sprawl stretching from about 7.5 miles southwest of the Sydney Harbour Bridge to the Blue Mountains foothills.

“The community here is really struggling at the moment and they feel there’s a double standard,” said Bilal El-Hayek, a councilor from the city’s west who spends most days helping deliver food packages to people who don’t qualify for pandemic-related support payments.

“You see photos and videos coming out of the east, people on the beach, whereas here the streets are absolutely empty,” he said.

As Australia’s largest city struggles to contain its worst outbreak of the pandemic, the harsher restrictions and tougher policing in its most-affected neighborhoods have stoked resentment in its most vulnerable people. That feeling is especially raw since the Delta outbreak began in Bondi, with an unmasked, unvaccinated airport driver.

Though the whole East Coast city of 5 million is in lockdown, around 1.8 million in its ethnically diverse west are banned from leaving their immediate surroundings and doing any face-to-face work. Authorized workers must be tested every three days, and masks are mandatory outside homes.

The rest of the city is getting by with construction and property maintenance allowed, fewer movement restrictions and masks not required outdoors. Schools, which have been closed citywide since June, are returning everywhere but the west.

“Even the refugee communities who came here 40 years ago, how do we think these people will feel in a situation like this?” said Elfa Moraitakis, CEO of SydWest Multicultural Services, which provides aged care and settlement services for refugees. “Of course they feel targeted.”

Mervat Altarazi, a Palestinian refugee who is also a SydWest case worker, said the police and army presence had raised doubts in her clients, many of them from countries like Iraq and Syria.

“It’s like a shock for them as they believed they arrived in a free country and they say, ‘we face same what we face in our (home) country’,” she said.

“Some of them told me, ‘we are not the virus’.”

New South Wales Police declined a request for comment, although it has said publicly the 300 defense force personnel helping with “compliance checks” are trained in community engagement and unarmed.

Tim Soutphommasane, a former federal race discrimination commissioner, called western Sydney “the heartland of multicultural Australia.”

“If we don’t get this right, we will undermine the social fabric of this city for years to come,” he said in an email.

Business bust

The tougher lockdowns have also dealt an economic blow the federal government – facing its weakest polling in years and with elections due by early 2022 – has said may contribute to a second recession in two years.

The west, where three-quarters of residents in some suburbs are overseas-born, contributes about 7% to the $1.2 trillion national economy, with major logistics and manufacturing hubs there, according to Business Western Sydney (BWS), an industry association.

Before the lockdowns, three-quarters of the area’s 1 million workers left their neighborhoods daily to go to jobs.

“These workers have gone from earning a wage to, for many of them, lining up for welfare for the first time in their lives,” said BWS Executive Director David Borger.

The state government has said it would let the 80,000 construction workers from the west return to job sites once fully vaccinated, but with supply shortages and changing advice about vaccines for people under 40, less than a sixth of young Australians have had both shots, government figures show.

After riding a construction boom through the first 20 months of the pandemic, Brickworks Ltd, the country’s top brickmaker, making a million bricks a day, said it pulled two Western Sydney plants offline after the lockdown brought an 80% reduction in demand.

“If you think about trying to find space to stack 800,000 bricks a day, in the end we get to the point our yards are full,” said Managing Director Lindsay Partridge by phone.

“We had no choice, we had to come offline.”

Restaurants across the city are banned from seating customers and rely on takeaway to survive, but the reduced income in the west, coupled with restricted movement, has severely dented sales.

“One rule applies to the west, one rule applies to the east,” said Abdul Eldick, who has owned Lebanese restaurant Little Tripoli for 12 years.

“I don’t need the government’s money. I can make my own money. Just give me back my business.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ARDALES, Spain, Aug 8 – Neanderthals may have been closer to our species of prehistoric modern human than previously believed after cave paintings found in Spain proved they had a fondness for creating art, one of the authors of a new scientific report said on Sunday.

Red ochre pigment discovered on stalagmites in the Caves of Ardales, near Malaga in southern Spain, were created by Neanderthals about 65,000 years ago, making them possibly the first artists on earth, according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal.

Modern humans were not inhabiting Europe at the time the cave images were made.

The new findings add to increasing evidence that Neanderthals, whose lineage became extinct about 40,000 years ago, were not the unsophisticated relatives of Homo sapiens they had long been portrayed as.

Pigments were made in the caves at different times up to 15,000 and 20,000 years apart, the study found, and dispel an earlier suggestion that they were the result of a natural oxide flow rather than being man-made.

Joao Zilhao, one of the authors of the PNAS study, said dating techniques showed that ochre had been spat by Neanderthals onto the stalagmites, possibly as part of a ritual.

“The importance is that it changes our attitude towards Neanderthals. They were closer to humans. Recent research has shown they liked objects, they mated with humans and now we can show that they painted caves like us,” he said.

all paintings made by prehistoric modern humans, such as those found in the Chauvet-Pont d’Arc cave of France, are more than 30,000 years old.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has stumbled into an issue during its first sampling attempt.

“#SamplingMars is one of my most complicated tasks. Early pics and data show a successful drill hole, but no sample in the tube–something we’ve never seen in testing on Earth,” the rover’s Twitter account announced on Friday. “Mars keeps surprising us. We’re working through this new challenge.”

In a release from the agency, the Southern California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) which leads the mission wrote that data sent back to Earth after Perseverance’s first rock sampling attempt indicated “no rock was collected.”

The 2,260-pound rover carries 43 titanium sample tubes in its mission to search for interesting rocks and sediment – potentially leading to signs of ancient microbial life on the red planet – and is exploring Jezero Crater: the region where it first landed in February.

“While this is not the ‘hole-in-one’ we hoped for, there is always risk with breaking new ground,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. “I’m confident we have the right team working this, and we will persevere toward a solution to ensure future success.”

JPL notes that Perseverance’s Sampling and Caching System uses a “hollow coring bit and a percussive drill” at the end of its long robotic arm to extract the samples.

The drill and bit were engaged as planned during its first attempt and the sample tube was processed as was intended.

“One of the steps that occurs after placing a probe into the collection tube is to measure the volume of the sample,” Perseverance surface mission manager Jessica Samuels explained further. “The probe did not encounter the expected resistance that would be there if a sample were inside the tube.”

The Perseverance team is working to create a response team to analyze the data, including snapping close-up shots of the borehole with the robotic arm’s WATSON (Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering) camera.

The rover is looking at two units in the area containing the crater’s “deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock,” named the “Crater Floor Fractured Rough” and “Séítah.”

While the “Crater Floor Fractured Rough” is on the crater’s floor, “Séítah” has ridges, layered rocks and sand dunes.

“The initial thinking is that the empty tube is more likely a result of the rock target not reacting the way we expected during coring, and less likely a hardware issue with the Sampling and Caching System,” Jennifer Trosper, project manager for Perseverance at JPL, said. “Over the next few days, the team will be spending more time analyzing the data we have, and also acquiring some additional diagnostic data to support understanding the root cause for the empty tube.”

JPL noted that previous NASA missions on Mars have “encountered surprising rock and regolith properties during sample collection and other activities.”

The agency hopes to fill up eight of its sample tubes before Perseverance returns to its landing site and readies to journey to Jezero Crater’s delta region for its second science campaign.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@MENDOCINO, Calif. — Tourists flock by the thousands to the coastal town of Mendocino for its Victorian homes and cliff trails, but visitors this summer are also finding public portable toilets and signs on picket fences pleading: “Severe drought. Please conserve water.”

Hotels have closed their lobby bathrooms and residents have stopped watering their gardens in the foggy outpost about 150 miles north of San Francisco after two years of little rain sapped many of the wells Mendocino depends on for potable water.

Mendocino’s water woes were compounded in recent weeks when the city of Fort Bragg a few miles to the north — its main backup water supplier — informed officials that it, too, had a significant drop in its drinking water reserves after the Noyo River recorded its lowest flows in decades.

“This is a real emergency,” said Ryan Rhoades, superintendent of the Mendocino City Community Services District, which helps manage the water in the town’s aquifer.

Eric Hillesland and his wife normally wouldn’t need to buy water until late July or August to supply the Alegria Inn, their 10-room oceanfront bed and breakfast. But the property’s well started pumping little water early in the year and by February they were ordering 3,500 gallons (13,250 liters) a week.

Then the couple stopped watering the gardens and switched from glass to paper plates to serve welcome cookies. They plan to start using microfiber bed linens, which take less water to wash.

“We’re also asking our guests to be cognizant of the severity of our water shortage and to not take the extensive showers they might be used to at home,” Hillesland said.

Mendocino relies on groundwater accessed through a network of about 400 privately owned wells, many of them dug by hand when the former mill town was established in the 1850s. Residents and business owners keep their water in storage tanks, including some perched atop historic redwood water towers.

The town has about 1,000 residents, but its economy depends on about 2,000 people who visit each day during the height of the tourist season, from May to October, Rhoades said.

Businesses have traditionally had to haul in water in the fall. But after a second dry winter, many have had to order more, much earlier than before.

Because of the pandemic and stay-at-home orders, there were few visitors last year when town residents began noticing their wells were producing less. Now the weekend getaway destination for people in the Sacramento and San Francisco Bay areas is teeming with guests.

That has forced residents and business owners to find drinking water sources that are farther away, which has doubled the price of water. Some restaurants are cutting back their operating hours to reduce costs.

In February, Hillesland was paying $300 for a 3,500-gallon (13,250-liter) delivery. Now it costs $600.

If it gets worse and they have to start closing rooms, “then we are in a situation like at the beginning of the pandemic — no income but still plenty of mortgage and insurance,” he said.

Many longer-term solutions are being considered, including bringing water by barge, plane and train and adding community storage tanks that can hold up to 500,000 gallons, asking the US National Guard or the Army Corps of Engineers to set up a mobile desalination treatment unit and even capturing fog. But all of them are expensive and the town would need the support of the state and federal governments, Rhoades said.

A company that developed new technology to capture moisture in fog proposed setting up a testing site in Mendocino at no cost and selling the water to the community. But Rhoades said the infrastructure would affect the town’s scenic views and getting a permit would be a challenge. A desalination plant would face similar permitting and environmental hurdles.

“Transporting water that is treated and is known from an inland source, might be a faster solution, even though it’s expensive,” he said.

Robert Pinoli, president of Mendocino Railway, which operates the historic Skunk Train, said he is ready to help. Since 1885, the train has been running from Willits through redwood forests and river canyons to Fort Bragg.

Pinoli said he could find tank cars quickly, attach them to the locomotive and deliver up to 200,000 gallons (757,000 liters) each trip. He identified a source for tank cars in 2015 when Fort Bragg went through a water shortage and considered buying inland water to transport it to the coast. Officials scratched those plans after it rained.

He said if Willits decides it wants to sell its water and Fort Bragg wants to buy it, “we become a logical vehicle for transporting water on a pretty large scale.”

Willits officials recently decided against selling their water to the parched town.

For now, Mendocino residents are relying on people like Brian Clark, who has been selling water from his well outside town and trucking it in. Clark said he can’t keep up with the demand.

“I’m really hiding from the phone because I’m getting way more calls than I have water and I’m hearing from people I’ve never met, never heard of and I can’t help them,” he said.

Clark, a longtime resident, said Mendocino hasn’t had such water storage issues since the 1970s when California faced the most severe drought on record.

County officials’ short-term solutions include waiving permit requirements for storage tanks that can hold up to 5,000 gallons (18,900 liters) and identifying wells with excess water near Mendocino. Officials are also asking the state to help finance the bigger private tanks, Rhoades said.

“I want residents to be able to store more water now, while their wells are still somewhat productive, to make it through the next four months. And if they have to purchase water, you get the most bang for your buck,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@GENEVA, Aug 10 – After spending hundreds of hours in virtual meetings to complete this week’s major UN climate report, scientists Piers Forster and Joeri Rogelj celebrated in a way their peers could not: by hugging.

Britain-based Forster had been weary of the isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and invited his co-author to work alongside him in his Harrogate kitchen as they worked with other scientists around the world to thrash out the final version of the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Being together for the last stretch of a three-year effort “made it more fun,” said Forster, a climate physicist at the University of Leeds.

“My neighbors must have thought us mad though, hearing “Thank you madam co-chair,” in response to questions from St Kitts, India, or the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, coming through at 4 am.”

When the more than 700 scientists and government delegates finally approved the last part of their 3,949-page report over the weekend, they all erupted into cheers – each separated in their own little frame, except for Forster and Rogelj.

A Zoom screenshot shows the two smiling out from the same box.

This year’s landmark report, warning that the world is dangerously speeding toward runaway climate change, took years of painstaking effort to pull together.

Specialist scientists, all 234 of them working for free, reviewed more than 14,000 scientific studies published since 2013 to draft the latest version of what has now become the established science on climate change, before coming together – virtually – for two weeks of final checks and negotiations.

Despite travel restrictions and national lockdowns that delayed the report’s completion for several months, organizers say they pulled off the effort with no notable technical glitches to meet their revised deadline.

For many of the scientists, the effort came with a personal cost. “You put a lot of yourself in it,” said ETH Zurich climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne, who had to skip a family holiday to help finish the report.

While scientists praised the inclusion of colleagues from 65 countries across the globe, some said the resulting time-zone challenges were bad for their sleep.

“We could not find any time slot that wasn’t two o’clock in the morning for somebody,” said Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. “I’m a night owl, but I’m not that much of one,” he joked.

Working through a cyclone

Completing the politically sensitive “Summary for Policymakers” section, which 195 governments must approve by consensus, presented a particular challenge. Each word of each sentence needed to be scrutinized and debated.

To help the effort, organizers displayed each sentence in yellow on a shared screen until it was approved, at which point it appeared in green. If it was rejected, it turned blue – signaling a revision was needed. Disputes then had to be resolved in virtual breakout sessions.

“We spent sometimes hours on a footnote,” said co-chair Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a climate scientist at the University of Paris-Saclay who described work on the report as a “marathon.”

One scientist in India even called by phone to attend a meeting while a tropical cyclone wailed outside his window, having already cut off his electricity and internet, she recalled.

But Masson-Delmotte also said the chance to work on pioneering climate research with so many scientists around the world was “one of the biggest joys of my professional life.”

She took strolls in a park among flowers to relax between sessions.

Others said they bonded while getting to know each other’s pets and kids, who frequently popped up in the background during video calls.

But for some, the loneliness at times was grinding. Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, said it was helpful to be able to work alongside Forster over the last two weeks – just to exchange ideas, or to vent.

“You can do everything that makes us human, that you can’t do through a screen,” he told Reuters. “If I would have been alone in my room, it would have been much harder to achieve this.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm on a rare illness that was previously only seen in tropical climates, particularly South Asia and northern Australia.

Now, two people are dead and two have recovered after being infected with melioidosis — a disease that had never before been detected on contiguous US soil. Melioidosis has now been seen in Georgia, Kansas, Texas and Minnesota, LiveScience reported. The only other known cases of melioidosis in the US were in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.

None of the four patients claimed to have traveled outside the country prior to becoming sick between March and July of this year.

The CDC “believes the most likely cause is an imported product (such as a food or drink, personal care or cleaning products or medicine) or an ingredient in one of those types of products,” according to the statement released Monday.

Investigators have taken more than 100 samples of soil, water and common products used in and around each patient’s home in order to discover a link between the four cases — but have found no common source thus far. However, genome sequencing of the bacteria has revealed that the four cases are likely somehow related, the CDC added.

About a dozen cases of melioidosis are seen each year in Americans, nearly all of which can be attributed to travel. This is the first time doctors are seeing the illness seemingly originate within the contiguous US.

Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, melioidosis can take several weeks to set in after exposure to the pathogen. Symptoms include cough and shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, intermittent fever and body rashes, the CDC wrote in a message to physicians on how to spot the illness.

Risk factors for developing the disease include diabetes, liver or kidney disease, chronic lung disease, cancer or another condition that weakens the immune system, the CDC warned.

One of the known cases of melioidosis — involving a 4-year-old girl — was recently publicized in Texas. Preschooler Lylah Baker had no known risk factors for the illness when she was sickened in May. Lylah spent a month in the intensive care unit of Children’s Medical Center Dallas, requiring a ventilator and eventually suffering brain damage, according to the Dallas Morning News.

“She was a healthy, typical little girl about to start pre-K in the fall — no underlying health issues previously. I mean just nothing,” Ashley Kennon, the child’s aunt, told the newspaper. “So it was definitely a major surprise to everybody not knowing where [the bacteria] came from.”

Lylah is convalescing at Our Children’s House Dallas.

The CDC is urging doctors to be aware of melioidosis symptoms regardless of their patients’ locations and travels.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Google has rolled out a new internal calculator to explain potential pay cuts to employees who choose to work remotely — and the early results suggests it will penalize its suburban staffers.

Screenshots obtained by Reuters show that Google employees who previously commuted an hour to Google’s Manhattan offices from nearby Stamford, Conn., for example, would see their salaries slashed by 15 percent if they choose to continue working from home.

By contrast, “Googlers” who live within NYC’s five boroughs and choose to work from home permanently would not see their pay slashed at all.

The screenshots also showed 5 percent and 10 percent differences for commuters living in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.

Google employees who move even farther away from the company’s offices have been warned they could face even harsher pay cuts. A worker who left San Francisco for Lake Tahoe, another expensive area of California, would have their pay cut by a whopping 25 percent.

That would mean an employee with a $150,000 salary would suddenly make less than $112,000 per year.

The calculator states it uses US Census Bureau metropolitan statistical areas, or CBSAs. Stamford, Conn., for example, is not in New York City’s CBSA, even though many people who live there work in New York.

News of the Google tool comes amid a broader debate at tech companies about remote work and compensation.

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have all warned employees who plan to leave expensive cities like New York and San Francisco that their pay will be slashed — while smaller tech companies like Reddit and Zillow say they’ll pay the same regardless of where employees live.

Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination, said Google’s pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely, including families.

“What’s clear is that Google doesn’t have to do this,” Rosenfeld told Reuters. “Google has paid these workers at 100 percent of their prior wage, by definition. So it’s not like they can’t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.”

Google, which has about 140,000 employees worldwide, took in $61.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of this year alone.

The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Post and did not address the Stamford commuter issue in a statement to Reuters.

“Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marissa Rohan — the Los Angeles Dodgers ball girl — has been dubbed a “hero” after she tackled a fan who ran onto the field during Sunday’s 6-1 win over the rival Angels.

Rohan, who reps a No. 93 Dodgers jersey on the field, got the job done after a number of security personnel couldn’t catch the intruder. Rohan has worked for the team since 2019, but Sunday’s fan take-down is believed to be her first-ever viral field moment.

Rohan has been reposting messages and support from others to her Instagram Story. She even joked that Sunday was a “rough day at work.”

“Yeah I am not going to stop talking about this lol,” she captioned a news story about her play on Instagram.

The 24-year-old is a senior at Cal State Northridge, pursuing a degree in deaf studies. She is a proud member of Alpha Phi sorority.

Rohan is a former gymnast and softball player, according to past posts on her public Instagram account — where she documents her relationship with boyfriend Justin Fallon, a ticket operations supervisor with the Dodgers.

When she’s not saving the day at Dodger Stadium, Rohan is like any other college student. She enjoys snowboarding, partying in Vegas, snapping the occasional selfie, and hitting the beach with friends.

Bottom line: Don’t try to get past the Dodgers ball girl.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kevin Nealon isn’t worried about getting canceled.

“I’m pretty woke on all that stuff,” the “Saturday Night Live” alum told Page Six. “I have a 14-year-old [son Gabe with wife Susan Yeagley]. In school, they really teach them well. So anytime I start going astray he says, ‘No, you’re kind of going in the wrong direction.'”

But the 67-year-old comedian allows that he’s never been one to push the envelope in his act.

“I wouldn’t want to offend anybody or insult anybody … My act has always been very appropriate,” he explained.

“I’ve never been a risk-taker as far as that was concerned. I’ve never been one of those edgy, ranting comics who just seemingly say what’s on their mind and sometimes get into trouble.”

Nealon began his career in stand-up, joined “SNL” in 1987 and stayed on for a then-record-breaking nine seasons, playing characters like Mr. Subliminal, the politically incorrect private investigator Frank Gannon and, of course, Franz (of weightlifting duo Hans and Franz) alongside Dana Carvey.

Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey as “Hans and Franz” on “Saturday Night Live.”

“It was striking gold just to be on that show because I was more of a stand-up than an actor or a sketch player,” he said adding that his favorite thing about being part of “SNL” was working with musical idols like Paul McCartney and James Taylor, who would sometimes stay and play a private mini-concert.

Since leaving “SNL,” Nealon has carved out a steady career in shows like “Weeds,” “Last Man Standing,” and a string of Adam Sandler movies. And in between stand-up appearance, he updates his YouTube series, “Hiking with Kevin,” in which he goes on hikes with various celebs.

The Connecticut-raised star is currently in the midst of a stand-up tour and says that audiences have been great.

“I was thinking that maybe I got funnier,” he quipped, “but I think people are happy to be out there and more grateful — they appreciate what they have now. They want to enjoy life again.”

Nealon is a talented caricaturist. Instagram

If he decides to quit stand-up, Nealon could very well become a professional artist. He often features his incredible caricatures on social media, explaining that he took a ten-class course via Skype during the COVID-19 lockdown.

His visual prowess spans multiple mediums as well: Nealon has another Instagram solely dedicated to his photos of his wife, “Parks and Rec” alum Susan Yeagley, at different locales throughout the U.S.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The woman who Claudine De Niro berated at Le Bilboquet on Saturday night for getting her boyfriend Cuba Gooding Jr.’s phone number tells us she was “scared” by the incident and feels “traumatized.”

As Page Six previously reported, De Niro —who is the ex-wife of Robert De Niro’s son Raphael — caused a scene at the fancy Hamptons restaurant allegedly yelling at a woman who got the “Jerry Maguire” actor’s digits.

Now we can reveal that the woman at the center of the conflict was Lieba Nesis, a Harvard-educated lawyer and writer. She tells us De Niro was “aggressive” and “harassing [and] berating” her for at least an hour.

Nesis, who runs with the elite Hamptons and New York City social crowd, tells us that she and Gooding Jr. have known each other for seven or eight years.

“Not well, but we always say hello,” she said.

She says the Oscar winner told her at the restaurant that he’s shooting a film in Miami in September and looking for a place to stay, so she told him that she owns property there that was going to be empty while he was in town. He put his digits in her phone to follow up, Nesis says.

But De Niro saw the exchange go down and lost it.

“His girlfriend goes, ‘Oh my God, what are you doing? That’s my boyfriend! You can’t take down the number,’ and she’s screaming ‘What the f-ck are you doing!” Nesis tells us. “So I started to explain and she was like, ‘You better stop doing that. That’s my boyfriend.”

“She was going on and on so I walked into the other room and thought, ‘Ok, this will simmer down. I come back in and she’s pointing at me and screaming across the room, ‘You better get out of here. You better leave this place.’ Everyone is staring at me.”

“She wasn’t screaming at the top of her lungs,” she added, “but it was very intimidating to me.”

“I really was scared,” she said, “I am not going to fight. I wasn’t expecting to go out and get in a fight. I am spending thousands a weekend to go to the Hamptons and get away from negative energy, I don’t want to do drama. I was like, I’m not going to engage and hopefully she will calm down but she didn’t.”

Nesis says she went into another room again and sat on a sofa to get away from the situation, but that De Niro followed her.

“She comes and stands right on top of me where I am sitting like, ‘You better get the hell out of here,'” Nesis says, adding that De Niro was “cursing me out.”

She says that no one stuck up for her, except for former “Real Housewives of New York” star Jill Zarin, who tried to get management to step in — but nobody from the restaurant intervened.

“The more I tried to explain [that] I was just trying to help, the angrier she got,” Nesis says. “She kept saying, ‘That is my boyfriend, I am a broker, why was I trying to take your business.’ I told her I am not, I am a Harvard-educated lawyer. But she would get angrier and angrier and more out of control.”

Nesis adds, “She was saying she’s a real estate agent and we’re foes, but I don’t know her. I have never met her. I didn’t know she was a real estate agent and I am not a broker. I was in a state of shock. It was out of hand.”

According to her LinkedIn page, De Niro has worked for real estate company Compass for four months. She previously worked at Prudential Douglas Elliman.

Gooding Jr., for his part, seemed to cut and run as things took a turn.

“In the beginning, he was trying to explain and then he just disappeared out of sight,” Nesis says. “I guess he saw she wasn’t going to be mollified … He was somewhere but he wasn’t confronting the situation.”

Nesis wound up leaving to get out of the situation when it allegedly became clear after an hour that De Niro was not going to let up.

She says she now fears another run-in.

“It’s a small circle. I like Bilboquet. It’s a lot of fun,” she says. “I am terrified to go there now. I am worried about seeing her. I was traumatized. I am non-confrontational.”

“It’s like, is she dangerous?” Nesis said. “I wasn’t sure. I felt like I was in danger. You can’t be safe anywhere, even in the Hamptons.”

When we texted De Niro for comment, she wrote in all caps, “Jill Zarin and Lieba are full of s–t,” before texting a few more things and quickly deleting them from WhatsApp, and then adding, “No comment.”

A source previously told Page Six that De Niro’s reaction wasn’t about jealousy over Gooding Jr., but about business. “It’s disrespectful, if you know someone is a broker, to go to their [boyfriend] and offer them help with real estate,” they said.

That source also insisted that De Niro wasn’t yelling — though the original source told us she was loud enough to “make a scene.”

De Niro and Gooding Jr. have been dating since 2018, when Page Six first spotted the pair.

In 2019, De Niro was caught on camera berating Gooding Jr. at a bar in Miami, knocking bottles and glasses off the top of the bar before being removed by security. A lawyer for Gooding Jr., Mark Heller, said she got a “little overly playful” while partying with her beau. A source later said she was upset when the actor took a friend’s side over something she was upset about and “it was just a silly argument.”

Like many of us, rapper Cardi B doesn’t quite understand why so many celebrities have shared that they don’t bathe regularly, tweeting her confusion over the admissions Tuesday.

“Wassup with people saying they don’t shower? It’s giving itchy,” the “WAP” rapper, 28, tweeted after several stars admitted that daily showers just aren’t necessary in their household.

Jake Gyllenhaal is the latest to admit he doesn’t find bathing regularly “necessary.”

“More and more I find bathing to be less necessary, at times,” Gyllenhaal, 40, told Vanity Fair last week while promoting Prada’s Luna Rossa Ocean fragrance.

“I do believe, because Elvis Costello is wonderful, that good manners and bad breath get you nowhere. So I do that. But I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.”

Days prior, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard had explained that they wait for their daughters to “stink” before cleaning them.

Mila Kunis, 37, and Ashton Kutcher, 43, have also shared that they only gave baths to their kids, Wyatt and Dimitri, as infants when they could “see the dirt on them.”

“I didn’t have hot water growing up as a child, so I didn’t shower much anyway,” said Kunis of her own showering habits, with Kutcher adding, “I wash my armpits and my crotch daily, and nothing else ever. I got a bar of Lever 2000 that delivers every time.”

Not all celebs are skipping the soap and water, however, as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson waded into the discourse, insisting he showers multiple times a day.

“I’m the opposite of a ‘not washing themselves’ celeb,” the “Jumanji” actor, 49, tweeted Friday. “Shower (cold) when I roll outta bed to get my day rollin’. Shower (warm) after my workout before work. Shower (hot) after I get home from work.”

Johnson was soon joined by Jason Mamoa, who told Access Hollywood Monday, “I’m not starting any trends. I shower, trust me.”

“I’m Aquaman,” Mamoa, 42, added. “I’m in the f–king water. Don’t worry about it. I’m Hawaiian. We got saltwater on me. We good.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@They went from crush to crushed.

When she was isolating in Florida last year at the beginning of the pandemic, scared and lonely, Erin Davis had one thing driving her hope and racing heartbeat: Andrew Cuomo.

“Cuomo was my God,” said the 36-year-old Upper East Sider, who added that she’s drawn to older men. “I was crazy for him — I thought he was shamelessly sexy.” Davis, who works as a dating coach, even threw herself a “Cuomo de Mayo” party complete with cocktails and prints of Cuomo’s wide grin during lockdown.

But Davis’ fire for the governor started to melt after last week’s damning attorney general report outlined multiple instances of sexual harassment, including the groping of a female aide and instances of “unwanted groping, kissing, hugging and making inappropriate comments.”

And the 63-year-old Cuomo’s resignation speech Tuesday, which sought to downplay his behavior by chalking it up to “generational differences,” didn’t sit well with his legion of female fans such as Davis, many of whom identified as “Cuomosexuals” in the early days of the pandemic and lapped up every daily press conference he gave.

“It’s worse than betrayal. It makes you feel like your whole world has been rocked. As a single girl, it makes me question my taste in men, my ability to trust,” said Davis.

Once considered the crème de la crème of bachelors, the groping gov is no longer, ahem, untouchable.

“I couldn’t pay anyone to date him right now,” said Long Island matchmaker Maureen Tara Nelson, who revealed that Cuomo, along with his embattled brother Chris Cuomo, topped Nelson’s annual “Most handsome man in New York” survey in 2020.

Just last year, comedian and mom of two Talia Reese had gushed about Cuomo’s likeness to Al Pacino, telling The Post, “It’s like all these women are back in high school. We’re all in our pajamas, eating ice cream in bed, and he’s in a sharp suit, looking clean.”

What a difference a couple of scandals makes. “Murdering old people and grabbing asses is not even the thing that turned me off. For me, it was when he wrote a book about how great he is,” said Reese, who lives in Great Neck, NY. “I love a good sociopath, but that was a bit much considering how much he screwed up — and screwed around.”

Most loyalists want no part of the pervy politico now that his true colors have come to light.

“Now I just wonder about his intellect. It’s 2021. I kept hoping these allegations were old,” divorcee Denise Albert told The Post. “How could one person be so out of touch with the times and what’s not acceptable, appropriate and tolerable?”

Albert, 46, co-founder of multimedia company the Moms, had posted on Facebook in March 2020, “Is Governor Cuomo single? Not asking for a friend.”

And like his reputation, Cuomo merch, which was flying off the shelves for the past year, seemed destined for the trash can.

Indeed, online retailer RedBubble, which carried a full line of fawning Cuomo goods, showed a broken link for a “Cuomo We Trust” T-shirt, aptly reading, “This is a lost cause.”

But he’s got some lingering loyalists out there somewhere.

“We’ve probably sold about 100 mugs in the last two weeks,” said Johnny Blaze of Austin, Texas, who sells his wares on Etsy. His “Cuomo Sexual” mug that shows a bare-chested gov goes for $16.99.

“They sold really well last year and especially around Christmas, but I hadn’t sold any Cuomo gear in a long time. Then all of a sudden people started ordering that mug,” he said.

Still, any Cuomosexuals still swooning feel they’ve got to do so in secret.

“I didn’t think the report was that bad. I’m shocked he resigned,” said a 52-year-old finance exec from Long Island who requested anonymity for fear of being shamed for her continued attraction to Cuomo. “I do think he’s still dating material.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Troll, ’Bama, troll. Y’all have to check out the latest TikTok trend.

Haters have taken over the #Bamarush and #Alabamarush hashtags — both hubs for University of Alabama co-eds to submit sorority pledge tryout videos — in order to parody accents, attire and attitudes on full display by actual sister wannabes.

Ahead of the new school year, some colleges hold sorority recruitment before classes are even in session, and real-life Potential New Members (PNMs) at ’Bama are currently posting TikTok videos in which the pledge prospects dance or offer up a #fitcheck (show off an outfit) and an #OOTD (“Outfit of the Day”) — even rattling off clothing brands and stores — in the hopes of grabbing a sorority’s attention. In just three days, the combined hashtags have together topped 26 million views.

User @whatwouldjimmybuffetdo has one of the most-viewed videos under #Bamarush — topping 683,000 — in which Makayla and her friends model their rush outfits.

But as soon as TikTokers got wind of the PNM videos — as well as the pledges’ hypnotizing Southern accents — they rushed to the app and ripped on the spectacle, showing off down-market ensembles, mimicking pledges’ presentations and viciously lampooning the whole process.

Of course, it wasn’t all about throwing shade. Some actually seemed in awe of the parade of pledge prospects, with one viewer confessing, “I don’t know how I got on sorority rush TikTok, but I never wanna leave,” and suggesting the over-the-top pledge process put the 2020 Tokyo Olympics “to shame.” And, by the way, he was not alone in that assessment.

Meanwhile, others have even joined in by mocking their own apparently out-of-control obsession with Alabama sorority recruitment.

Roll, Crimson snide!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The annual Perseid meteor shower will fill the night sky with light and vibrant colors from now until Aug. 24.

The shower is expected to peak around Aug. 11 through 13, during which time up to 100 meteors an hour will shoot across the sky at 37 miles per second.

Don’t miss this “best meteor shower of the year” — as described by NASA — featuring fast and bright meteors that can be easily viewed outside this summer.

What is the Perseid meteor shower?

Perseid showers occur when Earth traverses through a trail of cosmic debris given off by 109PSwift-Tuttle — a comet that won’t return to the inner solar system until 2125, since it takes 133 years to orbit the sun. The meteors make the night sky shine because of their “fireballs.” Viewers will see larger and brighter explosions of light in the sky than in previous years, appearing for longer than a typical meteor streak.

109PSwift-Tuttle was discovered in 1862 by Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle independently of one another. The comet’s nucleus is 16 miles across, which is about twice the size of the space rock thought to have killed many dinosaurs 66 million years ago, according to Live Science.

According to NASA, the ideal time to see the showers is on the night of Aug. 11 or super early on Aug. 12, since the shower’s peak occurs before dawn. AFP via Getty Images

Why are the Perseids considered the “best meteor shower of the year”?

According to NASA, fireballs occur when larger particles of space rock interact with Earth. Although the meteors will appear all over the sky, the meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, the 24th largest constellation. The fast and vibrant space rocks often leave behind long streaks of light and color. And this year during the peak, the moon will be waxing crescent with only 13% illumination, meaning that moonlight will not drown out the colorful array of lights.

When is the Perseid meteor shower and what time will it peak?

The Perseids come to town each year in mid-July and will continue this year through Aug. 24, but they won’t always be easy to spot. According to NASA, the ideal time to see the showers is on the night of Aug. 11 or super early on Aug. 12, as the shower’s peak occurs before dawn. You can see meteors across the Northern Hemisphere sky without equipment if the sky is clear of light pollution. NASA’s meteor calculator and the International Dark Sky Association’s dark sky finder can reveal your best viewing spot.

Meteors can also be seen as early as 10 p.m. on any night the shower is happening, but chances are there will be fewer meteors to see. NASA recommends that people not look at their phones while watching the shower to help their eyes adjust to the dark. The eyes need about 30 to 40 minutes to get used to the dark, Bill Cooke, lead of NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, told Live Science.

Where is the best place to see the Perseid meteor shower?

Because the meteors will fill the sky, you don’t need to travel to a particular spot for the best views. However, it is recommended to find a dark spot away from urban areas, since city lights will mute fainter meteors. Also, don’t expect to see meteors right away — you might catch one immediately, but chances are that your eyes need to adjust to the dark sky. But don’t get discouraged: These meteors can appear anywhere at any time, which is why telescopes or binoculars are ill-advised.

Many photographers will likely be setting up their cameras to capture the shower’s peak, and Cooke said that photographers should bring a camera and a tripod. They should set up cameras to take a long exposure for a duration of a few seconds to a minute. Any longer than that and they risk getting the rotation of the stars in the photo, which may obscure the meteors.

Where else can I watch the Perseids?

International Dark Sky Parks will likely be the best places to go for amazing views of the Perseids. These include Grand Canyon National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park and Cherry Spring State Park, among many others.

Current weather predictions for the New York City area reveal partly cloudy skies, but you’ll still be able to catch a glimpse of colorful light. Some of the best places in New York City to view the Perseids include Inwood Hill Park, Floyd Bennett Field, Carl Schurz Park, and Pelham Bay Park.

Why are the meteors called Perseids?

The Perseid meteor shower takes its name from how the shooting stars appear to stream from a point where the constellation of Perseus is located. In Greek mythology, Perseus — the son of Zeus and Danaë — slays Medusa and rescues Andromeda from a sea monster. Some Catholics, though, refer to the Perseids as the “tears of Saint Lawrence,” since they are suspended in the sky but return to Earth once a year on Aug. 10, the canonical date of Saint Lawrence’s martyrdom in 258 AD.

When is the next meteor shower in 2021?

Before the much-anticipated Perseids, catch a glimpse of the Southern Delta Aquariids, which are best seen from the southern Tropics. The meteors, though, are quite faint and lack fireballs customary of the Perseids.

Meanwhile, the Delta Aquariids — which are active from July 3 through Aug. 15 — will next peak on July 28 and 29 at night. On that same night, the Alpha Capricornids will peak and they do, indeed, produce many bright fireballs — which are seen equally well from either side of the equator.

And mark your calendars this fall for the Orionids, a medium-strength shower that sometimes reaches high strength activity. The Orionids will peak on Oct. 20 and 21 at night, but don’t get your hopes up too much since Orionids only produce between 10 and 20 shower members maximum. Between 2006 and 2009, though, the peak rates were on par with the Perseids.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CONCORD, N.H. — An off-the-grid New Hampshire man’s days living as a hermit appear to be over. “River Dave,” whose cabin in the woods burned down after nearly three decades on property that he was ordered to leave, says he doesn’t think he can return to his lifestyle.

“I don’t see how I can go back to being a hermit because society is not going to allow it,” David Lidstone said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday.

Lidstone, 81, said even if he could rebuild his cabin, which burned down last week, “I would have people coming every weekend, so I just can’t get out of society anymore. I’ve hidden too many years and I’ve built relationships, and those relationships have continued to expand.”

Lidstone, a logger by trade who chopped his firewood and grew his food in the woods along the Merrimack River in the town of Canterbury. He initially built the cabin with his wife, from whom he is now estranged, although he said they are still married.

He said he’s not grieving the loss of his life in isolation.

“Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life,” said Lidstone, who drifted apart from his family. “I grew up never being hugged or kissed, or any close contact.

“I had somebody ask me once, about my wife: ‘Did you really love her?’ And the question kind of shocked me for a second. I … I’ve never loved anybody in my life. And I shocked myself because I hadn’t realized that. And that’s why I was a hermit. Now I can see love being expressed that I never had before.”

Lidstone declined to comment further on his relationship with his family. Two of his three sons had told the AP they hadn’t been in touch with their father recently, and his daughter did not respond to a message seeking comment.

On July 15, Lidstone was jailed on a civil contempt sanction and was told he’d be released if he agreed to leave the cabin following a property dispute that goes back to 2016. The landowner, 86-year-old Leonard Giles, of South Burlington, Vermont, wanted Lidstone off the property.

The property, undeveloped and mostly used for timber harvests, has been owned by the same family since 1963.

Lidstone had said a prior owner in the family gave his word years ago that he could live there, but had nothing in writing. He later disputed that he was even on the property.

In court Wednesday, both sides agreed to arrange for Lidstone to collect his cats and chickens and remaining possessions at the site; some items had been given to police for safekeeping. Lidstone, who still believes he was not on Giles’ land, also was given permission to hire a surveyor to give him “peace of mind,” Judge Andrew Schulman said.

A fire destroyed the cabin on Aug. 4, hours after Lidstone defended himself during a court hearing. He was released from jail the next day after the judge ruled that he would have less incentive to return to “this particular place in the woods,” now that the cabin had burned down.

Canterbury Fire Chief Michael Gamache said that while the investigation isn’t over and arson is not being ruled out as a potential cause, the fire was more likely caused by accident. He said a representative of Giles who was starting to demolish the cabin on Aug. 4 disabled solar panels, which still had electrical charge in them. He also used a power saw to cut into metal supports that held the panels onto the roof. Either action could have created sparks to start making things smoke.

“He finished his day at about a quarter of three, and a fire is noticed at about 3:15,” Gamache said.

He also said it’s also possible the results could be inconclusive. “Right now, there’s nothing left to go on at the site.”

In the meantime, many people across the country and beyond have offered to help Lidstone, either through fundraising or offering him a place to live. Lidstone said he is thankful for all the support. He’s still trying to figure out where he would go next, although he wouldn’t mind staying in New Hampshire, where he’s developed some strong connections.

One proposal under consideration is for him to live on property belonging to the Concord Friends Meeting, a Quaker meeting in Canterbury that’s not far from the cabin site. Lidstone worked on the meetinghouse as it was being constructed in 2010. The congregation would have to agree on the matter.

The property overlooks the Merrimack.

“It has certainly occurred to us that here is a neighbor in need,” said Richard Kleinschmidt, co-clerk of the Quaker meeting, “and how can we help him?”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@NAIROBI, Kenya — Dozens of women have described shocking sexual assaults by Ethiopian soldiers and allied forces in the country’s Tigray conflict, says an Amnesty International report published Wednesday, and its researcher calls it striking how the perpetrators appeared to act without fear of punishment from their commanders.

“All of these forces from the very beginning, everywhere, and for a long period of time felt it was perfectly OK with them to perpetrate these crimes because they clearly felt they could do so with impunity, nothing holding them back,” Donatella Rovera told The Associated Press.

She would not speculate on whether any leader gave the signal to rape, which the report says was intended to humiliate both the women and their Tigrayan ethnic group. In her years of work investigating atrocities around the world, these are some of the worst, Rovera said.

More than 1,200 cases of sexual violence were documented by health centers in Tigray between February and April alone, Amnesty said. No one knows the real toll during the nine-month conflict, as most of the health facilities across the region of 6 million people were looted or destroyed.

These numbers are likely a “small fraction” of the reality, Amnesty said. It interviewed 63 women, along with health workers.

A dozen women described being held for days or weeks while being raped multiple times, usually by several men. And 12 other women said they were raped in front of family members. Five women said they were pregnant at the time they were assaulted. Two said they had nails, gravel and shrapnel shoved into their vaginas.

“I don’t know if they realized I was a person,” one woman told Amnesty, describing how she was attacked in her home by three men. She was four months pregnant at the time.

The AP separately has spoken with women who described being gang-raped by combatants allied with the Ethiopian military, notably soldiers from neighboring Eritrea but also fighters with the neighboring Amhara region.

Amnesty has not received allegations against Tigray forces, who regained control of much of the Tigray region in late June and have since crossed into the Amhara and Afar regions in what they call an attempt to break the blockade on their land and pressure Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to step down.

While Ethiopian and allied forces retreated from much of Tigray in June, some remain in western Tigray, and Ethiopia’s government on Tuesday essentially abandoned its unilateral cease-fire as Abiy called all able citizens to fight.

The Amnesty report calls for accountability for the sexual violence during the conflict, saying rape and sexual slavery constitute war crimes. Many women in Tigray now live with the physical and mental effects of the assaults including HIV infections and continued bleeding, it said.

In a statement responding to the Amnesty report, Ethiopia’s government said it had previously acknowledged that “some members of the armed forces have engaged in conduct that is contrary to the clear rules of engagement and direction they have been given.”

Ethiopia’s statement also accused the human rights group of “sensationalized attacks and smear campaigns” against the government, while Eritrea’s information minister Yemane Gebremeskel in a tweet accused Amnesty of having a “hostile agenda” against his country, which borders the Tigray region to the north.

Earlier this year, Ethiopia’s government said three soldiers had been convicted and 25 others indicted for rape and other acts of sexual violence. But Amnesty said no information has been made available about those trials or other measures to bring perpetrators to justice.

A spokesman for the attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for an update Wednesday on any investigations.

Ethiopia’s government has not allowed human rights researchers into the Tigray region, though a joint investigation into alleged atrocities is underway by the United Nations human rights office and the government-created Ethiopian Human Rights Commission.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A 28,000-year-old lion cub mummy was discovered in Siberia — though it looks like it could have perished just yesterday.

Nicknamed Sparta, the cat’s golden fur covers a fully intact body with nary a wound or lesion, with eyes shut and claws still sharp, CNN reported.

The study of Sparta was led by Russian researchers Gennady Boeskorov and Alexey Tikhonov, whose report was just published earlier this month in the journal Quaternary, after the female cub’s discovery in 2017 by mammoth tusk hunters near eastern Russia’s Semyuelyakh River.

Findings on Boris, a male cub found approximately 50 feet from Sparta in 2018, were also included in their current study.

A 28,000-year-old cave lion cub mummy, named Sparta, is being called the “best-preserved” animal fossil found from the Ice Age. Love Dalén

Originally presumed to be related, radio-carbon dating later revealed that the two cubs, both between 1 and 2 months old when they died, arrived at their shared final resting place on vastly different timelines. Boris, they found, is approximately 43,000 years old.

But the spotlight is on Sparta.

“Sparta is probably the best-preserved Ice Age animal ever found and is more or less undamaged apart from the fur being a bit ruffled. She even had the whiskers preserved. Boris is a bit more damaged, but still pretty good,” said Swedish researcher Love Dalén, of the Center for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, who co-authored the international study.

Sparta was unearthed in 2017 by mammoth ivory miners on the banks of the Semyuelyakh River in eastern Siberia. Love Dalén

Neither Sparta nor Boris are thought to have been killed by a predator. However, various skeletal damage was noted in computed tomography scans. Dalén told CNN, “Given their preservation, they must have been buried very quickly. So maybe they died in a mudslide, or fell into a crack in the permafrost.”

The two cubs represent an ancient species called cave lions that roamed the harsh tundras of the Northern Hemisphere during the Ice Age. Known to grow slightly larger than today’s African lion, little is known about how these big cats survived such an extreme habitat.

Sparta and her co-study specimen Boris, an unrelated cave lion cub found nearby, were thought to have died by collapsing into a crack in the permafrost, remaining preserved for thousands of years. Quaternary

Sparta’s discovery was predated by the news of Dogor, an 18,000-year-old canine puppy also from the Yakutsk region in Siberia, whose remains were similarly intact and well-preserved. But despite its pristine mummification its true identity has continued to elude scientists: Is it a wolf or a dog?

Dalén predicts more discoveries like this will be made in the near future, pointing to climate change as well as “increased demand for mammoth ivory” as the source.

“There are definitely more finds being made these days,” said Dalén.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TEMBOK GEDE, Indonesia – A homemade robot designed by Indonesian villagers and scientists for fun has found a new use during the pandemic – bringing food, and hopefully a smile, to self-isolating residents who have contracted COVID-19.

An eclectic assembly of household items like pots, pans and an old television monitor, it is now named the “Delta robot” in a nod to the highly contagious variant of the coronavirus that has ripped through Indonesia.

“With this new Delta variant and the surging number of COVID-19 cases, I decided to turn the robot into one used for public services such as to spray disinfectant, deliver food and meet the needs of residents who are self-isolating,” Aseyanto, 53, a neighborhood leader who heads the project, said.

The robot’s head is made from a rice cooker, and it is operated by remote control with a 12-hour battery life. It is one of several robots made in the village of Tembok Gede, which has won a reputation for its creative use of technology.

After trundling down the street to the home of an isolating resident, its speaker emits the message “assalamu’alaikum” (Peace be with you), followed by “A delivery is here. Get well soon.”

Aseyanto, 53, a resident of the Tembok Gede neighborhood, operates the “Delta Robot”, made from household items like pots, pans and an old television monitor, in Surabaya, East Java province, Indonesia, August 7, 2021. REUTERS

The village lies within Surabaya, capital of East Java province and Indonesia’s second-biggest city, where a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections has swept in over in the past month.

Indonesia has become the epicenter of Asia’s COVID-19 outbreak and recorded more than 3.68 million infections and more than 108,000 deaths from the virus among a population in excess of 270 million spread across the vast archipelago.

“This Delta robot is very simple…. When we created this, we purely used materials in our neighborhood,” said Aseyanto, who goes by one name.

It is a far cry from the robots deployed in hospitality and for care in Japan and elsewhere, some of which have been adapted to help tackle the pandemic.

“For the base, we used a used toy car chassis,” said another team member, engineering lecturer Benazir Imam Arif Muttaqin.

Beyoncé’s fans have long identified as “the Beyhive,” but the legendary singer now has her own real-life beehives at home, she told Harper’s Bazaar for its September issue.

“Now I’m building a hemp and honey farm. I’ve even got hives on my roof!” she said.

She didn’t specify which of her properties her bees live on — Miami? Bel Air? New Orleans? — but she was most recently staying in the Hamptons with husband Jay-Z and their children, Blue Ivy, Rumi and Sir, at their $26 million mansion.

“During quarantine, I went from overindulgences to creating positive rituals drawing from past generations and putting my own spin on things … I’m so happy that my daughters will have the example of those rituals from me,” she told the magazine.

A representative did not return a request for confirmation about the beehives’ location. Beyoncé has also traveled to Miami in the past few months.

Queen Bey’s history with bees

Beyoncé hasn’t always loved bees. As a child, she and two other girls discovered bees in a bush that sent them screaming, a home video used in her recent advertising campaign with Adidas shows.

“Leave those bees alone!” a man, presumably Beyoncé’s father, can be heard saying in the video as a young Knowles screams on her front porch.

Beyoncé’s newfound interest in raising bees comes from the healing properties of honey, she said. Honey has been proven to have antibacterial properties, according to studies.

“I found healing properties in honey that benefit me and my children,” she said.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z purchased the gated, guarded Hamptons home on Georgica Pond in 2017. The main house spans 12,000 square feet, with seven bedrooms. The 2-acre estate also has a 1,800-square-foot guest cottage, Page Six reported.

The home is near a private airport, which has also dedicated space to beekeeping amid threats the celebrity-favorite transport hub could close.

Beekeeping has become increasingly popular in recent years. Martha Stewart is one celebrity fan of the hobby, and Long Islanders have hopped on the trend.

Beekeepers’ hives have popped up on Brooklyn rooftops, on the Bank of America Tower, on the Brooks Brothers flagship and in the homes of veterans — although not everyone has been happy about it.

On TikTok, beekeeping methodology has stirred controversy, The Post previously reported.

She’s growing hemp, too

Beyoncé is also growing hemp, she said in the interview.

“I discovered CBD on my last tour, and I’ve experienced its benefits for soreness and inflammation. It helped with my restless nights and the agitation that comes from not being able to fall asleep,” she said.

In 2019, Jay-Z became the chief brand strategist at California marijuana dispensary Caliva, a company which has now become part of “The Parent Company,” and Jay-Z’s title has been updated to Chief Visionary Officer, a representative told The Post.

Beyoncé’s father, Mathew Knowles, is a medical marijuana user who works in the marijuana farmland business, he told Page Six.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This model is redefining what it means to be holy — posting on OnlyFans.

Nita Marie, a self-proclaimed Christian OnlyFans model, asserts that stripping for strangers online is what “God wants me to do.”

“I asked God if I should continue stripping off and the answer was always yes,” the Colorado resident, 45, told Jam Press.

Marie believes it’s her divine mission to empower other women to embrace their sexuality.

The Godly model, who has 953,000 followers and earns $1.8 million a year, found Christianity after having a dream about Jesus when she was 9 years old. Although she was not raised in a religious household, she became more spiritual and tried to build a relationship with Christ — without all the misogyny.

“That experience helped me seek out Christianity and I built a relationship with Christ on a personal level, rather than one filled with doctrine written by men thousands of years ago,” Marie told Jam Press.

To her, God gave her sexuality as a gift to share with others, where both parties are consensual. Jam Press/@love_nitamarie

Marie asserted that Christianity has suppressed women’s sexuality from the beginning, but she believes this is not what God intended. To her, God gave her sexuality as a gift to share with others, where both parties are consensual.

“I want to let women and men know that there’s nothing wrong with embracing their sexuality and being religious,” she said. “It all starts with loving yourself and trusting that when you have a desire for sex, it is OK and healthy to ask for it.”

She views her role as a guide to help people have safe and healthy relationships with sex and their bodies. Jam Press/@love_nitamarie

Marie told the outlet that her job, as well as her views on sexuality and religion, have led some of her Christian friends and family to shun her and fall out with her. However, because she believes God told her to continue, she views her role as a guide to help people have safe and healthy relationships with sex and their bodies.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Country queen and “9 to 5” singer Dolly Parton has been working overtime again — at her upcoming book “Run, Rose, Run,” cowritten with author James Patterson.

The book marks the 75-year-old musician’s first novel — having already made her name as a 10-time Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, actress, television and film producer, theme park tycoon and humanitarian.

Like so many of Parton’s iconic songs, the story of “Run, Rose, Run” is about breaking free of convention and trauma. It follows Rose, a young woman who moves to Nashville to pursue her dream of making music, drawing on inspiration of her own past trauma.

“The source of her heart-wrenching songs is a brutal secret she has done everything to hide,” reads the plot from a press release sent to People. “But the past she has fled is reaching out to control her future — even if it means destroying everything she has worked for.”

“I cannot be more excited about the release of my very first novel ‘Run, Rose, Run’ with the great James Patterson,” Parton said in a statement. Representatives for Parton declined further comment to The Post.

“It’s been an honor — and a hell of a lot of fun — to work with the inimitable Dolly Parton, whom I’ve long admired for her music, her storytelling, and her enormous generosity,” said Patterson, 74, in his own statement.

Naturally, alongside the book, an eponymous album — featuring 12 songs “based on the characters and situations in the book” — will be released by Parton’s Butterfly Records.

“The mind-blowing thing about this project is that reading the novel is enhanced by listening to the album and vice versa,” added Patterson, the prolific author and creator of the “Alex Cross” series. “It’s a really unique experience that I know readers (and listeners) will love.”

The Post reached out to Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, a monthly book gifting program for children, about their founder’s latest literary accomplishment.

“While Dolly is quite a prolific author with two children’s books and several biography and inspirational books, it is exciting to see her working with James Patterson on this new project,” said Jeff Conyers, president of The Dollywood Foundation, in an emailed statement. “For over 25 years, Dolly has been helping grow the next generation of readers through her Imagination Library program, gifting over 163 million books to children early in life to help build the foundation for a lifelong love of reading.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mother knows best — and these moms say breast milk is the best milk for their school-age kids.

“My daughter Piper will be 7 years old in November and I breastfeed her twice a day or whenever she says she needs it,” extended breastfeeding advocate Kim Summer, 40, told The Post.

“At bedtime, she’ll say, ‘Can I have boo boo?’ and I give it to her,” the lactation specialist and birth doula added. “It’s a special bonding time for us that’s comforting, reciprocal and organic.”

Coco Austin, 42, wife of “Law & Order: SVU” star Ice-T, 63, recently defended her decision to continue breastfeeding their 5-year-old daughter Chanel.

“Chanel still likes my boobs,” the busty model told US Weekly ahead of World Breastfeeding Week (Aug. 1 to Aug. 7).

“Why take that away from her?” she continued. “If she doesn’t want it, alright, that’s where you stop it. But I’m not just going to say no.”

Austin’s milk-fueled admission sparked a firestorm of controversy on social media.

Austin has been labeled a “pervert” by online critics who object her extended breastfeeding practices. Twitter

Extended breastfeeding attackers have deemed the former Playboy pinup “sick” and “perverted” — criticisms Summer has also endured.

“I get a lot of really insane hate online,” the Santa Barbara, Calif., native said.

She unashamedly shares photos of herself breastfeeding Piper on Instagram in order to normalize long-term nursing.

“People tell me I should die, I’m gross and that Child Protective Services should take my baby away from me,” Summer said.

But she’s empowered, rather than deterred, by the detractors.

“I’m going to keep sharing our breastfeeding pictures because it’s important that people learn to become comfortable around seeing mothers nursing an older child,” she insisted — noting that in addition to breast milk, Piper enjoys a “well-rounded diet” of fruits, vegetables and her favorite snack, cheese enchiladas.

“It supports her physical, emotional and mental health,” Summer added. “And I’m going to do whatever I need to as a mom to make sure she stays healthy.”

Women like Summer make up the less than 2% of American mothers who breastfeed beyond 24 months, per research in the Developmental Psychology journal.

Jada Shapiro, founder of Brooklyn-based lactation education platform Boober, says breastfeeding beyond infancy and toddlerhood can be beneficial to both the mother and child.

“Research shows that children who are breastfed for a longer length of time are at a reduced risk for developing respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes and some childhood cancers,” said Shapiro, citing a study from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“The World Health Organization also found that women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers,” she added.

Then there are the emotional perks.

“When we’re breastfeeding, oxytocin, which is sometimes called the ‘love’ hormone, is released from the mother and child and that bonds us closer together,” Shapiro continued. “So prolonging your breastfeeding experience with your child beyond the 6- to 12-month-old marks only extends that bond.”

Upper East Side mother of five boys Marisa Mayer says breastfeeding her two youngest sons until they were 5 and 6 years old, respectively, helped solidify their mother-and-child relationship.

“I’m close with all my children,” said Mayer, 45, who’s volunteered as a lactation support leader with the La Leche League of Manhattan for 13 years.

The international organization helps mothers navigate the various intricacies of breastfeeding.

“And I’m very close to my two youngest, who are now 13 and 10, and we developed that special relationship over a longer period of time through breastfeeding,” Mayer added.

She credits extended breastfeeding with making her boys emotionally strong and self-assured preteens.

“They’re very confident and they’re able to express themselves [freely] because they grew up in this safe and comforting space we’ve created with this type of bonding,” she said.

Mayer says extensive nursing has been the most rewarding parenting feat.

“Breastfeeding my kids for as long as we needed to was a beautiful experience,” she said. “It’s my life’s greatest accomplishment.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A team of Australian researchers has discovered the country’s largest flying reptile.

The fearsome, long-necked pterosaur had a wingspan measuring seven meters in length and what the team calls a “spear mouth.”

According to a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Thapunngaka shawi was located at the geological Toolebuc Formation near Richmond in North West Queensland.

The authors noted that the Toolebuc formation shows the period when shallow seas covered around 60 percent of Australia.

In June of 2011, local fossicker Len Shaw uncovered the rostral portion of the new anhanguerian pterosaur’s crested mandible at a site called “water pond.”

“This is a very exciting find because pterosaurs are extremely rare, not just in Australia but worldwide. It was found 10 years ago by a gentleman called Len Shaw. So, Len used to work for Twin Council and he would be one of the front-end loader drivers. On his lunch break, he’d essentially fill up the bucket of the front-end loader with water and then sort of gently tip it onto a slopey area of the quarry. And, one day he did that and lo and behold the teeth sockets were staring back at him,” University of Queensland Ph.D. candidate and Co-Author Tim Richards explained in a Monday video detailing the find. “And, he knew he was onto something. And, um, he called over to the curator at the time of Kronosaurus Korner, Paul Stumkat and they excavated it. And, that’s it. That’s the story of our pterosaur.”

In a University of Queensland article, Richards said their pterosaur was “the closest thing [they[ have to a real life dragon,” pointing out that the skull alone would have been more than one meter long and containing 40 teeth used to catch food in what was once the Eromanga Sea.

The creature’s bones were thin-walled and relatively hollow.

The paper notes that pterosaur fossils are “exceptionally rare” down under and that fewer than 20 specimens had been described since the discovery of the continent’s first pterosaur around 40 years ago.

“The Lower Cretaceous (upper Albian) Toolebuc Formation of North West Queensland is the most productive horizon for Australian pterosaurs,” Richards and fellow author Dr. Steven Salisbury and Stumkat wrote in their abstract.

The group said their pterosaur had features that “indicate an affinity with Anhangueridae,” a known group of toothy pterosaurs and that their findings were “consistent with their reported cosmopolitan distribution during this period.”

“Thapunngaka shawi can be distinguished from other anhanguerids through the possession of a mandible with a smooth dorsal surface medially and uniquely sized alveoli that are positioned laterally along the jaw,” they wrote, noting that further phylogenetic analysis revealed a “close relationship” among all Australian anhanguerids and “points to an endemic Australian radiation within Anhangueridae.”

Salisbury told the university the genus was named in honor of the First Nations peoples of the Richmond area and incorporates words from the now-extinct language of the Wanamara Nation.

“Thapunngaka means ‘spear mouth’ in Wanamara, the language of the people on whose Country the fossils were found,” he wrote in a Monday tweet.

“The species name, shawi, honors the fossil’s discoverer Len Shaw, so the name means ‘Shaw’s spear mouth,'” he said.

As the third-largest anhanguerian pterosaur known worldwide, the paper said that Thapunngaka shawi “provides further evidence for the existence of an increasingly diverse range of large crested pterosaurs in the Australian part of eastern Gondwana during the Cretaceous.”

“There’s always more to find,” Richards said. “There’s always more ground to scratch through.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The infrastructure bill the Senate passed Tuesday discriminates against white people at every turn.

Americans are enthusiastic about spending money on physical infrastructure — bridges, roads, broadband. But this racist bill hands out jobs and contracts and locates projects based on race, not merit. Minority businesses and neighborhoods hold the inside track. If you’re white, you’re low-priority.

The bill includes grants to install solar or wind technologies and generate jobs in areas decimated by closing coal mines or coal-fired electric plants. Here’s the catch: When contractors bid, the bill says minority-owned businesses will get selected first. Bad news for small-time white contractors in depressed areas.

The same is true for the bill’s proposals to improve traffic patterns in cities. Contractors and subcontractors get priority only if they’re owned by minorities or women. White male business owners can take a hike.

Americans should be outraged — but not surprised. After all, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act, passed in March, also put into place an ugly system of discrimination against whites. It offered debt relief to black farmers, but not white farmers. Another provision offered billions in aid to minority-owned and women-owned restaurants, but told struggling restaurants owners who happened to be white men that they had to go to the back of the line.

The injustice was obvious. White male farmers and restaurant owners sued, claiming the anti-white provisions are unconstitutional. So far, these challengers are winning. In every case, federal judges have halted the race-based programs in the American Rescue Plan Act until the challengers have their day in court. Politico reported last week that Biden’s Justice Department may fold without a fight on the black-farmer debt relief cases, because the law isn’t on the administration’s side.

The infrastructure hides discriminatory policies behind popular public works projects. EPA/JUSTIN LANE

You would think Democrats and the Biden White House would get the message. Instead, they’re doubling down on rigging legislation and divvying up taxpayer dollars to benefit minorities and shortchange whites.

Chances are high the infrastructure bill’s hodgepodge of anti-white discrimination will be struck down by federal courts. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution bars government from trying to even the score by discriminating against whites and in favor of minorities. The justices warned against creating “a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations” to correct past injustices. That’s precisely what this infrastructure bill does.

The bill’s backers would have you believe that obsolete airports, dilapidated public works and deteriorating roads and public spaces are evidence of racial injustice. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY) rails that “our infrastructure is racist” and calls on the Congress to pass a bill that “puts the needs of underserved and disadvantaged communities at the fore.”

That’s code for minority communities. But the truth is, there are plenty of poor white people in this country, too, and poor, predominantly white communities that could benefit from a bold federal infrastructure initiative. Race and ethnicity should have nothing to do with it. Locate the projects and put the funds where the economic need is greatest, regardless of race.

West Virginia has the lowest average income in the nation and ranks 46th in internet connectivity. Maine ranks 36th out of 50 states for income, and 34th in broadband connectivity. People in these states could really benefit from federal broadband assistance. Here’s the hitch: The infrastructure bill tilts the grant scale in favor of states with high minority and non-English-speaking populations, instead of considering only economic need and existing broadband capacity. Because Maine and West Virginia are 94 percent white, they’ll get less.

Polls show that Americans favor fixing roads, bridges, tunnels and airports. They know that good infrastructure promotes economic growth. But they’ve been kept in the dark about the fine print in the bill. Under the guise of upgrading the nation, the bill unfairly treats whites like second-class citizens.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She gave them a false sense of immunity.

A German nurse is being investigated for allegedly injecting thousands of people with a placebo instead of the coronavirus vaccine.

Based on witness testimony, police investigator Peter Beer said there was “a reasonable suspicion” that the rogue medical professional had administered shots of saline solution to up to 8,600 patients who were slated to receive the COVID jab, Reuters reported.

“I am totally shocked by this episode,” Sven Ambrosy, a local councilor, said of the alarming switcheroo, which reportedly occurred in March and April in Friesland in northern Germany.

It’s unknown why the shot-blocker — reportedly a Red Cross nurse — had injected people with blanks; however, she had reportedly broadcast anti-vax views on social media, investigators reported.

And while the faux jab was harmless, it may have disproportionately affected elderly people, who are at a greater risk of contracting the virus.

In order to prevent casualties from the fake shots, authorities are imploring thousands of people to get a second jab.

“The district of Friesland will do everything possible to ensure that the affected people receive their vaccination protection as soon as possible,” Ambrosy wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post.

Unfortunately, the nurse isn’t the first medical practitioner to express anti-vax views. In June, a Texas hospital suspended 178 employees for two weeks without pay for refusing to get the coronavirus vaccine.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A video clip shows Hunter Biden naked while recounting how he was passed out in a pool when a computer with recordings of him engaged in “crazy” sex acts was stolen — possibly for blackmail purposes, according to a report Wednesday.

The conversation took place while Biden and an unidentified woman lounged around in the nude after having sex in January 2019, the Daily Mail said.

“They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing like f—ing crazy [bleep] sex [bleep],” Biden said, according to a 3-minute, 40-second video clip posted online.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked.

“Last summer,” Biden answered.

Earlier, Biden said the theft took place while he “was in the [bleep] pool, facedown” and the people he was with “wouldn’t call an ambulance,” according to the newly surfaced video.

“And somebody stole it during that period of time,” he said.

If the account is accurate, it would mean that Biden, 51, lost as many as three laptop computers, including one that he’s said he may have abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and another that federal agents reportedly seized from the Massachusetts office of former celebrity psychiatrist Keith Ablow. The Post was not able to independently verify the video clip posted by the Daily Mail.

Biden said he suspected the crook who stole his computer was one of “three guys that were like a little, like, group.”

“The dealer and his two guys. Like, I took them everywhere,” he said.

“But how long ago did this happen? You said before—,” the woman asked Biden.

Throughout the recording, Biden — who has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions — sounds agitated and much of what he says is inaudible.

At one point, the woman suggested that if the thief had the videos, they “would have been out already.”

“No, no, no. Because [inaudible] running for president,” Biden said.

Biden’s father, Joe Biden, launched his successful 2020 bid for the White House in April 2019.

Biden has acknowledged repeated struggles with drug and alcohol addictions.

The woman asked Hunter Biden if the laptop thief was trying to blackmail him.

“No. I make like a gazillion dollars,” he said, sounding confused.

“No, the guy who took the computer,” the woman said.

The ensuing exchange is largely inaudible and includes Biden saying both, “No way” and “In some way, yeah.”

Biden also appeared to suggest that he might get a percentage of whatever the thief earned by anonymously selling the videos to a celebrity gossip website.

The Daily Mail said the clip it posted online is contained on a hard drive copied from the MacBook Pro left at the Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

Last year, The Post was the first to report on the laptop’s contents, which include emails detailing Biden’s former overseas business dealings, lurid personal photos and a 12-minute video that appears to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

Imitation isn’t always the sincerest form of flattery — at least when it comes to the morning TV wars.

After news broke on Wednesday that “CBS This Morning” was replacing veteran journalist Anthony Mason with former football star and “Extra” correspondent Nate Burleson, several industry insiders told us the network is admitting they’re in trouble by copying rival “Good Morning America.”

And it doesn’t help that the CBS show also announced in May it’ll be filming from a new studio directly across the street from “GMA” in Times Square.

”They’re basically copying ‘GMA.’ They’re moving to Times Square, hiring a [Michael] Strahan. What’s next? Cooking segments? They’re clearly in trouble,” one industry source sniped.

Meanwhile, another source told us that “GMA” staffers are “all shook over why CBS is copying them. It’s all the talk this morning at ABC,” they said.

The move comes as ratings for NBC’s “Today” — once the top of the morning show heap — continue to lose ground to “GMA.” This season-to-date, “GMA” is reportedly the most-watched morning show for the 9th consecutive year, and has this year increased its lead over “Today” to its biggest in four years. (Though “Today” did add viewers during its Olympics broadcasts.)

“CBS This Morning” remains at the bottom.

An ABC insider admitted there was buzz around the news, but “‘shook’ is not the way to describe it,” the source said. “Look at the numbers. Do you think ‘GMA’ would be threatened by CBS?”

CBS’ Strahan-like hire is “taking a page from the playbook. It’s an interesting move for them,” they added.

Another person from a competing network scoffed, “This is the same show [that] put out a statement about not wanting to [have anchors] dress up for Halloween! They planted a stake on Halloween as opposed to having fun, and now a football player is at the table? ‘Real Sports’ wasn’t hiring? It’s insulting to journalists.”

Burleson’s hire comes after former president of ABC-owned television stations Wendy McMahon fled the network to become president and co-head of CBS News and TV stations earlier this year.

“It’s interesting that they’ve put an ABC person in place over there, and she’s running the show. I commend them for recognizing a winning playbook and stealing it, but it could be a recipe for disaster,” the ABC source said.

Another source familiar with Burleson’s hire told us “they were grooming him” to take over after he filled in while co-anchor Tony Dokoupil was away on paternity leave. “Hollywood and this business only find value in former NFL players right now. It’s the Strahan effect. It’s not even a subtle trend,” they said.

In addition to co-anchoring “CBS This Morning,” Burleson’s overall deal will include a role as an analyst at CBS Sports’ “The NFL Today” and regular appearances on Nickelodeon, according to Variety. He’ll join Gayle King and Dokoupil at the table in September.

Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations, described Burleson as the “perfect fit for mornings on CBS” in a press release.

“There is no doubt that Nate’s experiences and broader interests in news, sports and entertainment will be an exciting addition to the table with Gayle and Tony as we continue to evolve the format of the broadcast to double down on news, original reporting, great storytelling and a broad range of feature pieces that appeal to viewers across the country,” he said in an internal memo.

For $100,000 initiation fee and $15,000 a year, members will have access to a 24/7 “private office,” which will take care of all travel planning “from facilitating private charters by land, sea, and air, to pre-planning unique experiences across Aman resorts,” as well as upgrades, lax check-in and check-out times, on-demand spa treatments, and access to a private club space, according to a presentation and pricing sheet seen exclusively by Page Six.

Members, which they have dubbed “Founders,” “can expect privileged access to global sporting events, fashion weeks and behind-the-scenes visits to artists’ studios,” it states.

It will also go beyond a guest’s hotel stay. “At home — beyond the resorts, this bespoke support is offered for individual wellness programs to private event planning with our ‘Aman at home’ experiences.”

The membership plan outline explains, “Experts in nutrition, health and fitness will create entirely bespoke, constantly evolving programs for Founders, offering ongoing support and guidance as their wellness journey progresses both on- and off-property.”

The annual dues are required to be paid before the hotel’s NYC opening. According to the website, the new hotel, on 57th Street in the Crown Building, will offer 83 rooms, a “Garden Terrace & Bar,” a three-floor spa, as well as a jazz club and a members-only space.

The membership applies to both the NYC club and global properties.

Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, the Kardashians, Angelina Jolie, David Beckham, George and Amal Clooney, Tom Hanks, and members of various royal families are fans of Aman, which has over 30 properties in 20 countries.

The chain, owned by Russian billionaire Vladislav Doronin, also plans on opening Tokyo and Miami locations.

No-no juice.

Mama June Shannon’s longtime boyfriend, Geno Doak, has been sentenced in his Alabama drug case, landing 16 months in Macon Community Corrections after copping a plea deal.

But TMZ reports that while the reality star will be registered as an inmate, he won’t actually be incarcerated. Instead, he will have strict rules to follow, with violations leading to actual jail time.

Doak’s drug paraphernalia charge was dismissed as part of his plea deal, and he will be placed on probation for two years after he serves his 16 months. Shannon’s beau is also required to complete substance abuse evaluation/treatment.

Doak, 45, and Mama June, 42, were arrested at an Alabama gas station in 2019 after a domestic dispute. The following week, both were charged with felony possession of a controlled substance — listed as crack cocaine — and drug paraphernalia, with Doak picking up an additional domestic violence charge.

As for Mama June, the “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” star pleaded not guilty in Oct. 2019 and was ultimately sentenced to 100 hours of community service. She also agreed to several provisions to avoid jail time, including remaining sober.

By August 2020, Shannon was celebrating six months of sobriety, shortly after admitting to having previously spent nearly $1 million on drugs for herself and Doak.

“I would say the last year of our addiction, probably a good $900,000,” the TLC star confessed. “So much money was sent to our dope man.

“In this industry, it’s kind of crazy that until you get busted it’s okay, and I think that is the wrong way to be, but it is — it’s true,” she added.

Reps for Mama June Shannon did not immediately return our request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@From tourist trap to culinary nirvana. That’s been the long, strange trip of Pier 17 in the Seaport District, previously known as the South Street Seaport.

Current Seaport owner the Howard Hughes Corp. lured marquee-name chefs — Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Andrew Carmellini and David Chang — and their arrival has proved transformational. The new pier, which resembles a floating fortress more than a dock for ships, has blossomed into a one-stop-noshing complex for three of the city’s most exalted chefs.

This isn’t your mommy or daddy’s Seaport of the 1980s, ’90s or early aughts with its tacky bars and bistros that relied on harbor views to draw tourists and boozy Wall Street Yuppies. (Remember them?)

Rather, the Seaport and the pier, especially, are now a mecca for actual New Yorkers to live and play. Today, some 70,000 of them call the FiDi home, as opposed to the day when 95 percent of the area was devoted to office space. Seaport visitors were 83 percent local just before the pandemic, according to the Howard Hughes Corp., and with travel limited, it’s above 90 percent today.

In addition to spots from top toques, the Pier’s other offerings include farm-to-table fare from Malibu Farm and rooftop revelry at the Greens. But it’s the new projects from Vongerichten, Carmellini and Chang that are really satisfying residents’ appetites.

“With three great restaurants, I no longer have to trek to Soho, the West Village or Tribeca to be in the mix,” said Merv Matheson, the CEO of lifestyle management firm Inner Circle Connect, who lives in the FiDi. “I can keep it all within walking distance.”

Have a look.

Carne Mare

Previous 1 of 3 Next Chef Andrew Carmellini recently opened Carne Mare on Pier 17 in Manhattan. The gorgeous new dining room at Carne Mare. An exterior shot of Carne Mare.

Several years in the making, Carmellini’s newly opened, two-story Italian-style chop house was worth the wait. The richly furnished main dining room, up a curving staircase from a rollicking horseshoe-shaped bar, is decked out with lacquered terracotta walls and brass trim galore. Tuscan leather banquettes face each other to maximize people-watching. You might well spot Carmellini himself running things in the open kitchen. There are a few al fresco tables, but the heart of the restaurant is inside, making it the coziest place on the pier in cold or rain.

The menu boasts an array of carpaccios and tartares ($18 to $23), along with wonderful salads ($15 to $17), each large enough to share, including an excellent Sicilian-style Caesar with sesame dressing. US prime cuts of beef ($36 to $185) are the stars of the show. The Gorgonzola-cured Wagyu strip loin sirloin is an original preparation with a winning musky depth that doesn’t overwhelm the beef. There’s even old-fashioned tableside service for certain dishes such as steamed black sea bass that’s skinned and sauced before your eyes.

“It’s my favorite new place to dine,” enthused Ronnie DeMichael, who’s with Roc Nation Apparel Group and lives a short stroll away.

Favorite dishes include smoked sweet-and-sour ribs ($19), cacio e pepe rice cakes with truffles ($48), and a sizzling, kalbi-marinated flank steak ($36) that rightfully seems to be ordered by just about every table.

Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s jumbo seafood joint finally hit full stride this summer after braving two pandemic closings and several redesign tweaks.

There are 240 seats indoors and out across two levels. For my money, the Brooklyn-facing outdoor seats are the best in the house, with expansive views of the bridges and harbor that make up for the ceaseless thrum of helicopters overhead. My favorite dishes include crispy fish tacos made with Icelandic cod ($19), an unusual mozzarella-and-octopus appetizer ($24) and roasted black sea bass ($54).

The views and the food from Vongerichten and chef Noah Poses are so delicious, even uptowners are coming down to the pier.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He was struggling to “pea.”

A randy Michigan man redefined “c-block” after he got six kidney beans lodged in his urethra during a bizarro attempt at sexual gratification.

The unnamed 30-year-old patient had reportedly wanted to “express the beans during ejaculation,” according to the wince-worthy report published in the journal Urology Case Reports.

So the sexual eccentric shoved six kidney beans in his urethra and attempted to expel them via “natural emission.” However, his pea shooter jammed during the process, prompting him to try to remove them with tweezers.

When that failed, he reported to the hospital, where he informed doctors that he was struggling to “pea.”

A CT scan showing three of the beans in the distal penile urethra. Margeaux Dennis et al.

The backed-up bean stalker also admitted it wasn’t his “first time participating in this practice, although he never attempted to utilize this many beans.” A subsequent CT scan confirmed that the poor soul harbored six beans in his urethra, which measured 15 mm by 7 mm each. Four were located between the urethral entrance and the urine pouch, while another had strayed all the way into the bladder.

After initially failing to extract the urethral infiltrators, medics managed to remove one legume by applying numbing cream to the area and then squeezing the penile passageway, the researchers reported.

They eradicated the rest of the beans the following day via a complex process that involved holding the man’s urinary entrance open and inserting a tube through which they passed surgical implements. They then plucked out the taco toppers with a tweezer-like tool and placed them in a basket.

Despite the highly invasive procedure, the frijole fetishist suffered “minimal” trauma to his urethra and was discharged the following day.

Thankfully the beans were extracted with minimal trauma to the man’s urethra. Margeaux Dennis et al.

He should thank his lucky stars. In a similar instance of beans in the urethra, the legumes had swollen to the point that endoscopic retrieval was impossible.

It’s unclear why someone would ever treat their manhood like a rainstick. However, experts say the sexual proclivity stems from psychiatric illness, sexual assault or even attempts to, somewhat paradoxically, “relieve urinary obstruction,” per the study.

Experts have also blamed “sounding,” a bizarre sexual proclivity defined by sticking foreign bodies in one’s urethra. In October 2019, a man in Saudi Arabia made the world wince after revealing that he’d harbored tweezers in his urethra for four years.

Unsurprisingly, scholarship on the subject is scarce due to its “taboo nature.”

Researchers analyzed the cognitive performances of 672 children born in Rhode Island, 188 of them born well into the pandemic (after July 2020), 308 born before it (prior to January 2019) and 176 of them born during its beginning stage (between January 2019 and March 2020). They found that children born during the pandemic have pronouncedly lower IQs than those born before it.

“Parents are stressed and frazzled. The ability to course-correct becomes smaller the older that child gets.” Sean Deoni

“It’s not subtle by any stretch,” lead study author and Brown University associate professor of pediatric research Sean Deoni told the Guardian of the trend. “You don’t typically see things like that, outside of major cognitive disorders.”

Authors attribute the pattern to children being cognitively impaired from spending so much time inside with overwhelmed parents during the past year. While many adults have managed to tough it out, so much isolation at a critical juncture in the mental progress of infants has likely caused lasting damage.

Not being exposed to the wider world as much as pre-pandemic children and instead spending their infancy with stressed adults has left them at a significant mental disadvantage than their slightly older peers, according to the not-yet-peer-reviewed findings published Wednesday.

“Parents are stressed and frazzled … that interaction the child would normally get has decreased substantially,” said Deoni, adding that the lack of stimulation during the pandemic has created setbacks that will be hard for children to overcome. “The ability to course-correct becomes smaller the older that child gets.”

Children from less financially secure families were impacted the most, researchers noted.

“Perhaps not surprising that children from lower socioeconomic families have been most affected as this resonates with many of the other financial, employment and health impacts of the pandemic,” University College London child health professor Sir Terence Stephenson told the Guardian.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sometimes the facts are stranger than fiction — and sometimes the facts are plagiarized.

The co-founder of myth-debunking website Snopes has been exposed as a plagiarist, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation.

David Mikkelson, who launched Snopes in 1995 with a mission to be “the internet’s definitive fact-checking site,” was suspended by his company, Doreen Marchionni, Snopes’ VP of editorial and its managing editor, confirmed to BuzzFeed, after their reporters uncovered no less than 54 plagiarized articles by Mikkelson.

“Let us be clear: Plagiarism undermines our mission and values, full stop,” Marchionni said in a statement on Friday. “It has no place in any context within this organization.”

In response to the investigation, Mikkelson said, “There is no excuse for my serious lapses in judgement. I’m sorry.”

BuzzFeed wrote that Mikkelson’s Snopes posts contained phrasing — even entire paragraphs — lifted from outlets such as the New York Times, CNN, the Guardian, the LA Times and the BBC between 2015 and 2019, often under the byline “Snopes staff” or while using the pseudonym Jeff Zarronandia.

“Zarronandia” was illustriously described in his Snopes bio as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and someone talented at “mule-skinning,” whose seemingly informed stories on everything from arts and culture to national politics had in the past drawn ridicule from the likes of former Donald Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone, BuzzFeed said.

David Mikkelson founded Snopes.com with then-wife Barbara Hamel in 1995, billing the site as “the internet’s definitive fact-checking site.” David Mikkelson

Snopes’ reporters have also jointly issued a statement, writing that they “strongly condemn these poor journalistic practices,” adding that they “work hard every day to uphold the highest possible journalistic and ethical standards.”

As of late Friday, Snopes had retracted 60 articles and disable advertisements on those webpages, according to the New York Times, and will continue making retractions as they conduct their own internal investigation. The company was said to have already flagged 140 articles for review.

One such cribbed passage, written by Jon Schuppe for NBC News, appeared on Snopes.com under Mikkelson’s own byline: “Muhammad Ali, the silver-tongued boxer and civil rights champion who famously proclaimed himself ‘The Greatest’ and then spent a lifetime living up to the billing, is dead.”

Mikkelson attempted to explain for his crimes in an interview with BuzzFeed. “I didn’t come from a journalism background,” he told them. “I wasn’t used to doing news aggregation. A number of times I crossed the line to where it was copyright infringement. I own that.”

Mikkelson insists that Zarronandia was created as a “stress-relief thing” during the fraught 2016 presidential election, when the concept of “fact-checking” became an ethical beacon for some, and a political bane to others.

“Let’s have some fun and watch these people vent their spleen inventing reasons why this nonexistent persona is biased,” he said.

However, insiders revealed to BuzzFeed that Mikkelson’s habit was driven by a need to drive traffic to the website — by being one of the first sites to rehash the most trending news headlines.

“He would instruct [writers] to copy text from other sites, post them verbatim so that it looked like we were fast and could scoop up traffic, and then change the story in real time,” Snopes’ former managing editor Brooke Binkowski told BuzzFeed. “I hated it and wouldn’t tell any of the staff to do it, but he did it all the time.”

The revelation comes in the aftermath of the heated divorce between Mikkelson and Snopes’ co-founder Barbara Hamel in 2015, which led to Hamel’s share of the company being sold to tech firm Proper Media. In 2017, the company filed suit against Mikkelson, claiming he’d mismanaged Snopes’ finances — and at the same time Mikkelson launched his own GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the website.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Looks like Steve Cohen can add a $21.6 million ultra-luxurious Florida estate to his expanding portfolio.

The New York Mets owner now has a warm place to escape to as winter approaches up north in the coming months. On Aug. 9, the hedge funder and 97.2% team owner closed on the sale of a 31,000-square-foot mansion located in an unincorporated area of Palm Beach County near Boca Raton and west of Delray Beach.

The move comes nearly three years after he sold his last Florida property in 2017 for $6.4 million, property records show — a relatively modest home compared to his newly purchased Palm Beach abode.

Background on the buyer: In 2012, Cohen was initially a minor owner of the Mets with an 8% stake. But last year, in an agreement with fellow MLB owners and several negotiations, Cohen won majority control of the team, beating out bids from the likes of Alex Rodriguez, who was reportedly angry at losing out on the deal.

The former Yankee blamed J.P. Morgan and loudly griped that the process had been rigged.

“I don’t think it ended well with JPM,” one source previously told The Post, noting that J.P. Morgan “did everything for A-Rod in the Mets deal,” and that the bank didn’t appreciate being blamed for losing the MLB team to Cohen.

In January, Cohen found himself involved in the infamous GameStop controversy.

Point72, his $22 billion hedge fund, saw significant losses due to its investment in Melvin Capital. Melvin was nearly wiped out when it placed a large bet against the video game retailer after amateur traders on the WallStreetBets subreddit recognized that — because hedge funds like Melvin had so heavily “shorted” GameStop and other stocks — they were vulnerable to any kind of run on the stock.

After receiving backlash on social media from the fallout, Cohen temporarily deactivated his social media accounts — but it appears the GameStop frenzy was short-lived, and Cohen bounced back fairly quickly. And what better way to rebound than with a mega-mansion in the Sunshine State?

In 2019, he sold his West 12th Street triplex for $30 million after only a month on the market.

But that still leaves him with two summer Hamptons homes worth a combined $80.5 million, as well as another West Village residence worth $38.8 million.

His main residence, worth an estimated $23 million, is located in Greenwich, Connecticut, and spans a massive 35,000 square feet with 18-plus acres.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s time to add some long-term thinking to your short-golf game.

A new climate change themed mini golf course opened on the Williamsburg waterfront last month, weaving critical lessons about the future of the city and planet into 18 sustainably built holes.

It’s just one of three exciting new little links New Yorkers have to choose from this summer. The two other courses bring beloved animated characters to life: You can now try your luck flinging your ball around Angry Birds landscapes, or bank your shots off the worlds of “Toy Story,” “Soul,” “Ratatouille” and other hit films in a new Pixar themed course. (Unlike the movies, crying is optional.)

Grab your (tiny) clubs and get out there.

A windmill is usually an annoying obstacle in a mini golf course, but here it’s a hopeful vision of the future. The spinning blades at Putting Green, the new climate change themed mini golf course on the Williamsburg waterfront, are a nod to both the sustainable wind energy that once powered New Amsterdam and the offshore wind farms that could power New York City today. That’s just one of the forward-thinking holes at the newly opened course from Two Trees, the developer that built the adjacent Domino Park. The course is located on the edge of the East River with a view of Manhattan that underscores how climate change could forever change the city.

To infini-tee, and beyond! A Pixar themed putt-putt course just debuted in Battery Park City, letting kids of all ages walk through iconic scenes and play among their favorite characters. The officially licensed course, which first appeared in Australia, has a higher price than most (an adult ticket is almost $40), but details from the films are rendered with careful attention.

This mini golf course is filled with Pixar movie references, including the balloon house from “Up” and a cheese plate from “Ratatouille”. Jeremy Daniel (www.jeremydanielp

You can putt around the house from “Up,” the structure poised to be lifted into the air by balloons. Elsewhere, golfers navigate a cutting board from “Ratatouille” loaded with crème fraîche, cheese and a baguette, and work through a life-size claw game filled with those freaky aliens from “Toy Story.” Fans will enjoy finding references to various Pixar flicks throughout the course, from the art on the side of the van from “Onward” to the goofy expressions of the birds from “Finding Nemo.”

Put down your phone and pick up a club to try your luck at Angry Birds mini golf, an interactive re-creation of the popular mobile game and movies. The 18 themed holes opened in October, in the massive shopping mall/amusement park/sports complex at the Meadowlands. It calls itself a “not-so-mini” golf course, using American Dream’s sprawling footprint to its advantage, with large cliffs and re-created landscapes from the bird-flinging phone game. The highlight is the slingshots: Just like in the game, you can use slingshots instead of a golf club at certain tees to fling your ball into play. You don’t get to knock over towers of pigs like you do in the game, but, spoiler warning, you do get to launch a ball right at a pig’s face for the final hole.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hazardous smoke from massive wildfires raging across the western US have likely caused COVID-19 infections and deaths to surge in several states, according to a new study.

Tiny pollutant particles known as PM2.5s — which invade the respiratory system and cause inflammation — may have raised the infection rate by nearly 20 percent in some counties in California, Oregon and Washington amid record-breaking wildfires last year, according to Harvard University researchers.

Overall, more than half of all COVID-19 deaths in the areas were linked to the pollution, according to the study, published this week in the journal Science Advances.

“Combining wildfires with this pandemic can have a really disastrous effect. It’s disturbing,” Francesca Dominici, a professor at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health who co-authored the research, told The Guardian.

“In some counties the association was very strong indeed – on days with lots of wildfire smoke the Covid cases went up by a lot,” she said.

The total number of COVID-19 infections linked to the wildfire smoke in the three states between March and December 2020 was 19,742 and the number of deaths was 748, according to the study.

The total number of COVID-19 infections linked to the wildfire smoke in the three states between March and December 2020 was 19,742 with 748 deaths, according to the study.

The report comes as wildfires ripped through parts of the west this week — including the Bootleg fire in southern Oregon, which swelled to the size of LA, and the Dixie fire in northern California, the state’s biggest ever in recorded history.

During the study, scientists looked at 92 counties in the three states while considering other possible factors for COVID-19 infection spikes.

They found that the wildfires last year caused the largest surge of coronavirus cases in Butte County, California, and Whitman, Washington, while Calaveras, California, had the largest rise in COVID-19 deaths.

“It’s very concerning. I’d say to anyone living in a place affected by wildfires to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Longer-term, this shows us, yet again, the importance of fighting climate change,” Dominici said.

More work needs to be done to fully link wildfire smoke to the coronavirus, which also attacks the lungs and respiratory system, the researchers said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@And just like that, COVID-weary New York City turned into a playground for the “Sex and the City” ladies.

Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis (sans Kim Cattrall) are filming scenes for their HBO Max spinoff, “And Just Like That . . .,” all over the Big Apple, sending superfans into a tizzy trying to catch a glimpse of the stars or land a scoop. Numerous Instagram accounts have sprung up to chronicle the on-location magic, which is bringing back a touch of pre-pandemic glamour and frivolity to the city.

“[The show] is the hottest social hunt of the summer,” Gregory Littley (@littleylittley), a content creator who has captured footage for his more than 20,000 Instagram followers, told The Post. “It’s thrilling, nostalgic and fun to post. The response on social has been a resounding ‘Welcome back, ladies.’ “

Littley, 37, helped tip off fans to a possible juicy plot line when he recorded the first sighting of Bridget Moynahan, a k a Big’s ex Natasha, on set near Balthazar, as he was shopping in Soho with his husband.

“Bridget Moynahan was there, but no one was picking up on it. My husband even thought it was Kristin Davis,” recalled Littley, who recognized that her presence was a big scoop — especially after Page Six reported that Big (Chris Noth) and Carrie (Parker) would be getting divorced.

“Big’s ex is back? What are the implications?” he said. The self-proclaimed “SATC” superfan made a short TikTok video of a chic-looking Moynahan walking on set. The video was viewed more than 200,000 times within the first 24 hours and spawned headlines on nearly every entertainment site.

Other fans say sightings of SJP and Co. are confirming plot twists in their own lives. Stumbling upon Parker on a Nolita set helped fashion executive Shay Gipson know her impending move from Los Angeles to the Big Apple was the right one.

Sarah Jessica Parker is spotted on the set of “And Just Like That . . .” TheImageDirect.com

Gipson, a former New Yorker, went West a few years ago but was recently summoned back by a new employer. Last month, she was in town looking for housing and went to a fashion event at the Crosby Street Hotel, where a film crew was set up in front. After her event wrapped, Gipson came out at the exact moment Parker pulled up to the set in a pink frock.

“I was like, ‘Oh, this is my big return to New York and here is SJP filming,’ ” said Gipson, who, years ago, used to bump into Parker at the Serge Normant salon on 23rd Street where the two would chat about the fashion industry. Gipson said the run-in felt like the universe was telling her she was in the right place.

“It solidified my return. I am definitely back in New York,” she said. “I felt like it was definitely an omen.”

For local businesses, the filming is also proving to be auspicious.

When the show recently shot a brunch scene at the East Pole on East 65th Street, crowds formed around the popular restaurant; it was like One Direction was in town.

“The excitement from the fans was palpable,” East Pole owner Anthony Martignetti told The Post. “When [the cast] got out of the town cars, people were screaming the characters’ names. They were really freaking out for Stanford [Willie Garson].”

Martignetti first opened the East Pole with his brother 10 years ago. When the two learned that “And Just Like That . . .” would be filming a brunch scene at their place, it was an exciting honor.

“I remember being a bartender in the city when the show was in its first season,” Martignetti recalled. “Places like SushiSamba and Magnolia Bakery, they really made it on there.”

In the aftermath of the shoot, a steady flow of superfans from the far reaches of Long Island have come into the restaurant, hungry for both farm-to-table fare and plot details.

“A lot of mother-and-daughter teams who follow the filming on Instagram have come in for brunch for the first time,” said Martignetti, adding that it’s been a bright spot for his staff in a tough pandemic year. “It was really exciting for us to have a momentary distraction from the mandates we are under.”

The East Pole wasn’t the only one to get its close-up. Server Mark Sopcyk was there while they were scouting, and he and Nixon hit it off. She requested that they not cast a random actor as their waiter but use Sopcyk, who is a stage performer.

“They signed him up with SAG right away and got his paperwork. He was super thrilled to be on there,” Martignetti said.

The shoot has also turned the city into a runway, showcasing the ladies’ over-the-top fashions. Original stylist Patricia Field is not working on the revival because she’s toiling away on Season Deux of “Emily in Paris,” but her collaborator Molly Rogers has taken the sartorial reins. Her head-turning looks have brought fashionistas to the set and inspired Instagram accounts devoted to the style.

“The sets are also a fashion show,” photographer Steve Sands, who has shot the stars on location, told The Post. “That’s what fans come to see.”

Some clothing choices have been controversial — such as the rumored Forever 21 dress worn by Carrie that a Venice Beach, California, boutique called Raga later claimed. The styles have been feverishly chronicled by Rogers’ own fan fashion account, @AndJustLikeThatCostumes, as well as unaffiliated popular accounts such as @JustLikeThatCloset, @SexAndTheCity_NewYork and @CarrieBradshaw_SexAndTheCity.

“I have been shooting different movies for a while, and this is the first time I’ve seen people this excited. You can feel it in the air,” said photographer Elder Ordonez, who has shot many on set-style moments, including the contentious boho dress. But he also feels the excitement on social media. He said his “SATC” revival snaps “are getting more interaction than any of my other photos. There’s so much interest.”

Littley noted that, in the present moment, frenzy around the filming transcends the latest between Carrie and Big.

He said: “It feels like a rebirth [in the city].”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SHANGHAI – China announced scores of new carbon-intensive coal and steel projects in the first half of 2021, research showed on Friday just days after a key U.N. report urged immediate global action to curb use of fossil fuels and prevent runaway climate change.

The push comes as climate experts exhort governments around the world to take drastic action amid increasingly widespread extreme weather events, like deadly wildfires, drought and even central China’s highest rainfall in 1,000 years – events that experts say are directly linked to human impact on the environment via carbon emissions.

“The rest of the world is getting the message that it’s time to move away from coal, but coal interests in China are dragging their feet, and the central government is not reining them in,” said Christine Shearer, coal program director at Global Energy Monitor (GEM), the U.S. think-tank that jointly authored the report on China’s first-half carbon projects with the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).

During the first half, China, the world’s biggest coal consumer and source of climate-warming greenhouse gases, announced plans to build 18 new coal-fired blast furnaces, more than in the whole of last year, according to the CREA-GEM research. Another 43 coal-fired power plant units were also proposed, the research showed.

China has promised to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2060, but faces growing calls to set more ambitious targets and act faster.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in a nearly 4,000-page report this week that climate change had “affected every inhabited region across the globe” and was in danger of spiraling out of control.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the report as a “code red for humanity” that should “sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels.”

However, according to the CREA-GEM study, China started construction on 15 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power capacity in the first half. That’s a slower pace than last year, but still amounts to one plant per week, and is enough to power roughly 4.5 million homes – more than in cities the size of London or New York.

“Glacial pace of change”

China’s greenhouse gas emissions surged after COVID-19 lockdowns ended last year, and growth rates only started to slow in the second quarter this year, the CREA-GEM study said.

Lauri Myllivirta, CREA lead analyst，said though China was currently trying to curb property lending that stokes the construction of new homes, a key factor in recent emissions growth, the continuing investment in coal-based power and steel was “worrying.”

“This is where a much faster shift is needed, and current glacial pace of change is not in line with the urgency of peaking global emissions,” he said.

China has not yet commented on the IPCC report, and has previously said it would only start cutting coal consumption from 2026.

Xie Zhenhua, China’s top climate envoy, said last week that existing targets already required “extremely arduous efforts,” with the country’s total emissions set to peak in 2030 at a lower per capita rate than the United States, Japan or Europe.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Children as young as four can “explore their gender” without parental consent in some parts of the UK.

New guidance in Scotland has said schoolkids should be supported in using a different gender if they want.

It may mean using a new name – including in school systems – pronouns, dressing differently, or using the toilets and changing rooms of their new gender.

And parents don’t need to be informed if the child does not want them to.

Teachers with kids as young as primary school age have been told to follow the guidance and show kids empathy and trust in their transition.

In Scotland, children are aged between four and five when they start primary school.

Northern Ireland has very similar guidance that applies to children from pre-school age, which is as young as three years old, while various individual schools or boards across England and Wales have advice.

The 70-page document published by the Scottish Government last night says: “Some young people are exploring their gender identity in primary school settings.

“Primary schools need to be able to meet the needs of these young people to ensure they have a safe, inclusive and respectful environment in which to learn.”

“If a young person in the school says that they now want to live as a boy although their sex assigned at birth was female, or they now want to live as a girl, although their sex assigned at birth was male, it is important to provide support and listen to what they are saying.

“If others deny this, it may have a detrimental impact on the young person’s wellbeing, relationships and behavior and this is often clearly apparent to teachers, parents and carers.”

Teachers have been told that it is not always their responsibility to tell the family that their child has a new gender identity if it will cause them distress.

“It is best to not share information with parents or carers without considering and respecting the young person’s views and rights,” it has been advised.

The transgender toolkit says that not conforming to stereotypes is “a healthy and normal part of growing up” and doesn’t immediately mean a child is transgender.

New rules

The Scottish government has called for changes in the classroom in order for more gender neutral awareness.

This might mean using books that “challenge gender stereotypes” and praising boys and girls using the same language.

Scottish education secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “This guidance outlines how schools can support transgender young people while ensuring that the rights of all pupils are fully respected.

“It provides schools with practical suggestions. The guidance is not prescriptive and does not promote transitioning.”

LGBT charities also backed its publication, with Dr Mhairi Crawford, chief executive of LGBT Youth Scotland, saying: “Our research shows that school is the area where trans young people experience the most discrimination and this must be addressed.”

But Marion Calder, director of the For Women Scotland, a campaign group for women’s rights, told MailOnline: “To be transgender you have to have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. What are they thinking?

“Parents will be very concerned to be reading this document.”

The legendary store, which shuttered in February 2019 after 36 years in the East Village, recently reopened in a more roomy and modern space in Brooklyn. The store will feature everything that the old location had — as well as a wider selection of vintage toys and even more comic books.

Co-owner Mitch Cutler bought the comics store in 1984 at just 19. He said he worked 90 hours a week selling books, appraising comics and consulting for publishers and manufacturers.

“I started reading comics as a little kid, and I got a job at a comic shop when I was 15, and then you’re off to the races,” Cutler, 56, told The Post.

St. Mark’s Comics gained worldwide acclaim as one of the country’s premier comic book shops. The store was featured in an episode of “Sex in the City” and still attracts plenty of film enthusiasts and tourists. St. Mark’s Comics also got a shoutout in “Friends” as the place where Phoebe — back in her hardscrabble days — mugged a young Ross when he came to sell his copy of “Science Boy.”

Cutler, a Bronx native, had his “Danny Glover moment” — or the realization that he was burned out — in the months prior to the store’s closing. That, combined with the changing landscape of the East Village even before the pandemic, led him to shutter the store and move to some online sales — after a much-needed two-month break.

“I was exhausted, and then a bunch of the other shops on St. Mark’s went out, and the entire corner of St. Mark’s and Third Avenue was bought and shut down, so that they could put up a giant office building,” said Cutler.

Upon closing the store and selling all its merchandise, Cutler noted that support was through the roof, and people proposed deals for a new location right away, although “none of them turned out to be the right thing.”

According to Cutler, Industry City was a perfect fit. He also entered into a formal partnership with Nick Giangarra, who had been a general manager at the store for years. He said Giangarra had deep contacts in the toy industry and brought both digital and technology experience — all of which, Cutler thought, could bring the latest incarnation of the shop to the next level.

At the new spot at 51 35th St., which had its grand opening on July 30, Cutler hopes to expand inventory beyond the thousands of books already on shelves. Just last week, the store was in talks to acquire a 10,000-book collection, and it bought an assortment of vintage steel cars from the 1930s through the ’70s. Cutler wants to fill up the interior since the space is “enormous, beautiful and clean.”

“One of the beauties of walking in is you never know what you’ll see,” said Cutler. “The stock changes literally every day, because we buy collections literally every day.”

Most of the current merchandise consists of books from the last 30 to 40 years, but Cutler hopes to become more established in the arena of Silver and Golden Age comic books from the 1930s through the ’60s — which are his great passion. The store also has a selection of imported Japanese toys and GI Joe sets in their original boxes.

“Every single guy of a particular age who walks in and sees these original play sets in their original boxes says, ‘I had that as a kid,’ ” he said.

According to Cutler, talking to customers and guiding them through the merchandise has become a “hallmark” of the store — and he’ll go to great lengths to maintain that service.

“There’s a lady who came in much later than she planned on because her international flight landed late, and [my staff] called me at home at 11:30, just as they were locking up, and said, ‘Hey, this lady is here to buy those vintage Spider-Man [comics] for her boyfriend,’ ” Cutler said.

“I got back out on the train in the pouring rain to make sure that she got her books.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BEIJING — Flooding in central China continued to cause havoc in both cities and rural areas, with authorities saying Friday that another 21 people had been killed and another four were missing.

Floodwaters rose to 11.4 feet in Hubei province’s Liulin township following heavy rains that began Wednesday.

The latest deaths add to the more than 300 people killed in flooding last month in Henan province just to the north. The vast majority of those victims were in Zhengzhou, Henan’s provincial capital, where at least 292 died, including 14 who were trapped when the city’s subway system was inundated.

The new Hubei floods have been relatively small in comparison, with just over 8,000 people affected, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

China regularly suffers seasonal flooding, but this year has been particularly severe with torrential rains reaching from the center of the country as far north as Beijing. The floods come on top of efforts to contain an outbreak of the delta variant of COVID-19 that has particularly affected Henan and the eastern province of Jiangsu.

China’s worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people were killed and almost 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along China’s mightiest river, the Yangtze.

Direct losses from this summer’s flooding are estimated at more than $14 billion.

If you’ve got it, flaunt it — and Blake Lively definitely does.

The 33-year-old actress promoted her husband Ryan Reynolds’ new movie, “Free Guy,” with a cheeky Instagram pic on Thursday.

Lively posed poolside in a floral thong bikini for the saucy shot, quipping in her caption, “Go see @freeguymovie this weekend or you’ll be bummed.”

Reynolds, 44, promptly reposted the photo to his own Instagram Story.

Lively also supported her hubby at the “Free Guy” premiere last Wednesday, clad in a backless pink sequin gown by Prabal Gurung featuring sexy cutouts that framed her famous curves.

“What a huge night for #FreeGuy. And what a huge night for @blakelively because this means we’re Instagram official,” the “Deadpool” actor joked on Instagram after the event. “I know how important that was to her.”

Despite the New York City premiere marking the couple’s first red carpet outing in a year and a half, Lively and Reynolds have been keeping fans in the loop about their life at home during the pandemic.

The pair share three daughters: James, 6, Inez, 4, and Betty, 1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This was not the kind of green light hitters want to see.

With the Mets and Dodgers tied in the top of the ninth inning Friday in front of a season-high 38,395 at Citi Field, a green light flashed onto Max Muncy’s face, halting play for a few minutes.

Muncy, batting with a runner on second and two out, collected himself before an 0-2 pitch against Edwin Diaz, but before he stepped into the box, his face turned green.

“Come on, jeez,” Ron Darling said on PIX11. “That’s just awful.”

Muncy immediately pointed left and the umpires conferred for several moments. There was no resolution, so Muncy stepped back into the box, and Diaz struck him out to end the inning. The light was not seen again.

“We don’t want that happening in a baseball game. Player safety — everyone’s safety — is always our priority,” said Mets manager Luis Rojas, who was not sure after his team’s 6-5, 10-inning loss if the culprit had been found. “I thought it might have been the best crowd of the season, so for that to happen, it’s just something that you don’t want to see.”

The scene was similar to an incident during a July game at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Red Sox, when a red light began flashing. An MLB investigation found no evidence of a rules violation by either team.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“American Idol” star Syesha Mercado is raising her voice against the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office after they seized her 10-day-old baby daughter in a harrowing moment captured in a now-viral video.

This is the second child that authorities have “forcefully and legally kidnapped” — as she describes it — under unclear circumstances in the past five months from the 34-year-old Sarasota, Florida native, who finished in the top three during the seventh season of TV’s long-running singing competition.

Deputies surrounded an SUV that Mercado, her newborn baby and her partner, Tyron Deener, were driving in Wednesday morning to conduct a surprise roadside welfare check, as captured in disturbing footage with more than 2.1 million views as of Saturday afternoon. Police then took custody of the infant to bring her to a hospital for a physical, presumably due to prior — still hotly disputed — allegations of malnutrition concerning the couple’s then 13-month-old son.

Mercado and Deener, 36, posted the incident on Instagram with the caption, “THEY TOOK OUR BABY AGAIN!.” The hour-long video shows multiple police vehicles flashing lights while two male deputies serve the couple with a court order to turn over their baby.

“Do you not feel anything? You guys, I’m human. This is my baby. My babies is days old — and you’re taking my baby away from me,” a crying Mercado can be heard saying in the chilling clip before starting to sob as four female child protective services caseworkers stand their ground.

The singer-actress — who starred in Broadway’s “The Book of Mormon” in 2014 — and Deener attempt to explain to authorities that they are “compliant and following every law,” adding that their daughter had already been seen by physicians just a day prior.

“You are traumatizing my baby. How could you guys do this?,” a distraught Mercado screams as her daughter is taken from her arms and placed alone in the back seat of a city vehicle. “… You have no heart. This is so wrong. I have the key to this city … I’ll hold it together. I’m strong.”

Mercado was indeed presented a key to the city of Sarasota during her “American Idol” hometown visit on May 9, 2008, which was proclaimed “Syesha Mercado Day” by local officials. She eventually finished third behind David Archuleta and that season’s winner, David Cook, on the show. She went on to headline the 2009-2010 national tour of “Dreamgirls,” which launched at Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater, opposite future 2021 Tony nominee Adrienne Warren, who stars as Tina Turner in “Tina” on Broadway.

A decade later, Mercado had to breastfeed her crying baby and provide authorities with a bottle of breast milk on the shoulder of a busy road, The Root reported.

The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office and Florida Department of Children and Families have not responded to The Post’s repeated requests for comment. The last listed professional representative for Mercado said “she’s not really working right now” but expressed concern about her situation. Attempts to contact her directly have been unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, her infant is still in protective custody, according to activist Donisha Prendergast, 36, founder of the We Have the Right to be Right social justice organization, who is advocating for the couple.

Five months earlier, Mercado and Deener’s 1-year-old son, Amen’Ra, also was placed into the system after Mercado’s breast milk supply started to run dry, and the boy would not accept other fluids, FOX Tampa Bay reported at the time. They took Amen’Ra to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg on Feb. 26 for help.

While there, Prendergast’s organization alleges that the little boy was examined by Dr. Sally Smith, the controversial subject of a 2020 USA Today Network investigation after she was accused of being “too quick to diagnose child abuse,” which Smith has denied. Investigators reviewed hundreds of Smith’s cases and found more than a dozen instances where charges were later dropped — but the caregivers names were left irreparably smeared forever.

Dr. Smith did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Almost two weeks after Amen’Ra was admitted, CPS and armed Pinellas County Police officers reportedly ordered Mercado and Deener out of the hospital amid allegations of “trespassing” and “severe malnutrition.” Their son was discharged in late March and immediately transferred by CPS into foster care.

During the ongoing fight to get their son back, the couple asked that all caseworker interactions be facilitated through their lawyer, said Deener, a youth service professional who works in the foster care system. When CPS investigators showed up at their home upon learning Mercado gave birth to her daughter without alerting them, they were refused entry and referred to said attorney. That’s when the agency reportedly received approval to conduct a welfare investigation and remove their newborn.

“My baby is healthy and happy,” a desperate Mercado is heard telling them during the roadside seizure. “All you had to do was call the attorney. We have all the paperwork.”

Prior to this week’s events, the parents had launched a GoFundMe — titled “The Legalized Kidnapping of Black Babies Through CPS” — and more than $327,000 has been raised as of Saturday, surpassing their posted $200,000 goal to cover legal bills.

“I am a pregnant, breastfeeding mama who went to the hospital with the intention to get my [son], Amen’Ra, some fluids while transitioning from extended breastfeeding to being bottle-fed,” Mercado’s crowd-sourcing campaign pitch reads. “On March 11 … Amen’Ra was forcefully and legally kidnapped from us by CPS, who claim we refused a B-12 shot that was a matter of life and death, which is an absolute lie.”

However, authorities did tell local media outlets that medical staff reported Mercado and Deener for turning down a B-12 intramuscular shot, as recommended by hospital doctors, a claim that Mercado adamantly denies.

“We never refused a B-12 shot, and at no point was he on the verge of death,” she said before her second child was taken into custody. “Our [son] has since been placed with a white foster family without interviewing qualified relatives or friends of our family for placement while they investigate. We are given limited information and presently only have weekly zoom visitation for an hour with … no court order stating these visitation limitations.”

Mercado has vowed to keep fighting.

During her time on “AI,” The Post took note of her survival skills: “In the ‘Idol’ dictionary under ‘drama’ lies Syesha’s week in Hollywood. The uber-talented singer spent the whole week on vocal rest to overcome a strained throat, cold and myriad of other complications. But when time came to fight for her spot in the competition, one of the most determined contestants in show history knocked it out the box.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On a recent balmy Hamptons night, the tables on the lawn of chic Bistro Eté in Water Mill were full. Men in blazers and women in flowing florals ­eagerly awaited the culinary creations of chef Arie Pavlou.

So did Bubbles, a 4-year-old Coton de Chaleur.

When the dog’s $34 multi-course feast — including bacon-wrapped chicken stuffed with spinach, over which the server shaved fresh truffles, and peanut butter ice cream for dessert — arrived, Bubbles’ owner offered her the first bite off a fork.

Maryam Winston, visiting from Fairfield, Conn., with her husband, appreciated the refined touches afforded her pet.

“The restaurant’s owner made a fuss over Bubbles and brought out a puppy bed, but she prefers to sit on a chair, so they offered her a cushion,” Winston, 50, a COO of a medical company, told The Post.

Pampered pooches are nothing new in the Hamptons, but this summer has reached new levels of extravagance. The pandemic-puppy trend means there are more dogs, and dog owners, than ever — and a mini-industry has popped up out east to serve them.

At Naia, a Mediterranean-influenced restaurant within Southampton’s Capri Hotel that has attracted Cuba Gooding Jr., there are even “spa” options — like a blueberry, quinoa and sweet potato bowl ($8) and frozen apple/carrot bites ($5) — for weight-watching canines.

Babette’s, an organic-centric spot in East Hampton that counts Bill Clinton, Steven Spielberg and Paul McCartney among its regulars, offers free-range chicken ($10) and turkey bacon ($7) among its canine selections.

The Capri, which reportedly has people getting into bidding wars for rooms, has so many four-legged guests that the hotel is unveiling a dog park this month. But first you have to get there: For helicopter or seaplane flights from Manhattan to East Hampton, Blade charges $95 for dogs under 25 pounds and a full-seat charge of $795 for dogs above that weight — which can add up to so almost $1,600 round trip.

Pooches are even welcome at society bashes now.

“There are more events for animals in the Hamptons than ever before,” said Kate McEntee, director of animal relations at the Southampton Animal Shelter, which hosts an August gala chaired by Jean Shafiroff with Georgina Bloomberg as an honorary chair.

Another group planned a “Doggie Date Night” movie screening — complete with cozy blankets plus cookies for humans and biscuits for dogs — of “Best in Show” in Amagansett.

Services abound, from swim lessons to massages. Celebrity vet Dr. Cindy Bressler recently launched Hamptons Veterinary Specialists, offering house calls from canine cardiologists, dermatologists, acupuncturists and others previously unavailable in the area. They’ll even same-day courier medication from Manhattan to the Hamptons.

“The closest places to get appointments with these specialists was over an hour away with a wait months long, so having them on call in the Hamptons can make the difference of life or death,” said Bressler.

Edward Alava, owner of The Dog Store in Manhattan, has a Mercedes van stationed in the Hamptons to provide services ranging from grooming and massage to getting pups prepped for private plane or yacht travel with a calming lavender bath. Known as “the dog guys,” he and his employees also set up canine spas — complete with “pawdicures” — at human parties, like the one thrown by Estée Lauder Group president John Demsey.

“The pampering has gone up 100 percent,” Alava said of this summer. “We got a call to groom two white Labs. Right after we left, the owners let them out, they jumped in a pond and we got a 911 call to come right back.’’

Marilyn Pelstring’s three poodles — including one purchased during the pandemic — regularly receive $175 massages from Alava’s service. “It’s so lovely to see them relax. They get a little euphoric,” said the 65-year-old Southamptonite.

The three pooches are also treated to $150-an-hour swimming lessons from Randy Herwerger, who owns Aqua Dog.

“Each one gets his own lesson and then I take them after to Carvel for a cup of vanilla,” said Pelstring, the chairwoman of American Humane, a nonprofit dedicated to the safety and welfare of animals.

And some people like to indulge with their canines: This summer, Bressler, along with massage therapist Jillian McElwee, launched a “best friends” massage. Dog and owner enjoy side-by-side treatments for $350.

“It’s crazy busy,” McElwee said.

Of course there are those who are baffled and even irritated by the omnipresence of dogs and the degree to which they are babied. At 75 Main, where steak and egg whites are among the offerings for canine customers, a woman dining with her husband began yelling at a man enjoying dinner with his pooch.

“Other people joined in and it was getting ugly,’’ recalled the restaurant’s owner, Zach Erdem. The man told the irate woman, “I love my dog like you love your husband” — to which she snapped back: “I don’t love my ­husband!”

Maurizio Marfoglia, an animal activist and dog owner, allows dogs outside during lunch at his popular restaurants, Dopo Argento and Dopo La Spiaggia, but has decided not to have them at dinner.

“Dogs were on the floor in the dark and people were tripping over them,” he told The Post. “One little one almost had its leg broken. Dogs aren’t people and they have different needs.”

Canine behaviorist Lisa Hartman, who is based in the Hamptons, said there is a lot of separation anxiety for pups rarely left alone during the pandemic — but bringing them into crowds can be problematic.

“People bang into them, little ones get stepped on and [dogs of all sizes] get grabbed by kids,’’ Hartman said. That’s why she started an au-pair and nanny service specifically for dogs, at a rate of $50 per hour. “Just like human children, some dogs have too much anxiety to be left alone.”

Which is, no doubt, why shipping heir John Theodoracopulos was spotted holding his pup, Pancake, at dinner at Tutto Il Giorno with socialite Liz Cohen and Princess ­Marie-Chantal of Greece last week.

But, Bressler said, dogs don’t relish the human pleasure of dining out. “While the owner is talking to friends and eating, the dog is often ignored, so you are better off leaving the animal in the comfort of home and giving it lots of attention later. Dogs just don’t like to go out to dinner the way we do.”

She’s the Vaccinator.

A one-woman rescue team in San Francisco has personally helped vaccinate nearly 1,300 neighbors – and the ranks of her army of the jabbed grows daily.

“You can’t always wait three days for the cavalry to come to the rescue,” Felisia Thibodeaux, the executive director of the Southwest Community Corporation in the Ingleside Heights neighborhood, told The Post. “Community is our first responders.”

She launched her battle plan in January, before COVID vaccines were readily available to everyone. The problem of vaccinating her neighbors was compounded in this “marginalized” community by their age – “the average senior here is 87,” Thibodeaux said – by San Francisco’s hilly terrain and the neighborhood’s lack of nearby public transportation options.

“It would take seniors two hours to get to a vaccination site,” she said. The trip was long enough to deter many from even trying.

Her efforts got a big boost from an anonymous donor, who provided the funds to buy a 15-seat van, which Thibodeaux then used to drive neighbors, sometimes one or two at a time, to a vaccine site at San Francisco City College.

“Having access was half of the battle,” Thibodeaux, told SFGate.com. “If we could establish a hub for access, then we can do many things, not to mention build continuity, whether there’s an earthquake, fires or smoke.”

The majority of San Francisco’s Ingleside Heights are senior citizens who needed to be vaccinated, Felisia Thibodeaux claims. REUTERS

So far, Thibodeaux has personally helped vaccinate 1,270 people. Her organization has assisted “another couple thousand” people get inoculated, she said.

The Southwest Community Corporation celebrated another major success Friday, opening an on-site vaccination program in their headquarters at the I.T. Bookman Community Center.

City data shows that about 21,000 people in the Ingleside Heights neighborhood have been vaccinated – a growing percentage of them due to Thibodeaux and her team.

Thibodeaux said she draws inspiration from her own family’s history of overcoming natural disasters. With roots in New Orleans, she said she lost family members during Hurricane Katrina. She personally survived San Francisco’s deadly Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and in the late 1970s, her dad’s grave in Houston was washed away by a hurricane.

Her organization, pre-pandemic, spent much of its time preparing for earthquake contingencies, before pivoting to become vaccination champions.

In these times of crises, she said, neighbors must lean on neighbors.

“If a building tumbles down, those who watched it fall become our first responders.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Steven Ritterman was a kid growing up on Long Island when he was first bitten by the collecting bug. It began with “Hardy Boys” mysteries neatly lined up on his bookshelf. He started out with one or two, and soon, the books had multiplied.

His love of collecting would become a lifelong hobby; the Upper East Side resident is now one of the foremost collectors of John le Carré spy fiction. His trove began in 1977, after reading le Carré’s “The Honorable Schoolboy,” and now includes over 300 pieces.

One of his prized items is a signed copy of “Call for the Dead,” le Carré’s first novel. In 1996, opportunity struck: Ritterman (inset) read that the author was on a promotional tour for his book “The Tailor of Panama” and would be signing purchased books at the 92nd Street Y.

“Everyone was saying, ‘He will not sign anything else.’ I knew it was going to be the only opportunity I’d ever have to get him to sign the first novel. And so I decided to smuggle it in,” says Ritterman.

“It was a cold day, and I hid the book under the jacket. If I ever thought I was as cool as one of his secret agents — well, I’m not. I got on line, bought a copy of [The Tailor of Panama], and when my turn came, I opened my jacket and I showed him the copy of the book. The handler said, ‘You haven’t read the rules.’ I looked at [le Carré], he looked at me and saw into my soul that before him was a desperate man. And he said, ‘This is one of the finest copies I’ve ever seen of the book.’ And he signed it for me.”

Does he have a favorite genre outside of spy fiction? “No,” he admits with a laugh.

He does regret the way collecting has changed with the Internet, though; the thrill of the hunt is gone.

“Today, you can go online, and in 5 minutes I can find you anything you want. If you want to collect quickly, that’s one thing. But it’s not as sexy or interesting,” says Ritterman.

“Before, I could search for three to four months for an early title, and I’d be thrilled to death to finally get a call from a buyer. All of my books have a story. The journey was the exciting part; getting the book was the cherry on top.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nobody knew until last month that ­Joseph Chung-Hsin Tsai — better known as Joe Tsai — was the “mystery buyer” who dropped $157 million this spring on two massive condos at 220 Central Park South, the most expensive apartment building in the country.

So far, keeping a relatively low profile and understanding international office politics has worked out well for Tsai, said to be worth at least $12 billion. The 57-year-old is the co-founder of Alibaba (China’s version of Amazon), the owner of the Brooklyn Nets and a friend of the Chinese Communist Party.

The same can’t be said for Jack Ma, his flamboyant onetime partner and the creative genius behind Alibaba. Ma has barely been seen in public for the past 10 months. His wings have been clipped, possibly permanently, by officials after Ma publicly dissed his country’s banking system last fall. He is reportedly being “re-educated” by the Chinese Communist Party.

“Tsai is savvy — savvier than Jack Ma,” ­Peter Navarro, author of “Death By China: Confronting the Dragon,” told The Post.

“In America you get canceled for saying the wrong thing. In China you get canceled for becoming a bigger celebrity than [President] Xi Jinping. Tsai realized that; Jack Ma did not,” Navarro said.

Tsai, who was born in Taiwan and educated in the US with citizenship in Hong Kong and Canada, is currently gallivanting around the world. He splits his time between a luxe home in Hong Kong, an oceanfront estate in La Jolla, Calif., and the new digs on Billionaires’ Row.

In addition to the Nets, Tsai and his wife, Kansas-born Clara Wu Tsai, co-own the WNBA’s New York Liberty, the San Diego Seals lacrosse team and the Barclays Center, where the Nets play their home games.

“Tsai is reducing his China risk when he buys the Nets and Central Park South. It’s a smart thing to do,” Gordon Chang, author of “The Coming Collapse of China,” told The Post. “Xi is going after Chinese tech companies like never before and no one knows how it’s going to end up.”

Meanwhile, Ma is thought to be under what amounts to house arrest in China, according to experts.

“He’s lying low right now. I talk to him every day,” Tsai told CNBC in June. “He’s actually doing very, very well. He’s taken up painting as a hobby.”

Ma built Alibaba into a $500 billion powerhouse and turned himself into the kind of iconic frontman more common among American and UK billionaires. At one point, his face was reportedly more ­recognizable in China and around the world than Xi’s.

Ma hung out with movie stars like Tom Cruise and Daniel Craig and top politicians all over the world, and became known for his wild performances — dressing as Michael Jackson or Elton John — at Alibaba functions.

His high life came to a halt when he gave a now-infamous speech at a 2020 conference, calling out China’s state-owned banks and regulators for being backward. Among other things, Ma slammed their “pawnshop mentality.”

“Today’s financial system is the legacy of the Industrial Age,” Ma said. “We must set up a new one for the next generation and young people.”

His remarks came days before Ma’s financial tech firm Ant Group was readying what would have been the world’s biggest IPO. In response, Beijing pulled the plug on the deal and since then has relentlessly gone after Ma’s massive empire, reducing it by half — levying antitrust fines against ­Alibaba and almost eviscerating Ant by dividing it up with new partners.

The less colorful Tsai, on the other hand, has never been more successful.

It hasn’t hurt that he seems to know which masters to bow to. Last October, Tsai responded to a tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting protesters in Hong Kong fighting the increasing overreach of the ­mainland.

While flying private from New York to Shanghai for a Nets game, Tsai wrote an astonishing “letter to NBA fans” that he posted on Facebook. In it, he referred to the Hong Kong protests as a “separatist movement.”

“The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the Western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland,” he wrote. “This issue is non-negotiable.”

It was recently ­revealed that Tsai spent $157 million on two pads at 220 Central Park South. Matthew McDermott

From a business perspective, Tsai was correct in trying to do damage control. Sources told ESPN that the NBA lost between $150 million and $200 million in revenue when Chinese officials yanked sponsorships and airtime after the Morey tweet.

But the irony in Tsai’s defense of China and, by extension, the Chinese Communist Party, is that he comes from a family who fled it.

Tsai’s paternal grandfather, an adviser to the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government, left Shanghai for Taiwan in 1948 with his family. They were part of a mass exodus after the Communists won the civil war.

At 13, Tsai was sent from his home in Taipei to boarding school in Lawrenceville, NJ. He then went on to graduate from Yale University and Yale Law School. His parents were reportedly made naturalized citizens of Canada in the 1970s, according to a source, which is apparently why Tsai has Canadian citizenship. But seemingly, none of the family ever lived in Canada.

Tsai is based in Hong Kong and visits his wife and three kids — all American citizens — in the US often, a source familiar with the situation told The Post.

He and Clara met in 1993 when Tsai worked at the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm and she was a senior manager and vice-president at American Express. They married in 1996.

“My first job after law school was in New York. I met my wife, Clara, here so New York to me is my second home,” Tsai told The Post in 2019.

By 1999 the couple had moved to Hong Kong, where Tsai was a $700,000-per-year principal at a private equity firm. That year, a friend introduced him to Ma — a former English teacher with a big idea about getting hundreds of Chinese companies online so they could sell their wares to the world.

As the story goes, Tsai was so impressed with Ma’s vision that he was ready to leave his job. But the feeling wasn’t immediately mutual. Tsai reportedly had to return more than once to meet with Ma but it wasn’t until he brought Clara that Tsai clinched the deal. By several accounts she is his best asset.

Clara has a bachelor’s degree in international relations and a master’s degree in international policy studies from Stanford as well as an MBA from Harvard.

“Joe Tsai’s smart, but his wife is always the smartest person in the room,” someone who has worked with them told The Post. “She seems to have an innate ability to be able to read landscapes well and ­really understand events. She comes across like a futurist.”

Clara has worked on her pet cause, prison reform, with Kim Kardashian. She and Tsai have donated hundreds of millions of dollars to charities and universities in recent years. They made gifts to Stanford ($250 million) and Yale (reportedly $800 million) under the rubric of “neuroscience” — which involves futuristic brain technology and is a favored investment of billionaires including Elon Musk and Google’s Ray Kurzweil.

But for all Tsai’s philanthropy, some think he is a traitor to his people.

Many supporters of Hong Kong protesters, including now-jailed Jimmy Lai, publisher of the now-shuttered Apple Daily, are disappointed by Tsai’s defense of the Chinese Communist Party’s heavy-handed influence over Hong Kong.

“If Joe Tsai would sell HK, he’d sell Taiwan, despite the island sheltering his family from potential death 70 years ago,” Catie Lilly, a Taiwanese-American historian, tweeted in 2019.

Which is another way of saying, according to some experts, that Tsai knows which way the wind is blowing and knows how to harness it.

“Tsai, frankly, is a whole lot shrewd­er than Ma,” Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Post.

“Tsai is unabashedly supportive of the Chinese Communist Party’s policies, including its recent security crackdown in Hong Kong,” Singleton added. “Having benefited from a close working relationship with the ruling party, Tsai understands the importance of going along to get along.”

Timing is everything in life.

Sandra Lee has gotten engaged to her boyfriend Ben Youcef, and the beaming couple hit the town in Paris to celebrate, with a besotted Lee showing off her dazzling new engagement ring, multiple sources sources told The Post.

Photos of the lovebirds reveal that Lee, the former girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and her hunky beau have made it official — as there was no mistaking the significance of a giant jewel on Lee’s left ring finger.

Youcef, an interfaith leader, actor and producer, sported a band on his wedding finger.

Lee was seen sporting the sizable new bling just days after Cuomo announced his resignation following a series of scandals — and a damning report by state Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of sexually harassing several women — that have plagued his third term as governor.

Lee and Youcef bolted to the City of Love after she was left devastated by the events of the past week, when Cuomo resigned as governor amid a sex harassment scandal, Lee’s friends said.

The two could be seen outside Parisian hotspot L’Avenue on Saturday night, sharing an embrace before heading in for dinner.

Lee, a 55-year-old lifestyle guru, wore a white summer dress while Youcef, 46, had on jeans, a leather jacket and a white T-shirt emblazoned with the logo “Fear of God.”

A source close to Youcef told The Post: “Ben really wanted to distract Sandra from all the news, so he whisked her away to Paris. He knows how hard this has been on her and he wants to make sure she feels loved and supported.”

The source added: “Ben is incredibly protective of Sandra. They’re soulmates and head over heels in love.”

The pair traveled to Paris after spending time in St. Tropez in the South of France.

Lee and Cuomo never got engaged during their 14 years together, although she was married previously to former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz from 2001 until 2005.

The source said their friends have been rooting for them since they met in the spring in Los Angeles.

As The Post reported, Lee has felt “betrayed” by Cuomo, most recently for what she claims was him taking credit for legalizing same-sex marriage in New York during his resignation speech when she was the one who urged him to push the legislation forward.

Cuomo’s cheating during their relationship, which he denied, was considered an “open secret,” former Cuomo staffers told The Post in April.

She met Youcef after moving to Malibu, Calif., and leaving behind the home she shared with Cuomo.

She solidified her move to the West Coast after selling her Mount Kisco home — named “Lily Pond” — for $1.85 million last October.

Youcef, a divorced dad of two, was discovered by Steven Spielberg and went on to appear in his 2005 movie “Munich.”

He has since appeared in a number of TV shows.

A rep for Lee declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If a governor resigns over a “he said, she said” dispute about where his hand was when she asked for a photo, or because he asked about their personal lives, or hugged them for a second too long at an event, is there any hope for being a male manager? I feel all it takes is for one woman to make a claim and then I am tarnished forever and risk losing my job. Can I make it clear that I will refuse to meet with any woman at work one-on-one, privately?

The truth is, I hear this privately from a lot of male managers. Highly regarded and respected leaders who have never had anyone complain about them have expressed concern about meeting with female colleagues behind closed doors a result of everything that has been reported in the media these past few years. I think that fear is unwarranted. In all of my years in HR I have never experienced a case of women conspiring to make multiple false claims about a male manager. If you have any concerns about a particular colleague, male or female, and you need to have a difficult conversation with them, you may feel more comfortable having someone else in the room. That is prudent and fine. But to say you won’t meet with any women privately is insulting and unprofessional.

My employer is nuts. We are customer-facing, so they are mandating that we don’t wear masks because they think it makes for a bad customer experience and implies we haven’t been vaccinated. I think this is unsafe. Can they enforce this? Can I refuse?

I would have to agree with you — your employer is nuts. For right now, they also have the law on their side, although that could change if we see a return to mask mandates. Your safety and health are far more important than the “customer experience.” Plus, if anything, in the current environment masks would give any rational person more comfort, not less. Ask what your employer will do if you refuse. Will they make an accommodation, or terminate you? I can tell you I wouldn’t want to be an employer that had to defend a lawsuit because they wouldn’t let their employee wear a mask. Just sayin’.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As record numbers of Americans quit their jobs amid the Great Resignation, what’s old is new again, with some pursuing a new job with a former employer.

It may be a win-win situation.

That was the case for Deirdre Latour, who resigned from her role as vice president at global communications firm Edelman in 2004, ready for a change.

The Upper West Sider went on to work at GE as a manager, working her way up to chief communications officer before leaving to work for education company Pearson. Last summer, a phone call from a former Edelman colleague changed everything. They asked her to run their Hudson Square office as president.

“It was really intriguing. They said running the New York operation, you’ll have a profit and loss in addition to being a communications executive. Edelman also felt like home to me during a difficult time for all of us.”

Latour accepted the position last September. Despite returning to her familiar stomping grounds, she approached it as a new job.

“It is in some ways very similar to the place that I left, and in most ways entirely different,” she said. “It was the realization of ‘Yes, I know the senior leaders of the company I’ve known since I was 25, but the place has grown a tremendous amount and I’ve grown a tremendous amount.’ It feels familiar, but it’s not the place that it was.”

In fact, she embraced the changes.

“Assume that you’ve never worked there,” she said. “And by the way, who would want to go back to working at something that was 16 years ago, right? That would be so lame. You want it to change. You have to have a huge amount of humility for what you’re stepping into. Yes, there may be some people you know, the spirit and the vision are the same, the ethics and the values are the same, but it’s not the same place.”

Rob Barnett, a Summit, NJ, headhunter and author of “Next Job, Best Job: A Headhunter’s 11 Strategies to Get Hired Now” (Citadel), agreed.

“I’ve seen many cases where an employee left on great terms for a bigger role with more compensation on the outside,” he said. “When you prove that you have more value for a senior position at a higher price tag, you can return to a former employer at a level you may never have achieved without leaving.”

The company may have also progressed since you left, and be ripe for a mutually beneficial return. Lee Caraher, CEO of p.r. and communications agency Double Forte and author of “The Boomerang Principle: Inspire Lifetime Loyalty From Your Employees” (Routledge), said, “Companies ebb and change like people do. What was tapped out for you at one stage in your career could now be a huge growth opportunity.”

To rekindle that connection, Caraher said, “Are you in regular contact with your former manager or other people who would be in a position to hire you back? Former colleagues who are happy at the company? Look at job postings to see if there’s something that is interesting and appropriate. If so, contact your former boss to see if it’s possible to return to that position.”

If not, then start slower. “Make sure you’re connected with them on LinkedIn,” said Caraher. “Ask for a ‘catch up’ call with your former boss where you could ask them for advice on the next step in your career.”

For Ken Marone, the reverse happened when his old boss reached out. After working for health care communications agency FCB Health in Midtown for five years, last July Marone resigned as an account supervisor and moved to Philadelphia. A self-proclaimed “in-person employee,” he landed a job at an advertising agency as a group account supervisor, and due to the pandemic ended up working remotely.“

I came to the realization that I had just led a team for 11 months without having met any of them,” said Marone. “It was possible to work remotely and be just as successful as working from an office.”Coincidentally his former boss texted him: “I have an opportunity.”One week later, they discussed how he could return to the agency. Three weeks later, he was back at FCB Health working from home as an account director with a new boss and more responsibilities in overarching strategy.“

FCB feels like home,” said Marone. “During my last stint, I had the opportunity to work with some of the best individuals I’d ever met — people who became mentors and friends. Having the opportunity to work with them again was a major plus. The network is also massive, which allows you to do things you might not be able to do somewhere else. For me, you can’t say no to that.”

The change of policy at FCB Health also worked for Shelby Rauen, who left in 2010 as group strategy director to work for another local advertising firm before moving to Cleveland to work for a Midwest-based agency.

Last year, recruiters contacted her and after exploring a few opportunities, she contacted human resources at FCB Health.

“There happened to be an opening that aligned,” she said. “It was a nice happenstance of all the right factors being in place.”

In May, Rauen returned as senior vice president strategic planning director, working remotely. Her secret sauce to a seamless return involved staying in close contact every year or two over e-mail or LinkedIn messenger with HR, her old boss and the chief creative officer. “

It was definitely a homecoming for me. Don’t burn your bridges.”

Caraher agreed. “Leave on a positive note. Give more than two weeks’ notice. Don’t fall down on the job after you give notice. Wrap everything you’re doing up with a bow — meet with people to transition work, write a wrap up e-mail or memo sharing where everything is, and say goodbye professionally to everyone.

Write a personal note to the people who you’re closest with. And say to your boss and your colleagues, ‘I hope we work together in the future.’”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rams and Chargers fans commemorated their return to SoFi Stadium with a massive brawl on Saturday.

A viral video showed a male Rams fan in an Aaron Donald jersey being pummeled by at least four others in the stands of the stadium shared by the two Los Angeles teams.

The melee, which left the fan in the Donald jersey bloodied, lasted nearly a minute.

The beginning of the video showed the fan in the Donald jersey arguing with another Rams fan. An unidentified woman in the back then threw beer on the fan in the Donald jersey, leading him to throw what appeared to be the first punch.

It’s unclear what exactly sparked the altercation and whether there were any arrests.

The Week 1 preseason game, which the Chargers won 13-6, marked the return of NFL fans amid the pandemic.

There’s no crying in casting.

Oscar-nominated actress Debra Winger quit the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own” because Madonna was cast in the women’s baseball dramedy.

According to the Telegraph, Winger was starring in the role of Dottie, which was eventually taken over by Geena Davis.

Serious actress Winger even trained with the Chicago Cubs for three months, but when director Penny Marshall cast Madonna, Winger felt Marshall was making fluff — “an Elvis film.”

“The studio agreed with me because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract. In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court,” she told the Telegraph.

She added, “As entertaining as [the finished film] was, you don’t walk away going, ‘Wow, those women did that.’ You kind of go, ‘Is that true?’”

She said the other stars didn’t train as much as she did, but Davis “did OK.”

“I certainly don’t begrudge any of them,” said Winger, 66.

As far as Madonna’s performance? “I think [her] acting career has spoken for itself,” Winger reportedly said.

Davis went on to get a Golden Globe nomination for the role, while Madonna picked up a nomination for Best Original Song. The film also stars Tom Hanks and Rosie O’Donnell.

Winger, most famous for her roles in “An Officer and a Gentleman” and “Terms of Endearment,” also spoke about quitting Hollywood back in 1995.

“I stopped because I ceased being challenged,” she said, adding that playing the supportive wife and mother got “pretty boring.”

Over the years, the actress has come back for various indie films like 2008’s “Rachel Getting Married.” Most recently, she acts in Apple TV+’s “Mr. Corman.”
