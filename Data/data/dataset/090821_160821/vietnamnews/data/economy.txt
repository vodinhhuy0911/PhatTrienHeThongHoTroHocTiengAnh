4.9x bigger prize pool than last year at up to 7.5m USDT & NFT addition

Largest WSOT donation to UNICEF at $400,000 in BTC





SINGAPORE - Media OutReach - 16 August 2021 - The summer games of crypto trading are back. The 2021 edition of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit's World Series of Trading (WSOT), set to open for registration on Aug. 18, promises to be the world's largest crypto trading tournament yet again.





The WSOT 2021 prize pool is up to an unprecedented 7.5 million USDT, plus a bonus track of WSOT NFT collectibles and additional USDT, Bybit announced today.





"WSOT is returning bigger and better as promised," said Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit. "We want to celebrate excellence and the spirit of competition, as well as shine a light on the positive influences of crypto on our daily lives — improving financial literacy, getting people interested in tech, and putting on top of mind ways we can be a force for change and give back to the wider society."





The flagship trading event by Bybit, one of the world's most popular crypto exchanges, attracted over 12,000 participants last year. The winning teams and individuals out of 135 troops and 2,128 solo contestants took home $1.27 million in prizes in 2020.

Eyes on the Prize

With a prize pool of up to 6,000,000 USDT for teams and up to 1,500,000 USDT in the individual competition, WSOT 2021 is slated to be the event of the year for crypto traders around the world.





"Bybit remains in awe by the overwhelming support from the global crypto community. In response, we worked hard in the past 12 months to take the competition experience to the next level with the largest prize pool to date," said Zhou.





WSOT 2020 was trader junki84's first ever crypto trading competition. The participant tested out his trading strategy and finished with a legendary 5,242.02% in Individual P&L(%). Equally impressive was trader SalsaTekila, who came in second with a 3,956.56% Individual P&L(%). With greater rewards and more participants, the competition is expected to be even more intense this year.





"We are grateful for the opportunity to provide a platform for the world's best traders to live up to their ambition. Their achievements were something to behold. And their craft and passion epitomizes everything crypto is about: creating a fair, transparent and open environment for individuals to be the best they can be," remarked Zhou.





WSOT 2021 is open to global traders where Bybit services are available. Participants can form a troop or play solo to access early bird perks, trading fee discounts or waivers and a chance at more than 1,000 NFTs and 40,000 USDT bonus in lucky draws.

Supporting a Better Future

In 2020, Bybit donated from the WSOT prize pool 10 BTC at market value of over $100,000 at the time, to UNICEF's pandemic relief efforts[1]. One year on, COVID-19 continues to be a universal crisis, particularly disrupting children's access to education and threatening their long-term well-being.





Bybit has quadrupled its donation to $400,000 in BTC this year to support UNICEF in their efforts to provide STEM education for girls in Vietnam and deliver quality education in East Asia and the Pacific.





"The world is learning to cope with the ongoing pandemic, but vulnerable groups who feel the deepest impact are often overlooked. Over the years Bybit has borne witness to the talent and potential of members of the global crypto community, regardless of age, gender and background," said Igneus Terrenus, head of communications at Bybit. "There really is no better investment than in the welfare of children and their right to education. We hope our donation to UNICEF will help change life for the better for those who will grow up to shape the future."

WSOT 2021 Details

The 10-day registration phase starts at 10AM UTC on Aug. 18.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach - 11 August 2021 - With the advancement of technology, Malaysia is increasingly becoming a digital economy. Malaysia is a developing Asian economy that aspires to expand in a technology-driven and high-tech production-based pattern. With in-person interactions on the wane since the Covid-19 pandemic began, e-signature systems like Signitory will have an advantage in a wide environment of digital services.

Introducing e-signature to your businesses

The pandemic has hastened the use of e-signature and process automation solutions by many organisations in order to continue to connect with their customers during lockdowns. Electronic and digital signatures are a clever approach to optimise your company operations, especially when face-to-face meetings are not practicable or viable.

While organisations consider and use e-signature providers such as Signitory as part of their operations, digital transformation is also taking place in the background. With Signitory helping organisations' signing procedures, it not only helps to maintain their companies operating smoothly, but it also enhances them in the long run.

E-signature provides contract validity and enforceability.

In Malaysia, the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 (ECA) presumes that contracts concluded with e-signatures are as legitimate as those signed in ink (except for specific exclusions). To begin, it should be noted that a contract does not have to be in writing in order to be lawful and enforceable under Malaysian contract law.

In conclusion, the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the way the world thinks and operates. The transition to electronic contracting was always going to happen, but the pandemic just hastened it.

Signitory, the simplest way to securely, remotely, discreetly, and legally sign documents, has officially launched the e-signature platform online, and it is also downloadable on the Google Play Store. What's more, it is FREE to use, completely compliant and underpinned by world-class Blockchain technology, thanks to its Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification functions.





Signitory is currently offering a new Zero-cost Free Plan. For those of you who haven't signed up yet, this is definitely worth a try. Of course, this is not an option for subscribers with a higher usage rate, as Signitory also provides "SIGNITORY" promo for new Starter Plan subscribers three months worth of service for *$2 /mo.

*Applicable for first 1,000 subscribers. T&Cs apply.

Try Signitory with Blockchain-enhanced features

No charges incur until you consume beyond the free plan

About Signitory:

In 2020, Kee Choy Lai and Carlo Chung established Signitory to create a more comprehensive experience with e-signing by infusing their system with blockchain. Signitory's ultimate goal is to improve people's quality of life by increasing the efficiency and coordination in their businesses, resulting in deals and documents being signed faster, easier and totally secured. Signitory is going for Equity Crowdfunding on one of the licensed ECF operator platform by Securities Commission Malaysia. Kindly contact us for more information.

NEW YORK — Ambassador Đặng Đình Quý, Việt Nam's Permanent Representative to the UN, has stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to avoid unexpected impacts of counter-terrorism measures on humanitarian activities.

Quý made the suggestion at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)’s virtual Arria-formula meeting on “Humanitarian action: overcoming challenges in situations of armed conflict and counter-terrorism operations” under the chair of Kenya.

The event drew the attendance of Raffi Gregorian, Deputy to the Under-Secretary-General of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Director of the UNOCT; Reena Ghelani, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)’s Director of Operations and Advocacy Division; Helen Durham, Director of International Law and Policy at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); and Ambassador Fatima Kyari Mohammed, Permanent Observer of the African Union to the UN.

The Vietnamese ambassador underlined that anti-terrorism measures must be in conformity with the UN Charter and international law.

He underlined the need for all countries to effectively implement UN resolutions, evaluate negative impacts of anti-terrorism measures right from the process of building and applying them.

The best way to protect civilians is to prevent and settle conflicts, and maintain sustainable peace, Quý stressed.

Participants were worried about the accelerating risk of terrorism in Africa, calling on the UNSC to reaffirm the requirement to protect humanitarian action space and promote dialogue and experience sharing.

They confirmed their commitments to fight terrorism, protect civilians, create optimal conditions for humanitarian activities in line with humanitarian principles, and effectively implement UN resolutions in the field. — VNS

GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - News Direct - 16 August 2021 - The Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association (ZESTAs) sees the UNFCC Climate report as a message of hope and believes the authors have made it abundantly clear that it is possible to avert climate catastrophe by pursuing the "very low emissions scenario" within the next two decades. As reported, there are no other options; it is global society's obligation to act now with "drastic, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gases to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees", because it can.









Brent Perry, CEO, Sterling PlanB, Chair of ZESTAs Board of Directors





ZESTAs is nailing their colours to the mast by starting at true zero with their unprecedented "SHIP ZERO – Charging to True Zero" workshop 1-3 November coinciding with COP 26 in Glasgow, Scotland. ZESTAs' SHIP ZERO workshop will be the first ever shipping event to align with the IPCC "very low emissions scenario", by not contemplating the use of fossil fuels or any GHG emitting fuel or technology.

"The simple truth is the time for discussion is past – nothing remains but for us to act. Whatever your beliefs, whatever your passions, whatever your politics, insuring that we, as a society are no longer contributing to the end of life as we know it is imperative. This century is about reckoning – the morals, purpose and goals of society must align with the common good in every aspect of life. Sustainability is not just a goal but a social imperative that transcends our societies and presents us with both opportunities and obligations – future societies will either praise us or damn us for our actions today" observed Brent Perry, CEO, Sterling PlanB, Chair of ZESTAs Board of Directors.

Only truly zero GHG emissions systems, solutions and technologies will be considered at this workshop. ZESTAs states that the technology to achieve true zero in all sectors of shipping exists today but that weak or misaligned policies and lack of finance are preventing these technologies from upscaling, achieving economies of scale and penetrating the wider market.

"We need to stop throwing the ball out to 2050 and investing in half measures that won't get us where we need to be. We need to invest in true zero now, upscale and shoot for 2030. If we don't, we have no chance of stopping warming anywhere near 1.5. The IPCC report clearly states we've got a shot. We need to take that shot and act now to change policy and finance, allowing zero emissions ship technologies to get to market before 2030" said Madadh MacLaine, ZESTAs Secretary General

The SHIP ZERO workshop will feature highly technical presentations, followed by discussions and brainstorming sessions, bringing together shipping stakeholders from; innovation, policy, finance, infrastructure, energy, and the wider shipping sector to combine solutions into an actionable road map.

"Our intention is that the outcome of SHIP ZERO is an action plan, a navigational chart to true zero with waypoints based on realizable actions, available technologies, and implementable policies that will keep warming below 1.5 degrees" MacLaine continued.

The SHIP ZERO workshop will demonstrate that marinized battery and hydrogen systems are market ready at multi megawatt scales, and that wind propulsion is being installed across the world fleet to delivers significant emissions reductions today.

"Wind propulsion uses the power of the wind as a direct renewable energy source and is available everywhere at sea. Any energy taken from wind directly on ships by modern sail technology does not burden the infrastructure that ultimately will be powered by wave, sun and wind, reducing the renewable energy required to produce clean fuels. Wind assisted technology therefore makes all other technologies more feasible. 'The answer my friends, is blowing in the wind'!" stated Frank Nieuwenhuis, eConowind, ZESTAs Board of Directors, Advisor.

More good news is that renewable energy and green hydrogen production infrastructure are being rolled out across the globe. From Scotland to Chile, from the United Arab Emirates to Monaco, governments are creating strategies that will achieve a price for green hydrogen that can compete with fossil fuels by the end of the decade.

"If shipping is looking for that silver bullet, ZESTAs has a fully loaded chamber and we're ready to fire" said MacLaine.

In light of the "code red for humanity", declared by United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres in his response to the IPCC report, ZESTAs calls on governments and regulators to acknowledge that fully developed market ready zero emissions ship technologies exist by creating the policy frameworks necessary for these technologies to have a fighting chance of competing against incumbent fossil fuel technologies and achieve market availability before 2030.

"I urge the governments of the world and each person living today to go "all in" – shift away from polluting activities and scale up climate solutions that deliver as close to zero emissions as possible. We still have the opportunity to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Governments can change policies to support this goal. As individuals we can make changes in our lives directly and speak with our votes to ensure our governments are not watered down by misrepresentative interests that are not focussed on climate management."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST - EQS Newswire - 10 August 2021 - The 27th Universal Postal Union Congress (UPU) will take place from 9 to 27 August 2021, in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast. Holding this event on Ivorian soil represents the culmination of extensive efforts on the part of the national government, dating back to 2011, to bolster the country's international influence and actively contribute to the development of postal services in Africa and worldwide.



Under SEM leadership. Thanks to the efforts of President Alassane Ouattara and a policy of strengthening multilateral cooperation, the Ivory Coast has rapidly reclaimed its place in the group of nations. Economically, the average annual growth rate stood at 8% over the 2012-2019 period and was largely positive at 2%, demonstrating the West African flagship country's pandemic resilience.



The triptych of peace, security and social cohesion remains one of the Government's main priorities to make this performance sustainable in the long term, increase investment in human capital and guarantee inclusive economic and social development in a peaceful environment for the population.



Therefore, the Ivory Coast is entering the new decade with the goal of strengthening its achievements and accelerating the structural transformation of its economy by placing people at the heart of development actions.



The Strategic Vision 2030 for a prosperous and united Ivory Coast makes the acceleration of technological innovation a key factor for improving productivity in all activity sectors and for all economic players, as well as Ivorian society at large.



This dynamic includes the implementation of two major innovative projects:

The "Post Office of the Future" opened on 21 May 2021 in the presence of the UPU's deputy director general and is an initiative for the Ivorian government to support the promotion of digital inclusion and the provision of modern and innovative postal and financial services.

opened on 21 May 2021 in the presence of the UPU's deputy director general and is an initiative for the Ivorian government to support the promotion of digital inclusion and the provision of modern and innovative postal and financial services. The ecom@Africa project, an UPU initiative, aims to position the postal network as one of the main e-commerce catalysts in Africa, based on an integrated, inclusive, and innovative ecosystem of designated postal operators. For its implementation, the UPU chose the Ivory Coast to become the e-commerce hub for West Africa.



As the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected economies by reducing the consumption of goods and services worldwide, the digital economy and digitisation will dominate discussions during the 27th UPU Congress.



The topics addressed in defining the future World Postal Strategy in Abidjan will focus on:

all e-Commerce components;

global logistics;

electronics with the creation of value-added services;

constant service quality improvements;

benefits to citizens through comprehensive inclusion (social, financial and digital).



The 27th Universal Postal Congress therefore represents an exceptional economic and strategic opportunity for the Ivory Coast and the 53 other African member countries to strengthen their position within this specialised UN agency. It will also enable them to benefit from technical support for sharing best practices, experiences, and expertise for general postal system reforms.



All African nations should seize the opportunity to deepen the transformation of the postal services and underscore the major role that post offices should play in social, economic, and digital life across the continent.



At the 27th Congress, which marks the end of the 2016-2020 period and opens the new 2021-2025 cycle, the UPU will renew its management bodies for four years, with the election of the Director General and Deputy Director General of the International Bureau of this UN institution.



Apart from the position of Chair of the Board of Directors (BoD), which is vested by right in the Ivory Coast as the Congress host nation, the other 40 BoD members are elected by the Congress, based on an equitable geographical distribution. The renewal of the Postal Operations Council (POC) is also planned.



The Universal Postal Union is the second oldest institution in the UN system. Since the first International Postal Conference was held in Bern, Switzerland, in 1874, the year of its creation, the Ivory Coast has become the second African country to organise this major event after Egypt in 1934.



"Africa invites you; the Ivory Coast welcomes you."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Winne Wong, Mastercard Country Manager for Việt Nam, Cambodia & Laos, discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed Vietnamese consumers' spending habits, how it has helped drive cashless payment in the country and the lasting impact it may have on the country's transition process to cashless payment in the future.

Mastercard Country Manager - Winnie Wong

How has the pandemic changed consumer behaviours and spending habits, in particular their payment preference?

The pandemic has been changing many aspects of our life. Three years ago, when I first came to Việt Nam, cash was still the dominant payment form that people heavily relied on, as I recall it accounted for 75 - 90 per cent of the transactions.

Việt Nam then was different from countries where cashless payments have high adoption rates like Singapore, for example. With everything being cashless, I could go out and easily survive with only 2 dollars in my wallet, as I have my phone and digital payment apps like Apple Pay. However, in Việt Nam, I found myself needing a lot of cash in my wallet, which was an inconvenient practice, especially when I forgot to prepare cash in my wallet.

Since last year, we have witnessed a huge shift to digital payment, in online transactions. Due to social distancing orders, we turn to cashless or online payments in order to minimise physical contact.

This trend toward digital payment is happening across the region, according to our new payments index. At least 94 per cent of people in the Asia Pacific now consider using at least one emerging payment method such as a mobile wallet or digital currency in the coming years, a remarkable change in people’s payment preference as compared to prior to the pandemic where people hardly considered it seriously in Việt Nam.

For a population that preferred cash and cards predominantly, the pandemic really prompted the acceptance of cashless at an unprecedented pace, as from what I observed, Vietnamese people are more likely to ask if the money could be transferred, moving away from the traditional cash reliance mindset.

What other advantages do cashless payments have over traditional cash-based transactions?

We at Mastercard are advocating for cashless because we believe in the many benefits that it offers. Number one is the data from cashless transactions, which also provides great help to the government, banks, and societies in general, in planning.

For example, when you withdraw VNĐ1 million in cash from an ATM and spend it in a shop, there is no record or data of that transaction. But that kind of data is very useful for government planning or for the banks to understand their customers better so they can improve services or even expand their credit line.

For many local micro, small & medium sized enterprises (MSMEs), one of their biggest financial challenges is that they cannot get loans from the banks and must look elsewhere for funding. Such difficulty is caused by their cash-based business operations, which provides no visibility for the banks to examine the business financial capabilities other than income tax statements and financial statements. Such documents are not sufficient for banks to grant businesses a high-value loan of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they could only show a modest yearly income of ten thousand dollars.

Digital payments record a trail of transactions. Banks can look at this digital proof of money into your account and even proactively reach out to offer you credit. This is called being banked, which is not only about having a bank account, but also having access to financing and a presence in the formal economy, so as to get financing from legal entities approved by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). The data is there to protect consumers as well. For instance, if the banks overcharged consumers, SBV could step in.

It's important for such data to be available to governments and formal institutions so they can make the right decisions for people and for businesses.

As a large part of Việt Nam's population still remains unbanked or underbanked, what has Mastercard done to address this issue?

As a global company, we understand that different markets require different approaches. We focus on each market environment and seek to understand what is important to the consumers, as well as areas that we can add value to the market. It's not about Mastercard doing and winning more but about how our solutions can help the government’s cashless agenda, how we use our resources to support the government's directives, and how we cooperate with the banks, fintech companies, the SBV and other partners to drive the bigger objectives for the market.

One of the initiatives we are working on is the unbanked (individuals or households with no bank accounts) or the underbanked (individuals or households with bank accounts but rely on alternative methods to fund purchases and finance). We understand there is a large effort by Việt Nam to address this issue and we are working with our partners to find ways to leapfrog and reach these groups in the most efficient manner.

What's more important is to always ask ourselves whether we still follow the same ways as in the past. For example, the rural areas of Việt Nam have high mobile penetration and Internet penetration rates, even among the unbanked or underbanked segments. So, we try to figure out ways to leverage that advantage to drive cashless payment faster and expand it wider in a more customer-friendly and secured manner. We also put efforts into finding ways to replicate our programmes from different countries and their successes when bringing them to Việt Nam.

What can Việt Nam, as a country, do to speed up the transition to cashless payment?

Việt Nam has been driving the fourth industrial revolution, a collective priority of the whole government. The SBV also serves this goal with efforts to promote a cashless agenda, to build up the capabilities of local partners such as NAPAS, and for international institutions including Mastercard to contribute to.

As the framework for the transition is already in place, along with the fact that the government and the country itself is already welcoming the development, SBV can advance the progress by providing a sandbox - a safe testing environment - for fintech companies such as Mastercard to experiment innovative cashless solutions that are novel to Việt Nam.

It's crucial that banks can test new models and take losses with minimized or no repercussions in a safe playground. The fear of failing and facing great consequences, especially within big institutions, will inhibit innovations. Furthermore, with failure we can learn our lessons and continuously improve our methods. Therefore, providing fintech innovators the safeguard assurance of no penalty when any thing occurs during their experiment will help accelerate the digital transformation further.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@HONG KONG SAR - Media OutReach - 12 August 2021 - Due to emergent COVID-19 developments in our key tournament markets, the group stage of the VCT Stage 3 - Challengers SEA - Playoffs will be pushed back by one day and will now take place between 13 - 16 August. This change does not affect the Playoffs finals dates which remain from 19 - 22 August, and the overall tournament format and our roster of casters will remain the same.

The health and safety of our teams and crew are our top priority. Given these recent developments with the pandemic, we are opting to hold a more streamlined event that will ensure the safety of all participants while delivering an exciting viewing experience to fans across the region.

VCT STAGE 3 - CHALLENGERS SEA - PLAYOFFS OVERVIEW

16 teams in the VALORANT Champions Tour Stage 3 - Challengers SEA will meet for two intense weekends of competition on 13-16 and 19-22 August as the region's best teams compete for one of two slots to represent Southeast Asia at the upcoming Masters 3: Berlin in September 2021, where they will play shoulder-to-shoulder with the best teams from North America, EMEA, Brazil, LATAM, Japan and Korea. These teams are also competing for championship points that will count towards qualification at VALORANT Champions, the final event of the 2021 VCT.

WHICH TEAMS ARE QUALIFIED?

16 teams have proven their mettle against hundreds of participants during the VCT Stage 3 Challengers Qualifiers period that took place throughout the month of July. The following teams have demonstrated strong regional performances and have earned their country slot in the VCT Stage 3 Challengers Playoffs through the qualifier tournaments. Here are the qualified teams –

Teams have been segmented into groups based on regional performance at previous events throughout 2021. Given Vietnamese teams were unfortunately unable to participate in the VCT Stage 1 competitions back in March 2021, Riot has allotted 3 seeds to Vietnam for the Stage 3 Playoffs in Pool 3 providing Vietnamese teams with an opportunity to gain circuit points in this playoff round.





HOW DO THE VCT STAGE 3 - CHALLENGERS SEA - PLAYOFFS WORK?

Playoffs will take place over two weekends. In the 1st weekend (13-16 August), teams will be drawn into 4 groups that will play single round robin, best-of-2 matches where they will be awarded points based on the best-of-2 results. Groups in this first weekend cannot have two teams from the same region. Points in this group stage will be awarded along the following outcomes:

A 2-0 result would provide the winner with 3 points

A 1-1 draw will award 1 point to both teams

Tiebreakers will be decided by head-to-head scores based on maps and then rounds





The 2 best teams from each group will then move on to the Playoff finals in the 2nd weekend (19-22 August). These teams will be drawn into an 8 team, double elimination bracket with the added rule that teams from the same group cannot meet each other in the first round. 2 teams will emerge victorious and will move on to represent Southeast Asia in Masters 3: Berlin in September 2021.

All 16 teams will be competing for a combined prize pool of USD 100,000 and a total of 260 championship points.

HOW TO WATCH & STAY UPDATED

The action starts on Friday, August 13th, with matches commencing from 11:00am GMT+8 during the two tournament weekends. Twitch will continue to be the English broadcast partner for VCT Challengers Stage 3.

The pandemic has been changing many aspects of our life. Three years ago, when I first came to Việt Nam, cash was still the dominant payment form that people heavily relied on, as I recall it accounted for 75 - 90 per cent of the transactions.

Việt Nam then was different from countries where cashless payments have high adoption rates like Singapore, for example. With everything being cashless, I could go out and easily survive with only 2 dollars in my wallet, as I have my phone and digital payment apps like Apple Pay. However, in Việt Nam, I found myself needing a lot of cash in my wallet, which was an inconvenient practice, especially when I forgot to prepare cash in my wallet.

Since last year, we have witnessed a huge shift to digital payment, in online transactions. Due to social distancing orders, we turn to cashless or online payments in order to minimise physical contact.

This trend toward digital payment is happening across the region, according to our new payments index. At least 94 per cent of people in the Asia Pacific now consider using at least one emerging payment method such as a mobile wallet or digital currency in the coming years, a remarkable change in people’s payment preference as compared to prior to the pandemic where people hardly considered it seriously in Việt Nam.

For a population that preferred cash and cards predominantly, the pandemic really prompted the acceptance of cashless at an unprecedented pace, as from what I observed, Vietnamese people are more likely to ask if the money could be transferred, moving away from the traditional cash reliance mindset.

What other advantages do cashless payments have over traditional cash-based transactions?

We at Mastercard are advocating for cashless because we believe in the many benefits that it offers. Number one is the data from cashless transactions, which also provides great help to the government, banks, and societies in general, in planning.

For example, when you withdraw VNĐ1 million in cash from an ATM and spend it in a shop, there is no record or data of that transaction. But that kind of data is very useful for government planning or for the banks to understand their customers better so they can improve services or even expand their credit line.

For many local micro, small & medium sized enterprises (MSMEs), one of their biggest financial challenges is that they cannot get loans from the banks and must look elsewhere for funding. Such difficulty is caused by their cash-based business operations, which provides no visibility for the banks to examine the business financial capabilities other than income tax statements and financial statements. Such documents are not sufficient for banks to grant businesses a high-value loan of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they could only show a modest yearly income of ten thousand dollars.

Digital payments record a trail of transactions. Banks can look at this digital proof of money into your account and even proactively reach out to offer you credit. This is called being banked, which is not only about having a bank account, but also having access to financing and a presence in the formal economy, so as to get financing from legal entities approved by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). The data is there to protect consumers as well. For instance, if the banks overcharged consumers, SBV could step in.

It's important for such data to be available to governments and formal institutions so they can make the right decisions for people and for businesses.

As a large part of Việt Nam's population still remains unbanked or underbanked, what has Mastercard done to address this issue?

As a global company, we understand that different markets require different approaches. We focus on each market environment and seek to understand what is important to the consumers, as well as areas that we can add value to the market. It's not about Mastercard doing and winning more but about how our solutions can help the government’s cashless agenda, how we use our resources to support the government's directives, and how we cooperate with the banks, fintech companies, the SBV and other partners to drive the bigger objectives for the market.

One of the initiatives we are working on is the unbanked (individuals or households with no bank accounts) or the underbanked (individuals or households with bank accounts but rely on alternative methods to fund purchases and finance). We understand there is a large effort by Việt Nam to address this issue and we are working with our partners to find ways to leapfrog and reach these groups in the most efficient manner.

What's more important is to always ask ourselves whether we still follow the same ways as in the past. For example, the rural areas of Việt Nam have high mobile penetration and Internet penetration rates, even among the unbanked or underbanked segments. So, we try to figure out ways to leverage that advantage to drive cashless payment faster and expand it wider in a more customer-friendly and secured manner. We also put efforts into finding ways to replicate our programmes from different countries and their successes when bringing them to Việt Nam.

What can Việt Nam, as a country, do to speed up the transition to cashless payment?

Việt Nam has been driving the fourth industrial revolution, a collective priority of the whole government. The SBV also serves this goal with efforts to promote a cashless agenda, to build up the capabilities of local partners such as NAPAS, and for international institutions including Mastercard to contribute to.

As the framework for the transition is already in place, along with the fact that the government and the country itself is already welcoming the development, SBV can advance the progress by providing a sandbox - a safe testing environment - for fintech companies such as Mastercard to experiment innovative cashless solutions that are novel to Việt Nam.

It's crucial that banks can test new models and take losses with minimized or no repercussions in a safe playground. The fear of failing and facing great consequences, especially within big institutions, will inhibit innovations. Furthermore, with failure we can learn our lessons and continuously improve our methods. Therefore, providing fintech innovators the safeguard assurance of no penalty when any thing occurs during their experiment will help accelerate the digital transformation further.

Ryuk, Cerber, SamSam top families of the year, making up 64% of all ransomware volume

Government, education, healthcare, retail verticals increasingly targeted by ransomware

Up 59% year-to-date globally, IoT malware continues growth since 2018

Cryptojacking malware remains a key threat, up 23% year-to-date globally and up 22% in the U.S.

SonicWall's patented RTDMI™ finding more never-before-seen malware than ever, posting a 54% year-to-date increase over the first half of 2020





SINGAPORE - Media OutReach - 16 August 2021 - In the first half of 2021, ransomware attacks skyrocketed, eclipsing the entire volume for 2020 in only six months, according to the mid-year update to the 2021 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report published today. In a new paradigm for cybercrime, SonicWall is analyzing how threat actors are using any means possible to further their malicious intents.





With high-profile attacks against established technology and infrastructure, ransomware is now more prevalent than ever. Through the first half of 2021, SonicWall recorded global ransomware volume of 304.7 million, surpassing 2020's full-year total (304.6 million) — a 151% year-to-date increase.

"In a year driven by anxiety and uncertainty, cybercriminals have continued to accelerate attacks against innocent people and vulnerable institutions," said SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner. "This latest data shows that sophisticated threat actors are tirelessly adapting their tactics and embracing ransomware to reap financial gain and sow discord. With remote working still widespread, businesses continue to be highly exposed to risk, and criminals are acutely aware of uncertainty across the cyber landscape. It's crucial that organizations move toward a modern Boundless Cybersecurity approach to protect against both known and unknown threats, particularly when everyone is more remote, more mobile and less secure than ever."





Ransomware running rampant

After posting record highs in both April and May, SonicWall recorded another new high of 78.4 million ransomware attacks in June 2021 alone. Ransomware volume showed massive year-to-date spikes in the U.S. (185%) and the U.K. (144%). Accounting for 64% of all recorded ransomware attacks, Ryuk, Cerber and SamSam were the top three ransomware families in the first half of the year, as recorded by SonicWall Capture Labs.

The top five regions most impacted by ransomware in the first half of 2021 were the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil. Across the U.S., the five hardest-hit states were Florida (111.1 million), New York (26.4 million), Idaho (20.5 million), Louisiana (8.8 million) and Rhode Island (8.8 million).

"The continued rise of ransomware, cryptojacking and other unique forms of malware targeted at monetization, along with their evolution of tactics, are evidence that cybercriminal activity always follows the money and rapidly adapts to new opportunities and changing environments," said SonicWall Vice President of Platform Architecture Dmitriy Ayrapetov.

In line with spikes in global data, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers also recorded alarming ransomware spikes across key verticals, including government (917%), education (615%), healthcare (594%) and retail (264%) organizations.



Patented RTDMI finding, blocking more never-seen-before variants than ever

In the fight against known and unknown threats, SonicWall's patented Real-Time Deep Memory InspectionTM (RTDMI) identified record numbers of never-before-seen malware, posting a 54% year-to-date increase over the first half of 2020.

RTDMI technology blocks more advanced and unknown malware compared to traditional behavior-based sandboxing methods, and with a lower false-positive rate. This can be seen in the latest ICSA Labs Advanced Threat Defense (ATD) Q2 test results, where the SonicWall Capture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) service with RTDMI detected 100% of previously unknown threats with zero false positives across 33 consecutive days of testing.

In its most recent test administered in the second quarter of 2021, ICSA conducted a total of 1,144 tests against Capture ATP, with a mixture of 544 new and little-known malicious samples and 600 innocuous applications. Capture ATP correctly identified 100% of malicious samples while allowing all clean samples through. It was the sixth consecutive ICSA ATD certification for Capture ATP, and second 'perfect score' in as many quarters.

"Third-party validation is hard earned, particularly in today's fast-moving threat landscape," said SonicWall Vice President of Software Engineering & Threat Research Alex Dubrovsky. "Consecutive perfect certifications is a testament to the SonicWall team and our continued quest to arm organizations with intelligence and technology that help protect them from the most dangerous cyber threats."



Malware continues to fall, non-standard port attacks down

Last year, SonicWall recorded a drop in global malware attacks, a trend that continued in the first half of 2021 with a 24% drop in malware volume worldwide. As threat actors become more sophisticated — using ransomware, cryptojacking and other types of cyberattacks to launch surgical strikes — the need for "spray-and-pray" malware attempts have lessened, decreasing overall volume.





Malware attacks via non-standard ports also fell in 2021 after hitting record highs in 2020. These attacks, which aim to increase payloads by bypassing traditional firewall technologies, represent 14% of all malware attempts in the first half of 2021, down from 24% year to date.

Debasish Mukherjee, Vice President, Regional Sales APAC adds "The pandemic drove the effectiveness and volume of cyberattacks to historic highs. Remote workforces, a charged political climate, record prices of cryptocurrency, and threat actors weaponizing cloud storage and tools created new and numerous attack vectors on targets. Threats that were once thought to be two or three years away are now a reality with do-it-yourself, cloud-based tools creating an army of cybercriminals armed with the same devastating force and impact of a nation-state or larger criminal enterprise." He continues "It's imperative the IT industry stay ahead of these mounting threats, strengthen relationships between private and government sectors, and formulate more coordinated efforts to swiftly share threat intelligence and act upon it."



Cryptojacking malware remains a concern

After having made an unexpected revival in 2020, cryptojacking malware continued to climb through the first half of 2021 as cryptocurrency prices remain high. From January to June, SonicWall threat researchers recorded 51.1 million cryptojacking attempts, representing a 23% increase over the same six-month period last year.



Europe was particularly ravaged, recording a 248% year-to-date rise in cryptojacking malware. This increase highlights the volatile shifts of a market cybercriminals have come to leverage due to their high desire for online anonymity when it comes to lucrative payouts.



IoT vector continues to serve threats

Last year, employees packed their belongings and went home in droves, introducing millions of new devices to the network and millions of openings for cybercrime. This year, Internet of Things (IoT) malware attacks have continued to increase, rising 59% year-to-date globally, a trend stemming back to 2018.



While the U.S. saw a slightly smaller 15% year-to-date increase in IoT malware, Europe and Asia also saw alarming rises of 113% and 190%, respectively, in IoT malware volume.

SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers collect and analyze threat intelligence data from 1.1 million sensors in over 215 countries and territories. This includes cross-vector, threat-related information shared among SonicWall security systems, including firewalls, email security devices, endpoint security solutions, honeypots, content filtering systems and the SonicWall Capture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) multi-engine sandbox; SonicWall internal malware analysis automation framework; malware and IP reputation data from tens of thousands of firewalls and email security devices around the globe; and shared threat intelligence from more than 50 industry collaboration groups and research organizations.

HÀ NỘI — The Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) has made a final determination in its investigation into the dumping and subsidising of certain upholstered seating from China and Việt Nam, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Trade Remedies Authority of Việt Nam (TRAV).

Accordingly, out of eight Vietnamese enterprises that co-operated in the investigation, only one is subject to the anti-subsidy tax of 3.7 per cent and the rest will avoid this tax. The anti-subsidy tax rate for non-cooperating businesses is 5.5 per cent.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade attributed the positive result to the close co-operation between the ministry and relevant agencies and People's Committees of provinces and cities to collect information and answer questions from the Canadian side.

The fact that Canada believed that the majority of Vietnamese enterprises do not receive subsidies from the Government shows the transparency of the country’s policy and law enforcement. It also reflected that Việt Nam's economic sectors are operating in an equally competitive market, said the TRAV.

Regarding the anti-dumping investigation, in the CBSA’s final conclusion, most of the enterprises that co-operated in the investigation receive duty rates ranging from 10 to 20 per cent, compared to preliminary levels of 20-90 per cent.

The duty rate for those who didn’t cooperate in the investigation is up to 179.5 per cent. Meanwhile, Chinese enterprises are subject to anti-subsidy tax from 1.1 to 81.1 per cent and anti-dumping duty of between 9.3 and 188 per cent.

In addition to the CBSA's investigation into dumping and subsidising, the Canadian International Trade Court (CITT) is investigating to determine the damage to the domestic industry.

The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) is reported to continue its inquiry to determine whether the imports are harming Canadian producers. It is expected to issue a decision by September 2.

According to the Canadian data, during the investigation period of the case from June 2019 to the end of September 2020, the export turnover of upholstered seats from Việt Nam to Canada reached approximately US$135.6 million, accounting for 10.08 per cent of Canada's total imports of this item.

The TRAV has urged the concerned exporters to keep a close watch on the case and fully co-operate with the CBSA during its investigation. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Traffic started to pick up in HCM City on Friday when social distancing order has not expired. — VNA/VNS Photo Xuân Tình

HÀ NỘI — HCM City, the current COVID-19 epicentre of Việt Nam, will extend its strict social distancing measures for another month until September 15 given the risk of a resurgence, Phan Văn Mãi, vice secretary of the city's Party Committee, said on Sunday.

Speaking at a meeting to receive goods and necessities for people affected by the pandemic in HCM City, Mãi said the pandemic could become more severe if the city relaxes its vigilance.

“Therefore, it’s essential that social distancing be applied to reduce the number of new cases and gradually bring the city to a 'new normal' state", he said.

In order to do so, people's awareness is the most important factor, he emphasised.

Mãi said the city has gone 80 days since the fourth wave of infections broke out with the Delta mutation. The period of social distancing, especially the five weeks of tightening Government’s Directive 16, were "unprecedentedly difficult" days for the political system and people.

The city has made great efforts to control outbreaks and infection chains, removing hundreds of locked down areas, promoting control of red zones, as well as expanding green zones. The health sector also cured more than 70,000 people and administered vaccines for over 4.5 million people.

With the spirit of making all efforts to take care of people, the city has tried its best to reduce difficulties, while ensuring the supply of goods and issuing support packages.

Mãi said the pandemic in HCM City has been partially controlled but is still very complicated; the number of infections is still high; the treatment system is overloaded and its operation is not synchronous. The process of receiving and treating COVID-19 cases is sometimes not efficient and the death rate has not decreased.

He said the Government’s requirement to control the pandemic by September 15 is challenging, but it was the common desire of the people. Leaders of the city affirmed maximum priority towards pandemic prevention, while putting the health and life of the people first and foremost.

To achieve this goal, Mãi said HCM City will focus on implementing four main tasks.

The first is to thoroughly apply social distancing, limiting the source of infection, each person and each household must strictly comply with the requirements of social distancing and the 5K message.

"The pathogen remains widespread in the community, close contacts make it more easy to spread, and that could be very dangerous for people with weak immune systems, the elderly, or those with underlying medical conditions,” he said.

Secondly, the city takes good care of people's lives in the coming days of social distancing, ensuring people’s needs for goods and necessities are met.

The city will mobilise all possible resources to deploy welfare packages for the poor, elderly people who live alone, freelance workers who lost their jobs, to ensure the basic life of people until they return to a “new normal” life.

Third, the city will focus on effective treatment strategies, reducing mortality. The city is expanding the number of hospitals and treatment facilities to meet the needs of emergency, oxygen support, medical care and deploying F0 home treatment.

Fourth, the city is speeding up vaccination to achieve herd immunity. However Mãi emphasised that even when the vaccination rate is high, implementing the 5K message is still a requirement.

The need to impose social distancing for one more month was also noted earlier on Saturday by Secretary of HCM Party Committee Nguyễn Văn Nên at a conference about assessment of pandemic prevention and control results after two weeks of implementing Directive 12, issued by the HCM City Party Committee's Standing Commission on strengthening several measures to implement the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic in HCM City.

The city has implemented the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 on social distancing rules since July 9 and started to impose even more restrictions from July 24 to contain spread of the virus.

On July 23, the Municipal People's Committee decided to extend the application of social distancing measures until August 1.

On August 1, the city issued a decision on imposing city-wide social distancing measures under the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 for an additional 14 days from 0:00 on August 2. — VNS

The pandemic has made the lives of poor people worse, and they are in dire need of support. Realising this, CT Group calls on people from all walks of life to give them a hand in order to not let them don’t have enough food to eat or get sick.

CT Group bought the rice, and, together with the HCM City Union of Business Associations and other benefactors, handed it over directly to the families.

Its employees from various divisions and supermarket staff split into several teams to complete the task as well as contribute to the country’s epidemic prevention and control efforts.

For instance, they provide meals daily to poor people in District 4 together with the local Women's Union and the Communist Youth Union, help the Department of Information and Communication prepare hundreds of thousands of flyers on anti-epidemic guidance, repair COVID examination areas at ​​Phạm Ngọc Thạch Hospital, and donate ventilators to medical units.

All the company’s employees are united and not afraid of the difficulties they might face while supporting disadvantaged people in the city.

The tens of billions of đồng used to carry out the tasks come not only from the company, but also from voluntary staff contributions.

Trucks carrying the first consignments of rice under a campaign to donate 1,000 tonnes to people living in over 350 locked-down areas in HCM City arrive at CT Group’s central warehouses in the city. The campaign aims to ensure poor people do not suffer from hunger.

CT Group donates 1,000 tonnes of rice to support people living in difficult circumstances in HCM City amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since June CT Group has also set up two machines to dispense rice for free, dubbed ATMs, at 20A Trương Định, District 3, and 360 Hanoi Highway, Thủ Đức City, to help disadvantaged people.

HÀ NỘI — The COVID-19 pandemic has been the defining headline of 2020, a humanitarian challenge that will have lasting effects on how people live, work, and play.

While many industries have been negatively impacted by the virus outbreak, the travel and hospitality industries have suffered the greatest setback. With international travel bans, social distancing measures and a significant reduction in the operations of public transportation, hotels and resorts have become deserted and many have been forced to temporarily shut down. According to the Việt Nam National Administration of Tourism, the number of food and beverage and accommodation businesses halting activities in the first quarter of 2020 increased by 29 per cent year-on-year, and the outbreak has caused an estimated US$5.9-7.7 billion in losses for Việt Nam’s tourism sector in the first three months of the year alone.

Nonetheless, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) has announced plans to stimulate the tourism market, with an initial focus on domestic travellers. The stimulus programme, devised alongside local governments, and transportation and travel companies, will offer attractive promotions to encourage domestic consumers to travel. Another focus in this plan is on the business travel segment, both domestic and international. The MCST has correctly identified that the first wave of international travellers will be for business purposes, and has outlined a plan to restart international travel by creating a biosphere between Việt Nam and countries that have excelled in their response to COVID-19, such as South Korea.

With these plans underway, there is a significant opportunity for quality affordable business hotels located in major cities to rebound effectively from the disruption of COVID-19. The hotel supply in Việt Nam is dominated by 1- to 2-star hotels run as family businesses, representing 77 per cent of the total supply. While some business travellers still choose to stay at traditional hotels, many now require fast, flexible, and convenient services. They expect technology to be integrated in the hotel experience and want a setting that promotes productivity and rest. Budget business hotels located in metropolitan areas that are able to integrate these elements will be able to attract domestic and international business travellers and enhance their opportunity to recover faster than their traditional competitors.

The Global Business Travel Association also forecasts business travel spending to grow between 4-6 per cent between 2020 and 2023, and Việt Nam has the potential to be a big winner in this segment. New multilateral trade agreements and the on-going and future relocation of companies and plants from China to ASEAN countries could boost business travel to and from Việt Nam.

According to an Oxford Economics USA Report, corporate travel contributes to higher client retention, benefits business development and presents networking opportunities for a hotel, with the added benefit of being less seasonal and more predictable. In a 2018 survey by booking.com, 51 per cent of business travellers are also happy to extend their business trips for leisure. This segment can be extremely lucrative and can be the driving force for economic recovery.

Việt Nam has earned praise for exemplary measures to fight against COVID-19, despite sharing a 1,100km long border with China. As of the writing of this article, the country has recorded 328 cases, zero deaths and has a recovery rate of 92 per cent. In a study released by Hong Kong’s Deep Knowledge Group, Việt Nam was recognised as one of the 20 safest countries in the world to weather the COVID-19 storm. With great efforts dedicated to containing the virus, the implementation of financial relief policies and a well-thought-out recovery plan to boost travel, there is optimism that Việt Nam’s tourism and hospitality industries can return to its pre-pandemic strength, driven initially by business travel.

According to Malina Ngai, CEO of A.S. Watson (Asia & Europe), "Most beauty lovers struggle to find the right shade as normally we apply foundation tester on hands. In most cases, the skin colour on hands is slightly different from the face. We know this is the pain point of customers and this inspires us to work on a solution. Our eLab digital team developed this together with Watsons makeup artists. I've tried it, and am confident that our customers will love it."





Technology Enhances the O+O Retail Shopping Experience

They can also save the recommendation via email for later reference when visiting the stores.





Innovation Makes Shopping Fun and Easy

Ngai shares her experience, "We all have foundations at home which we're not happy with the colour as they don't give a perfect match. Making use of AR technology, we can help our customers to find a much closer match to give a perfect look.

"In fact, we've been pioneering the application of AR technology in our O+O experience for beauty lovers. Simply using our Watsons app on their smart phones, they can try on different colour cosmetics and hair colour. Customers are now addicted to their phones, and being able to build a relationship with them involves both our physical store touch point as well as digital is the essence of our O+O strategy.

The health ministry said that 72 per cent of the received doses have been distributed.

According to the National Government Portal on COVID-19 Vaccination, HCM City, the epicentre of the fourth wave of infections and which has been allocated the most vaccines, is leading the race with over 3.5 million doses administered.

The park business association wants to trial daily commute by key staff between home and work instead of accommodating them on-site, which is financially stressing businesses. — Photo nld.com.vn

HCM CITY — The Sài Gòn Hi-tech Park Business Association has sought city authorities’ permission for its workers to travel to work from home since organising accommodation on-site for them is difficult.

Since July 15 businesses at the park in District 9 have been providing accommodation to workers as mandated by the city, either in their premises or other lodging places nearby.

Besides the enormous cost, they are also facing problems such as vehicles transporting staff or meals getting stuck at checkpoints, delaying work and stressing workers.

Many skilled personnel needed by their employers are also stuck at home, and their availability again would help restore production.

According to the association, long term solutions are needed to reconcile the strict distancing requirements under Directive 16 with the financial and psychological burden on businesses and staff.

In the event, it has suggested a pilot initiative allowing key, experienced workers at two businesses who have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose to commute to work from home between July 16 and 30.

They have to sign commitments to only travel to their home and workplace, and strictly follow pandemic regulations. Their movements will be monitored by an application or other methods.

Their workplace will be separated from the other workers’.

Their family members too will not be allowed to leave home during the duration of the trial, and will be tested at home for COVID.

The two businesses will transport them and frequently test them.

The pilot will continue even if some test positive as long as their number is less than 10 per cent of the total.

The plan has been submitted to the park management board and HCM City Business Association. Hồ Thị Thu Uyên, head of SBA, hoped it would help the Government and businesses overcome the pandemic.

HCM City is the COVID epicentre of the country with almost 140,000 cases by Friday morning. VNS

Connecting farming households to e-commerce platforms and bringing agricultural products online was critical to promote the digital economy of the agriculture sector. — VNA/VNS Photo

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam looks to connect five million farming households to e-commerce platforms this year, which would create breakthroughs in the development of the digital economy in the agriculture sector, Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Phạm Anh Tuấn said.

This was the highlight of the ministry’s plan approved in late July to provide support to farmers to take their products online and promote the development of the digital economy in the agriculture and rural sector.

At an online conference this week to implement the plan, Tuấn said that the plan aimed to connect farming households with e-commerce platforms to promote their products, expand markets and encourage consumption of farm produce.

Tuấn asked local departments of agriculture and rural development and industry and trade to cooperate with two selected post companies Vietnam Post and Viettel Post to develop detailed plans for connecting local farmers with e-commerce platforms this month.

Tuấn said that five million farming households would be connected to e-commerce platforms by the end of this year, which would create the first breakthrough in developing the digital economy for the agriculture sector, adding that support would continue to be provided in following years.

Nguyễn Trọng Đường, Deputy Director of the ministry’s Department of Enterprise Management, said that it was important to make farmers see the benefits of bringing their products online.

For a bigger goal, the ministry aimed to connect a total of 13 million farming and individual business households to e-commerce platforms, Đường said.

Statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Agricultural Products Processing and Development Department showed that to date, only around 8,000 farming households with more than 14,500 agricultural products were connected to e-commerce platforms.

E-commerce platforms provided a good channel for distributing agricultural products, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A clear example could be seen from the consumption of lychee of COVID-hit Bắc Giang Province in May. More than 8,000 tonnes of lychee was sold in 63 provinces and cities nationwide via two platforms Postmart and Voso.

According to Tuấn, the volume of agricultural products sold via e-commerce platforms remained modest. However, e-commerce platforms would not only play a role in selling the products but also in promoting the products and expanding markets, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. — VNS

'The bigger your dreams, the bigger your challenges. The higher your position, the bigger risk you take. So don't keep thinking just of the beauty of things but be ready for what the real challenges are.'

Actor Dato' Aaron Aziz emphasised the importance of investing in children's education and being receptive to their opinions. 'Do not look down on our youth, give them the opportunity, hear them out, listen to what is being said, and not to who is saying it,' the actor said.

'That has been my direction for the past ten years. I took anything that came my way. People said: 'Janna Nick, you act, you sing, you host, you want to do everything, even business.'

This measure was taken in accordance with safety measures implemented nationwide to minimise contact and any potential exposure, for both clients and their coaches.

2. Coaches Are Required To Put On A Face Shield At All Times Except When Demonstrating Swimming Techniques

During swimming lessons, Justswim Singapore requires their coaches to put on a face shield at all times to minimise the transmission of droplets.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@United Nations Security Council High-level Open Debate on “Enhancing Maritime Security - A Case for International Cooperation” was held virtually on August 9. — Photo from UN Security Council

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s approach and initiatives laid out by Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính’s at the United Nations Security Council High-level Open Debate on “Enhancing Maritime Security - A Case for International Cooperation” earlier this week have drawn appreciation from international experts, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reports.

Mr. James Rogers, co-founder and Director of Research at the UK's Council on Geostrategy, who specialises in British geostrategic and maritime power, and Euro-Atlantic, Indo-Pacific and Polar geopolitics, in an interview with the VNA correspondent in the UK, agreed with PM Chính’s emphasis on the fact that given the significance of the sea for the system of international commerce, it was important to keep it open and free for access by all countries.

Mr. Rogers said although most countries had signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which governs the behaviours that countries can undertake at sea, some countries had ignored rules and regulations they subscribed to in the past. That was the problem for all countries, not just those around the South China Sea (called the East Sea in Việt Nam), he said.

The British expert acknowledged the importance of regional coordination for maritime security in the South China Sea as proposed by PM Chính, pointing out that this should be facilitated not only in the UN, but also in ASEAN, particularly in relation to regulations of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. He also pointed to the necessity for a coordination mechanism that encourages countries to uphold important maritime norms established through the UNCLOS system.

He agreed with the Vietnamese PM's point that regulations and conduct of states at sea must comply with both the UN Charter and UNCLOS system, saying that any additional future policy or proposals in relation to the East Sea security and maritime rights must correspond to these rules and regulations that the countries have subscribed to.

He said it was very good seeing Việt Nam as an important regional power and close partner with many different countries in the world, including the UK, taking the lead in bringing this issue to international attention. He also acknowledged the role of Việt Nam and its support and leadership in dealing with security issues in the South China Sea, given the country's important location.

Regarding maritime security cooperation between Việt Nam and the UK, Mr. Rogers said the two countries would have many different opportunities in the coming years given the UK's increasing presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

He said the UK's deployment of the carrier strike group (CSG 21) in the region demonstrated that the country was undertaking its tilt towards the Indo-Pacific, which was put forward in the UK government's integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy released in March this year.

He pointed out that the UK understands the strategic significance of the Indo-Pacific and the South China Sea in Southeast Asia in particular, and therefore, takes the region seriously when deploying its largest and most powerful maritime group in the region.

As the UK intends to deploy later this year two patrol vessels permanently in the region beyond the periodic deployment, which will interact with regional partners, of which Việt Nam is an important one, Mr. Rogers said he saw the prospect for enhancing Việt Nam-UK cooperation.

Lauding Việt Nam’s proposals, Professor Giuseppe Cataldi from the University of Naples “L’Orientale”, who is President of the International Association of Maritime Law, reiterated Việt Nam’s call for relevant parties to intensify dialogue and cooperation and respect for international law, particularly the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Agreeing with Việt Nam’s view that UNCLOS is the "Constitution" of the seas and oceans, Cataldi said that countries needed to comply with the provisions of this original legal document and avoid unilateral actions that may escalate current maritime disputes.

Dr. Antonio Albanese, expert in world geopolitics, director of AGC Communication, assessed that Việt Nam’s proposals not only showed the universality in the global context, but also contributed to promoting a substantive approach to solving specific problems of the region. Việt Nam had affirmed its support for ensuring maritime security based on clear and consistent rules within the UN framework and concretised into common codes of conduct, he stated.

Việt Nam’s stance of resolutely opposing any unilateral actions and seeking multilateral and peaceful solutions was a suitable choice for the interests of each country and the globe’s common interests, thus ensuring equal access for all countries, especially in the fields of international trade and navigation, he added.

As an expert in Asian geopolitics, Prof. Antonio Fallico, President of the Conoscere Eurasia Association in Veneto, stated that Việt Nam’s proposals clearly demonstrated a foreign policy of peace and cooperation and its responsibility for regional and international stability and security.

From the Czech Republic, Dr. Takashi Hosoda, an expert on Việt Nam and the Asia-Pacific from the country’s Charles University, said that PM Chính’s speech could be considered an important milestone for the relations between Việt Nam and India because the Prime Minister of India – the rotating Chairman of the UN Security Council – was the one who took the initiative to organise, and also presided over the UNSC meeting.

Việt Nam and India played increasingly important roles in ensuring the maintenance of maritime security in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific as well as resolving issues related to peace and security in the region. The two countries also shared many strategic similarities, so it was important for Việt Nam to enhance cooperation with India, Hosoda stated.

He spoke highly of the proposals made by the Vietnamese Government leader to contribute to solving maritime security challenges, especially the need for the international community to raise awareness of the importance of maritime security as well as threats to marine security.

To that end, the expert suggested Việt Nam make specific contributions within the bilateral and multilateral cooperation frameworks, including the cooperation mechanisms between the European Union (EU) and Asian countries such as the EU Critical Maritime Route Wider Indian Ocean (CRIMARIO).— VNS

TOKYO — Vietnamese Ambassador to Japan, Vũ Hồng Nam, paid a working visit to Niigata to foster economic partnerships between the Japanese prefecture and Vietnamese localities.

During the trip on Tuesday, Ambassador Nam met with Niigata Governor Hideyo Hanazumi, expressing his hope that COVID-19 will be controlled soon, so that businesses of both countries can promote their co-operation activities.

Hideyo Hanazumi said that the Niigata administration and other localities highly value the Vietnamese Embassy's role in connecting firms of Niigata and Việt Nam, and pledged to create optimal conditions for improving investment efficiency.

At a talk with leaders of Sanjo city in Niigata and a number of local firms investing in Việt Nam, Nam said that Vietnamese consumers are interested in steel products of Japan, expressing his hope that the city will continue to support businesses investing in Việt Nam, especially in overcoming the pandemic.

Sanjo Mayor Ryo Takizawa said that the city is pleased to become the major unit to implement co-operation projects using the Japanese government's ODA in Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Province through the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA).

Takizawa said that the Sanjor Chamber of Commerce and Industry signed a cooperation document on human resources training with the Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Department of Industry and Trade in 2017.

Local firms in Sanjo spoke highly of online exchange events between business communities of Sanjo and Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu in May.

The embassy is working with agencies to report the difficulties facing Niigata firms in cooperating with Việt Nam, especially those caused by COVID-19, to the Prime Minister, seeking timely solutions, Ambassador Nam told Vietnam News Agency correspondents in Tokyo after the visit.

E-logistics is a rather new concept even to the logistics industry in Việt Nam.

The increasingly intense competition in all sectors due to globalisation means companies have to reduce costs or perish, and to cut costs they are adopting new strategies like supply chain management and e-logistics.

According to AMR Research, e-logistics helps reduce logistics costs by 10 per cent. That is why behemoths like Dell, Compaq and Hewlett Packard have embraced it.

But e-logistics however face many challenges in developing markets like economic and educational barriers, lack of infrastructure, security and trust and privacy, channel conflicts, security problems, global terrorism, and geographical barriers.

As one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in the world, Việt Nam is considered a highly promising market for e-logistics.

Its e-commerce is worth US$13.2 billion and growing at 15 per cent annually. The boom in online shopping and home delivery in recent years, especially with the advent of COVID-19, has created a huge opportunity for e-logistics operators, analysts said.

Logistics costs now make up 10 per cent of turnover in many sectors, meaning e-logistics activities could potentially be worth billions of dollars in the coming time, they pointed out.

They said it is imperative for logistics enterprises to get a full understanding of the advantages of and the urgent need for digital transformation since most of them have been slow in embracing it.

If they speed up their digital transformation they would enhance their competitiveness and be able to penetrate overseas markets after the pandemic ends, they said.

High logistics costs affect the competitiveness of goods and services, thus posing an obstacle for Vietnamese businesses seeking to enter new markets.

The country’s logistics costs as a ratio of GDP are six percentage points higher than Thailand’s, seven percentage points higher than China’s and 12 percentage points higher than Malaysia’s.

They are around 20 per cent of GDP while globally they range between 9 per cent and 14 per cent.

High costs of e-logistics

But experts said the Vietnamese logistics industry would find it very difficult to exploit the advantages of e-logistics since technology plays an important role but is high-priced.

A company seeking to foray into e-logistics services supply chain needs to invest millions of dollars into automatic commodity classification systems, which are able to process millions of orders in multiple categories and to many different delivery destinations but still ensure deliveries are done to the right customers and at the right time.

They also need some vital software solutions that cost hundreds of billions of đồng.

An order management system manages the lifecycle of an order.

A warehouse management system is a software solution that collates a business’ entire inventory and manages supply chain fulfilment operations from the distribution center to store shelves.

A transportation management system serves as a logistics platform that uses technology to help businesses plan, execute and optimise the physical movement of goods and makes sure shipments are compliant and have proper documentation.

Enterprise resources planning (ERP) is software that organisations use to manage day-to-day business activities such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management and compliance, and supply chain operations.

The huge costs needed to develop such IT infrastructure create a financial barrier for local logistics firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Another big challenge for the firms, especially SMEs, to surmount is the need to have a network of branches, agents and warehouses across the country.

E-logistics also requires quality human resources who are able to adapt to digital technologies.

Some industry insiders concurred with the analysts, admitting that lack of financial capacity, human resources and suitable technologies prevent Vietnamese logistics companies from adopting digital transformation.

Only some global logistics management software is used in Việt Nam, making it difficult for domestic firms to identify optimal ones, they said.

Thus, around 40 per cent of the software used for international forwarding management, warehouse management, transport management, electronic data exchange, and customs declaration remains very basic.

Besides, logistics companies’managers are not confident about data and payment security and so hesitate to go digital.

According to the Việt Nam Logistics Business Association, not many firms adopt integrated solutions in their logistics and supply chains.

The country now has around 30,000 businesses providing logistics services, 90 per cent of which are SMEs with a capital of less VNĐ10 billion (some $434,780) and another 5 per cent with VNĐ10-20 billion.

Only a few large companies can therefore meet the conditions for participating in e-logistics supply chains, including multinationals DHL and Fedex, Viettel Post and Vietnam Post.

Analysts said with e-commerce growing rapidly the Government and logistics firms need to soon have action programmes to sustain Vietnamese logistics firms’s market shares right in the domestic market.

Preferential policies in terms of taxes, land rentals and interest on loans are needed to enable domestic logistics firms to build warehouses and commodity classification systems so that they could compete with large foreign rivals.

Vietnam Post and Viettel Post have a competitive advantage in the form of delivery networks with large warehouses across the country, and would be able to compete with foreign rivals if they are more proactive with regard to technology, human resource training and improving corporate governance, they said.

They also said the Government should encourage leading IT firms to develop e-logistics administration software and sell them to logistics SMEs at reasonable costs, thus enabling them to enter e-logistics supply chains.

They said logistics SMEs that cannot invest in technology should focus on niche markets with small orders and single products to serve retail enterprises and sellers on social networks and mobile devices.

By this way they are likely to survive since the quality requirements from such customers are not too high for them to meet, they said.

SMEs should learn from the experience of large logistics players who have achieved digital transformation, and meanwhile should start getting acquainted with e-contracts, digital payment of taxes and digitisation of all business activities, they suggested.

To achieve digitial transformation, they must work closely with industry business groups and universities to retrain their human resources to operate digital logistics systems, they added. VNS

Just before July 27, Việt Nam’s tourism sector was on its way to an impressive recovery relative to the rest of the world; thanks to the summer holidays, top tourist hotspots were packed with local travellers looking to enjoy the sun, bolstered by promotions launched to boost domestic tourism as borders were likely to be closed for at least another quarter.

Flight routes approached 80 per cent traffic capacity during Tết, the busiest time of the year. According to the Việt Nam National Association of Tourism (VNAT), in June, many provinces recorded an increase of 1.5-3 times the number of arrivals of May, whereby Sa Pa recorded an increase of 2.65 times, Quảng Ninh 3.23 times, Quy Nhơn 2.8 times and Phú Yên 1.5 times. VNAT also estimates more than 31 million domestic arrivals for the first seven months of 2020, with 8 million corresponding to July alone – more than a quarter of travel for the entire year in just one month.

All of this momentum came to an abrupt halt the weekend of July 26, reverting the COVID-19 sentiment to panic and freezing Việt Nam’s economy as a whole and tourism in particular once again. Within two days, 31,000 guests from HCM City cancelled their bookings; an estimated 70-80 per cent of tour groups scheduled for the end of July and beginning of August travels from Ha Noi cancelled, and although most cancellations involved Đà Nẵng, a ripple effect was seen as tours to Phú Quốc, Đà Lạt and Nha Trang were affected as well. VNAT expressed concerns that many travel and accommodation companies would not be able to recover from the second wave of COVID-19 as losses exceeded predictions after six months.

The performance of city hotels, especially in the economic centre of HCM City and the old quarter of Hà Nội, suffered the most with the absence of inbound foreign travellers. Minimising losses by cutting expenses, rotating personnel, focusing on food and beverage (F&B) services and staycation packages were a number of measures employed to help generate revenue, but have barely been enough to cover the high operational costs.

Instead of focusing on costs and staff rotations, owners need to consider a structural shift. Some examples include retaining quality personnel while ensuring adaptability and flexibility, streamlining operational processes for greater efficiency, refining product offerings, filtering and localising supply chains, and providing cross-training to personnel to add new capabilities such as delivery and takeout for F&B services while maintaining new health and safety standards and protocols. Cash flow models should be updated weekly or bi-weekly with actual against budget comparisons.

More importantly, the pandemic creates an environment where close collaboration and co-operation between tourism stakeholders is essential for lasting success. We now live in a world where outbreaks will become increasingly frequent and we must accept the realities of a post-COVID world. The decades-old traditional hotel model is a thing of the past and owners and operators who adapt the quickest will reap the benefits in the long-term.

At a local level, hotels should work closely with F&B, travel and transport companies to overcome booking cancellations and generate more commercial opportunities behind creative solutions that go beyond a hotel’s core services. Strategic partnerships involving comprehensive packages with improved flexibility on duration of redemption and leisure activities unique to the location of each hotel can help all parties avoid cancellations and boost consumption by giving customers the sense of control and an opportunity to rediscover their home city. The collaboration can also work together to exchange market research and put together campaigns to understand customers’ behavioural changes to grasp what consumers are looking for as the pandemic evolves.

Regionally, hoteliers can rally owners, developers, consultants, government agencies and authorities to create private-public taskforces for the modernisation and strategic positioning of recovery mechanisms, working together to ensure every company is uniquely positioned to capture growth opportunities and is co-ordinating to overcome the crisis – as partners rather than competitors.

Information sharing is crucial to all stakeholders, especially owners and developers, as thorough understanding of operational readiness against crises will help as parties build operational protocols for the future. Local developers should seek international consultants and hotel management experts for comprehensive and specific solutions, from eliminating risks of contamination through common water and ventilation systems, limiting the touching of shared surfaces such as doorknobs, light switches, to forecasting demand and optimising opening dates at the expense of development.

Hospitality stakeholders need to co-ordinate multiple taskforce management teams to facilitate quick assessment and decision-making that will ensure hotels are strategically positioned to perform during and post-pandemic. While it's understandable that most players will initially be apprehensive in sharing information and co-operating with different stakeholders (and supposed competitors), we must take the long-term view and contribute to building resilience and ensure the continuity of the hospitality business.

PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA - Media OutReach - 12 August 2021 - Prince Charitable Foundation, the charitable arm of Prince Holding Group ("Prince Group"), one of Cambodia's largest and fastest growing conglomerates, will sponsor the Career Preparation program run by Caring for Cambodia, a leading charity that provides free education for 7,000 impoverished students, for the coming academic year. The partnership with Caring for Cambodia, announced on International Youth Day, highlights how Prince Group has embarked on a new journey at a crucial time when youth unemployment is expected to increase due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic situation in Cambodia. By supporting the Career Preparation program, Prince Group is looking to invest in the future of Cambodia by empowering and validating an institutional approach to youth development.









"We are pleased to partner with Prince Holding Group as we look to expand and enhance our Career Preparation program," said Jamie Amelio, Founder and CEO of Caring for Cambodia. "In the new environment defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, high school and university students will need substantial support to help them secure a strong foundation for their futures. To achieve better educational outcomes, Caring for Cambodia believes that public-private partnerships involving potential employers like member companies of Prince Holding Group and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport will be key."

Launched in 2006, the Career Preparation program helps more than 3,000 students every year by imparting information related to scholarships, carrying out career-related training (bolstering their interview skills, for example), offering internships, organizing career fairs, arranging visits to universities and introducing high school students to inspirational speakers from diverse fields. The program equips high school students with a post-graduate toolkit that makes a crucial difference, as students graduating from Caring for Cambodia schools are 18 times more likely to enroll in universities compared to the national average.

"Prince Holding Group is excited to support a high-impact initiative like Caring for Cambodia's Career Preparation program," said Cliff Koh, Secretary-General of Prince Holding Group. "As a responsible Cambodian conglomerate that contributes to sustainable development via education, healthcare and community engagement initiatives, sponsoring Caring for Cambodia's Career Preparation program will help Cambodian youth at an important juncture in their lives."

Further, the program also helps Caring for Cambodia alumni currently studying at universities with their job search process. Schools supported by Caring for Cambodia are some of the only ones in the country that prepare students with the skills they need to help them qualify for work in growth fields like telecommunications, logistics and conservation.

In the realm of education, Prince Group has offered regular support over the years and most notably brought the art of Swiss watchmaking to Cambodia by establishing the country's first independent watchmaking school last year, which gives Cambodian youth the opportunity to learn a new artisanal skill and gain the necessary experience to help them in job markets in Cambodia and abroad. The Group follows an established environment, social and governance (ESG) strategy on behalf of member companies, with educational initiatives that bring a long-term impact a key focus.

As a part of an overarching strategy, Prince Group Chairman Neak Oknha Chen Zhi (陳志公爵) has also answered the call for assistance from the Cambodian Government to combat the February 20 COVID-19 outbreak by announcing plans to donate US$3 million to anti-pandemic efforts. Towards the end of 2020, Chen Zhi also committed US$3 million to help Cambodia purchase COVID-19 vaccines.

Over the years, Prince Charitable Foundation has organized more than 250 charitable events and donated funds and other materials worth more than US$14 million, benefitting more than 500,000 people.

Prince Group will continue to support Cambodians from all walks of life and take a holistic approach to education support in the Kingdom, regularly engaging with the best-in-class solution providers and seeking high-impact initiatives that will ensure sustainable and enduring progress.

It addresses common vision problems faced by people, such as short-sightedness, amblyopia (lazy eye), visual fatigue and eye strain especially among schoolchildren and senior citizens

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach - 13 August 2021 - According to the Health Ministry, at least 80% of all blindness or limited vision cases can be prevented or treated[1]. With this understanding, Be Quinn Global (BeQ), a health and beauty company launched its first flagship product, Lumina Eye Vitamin, that aims to enhance vision and provide essential nutrients that can help maintain eye health and good macular function.









Formulated in Japan with three main ingredients - Lutein & Zeaxanthin, Blue Green Algae, and Prune Extract - Lumina Eye Vitamin was created to address common vision problems faced by people, such as short-sightedness, amblyopia (lazy eye), visual fatigue and eye strain induced by excessive screen time (including dry eyes, conjunctivitis and night blindness, among others), especially among schoolchildren and senior citizens, and more serious problems such as cataracts and aging macular degeneration.

A study in 2013 found that more than six in 10 people wear glasses or contact lenses[2], and another study done by The Segamat Paediatric Eye Disease Study done in 2016 found that one in 10 children in Malaysia has an undiagnosed vision problem that can lead to chronic headaches and learning difficulties[3].

The study, which involved 1,287 children, also found that 12.5 per cent (161 children) of them suffer from visual impairment, and 61 per cent of the 161 children have bilateral visual impairment.

Loreen Ling, the founder and CEO of BeQ says "When I was 8, I was diagnosed with the lazy eye condition, something that can be corrected with early diagnosis and treatment. The awareness regarding eye health back then was pretty low, but I was lucky to have been diagnosed early. Unfortunately, there are so many people out there who are suffering from the same problem, and I wish more people are aware of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for excellent vision health."

Lumina, with its Hexane-free formulation, is vegetarian-safe and contains the minerals and nutrients required for maintaining eye health and good macular function. It also contains extracts from butterfly pea flower and blueberry, which were extracted using a high technology extraction process and micro activation to ensure the purity of the product, apart from also containing soy lecithin, taurine, ascorbic acid, and astaxanthin, all components proven to be beneficial for eye health. The patented manufacturing process makes it a natural product with minimal residual solvents, and non-toxic.

"Some eye conditions are related to your genes. While you can't do much to reduce your genetic risk, there are some changes that you can make to your diet and lifestyle that can help make it less likely that you'll develop conditions affecting your vision," says Loreen.

"However, most of the time, we do not consume sufficient amounts of vitamins & minerals, antioxidants and phytoestrogen from our normal diet, which is crucial for eye health. Lumina, with its safe botanical formula, includes all the necessary nutrients to serve the purpose. With the natural plant & herbs extract that have been clinically proven, maintaining your eyesight has never been easier," she adds.

Apart from enhancing vision concentration and sharpness, Lumina can also support healthy eye function, preserve overall eye health, maintain the density of the protective macular pigment of the retina, and protect against free radicals.

It can be taken every day, and BeQ advises users to take 2 sachets per day for the first 10 days before gradually easing into 1 sachet intake per day.

In regards to the effectiveness, Loreen says "It depends on the condition of your health as well as age and other factors. Everyone is unique, therefore, results will vary. Some benefits will be noticeable around 15-21 days, however, the best results usually take approximately 4-6 weeks of regular use."

Lumina is JAKIM Halal-certified, HACCP-certified, KKM-approved, ISO-9001-certified and is produced in a GMP-certified manufacturer. To date, BeQ claims that a box of Lumina is sold every 10 minutes and they have exported their products to Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan with testimonials from over 15,000 customers.

BeQ is also launching I-mmuplus in August, an immune system booster containing liposomal Vitamin C, which are tiny, nano-sized bubbles that mimic the body's own cell membranes and are designed to protect the Vitamin C as it travels through the body, providing faster absorption.

All BeQ products can be purchased from BeQ's own website, as well as various pharmacies and health supplement shops in Malaysia, as well as its registered agents in Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

One lucky family will see their nursery revamped for their expecting or newborn child, ensuring assistance and support for parents in need.

SINGAPORE - Media OutReach - 12 August 2021 - Leading baby retailer Mothercare is inviting its customers and community to share stories about parenthood and family life for a chance to win a complete nursery makeover. The SG Cribs programme was first started in 2020 by Mothercare to give relief to parents in Singapore, both familiar and new, while supporting local business partners at the same time.





As many families in Singapore have been affected by the changing economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mothercare is using SG Cribs to create a positive social change by giving back to the community, one project at a time.













Assisting Mothers and Families in need

Couples who are expecting or have just welcomed a new arrival into the family will often want to dedicate a space in their home as a nursery for their newborn. The SG Cribs programme is aimed at helping mothers and families in need who do not have the resources to build and furnish their child's nursery the way they want to.

"I grew up in a low income family, whereby both my parents are unfit for work [due to health problems]. Given our family circumstances, we received support from the government and charity organisations," shared 29-year-old Rong Rong back in 2020 before she became the first winner of the SG Cribs competition.





Recollecting her own memories of growing up in a low income family and using hand-me-downs, Rong Rong wished for her baby girl Kate, then eight months old, to enjoy a more comfortable childhood than her own.





"I hope this contest will allow my girl to experience a different childhood by having a room, a beautiful and nice room that she will be happy to come home to," she added. Find out more about her story here.





By sharing such narratives about parenthood with Mothercare, parents stand a chance to win a nursery makeover including decor, soft sheets and swaddle, playmats, and crafted toys coordinated by a professional stylist. At the same time, Mothercare's partnership with local businesses helps to showcase popular items and services from these brands that can enhance the nursery experience for both parents and the baby.





Sponsors for SG Cribs 2021 include:

Hello Circus

Enstories

Soft Spot

Wander Mats

Med Karlek Inc.





There are no requirements to enter the contest, although entrants can increase their odds of winning if they follow the listed sponsors on their Instagram accounts.

Interested parents can fill in an online form to share their stories of parenthood and family for a chance to win SG Cribs 2021. Friends and family can also join in and show their support by nominating someone they think deserves a nursery makeover.

HÀ NỘI — Enterprises in HCM City and other southern provinces have shelled billions of dong to implement the "3 on-site" model for business continuity however production at these facilities is still at risk of disruption due to the pandemic.

Launched last month, the "3 on-site" model, which involves eating, sleeping, and working without leaving aims to keep production going while ensuring COVID-19 control and prevention measures are met.

However, the implementation of the model, which was applied successfully in the northern industrial hubs of Bắc Giang and Bắc Ninh in June, has created problems for many enterprises in the southern provinces with positive cases of COVID-19 spreading rapidly throughout industrial zones and the enterprises.

As of August 3, there were 1,931 positive cases found in the 285 businesses working under the model in the southern province of Bình Dương, where 3,747 enterprises were applying the "3 on-site" model.

The authorities of Tiền Giang, located next to HCM City, decided to pause the model in the province from July 29 to the end of August 4 as cases of infection spread.

Trương Thị Lệ Khanh, chairwoman of the Board of Directors of Vạn Đức Tiền Giang Company said 1,200 workers at her firm who tested negative for COVID-19 and work under the 3 on-site had to stop while they waited for a new decision from the authorities.

Khanh told local media: "It is a 'big shock' when our business is complying with the policy and has spent tens of billions of dong to arrange the model and to run it safely without a positive case."

As the company was one of the main facilities for processing of Vĩnh Hoàn Seafood, one of the leading seafood firms in Việt Nam, its postponed operations will disrupt the supply chain.

It also operated aquaculture facilities where it grows pangasius which cannot be sold if overgrown.

Khanh also said that when production stopped suddenly, workers could not return to their homes as most of them had not been vaccinated and most localities were under social distancing orders.

On August 5, many enterprises in Đồng Nai Province asked the authorities to stop the model as they could not bear the cost after a little more than a month.

In HCM City, Lê Viết Hải, Chairman of HCM City Association of Construction and Building Material and chairman of Hoà Bình Construction Group said: “Business cannot survive under this model.”

Hải said the model could not utilise the advantages the model affords due to limited financial resources. These costs include controlling the entry and exit of employees and frequent testing of the workforce. There is also a lack of resources to provide food and accommodation for workers of many businesses.

Hải said many construction enterprises in HCM City and across Viet Nam had to stop work, adding that: “This inadvertently has a huge impact not only on HCM City and neighbouring provinces but also on the Vietnamese economy. The city alone accounts for more than 20 per cent of the country's GDP and contributes nearly 30 per cent of the national budget.

Hải said instead of the slogan "Staying at home is patriotic" and the "5K message", all people should apply "7K+3T". This includes: "Mask - Distance - Disinfection - Don't gather - Medical declaration - Fresh air - Healthy" and 3T include: "Self-discovery - Self-isolation - Self-care" as these ways could not only increase disease prevention but also help individuals and businesses get ready to fight the disease more effectively.

The chairman said the local authorities should dedicate resources to vaccination programmes by applying information technology to classify all the subjects for vaccination into three groups: healthy people, people with underlying medical conditions, and those that cannot be vaccinated.

The construction leaders suggested vaccinating group one with people arranging, recording and checking everyone's documents while two or three doctors and nurses take care of the vaccinations. With an injecting capacity of no less than 100 injections per day, Hải calculated each spot could inject from 200 to 300 people per day.

Group two would have strong supervision and monitoring by physicians. When anaphylaxis occurs they would be treated quickly.

Estimating that each neighbourhood could have two or three vaccination stations and that each district has from 20 to 25 wards which have 3-5 neighbourhoods each, the whole city with 18 districts and 1 affiliated city could have no less than 2,000 vaccination points.

With his calculations, Hải said the mass vaccination in HCM City would be completed in two months.

Hai added medicine to treat COVID-19 was also key to fight against the virus, saying the Government needed to quickly access and promote the purchase of the drug Molnupiravir to treat positive cases as it was the most effective solution for the fight against the pandemic.

Last week, the Department of Industry under the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) after a working session with associations and enterprises in the processing and manufacturing industry said it had considered industry feedback and data and had sent to the Ministry of Health and related agencies a number of recommendations to fix the situation.— VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A field hospital for COVID-19 patients in HCM City's Phú Nhuận District opened on August 12. The city is in serious need of more medical personnel to meet demand at healthcare facilities. – Photo nld.com.vn

HCM CITY — More medical personnel from other provinces are being deployed in HCM City, Việt Nam’s COVID-19 epicentre, as the burden on hospitals worsens and as the city considers paying recovered COVID-19 patients, who have high natural immunity, to help with prevention and control activities.

The city is in need of 12,000 more personnel, including doctors and nurses who can treat symptomatic patients with underlying medical conditions from the second to fifth levels. Medical staff skilled in resuscitation and intensive care are especially needed.

Many hospitals are struggling to care for more COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 Resuscitation Hospital set up in Thủ Đức City, which has admitted over 1,000 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, is in dire need of more medical personnel since the number of patients admitted has exceeded its capacity.

Trần Thanh Linh, deputy head of Chợ Rẫy Hospital's intensive care unit and deputy director of COVID-19 Resuscitation Hospital, said the latter was designed to have 500 beds for its first phase, but currently it is already treating around 600 patients.

It has been receiving personnel from Chợ Rẫy Hospital and is working on improving its treatment capacity to 700 hospital beds.

While medical equipment there is still able to satisfy demand, more machinery and medicines will be needed in the future, he said.

Sixteen field hospitals have been established to treat the rising number of F0 (infected) cases. The Phú Nhuận COVID-19 No. 1 Field Hospital, for example, was put into service on August 12 in Phú Nhuận District.

The hospital treats second and third-level patients according to the city’s five-level admission and treatment plan for COVID-19 patients. The patients at the hospital include symptomatic cases with underlying medical conditions who may become moderately or severely ill.

With 350 beds, including 60 beds for resuscitation, and a wide variety of medical equipment, it aims to reduce the number of worsening F0 cases who need to be transferred to hospitals for specialised medical intervention, alleviating stress on such facilities.

The field hospital currently has 65 medical staff treating more than 20 patients.

Dr. Tăng Chí Thượng, deputy director of HCM City’s Department of Health, said that city districts must be proactive in finding, admitting and monitoring local F0 cases.

According to the HCM City Centre for Disease Control, the city has nearly 58,000 medical staff and 20,000 personnel involved in the fight against COVID-19.

More than 4,000 personnel are from central hospitals and other hospitals in provinces and cities, and there are tens of thousands of volunteers.

Help from recovered patients

Chairman of HCM City People’s Committee Nguyễn Thành Phong has asked the Health Department to suggest payment policies for recovered COVID-19 patients who could help the city in COVID prevention and control activities.

The city has a total of 65,135 COVID-19 patients who have been discharged from hospitals since January.

Vice Director of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases Nguyễn Trung Cấp told Vietnam News Agency that most people who have recovered from COVID-19 are likely to be immune for several months afterwards. One study concluded that immune responses from past infections reduced the risk of reinfection by 83 per cent for at least five months.

However, even though the COVID-19 reinfection rate is low, it is still possible, so people recovering from COVID-19 must take preventive measures and get vaccinated as soon as possible, Cấp said.

Phong has also asked city departments to conduct a survey on human resources and medicine at designated hospitals and, based on the results, make decisions about the best use of staff, medicine and transfer of COVID-19 patients.

The city also asked the Ministry of National Defence and the Government’s special task force to add more doctors and nurses to field hospitals and COVID-19 treatment hospitals, and increase contact tracing, testing, and the number of vaccination sites.VNS

HCM CITY — The Ministry of Industry and Trade has called on marine transport and logistics businesses to cut fees for container storage and warehousing for companies that have reduced operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Trần Quốc Khánh on Tuesday sent an official dispatch to a number of business groups like the Việt Nam Logistics Business Association and Việt Nam Seaports Association, port operators and shipping and logistics companies for the purpose.

It pointed out that 19 southern provinces and cities have mandated social distancing under the Government's Directive 16, including HCM City, Bình Dương, Đồng Nai, and Long An, all localities with large volumes of imports and exports.

The application of social distancing and other epidemic prevention and control measures means some businesses have temporarily reduced operations and face difficulties in picking up their cargo from ports, leading to an increase in the storage time at ports and costs, it said.

This makes it imperative to cut charges for them, it said.

It also instructed marine transport and logistics businesses and associations to improve goods clearance and reduce container backlogs at ports and facilitate import-export activities.

Many trade groups have complained to the ministry about a shortage of containers and high logistics and international shipping costs (that have risen 5-10 times since before the pandemic) that have persisted since last year.

The surging costs of fuel and imported raw materials in recent months have also caused enormous difficulties for companies producing goods for export.

HCM City’s Cát Lái Port eases huge container backlog

The huge container backlog at Tân Cảng - Cát Lái (TCCL) Port in HCM City has been mostly cleared, according to Tân Cảng Sài Gòn (Sài Gòn New Port) Corporation.

Speaking at an online seminar between port authorities, agencies, shipping lines and businesses on Tuesday (April 10), the deputy director of the corporation, Sr Lieut Col Bùi Văn Quỳ, said the large amount of stored goods had decreased markedly, ensuring the port’s capacity to accept goods.

The delivery and receipt of goods and release of cargo ships has freed up high inventory levels, and reduced the risk of suspending the port’s operation.

The TCCL Port said earlier that it would possibly have to temporarily stop receiving goods so that it could clear the huge backlog of containers. The pileup was caused by businesses reducing or suspending production since the city’s lockdown starting July 9.

According to the port corporation’s recent survey, about 20.5 per cent of 326 surveyed import-export companies had maintained operations as normal, 13 per cent of them had suspended operations, and 66.5 per cent had reduced production capacity.

The number of trucks coming to the port to pick up cargo declined sharply, while the number of containers stuck at the port had reached nearly 100 per cent of capacity.

The prolonged backlog affected services for import-export activities of companies in the southern key economic region.

To resolve the congestion, the port released import containers of over 90 days, rearranged space and maximised the capacity for loading and unloading containers, and worked with agencies to create favourable conditions for online administrative procedures.

The corporation called on companies to deliver goods to other ports near their factories, such as Tân Cảng - Hiệp Phước Port in the city’s Nhà Bè District, Tân Cảng - Cái Mép International Terminal in neighbouring Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province, or other ports in the Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta region.

To encourage delivery and receipt of goods at Tân Cảng - Hiệp Phước Port, it offered free services like container delivery, container storage, free 24-hour operation charge for reefer containers, and administrative assistance to change the port of destination.

Trương Tấn Lộc, marketing director of Sài Gòn New Port Corporation, said the TCCL port had resumed its normal operation. At present, the amount of goods left at the port is around 85 per cent of capacity, which will allow the port to operate.

The corporation has developed three plans to respond to possible scenarios for import and export of goods at ports in the last months of the year.

If the pandemic is brought under control in the late third quarter, the volume of goods passing through the city's ports in the last six months of the year would see an increase of 5-7 per cent compared to the first six months of the year.

The volume of goods would increase by 3-5 per cent compared to the first six months of the year if the pandemic is brought under control in the early fourth quarter. If it is brought under control in the middle of the fourth quarter, the volume of goods would be equivalent to the first six months of the year.

Under all the scenarios above, the amount of stored goods would be at 85-86 per cent of capacity at the TCCL port. — VNS

HCM CITY – The Ministry of Health plans to pilot an initiative to have COVID-19 patients treated at home with medicines, health supplements and care instructions in HCM City from August 16 at a time when COVID-19 treatment facilities are becoming overwhelmed.

Tests will be carried out at home and in the community and medicines and health supplements will be provided to patients and closely monitored by medical experts.

Food and groceries will be provided to households with patients since their family members will not be allowed to step out.

The ministry will provide detailed guidelines for taking care of patients, monitoring their health and seeking medical assistance if their condition worsens.

Helping COVID patients at home access medical care in time, thus reducing the burden on treatment facilities and fatality rates is of utmost importance, according to the ministry.

Minister of Health Nguyễn Thanh Long said home care would reduce the chance of pandemic spread.

HCM City has been trialling a programme to have asymptomatic patients quarantining at home since mid-July.

Phan Văn Mãi, deputy secretary of the city Party Committee, said medical facilities’ capacity has already been exceeded though the pandemic situation remains dire.

There is also a need for 12,000 more doctors and nurses to treat symptomatic patients with underlying medical conditions.

The city is focusing on reducing the death rate in the next 30 days.

The ministry has updated its treatment regime based on global case studies and the pandemic situation, which indicates that nearly 80 per cent of patients have few or no symptoms.

After piloting it in HCM City, the ministry will consider expanding it to the rest of the country.

According to the HCM City Centre for Disease Control, as of Saturday there were more than 35,000 COVID-positive people quarantined and monitored at home, and another 13,000 in quarantine facilities.

The city is the country’s pandemic epicentre with more than 144,000 cases by 6pm, Saturday. – VNS

HÀ NỘI — Oil prices have continuously increased since the beginning of the year on the production cut agreement of OPEC+ and the global recovery in fuel demand. This has been reflected in the market price of oil and gas stocks, however not all businesses benefited.

In the international market, oil prices had risen more than 47 per cent in the first half of the year, resulting in higher prices of refined products. In June, Brent crude even broke over US$76 per barrel over rising concerns of a supply shortage. OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, then agreed to loosen production caps starting in July.

From the end of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021, oil demand in the Asia-Pacific region hit a peak on COVID-19 control measures. However, the outbreak since the beginning of the second quarter of the year has affected oil demand in this region.

Mixed results

Despite the higher oil price, not all oil and gas enterprises in Việt Nam benefited, the latest report of Việt Dragon Securities Corporation (VDSC) said.

Of which, for upstream companies, business results were not very positive in the first six months of the year due to the impact of COVID-19 and the stagnation of domestic oil and gas projects.

PetroVietnam Drilling & Well Services Corporation (PVD), which operates in the upstream sector, involving oil and gas exploitation, providing most of the drilling services at Petrolimex’s oil fields and also participating in international activities, reported a drop of 47 per cent year-on-year in net revenue to over VNĐ1.66 trillion in the first half of the year.

The big fall in revenue along with large provision costs caused PVD to record a net loss of VNĐ95 billion.

Similarly, PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation (PVS)’s net revenue also declined by 35 per cent to nearly VNĐ5.7 trillion during the period, resulting in a fall of 16 per cent over last year in profit after tax to VNĐ347 billion.

Even in the same upstream sector, PVS will be less affected by oil prices than PVD because of its diversity in operations including ships, ports, floating warehouses and petroleum engineering.

However, the bright oil price outlook due to the supply-demand gap has helped the prices of PVD and PVS shares increase significantly.

On the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE), PVS shares had risen 53.2 per cent in the first six months of the year, while PVD shares climbed 27.2 per cent.

Meanwhile, for the midstream and downstream sector, companies witnessed positive business results, boosted by sustainable rallies of oil prices which translated into higher selling prices or improved gross profit margins.

Accordingly, PetroVietnam Gas JSC (PVGas, GAS) finished the first six months with net revenue of VNĐ40.27 trillion and profit after tax of nearly VNĐ4.4 trillion, up 23.2 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively.

PVGas operates in the midstream sector, specialising in gas collection and redistribution to other firms in the market. Particularly in the second quarter, the sharp increase in oil prices boosted the company’s revenue by 45 per cent, while gross profit climbed 57.5 per cent year-on-year.

In the same segment, Petrovietnam Transportation Corporation (PV Trans, PVT) also earned VNĐ256.5 billion in profit after tax in the second quarter, up more than 8 per cent.

PV Trans said that the gain was driven by higher freight rates, new ships, cost savings and asset liquidations.

In the first half of the year, PV Trans recorded net revenue of more than VNĐ3.58 trillion, up 5.5 per cent, with profit after tax rising 30 per cent to VNĐ439 billion.

Bình Sơn Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited (BRS), the unit that manages and operates production and business activities of Dung Quất Oil Refinery, posted significant growth on high oil prices.

As it had to continuously produce and process products, Bình Sơn Refinery always has to maintain a quantity of crude oil and it takes time to process crude oil to products for sale.

In the first six months, Bình Sơn Refinery’s net revenue reached over VNĐ48.9 trillion, up 54 per cent over last year. Its profit after tax was VNĐ3.58 trillion during the period, compared to a loss of more than VNĐ4.23 billion in the same period last year. Accordingly, the company has achieved 53 per cent of the output plan, 70 per cent of the revenue plan, and quadrupled the profit plan.

PetroVietnam Oil Corporation (PV OIL, OIL) which is also in the downstream sector, recorded an increase of 15 per cent year-on-year in net revenue in the second quarter of 2021 to VNĐ13.4 trillion. Deducting expenses, PV OIL’s after-tax profit was nearly VNĐ272 billion, up 45 per cent.

As of June 30, the company’s net revenue reached nearly VNĐ25.2 billion, down 14 per cent over last year. But it posted a net profit of VNĐ359 billion, while it lost VNĐ241 billion in the same period last year.

In its explanation, the company stated that the high profit was due to the fluctuations of gasoline prices in the international market, with the average Brent crude oil prices surging 133 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2021, from $29.56 per barrel to $68.97. — VNS

HCM CITY — On Sunday, as HCM City announced its plan to extend strict lockdown for another month until September 15, hundreds of migrant workers have packed their bags and personal belongings and rushed to the city's gateways in a bid to leave for their hometowns in the surrounding provinces of Đồng Nai, Bình Thuận, and some central provinces.

Using loudspeakers, police officers at the checkpoints on National Road No 1 struggled to prevent them from leaving the city, urging them not to congregate and telling people to remain where they stay as per the Government's order. The law enforcement and local authorities took note of their information and address to provide support later.

By Sunday noon, many remained at the checkpoints, refusing to return to the places they have been staying in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo

One man named Hoàng from Phú Yên Province told Vietnam News Agency his family has been unemployed due to the outbreak and lockdown measures but has not received any financial support, while the rent and daily expenses have become too much of a burden. He knows he is not supposed to leave on his own personal vehicle out of the city but he has no option.

His story is shared by many others waiting anxiously to return home, afraid they might not be able to go on.

Many provinces have organised 'repatriation' trips (by trains and airplanes) and subsequent centralised quarantine facilities for their people in recent days as the outbreak situation in the southern city worsens, but many others remain behind.

Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính in the decision issued late July on extension of lockdown across 19 southern cities and provinces has asked local authorities to guarantee livelihoods and healthcare of people so they could remain where they are. — VNS

HCM CITY — The Government always gives the highest priority to allocating COVID-19 vaccines to HCM City, said Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam at an online meeting with municipal leaders on COVID-19 prevention and control on Wednesday.

At the meeting, Đam, who is also Head of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, highly valued efforts made by the municipal authorities in the fight against the pandemic, while urging the city to improve the work in the future.

Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Nguyễn Thành Phong said the city has recorded initial positive results in controlling the pandemic as the number of new cases is slowing.

Up to now, nearly 63,000 patients have been given the all-clear from coronavirus, while over 32,600 are under treatment at health facilities in the city, Phong reported.

The city has worked with the Ministry of Health to operate four more intensive care units (ICU) with 1,750 beds while establishing five satellite emergency facilities supporting the city’s 115 Emergency Center.

The city has established a centre to receive and provide essential goods for local residents. It also completed the disbursement of the first support package worth over VNĐ700 billion (US$31 million) for those affected by the pandemic. Another VNĐ900 billion-assistance package is being launched.

He suggested that the Government allocate more vaccines for the city.

Phong also proposed that the Government and the Government's Special Working Group direct localities’ pandemic prevention and control forces at checkpoints to support and create favourable conditions for goods transportation.

He said localities can arrange traffic police and inspectors at these checkpoints to promptly deal with problems and ensure smooth transportation of goods between provinces.

Đam acknowledged the city's important adjustments in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, while asking the municipal authorities to effectively and safely organise goods deliveries, and adjust regulations accordingly.

He said the city needs to consider setting up transshipment delivery points at the district level so that shippers using motorbikes can move within the district. For deliveries between districts, goods can be transported by cars and trucks.

While waiting for general guidance, the city needs to pay attention to and provide credit support to those who are borrowing from banks for daily spending on food and other necessities, the deputy PM noted.

Regarding vaccine supply for the city, he affirmed that HCM City is always given the highest priority in vaccine access, requesting the municipal authorities to prepare for resumption of production and manufacturing once all residents are fully vaccinated.

Apart from accelerating COVID-19 vaccination, the city needs to organise periodic testing for local residents, the Deputy PM said, adding that after the period of social distancing, HCM City should consider gradually re-opening sale points but still ensure safety.

He highly evaluated the municipal authorities’ efforts to provide social security packages for local people, while requesting the city to further speed up COVID-19 testing for drivers. — VNS

With a 192km-long coastline and 52,000sq.km fishing ground, the central province of Bình Thuận has great potential for marine economy development. The locality, with largest titanium reserve, has also implemented many tourism, energy and industrial projects.

In a recent interview with the Vietnam News Agency, Secretary of Bình Thuận Province’s Party Committee Dương Văn An talks about the development strategy of the locality and recommendations made to the Government to tap its huge potential, making the province rich in economy and strong in defence and security.

With great potential in the ocean’s natural resources and important location, what are the orientations and solutions to develop the marine economy in association with ensuring sea and islands sovereignty protection of Bình Thuận Province?

Bình Thuận is a coastal central southern province with 192km of coast line, where international ships pass through. With 52,000sq.km of fishing area, this province is one of the three key fishing grounds of Việt Nam. Its Phú Quý Island District has a strategic location in marine economy and security and defence. There are also oil and gas fields in the water of the province. We have huge potential to develop the marine economy especially tourism, renewable energy and seafood exploitation and processing, in association with the island and sea sovereignty protection.

Bình Thuận Province’s Party Committee issued an action plan to make the province become one with a strong, sustainable and comprehensive marine economy. In order to achieve the goals, the province also takes into account other tasks including conservation, climate change, marine environment protection and coastal encroachment prevention, among others.

The coastal area will become a driving force to promote growth with the development of urban and tourist areas, coastal industrial and service zones and clusters, along with renewable energy and seaport system development. The priority industries include tourism, energy, manufacturing and processing and logistic services.

In tourism for example, the province will build many luxury tourism areas with resorts, ecology, heath treatment and water sports. In the next five years, tourism is expected to become a spearhead economic sector. Mũi Né National Tourism Zone is targeted to be one of the leading destinations in the Asia-Pacific region in the next 10 years.

In industry, the province will promote both manufacturing and processing, and energy industries. It prioritises offshore wind power and Liquefied Natural Gas power projects. Offshore wind power is a new industry that is both cost-effective and sustainable. Several local and foreign investors have looked at investment opportunities and asked for permission to survey the wind power projects with the total capacity of up to 22,000MW. However, it should be noted that whether they are to be approved or not also depends on the National Power Development Master Plan in 2021-2030 and other sea and island-related issues.

To achieve the goals, the province has accelerated the construction of the infrastructure system in coastal areas and Phú Quý Island. Many structures have been or are being built, including Hàm Tân-La Gi industrial, service and urban zone in Hàm Tân District, coastal roads and logistics facilities for fishing. In addition, the province has strengthened the capacity of the fishery surveillance forces to protect aquatic resources and combat illegal unreported and unregulated fishing.

We also aim to develop Phú Quý Island District to ensure that it can fulfil the marine security and defence tasks and serve as a logistical and technical base for Trường Sa (Spratly) Archipelago and the DK1 rigs. Phú Quý will also serve as a marine search and rescue centre for the central southern region.

At the same time, the province will strengthen its national defence capacity, build a strong armed force, enhance its combat readiness and meet the requirements of protecting sovereignty over sea and islands. It will also focus on building and consolidating the all-people defence as well as strengthen the efficiency of law enforcement forces at sea. At the same time, it will pay attention to improving the life quality of locals in coastal localities and Phú Quý Island District.

Could you tell us more about the proposals and recommendations of Bình Thuận Province to the 13th National Party Congress on the task of marine economy development in association with sovereignty protection in the upcoming term?

Tapping sea and island potentials is a significant and strategic issue in most countries especially in the context that the resources on land are becoming exhausting. The resolution on the strategy for the sustainable development of Việt Nam’s marine economy to 2030 and vision to 2045, known as Resolution No 36, affirmed that Việt Nam will be a strong and rich country based on the sea. The marine economy is not merely about fishing and exploitation of the ocean’s natural resources. The combination of sectors; marine infrastructure; socio-economic, security and defence factors all contribute to the development of the marine economy.

Despite impressive achievements, Việt Nam has yet to tap the potentials of a country with more than 3,000km-long coastline. There are shortcomings in the development process including the unsustainable development, lack of planning and poor management. Fishing activities have not been controlled properly, leading to the depletion of aquatic resources.

Sustainable development of the marine economy in association with sovereignty protection is an imperative and strategic, long-term task. To this end, it is necessary to develop sectors that have high added-value, use modern technologies and are environmentally friendly while still ensuring the security and defence as well as protecting the sovereignty of the nation.

Việt Nam is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change, therefore it needs to work on solutions to protect the ocean environment and develop the marine economy sustainably.

Bình Thuận aims to become a province strong in ocean economy. The province has many solutions to develop its maritime economy and has achieved positive initial results, however, there is still much room to tap its potentials and make breakthroughs.

One of the projects much anticipated by locals is Phan Thiết airport. The plan to build an airport in Phan Thiết was approved by the then Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng in 2014 and it will be used for both civil and military purposes. Nearly 600ha of land have been cleared ready to build an airport. We hope that Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc will direct competent authorities to accelerate the progress of the project to put the airport into operation soon.

Investment in some projects in Bình Thuận is also facing legal difficulties. Bình Thuận Province has the largest titanium reserve in the country with more than 82,000ha, accounting for some 10 per cent of the province’s total land.

We hope that permission will be given for the implementation of development projects on the surface of areas of mineral reserves.

With 192km-long coastline, Bình Thuận has many beautiful beaches for tourism development. However many have also degraded by erosion. We hope that the Government has programmes to support the building of sea dykes which are used for both erosion prevention and military defence purposes.

For Phú Quý, we hope to continue to receive support and investment from the Government so that this will be a district rich in economy and strong in defence and security. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Government has set a target for HCM City, the epicentre of the current wave of infections, to contain its COVID-19 outbreak by September 15.

Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has just signed Resolution 86 of the Government on the implementation of urgent measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic to implement Resolution 30 of the National Assembly.

According to the resolution , the Government aims for HCM City to control its outbreak before September 15; Bình Dương, Long An, Đồng Nai provinces before September 1; and other localities before August 25.

The resolution said that many agencies, units and localities have not taken serious, decisive or substantive measures in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, while inspection and supervision is still lax in many places.

These include slow responses to the changing situation, slow vaccination rates, lax management of social distancing, as well as congestion in the transport of goods.

The pandemic is still unpredictable, while the supply of vaccines is limited and there is not yet any specific treatment for the virus, so the Government emphasised that pandemic prevention is an urgent task.

The Resolution stipulates urgent and specific solutions to prevent, repel and move towards good control of the pandemic in order to prevent a crisis both in public health and the socio-economic sector.

Regarding the application of urgent measures, the Government assigned local leaders to proactively decide and direct their subordinates to strictly apply solutions corresponding to the level of risk in the spirit of Directive 15, Directive 16 and Directive 19 of the Prime Minister. Based on the actual situation, they may apply these solutions earlier and at higher levels but not later and lower than the provisions in the above documents.

The Government pays special attention to social distancing and other measures in anti-pandemic work that must be strictly implemented from the very beginning, at all levels. Leaders of localities are asked not to procrastinate, hesitate, lack determination or lack responsibility. Instead, they should take the lead, be creative when implementing the task, draw lessons from the work and made quick adjustments when the situation changes.

All localities must strictly implement the motto "go to every alley, knock from door to door, check every person", detect and handle people who come from pandemic-affected areas without declaring and people leaving localities which are applying social distancing without permission.

One of the other urgent solutions proposed by the Government is to allow localities to proactively and flexibly apply necessary measures such as restricting some vehicles or asking people not to leave their homes for a certain period of time.

Speed up testing

Localities need to speed up testing among high-risk groups of people in order to detect new cases as soon as possible, the resolution said. Localities must not miss new F0s and not let them continue to travel and spread the virus further.

For areas with widespread infections such as HCM City and neighbouring provinces, it is necessary to enhance testing, care and treatment, ensuring the maximum reduction in the rate of severe cases, mortality and spread to other areas.

The Ministry of Health is tasked with promptly distributing vaccines to provinces and cities, in which priority is given to densely populated localities, those with many infections and fatalities, as well as any large and crowded urban areas.

The resolution also asked the Ministry of Health to build pandemic response scenarios for all levels, based on which the procurement of equipment and materials can be calculated.

The Ministry of Health, ministries, branches and localities can mobilise public and private health systems and social resources to promptly coordinate in the implementation of COVID-19 prevention, treatment and vaccination.

The Government also requested the Ministry of Finance, ministries, branches and localities to prioritise the arrangement and allocation of the state budget and other lawful resources to ensure funding for the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control work.

The Government requested the cutting of at least 50 per cent of spending on conferences, travelling expenses of ministries, central agencies and localities (except for the expenses of important and urgent activities and to serve the pandemic prevention and control work). — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Việt Nam Trade Promotion Agency (Vietrade) and the Vietnamese Trade Office in the Netherlands on Tuesday organised a virtual consultation on the export of agro-aquatic products to the European market.

As part of the online conference on export and distribution of farm produce and aquatic products in the southern and Central Highlands regions, the event attracted over 100 representatives from Vietnamese agencies, organisations and exporters.

According to Nguyễn Thị Thu Thủy, deputy head of Vietrade’s export assistance centre, key products listed by Vietnamese exporters include fresh and processed fruit, mushrooms, processed cashews, and shrimp.

At the consultation, Võ Thị Ngọc Diệp, Vietnamese Trade Counsellor in the Netherlands, and Phạm Văn Hiển, Director of the LTP Import Export B.V., answered more than 20 questions raised by Vietnamese firms.

Diệp stressed the European market is open without any priorities and restrictions on agro-aquatic products, adding the country’s willingness to import those meeting European and its requirements, and local demand.

Since August 2020, Việt Nam and the EU, of which the Netherlands is a member, have implemented their Free Trade Agreement (EUVFTA), offering many tax incentives and opportunities for Vietnamese exporters.

Diệp said a large number of Vietnamese firms have utilised certificates of origin (C/O) issued for exports to the EU to access the Netherlands’ preferential import tariffs.

Highlighting advantages of Vietnamese aquatic products in the Netherlands, the official pointed to the products’ competition against those from Bangladesh, India and Ecuador, among other nations, in recent years.

She said the Netherlands now mainly imports fresh fruit from South America thanks to advantages in terms of transport duration and prices.

Diep advised Vietnamese firms to seek ways to compete and boost the quality of their products.

Hiển said 50 per cent of his company’s total imports are from Việt Nam and expressed his wish to increase the proportion.

He recommended Vietnamese enterprises use environmentally friendly packaging, as the Dutch market refuses those made of plastic. He also underscored the need to ensure food safety and pesticide residues within the allowable limits for fresh and dried fruit and vegetables. — VNS

HCM CITY — Việt Nam, especially the current hotspot HCM City, needs to maintain stringent social distancing measures and stress that each individual and family plays a decisive role in reducing infection chains, overseas-Vietnamese experts said at a webinar on Thursday.

Dr Vũ Ngọc Khuê, a Vietnamese-American, said the country’s pandemic epicentre should be able to contain the latest outbreak that began in late April within the next four weeks.

“Four weeks would be enough for the city to contain the spread. The first two weeks will detect symptomatic FO (COVID patients) cases for quarantine, while the next two weeks will detect cases that have had longer incubation periods” and may not be showing symptoms, he added.

Severe cases will need more time for treatment and recovery in a hospital or at isolation facilities, he said, adding that the city should focus on critically ill patients to minimise the number of deaths.

In addition to having medical staff fully equipped with proper equipment, all resources including military forces should be mobilised for the fight.

Trần Trọng Hùng, a Vietnamese-Polish man who is vice chairman of the Vietnamese Community in Poland, said that the COVID-19 Prevention and Support Committee in Poland developed a COVID-19 prevention manual, stressing the role of each individual and each family.

All people, including those fully vaccinated, must strictly implement measures such as hand washing, keeping a distance, wearing a mask, and limiting gatherings. People should contact medical staff immediately to have a COVID test when they have symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or headache.

To quickly recover, you should practise breathing exercises to support the lungs, and keep a thermometer, blood pressure monitor and oximeter at home.

Testing is key

Experts said that even with the promising prospects of COVID vaccinations, it will take some time for vaccines to be delivered to the general population.

The surge of the more transmissible Delta variant has made testing more vital, even among vaccinated people. Testing, tracking, tracing and isolating quickly, massively and smartly are all needed to prevent future rebounds of infections following social distancing measures.

Dr. Nguyễn Đức Thái, a Vietnamese-American and co-founder of TransMed-VN forum, said that Việt Nam has conducted three main kinds of testing. The first is an antibody or serology test, a blood test that looks for signs of a previous infection to help understand the pervasiveness of the disease in communities.

The second is a rapid antigen test, which can deliver results in less than 15 minutes, a less accurate alternative but one that is very good at identifying when people are infectious. The third is the more accurate PCR tests, which requires a laboratory, according to Thái.

With the delta variant surging throughout the world, more testing is paramount.

Dr Thái said the city could use a highly sensitive and cost-effective test that uses artificial intelligence to detect pathogens (called AIMS RT-PCR technology) as recommended by Dr. Hồ Hữu Thọ of the Hà Nội Military Medical Academy.

The test, which can take a pooling sample of 100, is very accurate and suitable for large-scale testing or city-wide testing, he noted.

Japanese-Vietnamese Trần Ngọc Phúc, president of the Japanese medical equipment firm Metran, and chairman of the Association of Vietnamese in Japan, said the city should buy low-cost ventilators that are easy to use so that doctors at all levels can safely use them.

The city should also buy more CPAP machines, oxygen generators and saturation oximeters to meet the needs of patients treated at home to reduce the transfer of patients to hospitals, he added.

An online monitoring system for patients with unstable medical conditions could be used, and mobile medical teams should be set up to better diagnose and take care of patients at home.

Dr. Võ Toàn Trung, Vietnamese-French, said the city needed to prepare for a worst-case scenario, especially if the rate of positive cases exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system.

Dương Anh Đức, vice chairman of the People’s Committee, said the city would consider all of the recommendations and expressed gratitude to overseas Vietnamese, including those at home and abroad, for providing medical equipment and essential items.

After successfully containing the virus in 2020 and early this year, the country now faces a serious outbreak, with HCM City and southern provinces accounting for most new infections. HCM City, the largest hotspot, has recorded more than 137,000 cases since the beginning of the fourth wave in late April.

Việt Nam recorded 9,667 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday and a further 326 people died of COVID. The new cases take the total number of infections to 246,568 and the total number of deaths to 4,813.

The country has administered 12,098,821 doses of vaccines. A total of 1,092,700 people have received two doses.

HÀ NỘI- Many countries in the world have showed serious concerns over China’s recent deployment of over 200 ships around Sinh Tồn island cluster in Việt Nam’s Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelago and requested the country to immediately bring these vessels out of the area and end all provocations.

In a regular press conference, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry’s Spokeswoman Lê Thị Thu Hằng said that the operation of the Chinese ships within the territorial waters of Sinh Tồn Đông island in the Trường Sa archipelago violated Vietnam’s sovereignty and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)’s regulations on the operation of foreign vessels in the territorial waters of coastal nations, run counter to the spirit and content of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC), and complicated the situation, which is unfavourable for the process of negotiations between ASEAN and China on a Code of Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (COC).



The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said in a diplomatic protest that the swarming and threatening presence of the Chinese ships creates an atmosphere of instability and shows that China is ignoring its commitments to promoting peace and stability in the region.



At a reception for Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto on March 30, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga voiced his concern over China’s activities in the waters, including the enforcement of its Coast Guard Law which allows patrol ships to use weapons. Both sides spoke highly of the importance of maintaining free and open navigation based on international law.



Meanwhile, Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Koshikawa Kazuhiko tweeted that the South China Sea (called the East Sea in Việt Nam) issues are directly related to peace and stability and concern for all parties.



“Japan strongly opposes any action that heightens tensions. We support the enforcement of the Rule of Law in the sea and work with the international community to protect the free, open, and peaceful seas,” he stressed on his Twitter account.



Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Steven Robinson tweeted that “Australia supports an Indo-Pacific region which is secure open and inclusive. The South China Sea – a crucial international waterway – is governed by international rules and norms, particularly UNCLOS. We remain concerned about destabilising actions that could provoke escalation”.

Responding to China’s statement that the vessels operating around the Sinh Tồn island cluster are fishing ships and they were just taking shelter from rough seas, Jay Batongbacal, Director of the University of the Philippines’s Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said that a reconnaissance flight by the Philippine Air Force showed that around 200 vessels have been there for weeks.



“Satellite photos also show that the decks of these vessels are very, very clean. It's as if they're brand new,” he said, adding that “One big worry, of course, is that they might be preparing to occupy the reef in order to construct another artificial island”.



Gregory B. Poling, who is Director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that China’s acts are “suspicious” as the boats, tied up “with military precision” beside each other, “are not fishing,” they're parked.



Collin Koh, a Research Fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies under Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, stated that China’s activities are escalating tensions in the East Sea.



It can be said that China’s recent activities in the East Sea have continued challenging international law and violating the sovereignty and sovereign rights of other countries.



In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague issued a ruling rejecting all China’s illegal sovereignty claims in the East Sea. VNA/VNS

A series of paintings depicting the experience of a young freelance illustrator receiving the coronavirus vaccine has recently gone viral on Vietnamese social media.

Only one day after being posted on her Nguyễn Vũ Xuân Lan’s Facebook page, the series Nhật Ký Đi Tiêm (COVID-19 Vaccination Diary) received over 5,000 likes and nearly 1,000 shares.

It has also been shared on the Facebook of UNICEF Việt Nam where it garnered over 79,000 likes after just two days.

COVID-19 Vaccination Diary is effectively a short comic book including 18 paintings. Each sketch details the process of a girl, presumably the painter herself, as she goes through the various stages of the inoculation, from registering and being notified via text message of the time and place of injection, through to being screened and injected, and finally being consulted on how to rest and stay healthy at home after the jab.

The picture diary is a string of cute drawings accompanied by simple but humorous dialogue.

Nguyễn Vũ Xuân Lan came up with the idea of the COVID-19 Vaccination Diary after returning home from being vaccinated on July 30.

“Before that, I used to feel doubts about the vaccination due to much conflicting information related to it, about anaphylaxis or the huge crowds waiting for injections in the hospital,” Lan said.

“However, my experience was surprisingly smooth and pleasant. Feeling safe and happy back home, I wanted to share this first-hand experience so that everyone can better understand the vaccination process and be less bewildered. I also hope that it would partly encourage others to get the injections.”

The 32-year-old freelance illustrator said that she finished the picture diary within four days of getting the injection.

“I started to have a fever while drawing so I had to take a day off. When my fever came down and I regained my composure, I continued to draw,” she said.

COVID-19 Vaccination Diary aims to record a life memory of the painter, but on receiving a vast array of positive comments, she realised that it has done much more.

“My series of paintings has offered a more positive view of the vaccination and answered a few frequently asked questions, so I feel like I have been contributing a small part to the fight against the pandemic,” she said.

The diary is not Lan’s first work related to the pandemic. Previously she created a series of paintings of small children going to quarantine during the pandemic, which attracted over 12,000 likes and hundreds of comments.

On her Facebook page named X.Lan, the illustrator captioned the photo album: "Drawing some cute moments to relieve stress during the pandemic."

Lecturer turns illustrator

Lan currently works as a freelance illustrator. Her work revolves around drawing and illustrating brands, advertising articles, books, teaching drawing for adults and creating graphics.

However, she was not officially trained in the arts and is a graduate of the University of Languages and International Studies at Việt Nam National University where she worked as an English lecturer.

“In 2013, while still an English lecturer, I used to make random drawings or short comics during my free time and uploaded them to my Facebook. Some of them went viral and I started to be noticed, which made me happy to keep drawing for the next few years,” said Lan.

“In 2016, I realised I wanted to take drawing more seriously so I decided to take a year off from teaching. I didn't think I would make a living from drawing. It was just because I liked it enough to spend time being serious about it. I thought that it was just a year and if I didn’t try, I would regret it later. If it didn't work out, it would not be too late to resume teaching. However, I was so satisfied that I never went back to teaching."

Lan’s paintings mostly revolve around her personal life, depicting small but memorable moments that she encounters each day.

“I observe and take notes a lot so there is always an abundance of ideas in my mind waiting to be drawn,” she said.

On her personal page, Lan describes herself simply: “I'm not good with words, so I draw to tell my stories.”

Since embarking on her new path, Lan cannot remember how many art projects she has been involved in. Some highlights include drawing illustrations for a book, entitled 199 mấy Hồi Ấy Làm Gì (What Were You Doing in the 1990s), a series of pictures on the issue of gender violence for CARE Vietnam, and the cartoon Kindness is Contagious for UNICEF.

The contents of Lan’s paintings mostly revolve around her personal life, depicting small but memorable moments that she encounters every day.

One of her most unforgettable memories as a freelance illustrator was receiving a request to draw the steps for wearing personal protective equipment. The pictures were to be presented to medical workers at Bạch Mai Hospital, and the client seemed to be the owner of a printing shop for hospitals.

“I drew the pictures very quickly so that he could present them to the doctors in time. The drawing process helped me to understand how hard it was for the medical staff, as using a protective suit involves dozens of steps, each of which demands proper disinfection, Lan said.

“The complete suit is enough to keep them safe from the virus and consists of many layers, but the doctors have to suffer from great heat and exhaustion.

"Sadly, the pictures still have not been presented to the doctors because the client contracted the virus and been taken to hospital for treatment."

Lan revealed that she would continue to draw and share any interesting experiences she encounters during this unforgettable global health crisis.

“I hope everyone will find moral support and comfort during these difficult days,” she said. VNS

BÌNH DƯƠNG— Bình Dương Emergency Resuscitation Field Hospital, specialising in treating patients with severe COVID-19, has been put into operation on Thursday in the southern province of Bình Dương’s Thuận An District.

The field hospital, with a total of 437 beds, was built inside the Becamex International General Hospital in just six days, to treat COVID-19 patients in the province.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the field hospital on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn said the field hospital was built thanks to the great efforts of local authorities as well as the support of both human resources and medical equipment from the Government and Hà Nội Medical University Hospital.

Sơn also said when the number of COVID-19 patients increased very quickly in the province, with many severe cases, the local authorities proposed the ministry set up the field hospital.

Associate Professor Nguyễn Lân Hiếu, director of Hà Nội Medical University Hospital, who was recently assigned to be the head of the field hospital, said it was implemented very quickly thanks to requisition of the available facilities and modern machinery from Becamex International General Hospital.

We are now focused on upgrading rooms to increase the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and preparing oxygen and compressed air, ventilators and dialysis machines, he added.

The field hospital could conduct ECMO techniques to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, he said.

The field hospital includes medical staff of Hà Nội Medical University Hospital, Becamex International General Hospital, Bình Dương General Hospital and teams of doctors and nurses from many localities, especially from the northern provinces, he said.

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s overseas investment totalled US$570.1 million in the first seven months of 2021, a 2.3-fold increase from the same period last year, data from the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Foreign Investment Agency (FIA) showed, reflecting Vietnamese firms’ efforts to expand in foreign markets.

In March, multi-sectoral giant Vingroup registered to invest in four new projects in France, the Netherlands, Canada and Singapore, and inject additional investment into projects in the US and Germany. The total amount of registered and added investment is estimated at $450 million.

It forms part of the conglomerate’s plan to go global, following the footsteps of military-run telecom group Viettel and dairy producers Vinamilk and TH. The group is also aiming to turn its subsidiary VinFast into one of the world’s leading electric and smart vehicle makers.

According to the Ministry of Finance, Vietnamese firms earned more than $7.02 billion in revenue from their overseas projects in 2019, up 27 per cent from the previous year. They brought back over $3 billion in profits while overseas retained earnings reached $400 million.

Major Vietnamese investors posted positive business results overseas in the first half of this year. Viettel Global generated nearly VNĐ5.26 trillion (about $230 million) in gross revenue in the second half of the year, up 22 per cent year on year.

Vinamilk said its foreign branches’ gross revenue rose by 12.8 per cent year on year to VNĐ859 billion from April to June. — VNS

PLZEŇ The daily life of Vietnamese families in the Czech Republic is featured at an exhibition in Plzeň City that is located nearly 80km from Prague.

Vietnam Stories, the name of the exhibition, showcases 50 photos by Czech photographer and teacher Jindřich Štreit, who is considered one of the most important exponents of Czech documentary photography.

It is jointly organised by the City Council in collaboration with the Vietnamese association in Plzeň.

Vietnam Stories also features traditional Vietnamese customs and habits that are still preserved and practised in the Czech Republic, such as national holidays, birthdays, weddings and death anniversaries.

Speaking at the opening of the exhibition, Štreit said that he had researched and integrated into the Vietnamese community to capture the most authentic angles of their life for the photo collection.

“I personally have a very good relationship with the Vietnamese community in North Morava and they themselves, especially young people, have enthusiastically helped me to make this meaningful series of photos,” the 75-year-old photographer said.

According to Eliška Bartáková, Deputy Mayor of Plzeň City, the Vietnamese community has been in the Czech Republic for three generations and is integrating very well into Czech society.

“Vietnamese people obey the law, study hard, run businesses and make many positive contributions to society. It is perfectly fine and normal for two peoples of the Czech Republic and Việt Nam to harmoniously live and develop together in the country.”

Dr Nguyễn Duy Nhiên, Chairman of the Vietnamese Association in the Czech Republic, said the association greatly appreciates the photos capturing the life of the Vietnamese community by photographer Štreit.

He added that Vietnam Stories would help to enhance the friendship and relations between the two nations.

A visitor to the exhibition and photography enthusiast, Vojtěch Štajek, recalled that the number of Vietnamese people coming to the Czech Republic has increased significantly since the 1990s.

There used to be many differences in lifestyle and perception between the Czech and Vietnamese communities. At first, Czech people were amazed at the Vietnamese unyielding struggle and hard-working manner, he said.

“However, over time, it was that strong will of the Vietnamese people and their positive contributions to society that have convinced the Czech people, so today the Vietnamese community has truly integrated and lives in harmony with all other ethnic groups in the Czech Republic.

“We really consider the Vietnamese as our people. The photos displayed at this exhibition have accurately reflected their life that I witness every day,” he added.

According to Nguyễn Hoài Thanh, Chairman of the Vietnamese Association in Plzeň, the community of over 6,000 Vietnamese living in this city wholeheartedly supports the exhibition, expecting that Vietnam Stories will help Czech people better understand the customs and habits of Vietnamese people.

Vietnam Stories will last until August 27.

Jindřich Štreit, born September 5, 1946 in Vsetín, is a Czech photographer and teacher known for his documentary photography. He concentrates on documenting the rural life and people of Czech villages.

The photographer began taking photographs in 1964, during his studies at the Pedagogical Faculty of Palacký University in Olomouc. VNS

HCM CITY — Many businesses in HCM City and southern provinces producing essential goods, including medical masks and personal protective equipment, face difficulty in sustaining their operations due to a lack of workers and transportation problems due to social distancing.

The HCM City Department of Industry and Trade said they face difficulties mainly because of regulations that only 30 per cent of workers are allowed on site and suspension of operations after workers were found to be infected with COVID-19.

Those that remain open have difficulty transporting both raw materials and finished products.

Earlier this week, the department called on relevant agencies to create favourable conditions for medical equipment firms to remain operational.

It urged export processing and industrial zones, Hi-Tech Park, Thủ Đức City, and districts to mitigate difficulties and ensure smooth distribution of essential goods. — VNS

Transaction volume in Guangzhou and Shenzhen exceeds RMB50 billion for four consecutive years, forecast similar volume for 2021 while transactions extend to tier 2 cities in the region.

Foreign investors increase investment in the Greater Bay Area especially low value assets in Southern China for geo-strategic asset allocation.

Though transactions are still dominated by traditional industries, the mature transport network favours the development of new property types, with industrial logistics, cold chain, and data centers preferred by investors.





HONG KONG SAR - Media OutReach - 12 August 2021 - Global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield announces Greater Bay Area Commercial Real Estate Investment Market Review and Forecast 1H 2021 today. The rapid development of the Greater Bay Area in recent years, coupled with a maturing transport network, has driven industrial transformation and shifts in real estate investment in the region. Apart from Shenzhen and Guangzhou, investors also set eyes on tier 2 cities. Investment portfolios are increasingly diversified to include new types of properties such as industrial logistics, cold chain and data centers, in addition to traditional office buildings and shopping malls.

Chart 2: Ratio of domestic and foreign investment

Chart 3: % of CRE transactions by property type in Greater Bay Area

Chart 4: Some of the transactions in warehouses, logistics and data centers in the Greater Bay Area in 2020 and 2021





Commercial real estate investment transaction value in the Greater Bay Area

The launch of the Greater Bay Area initiative in 2017 has drawn immediate attention from owner-occupiers, private investors and funds. Commercial real estate (CRE) investment transactions have turned vibrant, with Guangzhou and Shenzhen recording annual transaction value of over RMB 50 billions for four consecutive years. Such transactions include headquarters purchase by corporations such as Li Ning, Qiaodan Sports, and Shenzhen Expressway in Shenzhen. Driven by TMT (technology, media, telecom) companies, small scale single-block buildings in Guangzhou have also attracted owner-occupiers.

"Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area" was officially announced in 2019, setting a major development milestone for CRE investment market in the Greater Bay Area.With more CRE investment opportunities emerging in other Greater Bay Area cities, investors have been drawn to cities other than Guangzhou and Shenzhen since 2019. The transaction valule has increased from RMB2.7 billion (4% of the total) in 2019 to RMB3.4 billion (7% of the total) in 2020. Over RMB200 million (1% of the total) of such transactions were recorded in 1H21. Total transaction volume for the full year of 2021 is expected to exceed RMB 50 billion, proving investors' persistent interest in the region. (Chart 1)





Distribution of investors in the Greater Bay Area

Capitals in the Greater Bay Area used to be predominately domestic, accounting for over 80% of the investment considerations. Yet foreign investors also pay close attention to this market and their investment activities are increasing year after year, especially in Guangzhou. With an outstanding macro-economic performance and strong spending power, coupled with low availability of quality mixed-use commercial portfolio in core locations, Guangzhou has become the investment target of foreign investors.

Ms. Queeny So, Cushman & Wakefield's Executive Director, Capital Markets, China, shares, "Foreign investors have strengthened their investment in the Greater Bay Area since 2018 and 2019. By 1H21, ratio of foreign investment has surged from below 20% in the past to 25% (Chart 2). We believe foreign investors have used to hold fewer assets in southern China. Yet CRE investment in the Greater Bay Area, as a key strategic zone of China, creates a golden opportunity for geo-strategic asset allocation, leading to a surge of such transactions. We believe foreign investors will continue to look for new investments in various Greater Bay Area cities. "

Types of CRE investment in the Greater Bay Area

Strong consumption power of the Greater Bay Area drives frequent CRE transactions (Chart 3). Of the various CRE types, traditional asset class like office buildings and shopping malls in the Guangzhou-Shenzhen area constituted the most transactions. With CRE asset value softened, many occupiers and private investors are acquiring their current rental premises and turn them into their headquarters. Key investments into major transactions are still dominated by insurance capital For instance, the biggest transaction in Shenzhen was the RMB6.6 billion purchase of Vanke Yuncheng project by Ping An Insurance. Number of CRE transactions in Shenzhen is expected to be record-breaking this year, with total transaction volume similar to that of previous year. Average transaction volume may decline to around RMB1 billion per transaction, slight drop from year 2020.

In Guangzhou, the scarcity of high-quality office buildings in core locations has steered investors to other projects such as shopping malls. In 1H21, the ratio of such transactions therefore rose to over 30% of overall CRE transactions. For instance, Link REIT acquired Happy Valley in Guangzhou this year at RMB 3.205 billion. Meanwhile, occupier-type investors are more drawn to single-block office properties.

As the public transport network in the Greater Bay Area matures, not only has commute time and distance greatly reduced, but it also results in industrial transformation and population influx. This has driven the rise of economy in tier 2 and 3 cities, resulting in new CRE investment types such as industrial logistics, cold chain, data centers, etc., all of which are favored by investors and have recorded perpetual transactions (Chart 4).

Mr. Alva To, Cushman & Wakefield's Vice President, Greater China, concludes, "Domestic investors in the Greater Bay Area and cash-rich real estate funds have turned active and kept close eye on opportunities in the market, resulting in an upsurge in CRE transactions in 1H21. However, as transport and infrastructure facilities in the region gradually complete and coupled with policy supportother Greater Bay Area cities are getting more traction from investors. We believe investors will turn to opportunities in tier 2 cities outside Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Investment projects will also extend from traditional office buildings and shopping malls to logistics, cold chain, and data centers, resulting in a more diversified CRE market in the region."

The pandemic remains complicated partly because social distancing rules have not been strictly implemented or abided by, according to the committee.

In many cases, travel permits have not been issued and used for the right purposes.

In order to control the spread of the infection, people are required to show travel permits along with their identification cards, work schedules and work related documents when they go out.

The city's committee also requests agencies and units to strictly implement Directive 17 and promote the application of information technology so staff can work from home.

HCM CITY — Việt Nam is continuing its institutional reform commitments made in the historic EU-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) in an aim to boost exports of agricultural products and attract more investment from the EU trading bloc.

Võ Tân Thành, vice chairman of the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), said the country has made huge progress in administrative reform and improvement of the business environment.

“After the EVFTA took effect in August, exports to the EU in August and September increased by 4.2 per cent compared to the same period last year. In September alone, exports increased by more than 14 per cent year-on-year,” he said.

However, the EU is a highly demanding market and exporters must meet its food safety standards and management procedures, and provide transparent information about their labour force and working environment, he noted.

European consumers prefer high-quality products, especially those that are organic or fair trade, or have geographical indications, according to Thành.

He urged farmers to gradually shift from traditional to more sustainable cultivation, and to adhere to food safety and hygiene regulations in the EVFTA and other FTAs.

Exporters must also follow the rules of origin (RO) and engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainable development and environmental protection, said Thành, who spoke at a conference on Vietanmese farm produce exports to the EU under the EVFTA organised last week in HCM City.

Lê Duy Minh, chairman of the Việt Nam Farms and Agricultural Enterprises Association (VFAEA), noted that the EU is the third largest trade partner of Việt Nam and one of the country’s two biggest export markets. Exports of agro-forestry-fishery products to the EU stand at nearly US$5 billion per year.

Phạm Văn Duy, deputy director of of the Ministry of Agricutlure and Rural Development’s Agro-product Processing and Market Development Department, said: “The EU is a choosy market, so meeting the EU’s requirements will help businesses open the door to other markets in the world.”

He said that it was important to protect intellectual property of major agricultural products, and to promote branding, geographical indications, and traceability.

For the past decade, Vietnamese exports of agricultural, forestry and aquatic products grew more than 9 per cent on average each year.

Việt Nam’s agricultural sector will be one of the biggest winners from the EVFTA, as reductions in tariffs will increase demand and boost exports to Europe’s high-spending consumer market, according to experts.

Trade in agricultural products represents nearly 12 per cent of the total two-way trade between Việt Nam and the EU.

The trade pact abolishes 99 per cent of import tariffs over the next seven to 10 years.

With a population of more than 500 million and a combined GDP of over $15 trillion, accounting for 22 per cent of the world’s GDP, the EU is the world's largest exporter and importer with annual trade of $3.8 trillion. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — As the third largest seafood exporter in the world, Việt Nam's could lose about US$480 million per year if it fails in its fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

The Việt Nam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) and the World Bank on Tuesday announced its latest report on the economic impact if Việt Nam fails to obey regulations set by the European Commission.

According to the report, fishery and aquaculture commodities represent Việt Nam’s fifth largest export, accounting for about 4 per cent of the country’s exports in 2018. In recent years, Việt Nam’s seafood exports have reached close to US$8.5 - 9 billion per year, of which aquaculture represents 60 to 65 per cent and fishing 35 to 40 per cent.

While Việt Nam prioritised the development of sustainable fisheries, the local fishing sector has been issued a "yellow card" over IUU fishing, by the European Commission (EC) since 2017.

Nguyễn Thị Thu Sắc, vice president of VASEP, said since the issuance of the card, local seafood exports to the EU had decreased significantly. From 2017 to 2019, seafood exports to the EU declined at 12 per cent or US$183.5 million while total marine product exports decreased by over 10 per cent or US$43 million.

Among the products, squid, octopus and cuttlefish plunged the most with a 37 per cent drop, while clams, oysters and scallops decreased 11 per cent, tuna by nearly 2 per cent and crabs by 11 per cent.

The association said the downward trend continued in 2020, especially due to the combined impact of the pandemic, IUU yellow card and Brexit: “Việt Nam’s seafood exports witnessed a decrease of 5.7 percent, equivalent to a turnover of only US$ 959 million, compared to 2019.”

According to VASEP, Việt Nam went from being the second largest seafood import market for the EU to the fourth largest, after the US, Japan and China.

The association said the EU was still a dominant world market and could create a ripple effect in other markets, including important partners for the local seafood market, thus the country could risk losing access to the EU market and being issued a "red card" from the EC for the failure in addressing IUU fishing.

VASEP has worked with partners on a 60-page report covering local seafood production; market regulations on IUU Fishing; overall assessment of trade fluctuations between 2017-2019 to assess the impact of the IUU yellow card; and the estimated short-term and medium-term economic impacts of receiving a red card.

The analysis revealed that fishing was directly affected by the IUU regulations and carding process, while aquaculture was subject to an indirect impact.

The report said if Việt Nam was issued a red card from the EU, the immediate and short-term impact on Việt Nam’s seafood sector would be a trade ban and the local seafood sector would immediately lose EU markets with an export value of nearly US$480 million.

It was estimated that the Vietnamese fishing sector could lose around US$387 million per year.

At the same time, the indirect impact for aquaculture stems from an increasingly negative reputation, the increasing burden of customs control, and missing opportunities to take advantage of the Việt Nam- European Union Free Trade Agreement's preferential tax levels. In this case, Việt Nam’s aquaculture sector could lose around US$93 million.

If the ban lasted for between two and three years, it would mean disruption of the Vietnamese seafood sector with a decline of at least 30 per cent in earnings for fishing.

By reviewing the new challenges faced by the seafood sector as a result of the pandemic, the report said by addressing the IUU yellow card and taking advantage of other opportunities, Việt Nam could minimise the impact.

The report said: “If Việt Nam can remove the IUU yellow card soon, take advantage of tariff preferences and institutional changes from EVFTA, and the opportunity to recover and grow back in the EU market, it would be feasible for Việt Nam to achieve exports of around US$1.2-1.4 billion in the coming years.”

The report said solutions to remove the yellow card could bring the fishery industry closer to achieving the annual growth target of seven to nine per cent in exports and reaching $16-18 billion for export by 2030 as well as contribute to the development of sustainable fisheries.

In January 2019, the EU officially announced the removal of the yellow card for Thailand in recognition of the significant progress it had made in addressing IUU fishing since 2015.

Việt Nam is the fourth largest seafood producer in the world and the third largest exporter of seafood. The local seafood products reached more than 160 markets and had a firm foothold in many large and demanding markets such as the US, Japan, EU and South Korea.

In July, Deputy Prime Minister Lê Văn Thành announced that the country was determined to gradually reduce the number of fishing vessels violating IUU regulations and hoped to have the yellow card removed by 2022. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Despite a new outbreak of COVID-19 in Việt Nam, the industrial property sector saw positive signs with new industrial zones established and key industrial projects beginning operations, according to Savills Vietnam.

The fourth outbreak of COVID-19 that started in late April has forced some southern provinces and cities to suspend flights to and from HCM City to apply strict social distancing measures under the Government's Directive 16.

“The social distancing and domestic travel restrictions continue to pose difficulties for developers trying to lease their land, factories, and warehouses, as investors and potential occupiers cannot undertake site visits in other provinces,” said John Campbell, Manager of Savills Vietnam’s Industrial Services.

“However, the rollout of the vaccinations and promises of a vaccine passport programme is instilling confidence into landlords and investors alike. Given the obstacles facing this segment, the industrial sector continues its fight during the fourth wave of the pandemic.”

Meanwhile, this year has witnessed a number of new mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and improvements in industrial land supply. The largest manufacturing projects in the first half of 2021 came from Hong Kong (China) and Singaporean investors that targeted northern Quảng Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces, according to Savills Vietnam.

Việt Nam’s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose by 3.8 per cent year-on-year to US$10.5 billion in the first seven months of 2021, with processing and manufacturing taking the lead, raking in $7.9 billion, or 47.2 per cent of the total, data from the Ministry of Planning and Investment showed. Real estate came third with registered FDI of $1.16 billion.

He also noted that various new M&A deals have been inked this year. Boustead Projects Co Ltd, for example, signed an options agreement for the proposed acquisition of a 49 per cent stake in KTG & Boustead Industrial Logistics JSC.

If successful, the partnership will consist of 13 real estate seed assets amounting to $141 million in gross asset value covering about 840,000sq.m of land and about 550,000sq.m of gross leasable area, he added.

ESR Cayman Limited, the largest Asia-Pacific-focused logistics real estate platform, and BW Industrial Development JSC (BW), the leading logistics and industrial real estate developer and operator in Việt Nam, have entered into a joint venture to develop 240,000sq.m in Mỹ Phước 4 Industrial Park near HCM City.

Regarding new projects, Logos Property’s 81,000sq.m project in the Việt Nam-Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP) Bắc Ninh 1 is expected to begin operation in the fourth quarter of 2021.

A new player in the market, KCN Vietnam Group JSC, acquired a significant 250-hectare land plot with an investment of US$300 million, aiming to develop premium, sustainable factories and warehouses for rent in Việt Nam with a national portfolio spanning across localities of Bắc Giang, Hải Phòng, Hải Dương, Đồng Nai and Long An.

In the domestic market, a developing trend has emerged of investors actively seeking industrial properties for sale-leaseback, according to Savills Vietnam.

“Amid travel restrictions, the industrial property sector activity in 2020 and 2021 to date has revolved around companies in Việt Nam expanding or relocating their production. Last year has also seen some key deals and the emergence of distressed assets and facilities for sale and leaseback,” said Campbell.

Sale-leaseback is a very particular form of a financial instrument where one party (the seller/future lessee) that owns an asset sells the asset to the second party (the investor/future lessor). Then, the seller leases the asset back from the buyer, therefore the seller becomes the tenant, and the investor is the landlord. The benefit for the seller is that they can raise capital without moving or interrupting business operations.

Sale-leasebacks are still underutilised in Việt Nam. Many manufacturers and logistics companies are not aware of this method as a potential means of financing.

However, some international and even local players are starting to pave the way. The first high-profile sale-leaseback in Việt Nam’s industrial market was DKSH’s warehouse in Bình Dương in 2017.

In 2018, Mapletree Logistics Trust from Singapore invested $43 million in Unilever’s 66,800 GFA warehouse in Bình Dương. The property was leased back to Unilever on a 10-year term, providing a net initial yield of 8.3 per cent for Mapletree.

In 2020, Savills Vietnam brokered a successful sale-leaseback of warehouse space in the Dĩ An Industrial Zone, Bình Dương. — VNS

HCM CITY — Experts have called on Việt Nam to enhance its legal framework to promote the development of the digital economy to attract investment and improve its competitiveness.

Speaking at an online conference this week, Prof Dr Trần Việt Dũng, dean of the international law faculty at the HCM City University of Law, said with the boom in smartphones, internet and social networks, digital technology had developed significantly, giving rise to a dynamic digital economy with huge potential.

But infrastructure for things such as the internet and digital payment services remain poor since there is still no legal framework for the digital economy, according to Dũng.

He called for creating a legal system to govern new business models in the digital economy, electronic transactions and virtual currencies, intellectual property, competition, protection of consumers using e-commerce, and civil liability of artificial intelligence.

Đinh Thị Chiến, lecturer at the university’s civil law faculty, said transport services digital platforms were putting workers, especially motorbike taxi drivers, at risk due to a lack of protections in the Labour Code.

“The relationship between digital service providers and app-based motorbike taxi drivers must be recognised as an employment relationship under the Labour Code.

“An employee is a person who works for an employer under an agreement, and is paid, managed and supervised by the employer.”

The ambiguous labour laws put drivers’ rights at risk because their scope is too narrow or are too narrowly interpreted, and the laws themselves are poorly or ambiguously formulated making their scope unclear, she said.

P2P Lending

Experts also discussed peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, which is still very new in Việt Nam.

They said the P2P model is good, but due to the absence of a regulatory framework, though there are many Vietnamese start-ups in the field, foreign loan applications creep in, posing the threat of black credit.

The lack of a legal framework has made Việt Nam a fertile environment for malicious P2P models, while genuine P2P companies have no chance.

They recommended having a legal framework soon, even if on trial, to protect both borrowers and P2P businesses.

The State Bank of Việt Nam has proposed a regulatory ‘sandbox’ for P2P lending, which could be approved by the end of this year, to help SMEs borrow, eliminate unscrupulous businesses and help the market grow.

Artificial Intelligence

Lawyer Lê Thu Minh said Việt Nam also lacked a legal framework for civil liability related to AI and AI-based activities.

But Nguyễn Đào Phương Thúy, a lecturer at the faculty of international law, said countries, including those very active in AI technologies, were hesitant about giving AI an independent legal status.

When AI started to be applied in many fields in Việt Nam, for example self-driving cars, it raised the question of the responsibility of the manufacturer if the safety of a vehicle is jeopardised due to a manufacturing defect.

Vietnamese law does not have any specific provisions for self-driving cars and considers them an ordinary motor vehicle, which means the owner of the vehicle is liable while the vehicle runs on its own through AI, according to experts.

They said authorities should consider a pilot mechanism (sandbox) specific to this to enhance the liability of the manufacturer through financial measures such as compulsory insurance contributions, which have been proven successful in the EU and the US.

Việt Nam’s digital economy is expected to be worth US$52 billion by 2025. — VNS

NINH THUẬN – The south-central province of Ninh Thuận is taking measures to increase the number of its products made under the country’s ‘one commune – one product’ programme.

OCOP includes commercial products and services like food, beverages, handicrafts, and rural tourism services, which are rated up to a highest of five stars.

Lê Huyền, deputy chairman of the province People’s Committee, said to develop OCOP products, Ninh Thuận was enabling co-operatives and production establishments to participate in the programme.

It was providing them with machinery and facilities, helping develop production linkages between stakeholders and raw material growing areas, training human resources, and carrying out trade promotion activities for OCOP products, he said.

It would promote the sales of these products through modern distribution channels like supermarkets and e-commerce platforms, he said.

Producers would get help in using advanced technologies to improve quality and value, with competent agencies overseeing quality from production to sales, he said.

The province has had 69 OCOP products, including 10 four – star and 51 three - star products as of last year including honeydew melon, jujube, grapefruit, Cà Ná fish sauce, aloe vera products, garlic, and red onion.

These have not only helped improve the value of the province’s agriculture production and rural economy but also promoted its brands, according to the People’s Committee.

The products are in high demand both inside and outside the province.

The Thái Thuận – Ninh Thuận Manufacture and Trading Agricultural Company Limited in Ninh Sơn District’s Nhơn Sơn Commune produces 10 OCOP products, including grape and jujube.

Nguyễn Đình Quang, its director, said through local and central government support policies, the company had developed production linkages for its grape and jujube products.

In early July it began selling its four-star green grapes on e-commerce platform sendo.vn, he said.

“The company will also sell grapes and jujube products on other e-commerce platforms. This will help sell them more conveniently and maintain the production and value of agricultural products during the COVID – 19 pandemic.”

The province is spending more than VNĐ6.1 billion (US$266,000) this year to develop 20 – 30 new OCOP products.

Đặng Kim Cương, director of its Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said this year the province would also upgrade the quality levels of its existing products.

The province has 38 products, including specifically identified ones, that can be developed into OCOP items, according to a steering board tasked with developing them.

Ninh Thuận, which has the lowest rainfall in the country, has 12 specifically identified products, including asparagus, sheep, goat, Mỹ Nghiệp brocade, and Bàu Trúc pottery.

Its asparagus, for instance, enjoys great demand and stable prices even amid the pandemic.

The province has more than 200ha under asparagus, mostly in Ninh Phước, Ninh Hải, Thuận Bắc, and Ninh Sơn districts and Phan Rang – Tháp Chàm City.

Ninh Thuận is the country’s largest producer of asparagus, grape, jujube, sheep, and goat as its weather and soil are ideal for them.

Along with tourism

The province is promoting OCOP products together with tourism.

Its Department of Industry and Trade is showcasing the province’s OCOP products at six popular tourism destinations including the Vĩnh Hy and Hang Rái tourism areas and the tourism night market.

Last year it organised two fairs to introduce the products and two conferences to discuss linking up with buyers in Bình Thuận and Lâm Đồng provinces and HCM City.

The province also subsidised 50 companies that participated in eight trade fairs held locally and in other provinces and cities last year. – VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vice chairman of HCM City People’s Committee Dương Anh Đức.

HCM CITY — HCM City is set to extend lockdown measures until September 15, the date set by the Government for the southern city to have its severe COVID-19 outbreaks under control, the city's officials have said.

“The situation is complicated and can last for a long time, the number of cases tends to decrease but the number of deaths is still high,” Vice Chairman of HCM City People’s Committee Dương Anh Đức said on Friday at the daily press briefing.

From August 5, on average, the city recorded 3,687 cases a day, of which 78.6 per cent were in locked down areas, 2.3 per cent in quarantined areas, 17.7 per cent via screening tests at hospitals.

The city currently has 1,558 critical patients, and 16 on ECMO. As many as 10,421 are asymptomatic and being treated at home. More than 12,000 patients have been treated for more than seven days and are recovering.

“The most worrying problem is the high death rate, at about 241 deaths a day.”

Thus, the city now focuses on improving treatment efficacy, with the highest goal being reducing the number of deaths in 22 localities in the city.

It is forecast that after August 15, the number of cases will still be around 3,000 a day.

“Therefore, if we do not drastically implement strong anti-pandemic measures, it will be difficult to maintain the results, and the situation may even get worse,” Đức said.

Phan Văn Mãi, deputy secretary of the city Party Committee, said the city would strengthen measures from August 15 to September 15, divided into two phases - from August 15 to August 31 and from August 31 to September 15. Specific measures have been determined for each phase.

It is expected that on August 15, the city will announce the details of the plan, with strict social distancing measures according to the Government’s Directive 16 continuing.

Sinopharm vaccine

Vice Chairman Đức said that the city’s Department of Health on Friday started to administer the batch of one million doses of Sinopharm's Vero Cell COVID-19 vaccine to its residents.

This batch of vaccines had undergone quality controls and approved by the Ministry of Health, Đức said at a press conference providing updates about anti-pandemic activities in HCM City Friday morning.

Đức said currently the supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to Việt Nam remained very limited. In August and September, about three million doses were expected to be delivered, among which the allocation to HCM City would not be sufficient since many provinces and cities were also facing similar scarcity.

Therefore, in August, in HCM City, "the best is what we have at the moment”, he said.

The city would administer vaccinations, ensuring all vaccines are qualified and licensed by WHO and the Ministry of Health. People must be aware of their own health and act together with the community to contribute to improving the city's anti-pandemic efforts, he said.

With current resources, HCM City can inject 350,000 shots per day or more.

Currently, HCM City has five million doses of Sinopharm's Vero Cell vaccine, and is trying to bring five more million doses of Moderna by the end of this year.

Regarding the five million Moderna vaccine doses, Đức said the vaccination was completely non-profit, coming from the donations of businesses, who wanted to ensure vaccine coverage for its employees, then support the city in injections for priority groups.

Đức emphasised that the city organised vaccination for all people, and treated all qualified vaccines equally. — VNS

HCM CITY — The Việt Nam Poultry Breeders Association has said the Government should have a strategy to develop feed ingredients domestically to reduce their imports.

It forecast demand for the raw materials to increase over the next five years to 28-30 million tonnes a year costing US$12-13 billion, including 14.5-15 million tonnes for poultry feed.

Feed production has been growing by 13-15 per cent annually, and Việt Nam has become the 10th largest producer in the world and the largest in Southeast Asia.

But it still relies heavily on import of raw materials.

According to a forecast by the US Department of Agriculture, Việt Nam will continue to depend on imports for raw materials like soybean powder, corn, other cereals, bran from copra and canola, animal proteins such as meat and bone meal and fish meal.

Phạm Đức Bình, deputy chairman of the Việt Nam Animal Feed Association, said the industry is dominated by importers and foreign businesses, while all the corn used for production is imported.

Việt Nam only produces rice bran and cassava, and has failed to develop other inputs because of poor productivity, and the animal feed supply chain is not comprehensive, he said.

The dependence on imports and the sharp increase in global prices of raw materials due to crop failures and China buying record quantities means input prices have increased sharply.

The lack of empty containers, which are stuck in various ports around the world, to transport goods has further increased the prices of imported raw materials.

To minimise the monopoly of foreign enterprises and create competition, Bình said the Government should plan raw material areas and offer preferential credit policies to domestic companies.

Experts said it is time for Việt Nam to develop domestic feed ingredients supply in a methodical manner.

One of the solutions is to apply bio-technology to develop crops for feed ingredients, helping reduce imports, they added. — VNS

HCM CITY — A total of 85,608 people in HCM City were vaccinated with Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) on Saturday, the municipal Department of Health announced on Sunday.

The doses used are part of the first shipment of 1 million doses of the Chinese vaccine that were imported by HCM City-based Sapharco under the sponsorship of the private group Vạn Thịnh Phát and delivered to the southern city last month.

Another one million doses of the 5-million-doses contract arrived at Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport on Saturday, pending quality controls before being administered.

The department also said that two districts including Phú Nhuận and Cần Giờ had completed the first dose vaccination for people over 18 years old. Specifically, Phú Nhuận District has a vaccination rate of 152,387 out of 163,961 people, reaching 92.94 per cent of the population. Cần Giờ District has vaccinated 54,130 people, reaching 97.3 per cent. The district has more than 71,000 people, of which those over 18 years old number more than 59,000.

A medical worker consults a resident before the injection.

Trần Thị Xuân Hải and her son had the vaccination at the An Hội Primary School in Gò Vấp District in an excited mood.

"Before getting the injection, I was told that I was to be vaccinated with Vero Cell vaccine, but I was not worried. I think any type of vaccine is fine as long as the disease could be prevented, and the sooner is the better. The doctor here enthusiastically consulted us about the vaccination and I felt even more reassured. After the injection, I feel that I am still healthy," said Hải.

People fill in their personal information and sign to agree to receive the vaccine.

A medical worker gives a Vero Cell vaccination to a resident.

Nguyễn Công Sơn, 55, in Gò Vấp District, said he was advised by the medical staff about the type of vaccine being injected. Believing in the State, he did not hesitate and signed to agree to receive the Vero Cell vaccine.

Nguyễn Hồng Lâm, deputy chairman of the Ward 12 People’s Committee in Gò Vấp District, said the ward had given clear information about the vaccine and injection work to local residents.

All of the injection sites were organised well to ensure security and preventive measures.

HCM City's officials have said that the injection of the vaccines are voluntary and all vaccination sites communicate clearly with the people about the vaccine being offered, amid some hesitancy against the Chinese vaccine, despite it having been approved by WHO and the Vietnamese health ministry.

On Friday, for example, a video clip circulating online showed people leaving a vaccination site on Huyền Trân Công Chúa Street, District 1, HCM City, after being told by health workers that AstraZeneca vaccines had run out and only Sinopharm vaccines were left, on the first day of the 1 million shipment being rolled out. HCM City's representative said they are aware of the incident but the administration of Chinese vaccine still continued at the site throughout the day.

17,916 doses of Sinopharm's vaccine were administered on Friday, according to the city's health authorities.

To date, Việt Nam has received 2.5 million doses of Sinopharm vaccines, with the 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government in June reserved for people in border areas neighbouring China, Chinese nationals in Việt Nam, and people who wish to go to China for trade, studying or work, as well as those who have the need for the vaccine.

HCM City is currently the biggest COVID-19 hot spots with healthcare system straining to deal with the large caseload, and amid global shortage, the city is quickly running out of vaccines to give to its residents.

Việt Nam currently relies mostly on Western vaccines, primarily AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, in its mass vaccination drive. — VNS

Nearly 800 leaders, experts, and academics at the recent workshop on Quality Assurance for Online and Digitally Enhanced Learning, the biggest industry-facing event co-hosted by RMIT University and the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training

Drawing experience from universities and tertiary education authorities in both Australia and Viet nam, the experts shared some lessons learned from the recent period of online and hybrid learning.

A holistic approach

Representatives from RMIT University, Deakin University and the Australian Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) all highlighted that the online student experience is more than just about learning. As such, a high-quality education needs to cater for the holistic student experience regardless of the delivery mode.

Professor Shona Leitch, Associate Deputy Vice-Chancellor Education at RMIT University, commented: “All considerations should be student-centric, from designing online course contents and learning environments, to setting learning outcomes and the actual teaching and assessment.”

Beyond that, student support mechanisms should be available on virtual platforms as well. At RMIT, student services like the library, recreation centre, student advice, academic support, wellbeing, and career advice are now all accessible online with some being accessible by students 24/7.

“We also conduct student surveys throughout the semester and quality confirmation checks on all courses, which enable us to adapt to our students’ expectations and ensure that our staff have the capability and support they need to make continuous improvement,” Professor Leitch added.

Digital is the new norm

Experts agreed on the need to think of online learning not as a second choice, but a current necessity and constant element of modern education going forward. Such a mindset would help steer actions that improve the quality of online teaching and learning.

According to quality assurance specialist Dr Nguyen Huu Cuong, educational institutions need to prioritise equipping their faculty with the capacity to teach online and their students with the skills to learn online.

“Online education requires specific online teaching materials as well. Though a challenge for many Vietnamese institutions, the way forward for them is to upgrade their digital libraries so that both academics and students can access high-quality online resources,” Dr Cuong said.

Online delivery also urges academics to think about assessment more creatively. Authentic assessment (rather than traditional exams) has been adopted by many Australian universities including RMIT, and such experience was shared with their Vietnamese counterparts at the workshop.

Quality assurance framework

In a move to support online education, the Vietnamese Prime Minister has approved several plans to develop distance learning. Moreover, Viet Nam's Ministry of Education and Training has issued distance learning frameworks, regulations allowing a 30% online component in undergraduate and doctorate programs, criteria for assessing the quality of distance education programs, as well as research projects and directives for implementation.

According to Associate Professor Pham Van Tuan from the University of Da Nang, AUN-QA Lead Assessor, “constitutes of quality in online learning include the institutional strategy, teaching and learning methodology, online-appropriate student assessment methods, course development, professional development for online teaching staff, IT skills development for tech support staff, and more.”

“Institutions need to build an online learning quality assurance framework covering the constituent elements of quality identified, and comply with the regulations that govern online learning,” he emphasised.

Overall, the Australian and Vietnamese experts at the workshop agreed that online and digitally enhanced learning is an exciting area to collaborate in. They expect to use the lessons learned from the past 18 months to give students a much deeper and richer experience in the future.

BRUSSELS — Canned pure fresh coconut water Cocoxim of Bến Tre Import-Export Joint Stock Company (Betrimex) has become popular among consumers in Belgium.

This product is imported directly from Việt Nam by the Belgian firm South Export Alliance and distributed in Belgium, France and the Czech Republic.

François Colonval, manager of South Export Alliance, said that he founded the company in 2016 with a hope to introduce Việt Nam’s fresh coconut water to Belgian consumers.

South Export Alliance is the exclusive distributor of Cocoxim coconut water for all Asian restaurants and some supermarkets in Belgium, and also exports this kind of product to France and the Czech Republic. Every few months, the company imports from Betrimex a container weighing 25 tonnes.

Since the European Union-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) officially took effect with preferential tariffs offered for Vietnamese agricultural products imported into the European market, South Export Alliance has conditions to expand business opportunities in importing goods from Việt Nam. Along with coconut water, Colonval has also imported other products such as rice paper and dried vermicelli.

He sees many advantages when looking for partners in Việt Nam to import goods with incentives from the EVFTA.

Currently, Colonval is working with large Belgian customers to import other Vietnamese food and beverage products such as Hanoi beer and Saigon beer because he wants Belgian customers to enjoy the taste of Vietnamese beer even though Belgium is the kingdom of beer. — VNS

Doctor Trần Danh Cường, director of the National Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology talked to Sức khỏe & Đời sống (Health & Life) newspaper about COVID-19 vaccinations for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

Is COVID-19 dangerous to pregnant women? Do they face more risk of catching it than others?

Studies conducted all over the world show that pregnant women face the same risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 as other people.

However, once catching the virus, pregnant women are vulnerable because, during pregnancy, a woman's immune system can be weakened.

During pregnancy the pregnant woman's uterus will be larger, pushing the diaphragm up and making the lung capacity low, which obstructs their breathing. So, the oxygen demand of pregnant women is higher than that of normal people.

As pregnancy progresses, fluid may accumulate in tissues, usually in the feet, ankles, and legs, causing them to swell and appear puffy. This condition is called edema. The edema is also seen in the upper respiratory tract mucosa, which easily causes damage to the upper respiratory tract. If infected with COVID-19, the pregnant women are more at risk.

Underlying health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, chronic lung disease will also cause complications during pregnancy.

Together with the above factors, if pregnant women get COVID-19, they will face a high risk of serious complications which require intensive care, ventilators and ECMO.

Vaccinating pregnant women against COVID-19 is very important.

Is the COVID-19 vaccination safe for pregnant women?

When a pregnant woman catches SARS-CoV-2, two of the most common issues are if the virus goes to the fetus and if the unborn child catches COVID-19.

When we tested amniotic fluid samples from pregnant women after giving birth, blood samples from the umbilical vein and throat fluid samples from the mother and the pathology of the placenta, scientists did not detect any SARS-CoV-2 virus in the samples.

This confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not enter the amniotic cavity where the baby grows.

Normally, in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the exchange between the mother and the fetus is modest, so the risk of transmitting of SARS-CoV-2 virus from mother to child is very low.

However, if an infection occurs at this stage, the risk to the baby is great and can potentially cause abnormalities in the fetus because this is the period of formation and development of the important organs of the fetus.

In the next stage, the possibility of infection between mother and child is very strong, but the risk of causing birth defects is lower because important organs of the fetus have already formed.

According to the latest COVID-19 vaccination guidelines of Việt Nam’s health ministry, pregnant women at 13 weeks and more can get COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccination for the mothers will help produce antibodies against the COVID-19, their babies may benefit from vaccine antibodies that pass through the placenta.

I think that the ministry’s guideline is reasonable using scientific proof ensuring safety for both mothers and their children. The benefits of the vaccination are much more when compared with the risks it might bring.

If the COVID-19 vaccination is taken by breastfeeding mothers, will it affect their babies?

Studies show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not spread through breastfeeding. So, if having the COVID-19, breastfeeding mothers still can breastfeed their babies as long as they strictly take anti-infection measures.

What should pregnant or breastfeeding women do before and after they get COVID-19 vaccines?

The COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women is necessary to protect them from the SARS-CoV-2.

Before getting a COVID-19 vaccine shot, pregnant women need a medical check to identify the health conditions of them and their babies.

Pregnant women with underlying health conditions need more careful medical checks. I think that only those with risks of preeclampsia, placental abruption and other serious obstetric complications should delay the COVID-19 vaccination.

As a medical facility assigned by the Ministry of Health to take care of and protect the health of pregnant and postpartum women, my hospital has prepared all necessary elements to vaccinate pregnant women after 13 weeks and breastfeeding mothers. VNS

QUẢNG NGÃI — The People's Committee of Quảng Ngãi Province, home to the Bình Sơn Refinery and Petrochemical Joint Stock Company (BSR), one of the country's largest petrochemical enterprises and the province's key economic lifeline, has reported to the Prime Minister's Office that the country should prioritise the use of gasoline and diesel oil from domestic suppliers and reduce imports in light of crumbling demand during the pandemic.

The central province's report to the Government said as the country attempts to contain the novel coronavirus in its fourth outbreak (since late April) major cities and towns across the country including the capital city of Hà Nội and the southern largest economic hub HCM City, have one after another, gone into lockdown. This has sent domestic demand for gas and oil nose-diving at least until the end of the year.

The sudden fall in demand has made traders stop buying gas and oil. In July alone, deliveries for some 230,000cu.m of gas and oil have been either delayed or cancelled, which has caused BSR's inventories to balloon rapidly within a short period of time. As of now, the refinery is holding onto over 200,000cu.m, or 1.2 million barrels, of petrol products and nearly 400,000cu.m, or 2.4 million barrels, of crude oil.

To make matter worse, deliveries for August have also been forecast to drop by 40-50 per cent as many traders have not made plans with BSR for their purchases.

Since August 3, the refinery has been forced to operate at 90 per cent capacity, its minimum technical efficiency. BSR has also been forced to send 25,000cu.m of gasoline into storage and expected to make room for another 100,000-120,000cu.m of products in August. This, however, only offered a temporary measure as storage space has been snatched up fast. Once it runs out of storage, the refinery will have no choice but to shutter operations, which will incur huge costs for the enterprise, said the report.

Another refinery, the Nghi Sơn Refinery in Thanh Hóa Province, has been reportedly dealing with the same problem.

Meanwhile, the country's import of petroleum products still remained high, making it even more difficult for domestic refineries to find a way out. Việt Nam likely will find itself with a large surplus in supply in the coming months across all of its cities and provinces, said the report.

BSR, however, has been reportedly doing well during the first six months of the year. The refinery reported net revenue of VNĐ27.8 trillion (US$1.2 billion) during the second quarter of 2021, and after-tax profit of VNĐ1.7 trillion, despite rising operational costs across the board, a stark contrast to performance during the same period last year when BSR reported VNĐ1.9 trillion in losses. — VNS

HCM CITY — The Ministry of Information and Communications and Ministry of Health has called on localities to take full advantage of information and technology to administer vaccinations rapidly and effectively.

Speaking at an online conference on IT applications in COVID-19 prevention and control, Đỗ Công Anh, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Information and Communications Department of Informatisation emphasised that utilising IT in the vaccination campaign would ensure the campaign’s transparency.

Four vaccination management platforms have been built by the military-run telecom group Viettel under the guidelines of the two ministries, including the electronic health record app, a portal for COVID immunisation information at tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn/portal, a system supporting national vaccination at tiemchungcovid19.moh.gov.vn, and an MCC Centre, with its database to be managed centrally and transparently.

The databases of these platforms are strictly managed, ensuring transparency of information for both people and State management agencies. The vaccination management system has been implemented in five steps from vaccination registration to post-vaccination monitoring.

People can register to get a COVID-19 vaccine via the e-health record application and immunisation information portal. After receiving the information, departments of health in specific areas will guide people to vaccination sites.

The health departments will be in charge of allocating vaccines to vaccination sites. After being vaccinated, people can track their vaccination records via the two platforms.

The data will be centrally managed on the national COVID-19 vaccination management platform and will support the National Immunisation Steering Committee to monitor vaccination results and manage the entire nationwide vaccination campaign.

Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Huy Dũng said the vaccination management platform was capable of managing vaccines from their arrival in Việt Nam, to their storage, distribution, and shipping to vaccination sites and to the point of injection. Each dose, each batch, each type of vaccine has been tightly managed at each vaccination site.

"The IT application will help us deploy the vaccination campaign more rapidly and conveniently,” he said.

Võ Thị Trung Trinh, Deputy Director of the HCM City’s Department of Information and Communications said the application of the national vaccination management platform in the fifth phase of the city-wide vaccination campaign has increased the number of vaccinated people to 930,230 after 10 days.

"In the fifth phase, the vaccination programme has accelerated very quickly. In the first days there were only a few thousand injections per day. But the number has reached over 100,000 per day in recent days,” she said.

Trinh also said the department had suggested measures to deal with unexpected situations that arise in different localities.

In addition, the city also recommended the department send IT staff to standardise vaccination registration data and ensure the apps were being used effectively.

The department will make a list of people that need to be vaccinated on the national immunisation portal and e-health book app and use pandemic data to point out the hot spots where rapid vaccination is needed.

Anh confirmed the practice of using the IT applications in HCM City was a valuable test case for expanding the technology nationwide.

He has asked the departments of health and information and communications to register for vaccination via the e-health record application or immunisation information portal tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn.

All vaccination sites, including mobile ones, must be connected to the internet. Technological systems and platforms related to COVID-19 vaccination would be further upgraded, he said. — VNS

HCM CITY Two Vietnamese films by Marcus Mạnh Cường Vũ and Nguyễn Phan Linh Đan have been included at the Busan Film Festival, while the new horror movie by Lê Bình Giang has been introduced at the Locarno Film Festival.

The Asian Project Market (APM) at the Busan Film Festival, which recently announced 26 films participating this year, will take place from October 12-14 within the framework of the Busan International Film Festival 2021 in South Korea.

Among 26 films participating in APM, two are Vietnamese movies, including Memento Mori: Water from director Vũ and producers Nguyễn Hoàng Điệp and Nguyễn Trinh Hoan, and the film If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood from director Đan and producer Ngô Thị Bích Hạnh.

Memento Mori: Water is the second movie in the Memento Mori the Movie trilogy, written and directed by Vũ since 2019. The series is inspired by a true story in the book Điểm đến cuộc đời (Destination of Life) by author Đặng Hoàng Giang.

The film tells the story of Hà, a mother who has a son with bone cancer. The main event offers Hà an opportunity to experience sympathy and enlightenment, among other insights.

The movie is currently in pre-production, and is scheduled to start filming in 2022 and be released in 2023.

The first movie of the series, Memento Mori: Land, is seeking community funds to complete its post-production.

Director Vũ told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper that it was a great honour to be included in the Busan Film Festival.

“This is the first crucial recognition for the project. Every filmmaker in Asia looks forward to APM during his or her first steps,” he said, adding that this "relay station" is especially meaningful as the film industry is facing difficulties due to the pandemic.

Little information is currently available for the movie If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood. Its director Đan took part in the 2019 Busan Film Festival in his role as cinematography director for the movie Bí mật của gió (The Secret of the Wind) directed by Nguyễn Phan Quang Bình, who is Đan’s father.

Đan plans to return to the festival this year as a film director. This is Đan’s first time as a director for a movie, after making a number of music videos, commercials and short film projects.

APM is rated as the best "filter" of Asian art film projects, and 26 selected movies this year are from 15 countries.

Giang’s horror movie

Variety magazine on August 7 reported that director Lê Bình Giang’s horror movie Who Created Human Beings is part of the Open Doors programme at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland between August 4 and 14.

The film is about a policeman named Sinh and his girlfriend Linh who are both Catholic. The characters and plot are inspired by real people whom Giang knows.

The film explores the differences between the older generation and their adult children, as well as certain religious and social norms.

Shooting for the film starts in a mountain village during the rainy season in 2022. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Experiencing the effects of lockdowns, consumer buying behaviours have been changing at an unprecedented rate.

This change forced businesses to adapt if they wanted to maintain and increase revenue, said experts at a webinar on enhancing strategy on Thursday.

The webinar helped businesses reassess customer behaviour thereby upgrading their online business strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consumer buying behaviour is influenced by many factors and within seconds, a buyer's decision could change.

Research by Think With Google showed that 82 per cent of smartphone users consult their phones for information on products they want to buy. But, one in 10 of those end up buying a different product than they had planned.

As a payment solution provider and a business, Visa Việt Nam and Biti's are two examples that show the awareness and strategic adaptation of businesses in the face of changes in needs and habits, or behaviours, of customers.

With the mindset of putting customers as the focus of their business strategy, these two businesses have actively researched and found new business solutions.

Biti's made a bold change in its business strategy, which is to switch to trading agricultural products from last month.

This business said that this was a new direction to meet the most urgent needs of the people, and at the same time a solution to help businesses work.

Visa Việt Nam conducted a survey on the change in payment habits of users at the end of last year. The survey showed that when affected by the pandemic, 44 per cent of consumers made their first online transactions on social networks, while 82 per cent spent more online than in the previous year.

Statistics showed that more and more Vietnamese people know how to use online payments and most are spending more through online and card payments.

Through the webinar, brand owners who have been successful in e-commerce implementation helped businesses to learn how to connect with customers through the internet and electronic devices, understand consumers' online shopping behaviour to seize opportunities for e-commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The workshop also helped businesses grasp solutions on e-commerce and digital transformation, helping businesses to gradually transform their operations from traditional methods to do business in the online environment, and attract customers through online tools. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@While the shift to online learning amid COVID-19 prompted discussions around how to ensure quality quickly, the conversation is now evolving into how to look more into students’ needs and use student feedback to improve quality.

This trend was discussed among nearly 800 leaders, experts, and academics at the recent workshop on Quality Assurance for Online and Digitally Enhanced Learning, the biggest industry-facing event co-hosted by RMIT Vietnam since the pandemic started.

Nearly 800 leaders, experts, and academics at the recent workshop on Quality Assurance for Online and Digitally Enhanced Learning, the biggest industry-facing event co-hosted by RMIT University and the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training

Drawing experience from universities and tertiary education authorities in both Australia and Viet nam, the experts shared some lessons learned from the recent period of online and hybrid learning.

A holistic approach

Representatives from RMIT University, Deakin University and the Australian Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) all highlighted that the online student experience is more than just about learning. As such, a high-quality education needs to cater for the holistic student experience regardless of the delivery mode.

Professor Shona Leitch, Associate Deputy Vice-Chancellor Education at RMIT University, commented: “All considerations should be student-centric, from designing online course contents and learning environments, to setting learning outcomes and the actual teaching and assessment.”

Beyond that, student support mechanisms should be available on virtual platforms as well. At RMIT, student services like the library, recreation centre, student advice, academic support, wellbeing, and career advice are now all accessible online with some being accessible by students 24/7.

“We also conduct student surveys throughout the semester and quality confirmation checks on all courses, which enable us to adapt to our students’ expectations and ensure that our staff have the capability and support they need to make continuous improvement,” Professor Leitch added.

Digital is the new norm

Experts agreed on the need to think of online learning not as a second choice, but a current necessity and constant element of modern education going forward. Such a mindset would help steer actions that improve the quality of online teaching and learning.

According to quality assurance specialist Dr Nguyen Huu Cuong, educational institutions need to prioritise equipping their faculty with the capacity to teach online and their students with the skills to learn online.

“Online education requires specific online teaching materials as well. Though a challenge for many Vietnamese institutions, the way forward for them is to upgrade their digital libraries so that both academics and students can access high-quality online resources,” Dr Cuong said.

Online delivery also urges academics to think about assessment more creatively. Authentic assessment (rather than traditional exams) has been adopted by many Australian universities including RMIT, and such experience was shared with their Vietnamese counterparts at the workshop.

Quality assurance framework

In a move to support online education, the Vietnamese Prime Minister has approved several plans to develop distance learning. Moreover, Viet Nam's Ministry of Education and Training has issued distance learning frameworks, regulations allowing a 30% online component in undergraduate and doctorate programs, criteria for assessing the quality of distance education programs, as well as research projects and directives for implementation.

According to Associate Professor Pham Van Tuan from the University of Da Nang, AUN-QA Lead Assessor, “constitutes of quality in online learning include the institutional strategy, teaching and learning methodology, online-appropriate student assessment methods, course development, professional development for online teaching staff, IT skills development for tech support staff, and more.”

“Institutions need to build an online learning quality assurance framework covering the constituent elements of quality identified, and comply with the regulations that govern online learning,” he emphasised.

Overall, the Australian and Vietnamese experts at the workshop agreed that online and digitally enhanced learning is an exciting area to collaborate in. They expect to use the lessons learned from the past 18 months to give students a much deeper and richer experience in the future.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@According to data from the WINA, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a sharp increase in the demand for instant noodles around the world. — Photo doanhnhansaigon.vn

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam ranked third in instant noodles consumption after China/Hong Kong and Indonesia.

Around 7 billion packs of instant noodles were eaten in the country last year, according to the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA). The latest survey by Nielsen Việt Nam shows that the consumption rate has increased by 67 per cent. Việt Nam is home to about local and foreign instant noodles producers.

China is currently the world's highest consumer of instant noodles, but the growth rate in consumption is not as high as that of Việt Nam.

According to data from the WINA, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a sharp increase in the demand for instant noodles around the world. The consumption demand of this product surged by 14.79 per cent year-on-year in 2020.

Statistics of the WINA show the Asian market was the biggest consumer of this product, accounting for 56.45 per cent of the total global instant noodle consumption last year, especially in Northeast Asian countries such as China, the Republic of Korea, and Japan.

With the five main markets, Indonesia, Việt Nam, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia, the Southeast Asian region accounted for 25.24 per cent of the total demand.

According to a market research report of Facts and Factors, revenue from noodles is expected to increase to US$73.55 billion over the next five years from $45.67 billion in 2020.

A number of Vietnamese companies recorded a 300-per cent surge in the noodle export output. Instant noodles made in Việt Nam have been sold in more than 40 countries worldwide. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Goods have been moving through Việt Nam's numerous seaports without hiccups despite the COVID-19 pandemic, said the Việt Nam Maritime Administration (VMA).

During the first seven months of this year, some 425 million tonnes of goods have been moved through seaports across the country, a six per cent increase from the same period last year. Of which, exports accounted for 106 million tonnes, a nine per cent increase, imports 133 million tonnes, a two per cent increase and domestic trade 184 million tonnes, a seven per cent increase from the same period last year.

Notably, there has been a jump in containers. The country recorded 14.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), a 21 per cent increase from the same period last year.

The smooth sailing, however, very much depends on how well the country can contain the virus, said Hoàng Hồng Giang, deputy head of the VMA. He said social distancing measures in effect in major towns in the Mekong Delta during the last two months will have an immediate effect on import/export and domestic trade activities. The administration said it's expecting drops in volume of goods passing through seaports for July and August this year.

Regarding skyrocketing costs for ocean transport in recent months, Giang said the Vietnamese fleet are losing on their home turf. As of now, the country's fleet did not have the capacity to operate outside of Asia and ASEAN.

According to the VMA, the country has just 38 container ships, which account for just a five per cent market share, meaning 95 per cent of the country's import/export and domestic trade will have to rely on some 40 foreign fleets. A lack of alternatives and competition leaves Vietnamese importers/exporters with little bargaining power when it comes to price negotiations with shipping firms.

He said the country's most urgent task is to invest in building a stronger fleet and container manufacturing, especially as the country's exports are forecast to rise in the coming years.

There is a large gap between the domestic fleet and international competitors in both operational and sheer shipping capacity. The largest container ships operated by domestic firms have a capacity of 1,800 TEUs. Meanwhile, some competitors have been operating ships with 20,000 TEUs capacity.

In order to address this issue, the administration has made a number of proposals to the Government which included giving the green light to ship owners to purchase new and bigger ships as early as they see fit. This is part of a national strategy to strengthen the Vietnamese fleet to meet the demand for import/export in the near future. — VNS

HCM CITY — The HCM City People’s Committee plans to establish technical standards to develop a single smart card that could be used for all types of public transport.

The city aims to create inter-linkages between automatic fare collection (AFC) systems as well as convenience for card users.

If metro lines, rapid buses and water buses have many kinds of AFC systems, the cost to interlink these systems would be too high, according to city officials.

The committee has sought clearance from the Ministry of Transport to give the city the authority to decide on the technical standards for all AFC systems in public passenger transport on waterways and roads.

An AFC system is in line with the city’s smart-city project which promotes the use of cashless payments.

In a related issue, the city’s Transport Department is considering investment in an automatic payment system that could be used for all types of public transport.

The city launched a one-year pilot project on the use of cashless payment for public buses in March 2019, and later extended it to the end of this year.

The pilot is expected to encourage more residents to use the bus system. Passengers need to register to get a bus card, which is similar to a bank card.

The cashless payment was first used on bus route No 86 from Bến Thành Market in District 1 to Tôn Đức Thắng University in District 7.

The project is being piloted on a total of eight bus routes instead of 18 bus routes as previously planned. More than 10,300 smart bus cards were issued to passengers by the end of last year.

After preliminary review and evaluation, the city will decide on how to proceed with the project.

The pilot scheme will also be applied to metro lines, rapid buses and boats in the future.

The Việt Nam Thương Tín Commercial Joint Stock Bank (VietBank) and Zion Company received approval to carry out the pilot project, which uses capital from enterprises instead of funds from the city or state budget. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@*Vũ Thanh Ca

In late 2019 and early 2020, China announced its 'Four-Sha' sovereignty claims over the East Sea in two diplomatic notes sent to the UN Secretary-General, aiming to replace the so-called 'nine-dash line' that had been previously rejected by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).



It claimed in the notes that it holds “undeniable sovereignty” over the Dongsha (Pratas Islands), Xisha (Viet Nam’s Hoang Sa (Paracel) Archipelago), Nansha (Viet Nam’s Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago), and Zhongsha (Macclesfield Bank) Archipelagos.



China said those are archipelagos so it can use the straight baselines to define baselines and waters, adding that these groups of islands have archipelagic waters, territorial waters, 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves calculated from the straight baselines.

Contrary to UNCLOS

Let us consider China's claim based on the provisions of international law, especially the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

UNCLOS specifies that only "archipelagic states", made up entirely of one or more archipelagos, can use straight baselines to connect the outer points of the outermost islands and coral reefs of an archipelago with some outstanding conditions as follows:

1. An archipelagic state may draw straight archipelagic baselines joining the outermost points of the outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago provided that within such baselines are included the main islands and an area in which the ratio of the area of the water to the area of the land, including atolls, is between 1 to 1 and 9 to 1.

2. The length of such baselines shall not exceed 100 nautical miles, except that up to 3 per cent of the total number of baselines enclosing any archipelago may exceed that length, up to a maximum length of 125 nautical miles.

In addition, UNCLOS states that: "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.”

We can take a look at the legal regime of the islands cited by China to clearly see the errors in China's claim.

Clearly, China is not an archipelagic state "made up entirely of one or more archipelagoes", so the baseline straightening the archipelago to connect the islands outside the 'Four Shas' is completely contrary to the provisions of UNCLOS.

First, consider Zhong Sha (Macclesfield Bank), a reef with a depth of at least 9.2m. Per UNCLOS, it is not a subject for territorial claims. According to Chatham Academy scholar and journalist Bill Hayton, because there was absolutely no knowledge of the reefs in the South China Sea, in the past, when translating the names of a series of reefs from English into Chinese, the words "bank" or "shoal" were mistakenly translated into island or sandbank. It was this mistake that led China to name Macclesfield Bank as the 'Nansha Archipelago,' and then had its name changed to 'Zhongsha Archipelago' in 1947.

China recently included several shoals, such as Scarborough Shoal and St. Esprit Shoal, into the so-called Zhongsha, he said, stressing that the expansion is not persuasive as these shoals are located quite far from the Macclesfield Bank.

The 2016 PCA ruling clarified UNCLOS’s “fit for living” concept and stated islands in the Spratly Archipelago are only rock islands, meaning they have no exclusive economic zones or continental shelves.

Similarly, the Paracel and the Pratas Islands are rock islands without exclusive economic zones or continental shelves.

Attempt to rewrite UNCLOS

By making the 'Four Sha' claims (Dongsha, Xisha, Nansha, and Zhongsha), China attempted to take advantage of UNCLOS’s terms to rewrite the convention.

Comparing the court's arguments against the islands in the Paracel Islands (under Vietnamese sovereignty), it can be seen these islands with their natural conditions have never before had a stable population community considering it as home; meanwhile, economic activities are purely natural resources exploitation activities; the ratio of land area and water in the archipelago area is much smaller than the ratio of 1:9. Therefore, the islands of the Paracel Islands are only rocky islands and cannot use straight baselines to connect the islands on this archipelago to form archipelagic waters.

The last 'Sha' in the 'Four Shas' - Pratas Islands - is currently controlled by Taiwan (China), and is actually a collection of coral reefs that only protrude from the water surface during ebb tide, except for one coral rock. As such, this cannot be considered an archipelago but only a rock, without an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.

By using this tactic, China attempted to rewrite UNCLOS. Combined with using its military power to harass and its economic power to bribe countries both inside and outside of the East Sea, China wishes to turn its illogical arguments into reality to monopolise the waters.

Such claims were rejected by Việt Nam in its own diplomatic note sent to the UN Secretary-General, in which it affirmed its sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction, and other legitimate rights in the East Sea. Việt Nam also asserted UNCLOS is the only legal basis with comprehensive and thorough regulations on the territorial rights of waters between Việt Nam and China.--VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Governor of the State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV) Nguyễn Thị Hồng has directed commercial banks in the Mekong Delta region to support rice producers and traders to overcome difficulties amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The latest outbreak of the pandemic has negatively affected the paddy and rice supply chain, from production and distribution to consumption and export, especially in the Mekong Delta region.

Under Document No 5747/NHNN-TD issued earlier this week, commercial banks must ensure they fully and promptly meet capital needs and expand credit limits for rice traders so they have enough capital to purchase more paddy and rice, and increase their storage, preservation and processing establishments.

Banks also need to step up reforms and simplify their internal procedures to shorten the loan approval time besides diversifying appropriate credit products and working directly with rice traders and businesses to have effective solutions to overcome difficulties.

However, the SBV noted, the lending must still meet the Government’s current credit rules to ensure legal cash flow management and debt recovery.

It is necessary to continually promote the implementation of credit policies for agricultural and rural development, of which focus is placed on lending to models of chains from paddy and rice production to purchasing, processing, preservation and consumption, according to the SBV.

Banks need to continually implement solutions, such as restructuring repayment terms, keeping the debt group unchanged, exempting and reducing interest and fees for loans, to remove difficulties for COVID-19-affected customers, including rice producers and traders, to help them restore production and business.

They must follow closely the rice market’s developments and lending to purchase and temporarily store paddy and rice in the area to promptly report and propose solutions to the provincial and municipal People's committees during the implementation.

According to Đỗ Hoài Nam, Chairman and General Director of Intimex Group, complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it difficult for rice trading. Rice traders are facing obstacles due to social distancing measures, especially in the stage of loading and unloading, causing big problems for exporters.

Nam underlined the significance of promptly controlling COVID-19 as well as faster vaccinations for workers in food producing and processing companies.

The Việt Nam Food Association also said due to pandemic prevention and control regulations, it is difficult for domestic companies to buy, process and export rice. Meanwhile, the opportunity is high for Việt Nam to increase exports as global demand is rising and supplies are falling, especially from big exporters like India and Thailand.

Rice supply chain faces risk of disruption

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said more than 1.5 million hectares of rice in the Mekong Delta with eight million tonnes are ready for harvest, but there are no traders to buy the grain.

Farmers in the south are unable to sell their produce while consumers are struggling to buy food, a frustrating paradox created by COVID-19 travel restrictions and the closure of both wholesale and retail markets.

The threat of disruption in the supply means prices have fallen by 10-25 per cent from a month ago, or VNĐ500-800 per kilogramme.

However, farmers still cannot sell their rice.

Trần Văn Nam of Cần Thơ City said he has just harvested around 20 tonnes of high-quality rice. Two months before the harvest, a trader came and deposited VNĐ9 million for his rice and agreed to buy at VNĐ6,000 a kilogramme, but since social distancing began and transportation has become very difficult, the trader has opted to forfeit deposit and prices have started to fall relentlessly.

Nguyễn Văn Kiên, a large rice trader in Cần Thơ, said many traders have chosen to forego deposit rather than buy the rice at the committed prices since that would increase their losses.

"In previous years in the summer-autumn rice crop I used to buy 50,000-60,000 tonnes of rice from farmers in Hậu Giang, An Giang, Bạc Liêu, and Kiên Giang provinces, but this year I bought only 5,000 tonnes because I cannot transport it to large markets like HCM City."

He has 100 employees buying rice from throughout the delta, and they all have to carry COVID-19 negative test results that are only valid for three days while the procurement takes them one to two weeks, he said.

The Việt Nam Food Association said since social distancing began, half of the 120 rice enterprises in the delta have suspended operations and the rest have reduced their capacity by half.

To resolve these problems, the Vietnam Food Association calls for the Ministry of Industry and Trade and other related ministries to create favourable conditions for traders to buy and distribute rice by prioritising for vehicles rice transporting the grain and vaccinating workers in the rice and food supply chains.

HÀ NỘI — The Hà Nội People's Committee has issued a plan to provide enough medical oxygen for a scenario in which the number of COVID-19 patients in the city reaches 40,000.

The move aims at ensuring adequate medical oxygen for hospitals and medical facilities under the management of the city's Department of Health (DoH) and using resources in the treatment of patients reasonably, economically, and effectively.

The plan is implemented in three phases, responding to scenarios in which the number of COVID-19 patients hits 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000, respectively.

The patients are classified in line with the severity of the disease based on the Ministry of Health's guidance. They are asymptomatic patients with mild (83.6 per cent) and moderate levels (7 per cent), severe patients needing oxygen (3.8 per cent) and very severe patients needing invasive and non-invasive ventilation (3.6 per cent), and critical patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) intervention (2 per cent).

Therefore, there will be 3,120 patients requiring medical oxygen (9.4 per cent) if the number of coronavirus infections is up to 40,000.

The treatment facilities will be divided in accordance with the disease severity. There will be establishments that care for moderate patients, severe and critical patients requiring intensive care treatment as well as those that treat mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.

To carry out the plan effectively, it is necessary to involve the entire political system, relevant departments, agencies, and units. There should be close coordination between forces to assure the capacity to store medical oxygen, supply and transport of the oxygen to the hospitals and medical facilities under the management of the DoH. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The liquidity of the banking system has risen recently, helping cool interbank interest rates.

According to the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), the average overnight interest rate in the trading session ending last week was only 0.92 per cent per year, against 1.21 per cent in May. The rate for one-week loans was 1.16 per cent, compared with 1.35 per cent in May.

The good liquidity was thanks to a large amount of money the SBV pumped into the market through the purchase of US dollars from commercial banks.

In a recent money market report, Saigon Securities Incorporation (SSI) reported about 75 per cent of foreign currency sales contracts have expired to date this year and the remaining contracts will expire in August. Accordingly, the SBV will have to pump about VNĐ157 trillion into the market to buy foreign currency.

According to SSI's estimates, commercial banks sold a foreign currency amount of nearly US$7 billion with a 6-month term to the SBV at the beginning of this year.

A recent report of Vietcombank Securities Company (VCBS) also stated that the liquidity of the banking system in this period is expected to be more abundant than in the previous quarter when the SBV purchases the dollars following the expiry date of foreign currency contracts.

According to VCBS, the bright spot at this time continues to come from the fact that capital flows choose Việt Nam as an investment destination with the registered and disbursed FDI capital still on an increasing trend.

The Government’s target of stabilising inflation is being met, and there is still room for controlling inflation.

These factors would help increase interbank liquidity, thereby bringing interest rates down again in August, VCBS said.

While the liquidity of the banking system is abundant, lending is showing signs of slowing down due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many cities and provinces having to implement social distancing measures.

According to a report of the SBV’s HCM City branch, credit last month only increased by about 0.56 per cent compared to the previous month. The average credit increase in the previous months was more than 1 per cent. The city's total outstanding loans at the end of July was estimated at VNĐ2.69 quadrillion, up 6.2 per cent compared to the end of 2020.

The deposit growth at the city’s banks in the period also showed signs of slowing. The total mobilised capital of banks in the city at the end of July was estimated at more than VNĐ3.02 quadrillion, up only 0.5 per cent compared to the previous month and 4 per cent compared to the end of 2020.

As the latest outbreak of COVID-19 is causing many difficulties for production and business, SSI believes the SBV would continue to maintain the current monetary policy in the direction of supporting growth and firms.

“The monetary policy might be continually loosened if the pandemic becomes more complicated and lasts longer than expected,” SSI noted. — VNS

HCM CITY — Many HCM City businesses, even small traders in traditional markets who are not usually thought to be tech-savvy, have been focusing on selling online and networking to survive, or even thriving, amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Sellers in traditional markets are networking with "other businesses" to survive the pandemic. Trần Xuân Trang, who owns a stall in Bến Thành Market in District 1, said she is preparing for the Mid-Autumn festival in September and working with business partners who can deliver goods to customers.

A trader at the Hóc Môn Wholesale Market, which remains closed, has been selling a steady amount of pork daily to regular buyers online.

Traders are making use of social media to advertise their goods.

Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Hà, deputy head of management of District 5’s An Đông Market, said while the market has been closed, it has been helping its tenants sell online by creating a webpage and helping them connect with social media groups.

More and more traditional markets are helping their traders similarly.

Exports

Some small traders are even looking into exporting.

Ngô Bích Lài, owner of a stall at An Đông Market, told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper that she has been exporting products such as coffee and bird’s nest to China and Singapore by networking with export companies and social media groups for overseas Vietnamese.

Others are in contact with foreign visitors who had bought from them when they visited Việt Nam.

Large businesses are using the pandemic to restructure their operations.

A rice supply business even created a mobile application last November for online sales. It is now supplying dozens of tonnes of rice every month in HCM City.

Trần Văn Trường, director of Royal Seafood Company, said his company has nine stores with staff living on-site focusing on online selling. While the sales are admittedly not as high as before, they are also supplying and delivering cooked meals to customers.

Trương Chí Thiện, director of egg supplier Vĩnh Thành Đạt Company, said the pandemic has provided a great opportunity to set up an online channel for selling eggs and move away from focusing solely on direct selling.

HCM City is the country's current and largest COVID epicentre of the country with more than 135,000 cases by yesterday morning since the fourth outbreak began in late April. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s NanoDragon satellite was delivered to Japan on August 11 ahead of its planned launch into space, according to the Việt Nam National Space Centre (VNSC) under the Việt Nam Academy of Science and Technology.

The centre said the satellite would be transferred to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The NanoDragon satellite (NDG), a nano-layer CubeSat satellite which weighs 3.8kg, was developed by the VNSC. It is expected to be launched into orbit from the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture in the fiscal year 2021 (to March 2022) of Japan.

The satellite is the product of a project to design, manufacture, launch and test operation of a nano-sized microsatellite under the national space science and technology programme in the 2016-2020 period.

The process of researching, designing, integrating, and testing the satellite's functions was carried out completely in Việt Nam by VNSC researchers.

The satellite was developed with the purpose of demonstrating it could use micro-satellite beam technology to receive the Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal to track and monitor activities at sea.

The centre said after the manufacturing, integration and functional testing were conducted in Việt Nam between March 9-April 9, the satellite has passed pre-launch environmental testing at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan.

Along with the satellite development process, a ground station to operate the satellite after its launch has been installed and is ready for operation at the VNSC in the Hoà Lạc Hi-Tech Park in Hà Nội.

Previously, the VNSC also successfully developed the 1kg microsatellite PicoDragon, and the 50-kg satellite MicroDragon, which were launched into orbit in 2013 and 2019, respectively. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Exports of Vietnamese agricultural products via border gates to China are facing numerous difficulties. Ministries, localities and branches from the two countries are urged to make greater efforts in facilitating the clearance of these products, senior officials have said.

Online newspaper congthuong.vn cited Lương Trọng Quỳnh, vice chairman of the Lạng Sơn People's Committee, as saying that China examined all of Viet Nam's fruit shipments to the country. That would result in longer customs clearance time for Vietnamese fruit than those of other countries.

China had also strengthened the application of standards on origin and label quarantine while strictly controlling quality standards and food hygiene and safety for farm produce and fresh fruit and vegetables imported from Việt Nam. Meanwhile, many fruits of Việt Nam such as passion fruit, durian and custard apple were yet to be permitted for export to China, Quỳnh said.

Most businesses had failed to learn the latest information on Chinese export conditions such as those in quarantine and traceability, so they had encountered numerous difficulties in customs clearance. Therefore, localities that shared border gates with China petitioned ministries and branches to offer local businesses effective guidance in production so that their goods would meet requirements from the neighbouring country and customs clearance for these products would be faster, he said.

According to Đỗ Văn Duy, Director of Lào Cai Province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the province exported 760,000 tonnes of agricultural products via border gates to China for US$690 million over the past seven months of 2021. In which, dragon fruit saw the highest export value with $444 million, followed by mango with $120 million and watermelon with $28 million.

Despite these encouraging figures, import-export activities with China through the province’s border gates faced certain difficulties. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only Chinese drivers were allowed by the Chinese side to transport goods. That caused difficulties in trade activities via the province’s two international border gates, resulting in modest transport productivity and slow clearance of goods, Duy told a virtual conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) this week.

In order to better facilitate exports of agricultural products, the province had arranged officers responsible for issuing certificates of origin for export enterprises at the two border gates, Duy said, adding that it had also contacted the authorities of some Chinese localities to inform them about the pandemic situation in Việt Nam and disease prevention measures that Việt Nam had implemented. Meanwhile, it also suggested the Chinese localities remove difficulties for the clearance of fruit, including dragon fruit, through the Lào Cai-Hà Khẩu International Border Gate.

Duy also petitioned MARD to regularly update and notify local businesses of China's regulations on labels, traceability, planting area instructions, quarantine and testing, as well as embracing and building trademarks for Vietnamese agricultural products thus facilitating the long-term and stable exports of goods to foreign countries.

The ministry should also set up an agency that would be responsible for regulating local agricultural products, because, during the harvest season, agricultural products were transported in large amounts to border gates. If not regulated, they would suffer congestion. The establishment of the agency would help prevent agricultural products from damage or price pressure from Chinese traders, he said.

Trần Quốc Toản, Deputy Director of the Import-Export Department under Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) agreed. He urged MARD to closely monitor major growing areas and promptly coordinate with relevant agencies to regulate the volume of agricultural products transported to border gates in accordance with conditions and capacity in goods clearance of each border gate.

Also, the ministry should ask relevant agencies to guide farmers, traders and businesses on how to classify, pack and preserve farm produce appropriately to meet requests from Chinese traders, Toản said.

In his speech at the event, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phùng Đức Tiến called on closer co-ordination among relevant Chinese agencies with localities sharing border gates with China, ministries and sectors of Việt Nam in removing difficulties and facilitating the clearance of Vietnamese goods to China amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

China had issued a lot of new regulations on food safety, traceability, plant quarantine and animal quarantine. Thus, provinces that had good relations with Chinese localities should team up with the MoIT and MARD to disseminate these regulations to provinces, cities, businesses, associations, and farmers in a timely manner so that goods transported to border gates could enjoy smooth customs clearance, Tiến noted.

According to MARD, the country's export of agro-forestry-fisheries products increased by 26.7 per cent year-on-year in the seven-month period, topping $28.6 billion. During the period, China was the second-largest importer of Việt Nam's agricultural goods with a growth rate of about 36.5 per cent over the same period last year.— VNS

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam exported US$9.58 billion worth of wood and wood products in the first seven months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 55 per cent, according to the General Department of Customs.

Of the figure, wood products raked in $7.44 billion, posting a 64-per cent rise compared with the same period last year.

Local experts contributed the impressive growth to increasing demand for furniture during the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to Điền Quang Hiệp chairman of Bình Dương Furniture Association (BIFA), shipments to the main export markets of the Bình Dương wood processing industry rose considerably.

The US market accounted for more than 65 per cent of Bình Dương's total export turnover, with an increase of 81 per cent over the same period last year, while Hong Kong (China) made up 8.5 per cent, with an increase of more than 47 per cent, and Taiwan (China) picked up 43 per cent.

A similar situation is also reported in the central province of Bình Định.

Ngô Văn Tống, director of Bình Định Department of Industry and Trade, said local wood products had been exported to countries in Europe, Oceania, America, Asia, and Africa. The province’s furniture exporters had received orders until the end of the third quarter of this year.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many difficulties for trade and transportation activities, resulting in changes in work and lifestyles, with consumers purchasing more furniture to work from home. Thus, Hiệp said, the province's export turnover of living room and dining room furniture was forecast to rise rapidly.

To be able to meet the orders of wood products, wood processing enterprises in Bình Dương had quickly adapted and changed their production methods accordingly, he said, adding that some businesses were renting more land to open factories.

Bùi Chính Nghĩa, deputy general director of the Việt Nam Administration of Forestry (VNFOREST) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, said along with the US, Japan, and Hong Kong (China) markets, Việt Nam’s export turnover of wood and wood products to the European market would increase sharply in the last months of 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic is brought under control and prevention measures are gradually eased.

Although Việt Nam's wood processing and export industry has gained momentum given the whole country is coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges still lie ahead.

According to Nguyễn Liêm, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Lâm Việt Company in Bình Dương Province, the high growth in export value of the wood industry in the past two years contains potential risks because the US would increase defensive measures for imports with sudden growth.

Therefore, enterprises that export furniture for living and dining rooms should be careful to avoid becoming a transit point for goods to a third country, he said, adding that if the US imposes sanctions on Việt Nam's wood industry, the whole sector would be seriously affected.

Another problem for the sector is the lack of empty containers for shipments, which has pushed transport costs up by twice, three times and even 10 times in the past two to three years. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Insights from Indochina Capital consultants

Categorised as a global pandemic, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is having a drastic impact on all nations across the globe. From flight cancellations, travel restrictions, conferences and business gatherings being delayed, to millions of workers encouraged to work from home or stay at home, COVID-19 is affecting global supply chains and financial markets around the world.

Over the last couple of weeks, the situation has become more and more distressing with the rise in confirmed cases in Vietnam. The outbreak’s effect on the local real estate market has been significant. The hardest hit sectors, where immediate impacts can be observed, are hotels, retail, entertainment venues and other tourism-related assets.

With the near complete shutdown of international and local travel, occupancy rates at hotels have plummeted. Hotel owners and developers have had to make the hard decision of letting staff go, or worse shutting down their properties for the foreseeable future. The highly anticipated Vietnam Grand Prix has been postponed indefinitely. Hanoi and Saigon have shut down all public entertainment places and the tourism industry has lost billions of dollars in January and February alone.

In retail, the rise of social distancing has been devastating for consumption. With the sight of empty malls and shopping centers, most tenants have asked for rent reductions up to 50% during the outbreak, which will in turn put pressure on owners and landlords who will have to balance the livelihood of their businesses and morale during these turbulent times. Similar to the hospitality segment, where prices are being slashed by the day, companies who develop long-term strategies to transform the sector will benefit greatly further down the line, allowing them to recover from the detrimental effects of the virus outbreak.

Residential real estate is seeing a short-term negative impact as travel bans are preventing buyers from visiting and closing deals, especially as China, South Korea and Japan account for a large proportion of international demand in Vietnam’s residential sector. New projects are also not being launched to avoid social gatherings and the increased risk of infection. Nonetheless, compared to competitors in the region, Vietnam still has one of the highest rental yields and lowest real estate prices. Thus, we can expect interest from foreign buyers to remain high – they are only suspending their investment plans in response to travel bans and focusing on their own well-being amid COVID-19. In the long-run, we can expect to see local and international demand return to their previous levels.

In the industrial segment, the outbreak is disrupting the global supply chain, hence slowing down the growth of this sector; however, it is likely that the outbreak will push international manufacturers to diversify their production and supplier bases. Once the spread of the virus slows, the logistics industry in Vietnam will continue to be highly desirable due to geopolitical factors, lower labor costs and new foreign trade agreements, which will help Vietnam attract foreign investors looking to set up plants outside of China. Samsung has already moved part of its production to Vietnam and stringent containment efforts in the country have allowed companies to keep local plants open and under operation. As a result of COVID-19, health and safety procedures at factories and workplaces will progressively become a competitive advantage as production cannot be carried out remotely.

Instead of the previous wait-and-see approaches or halting of activities until the end of the outbreak, real estate companies need to prepare action plans as soon as possible, including prompt measures to curb the temporary effects of COVID-19, and longer term strategies to reduce its potential prolonged negative effects on the entire market.

In the short-term, operators, retailers and owners should sit down to review fixed costs. Reducing service offering and shutting down parts of their facilities are ways to save energy and reduce workload on their personnel. Flexibility, including remote working and effective rotation plans for staff, could help companies maintain operational continuity while securing income to all employees. This will be key in the short term as events take unpredictable turns every day.

In the longer term, companies should review budgeting and financial expectations for the next 12-24 months, as well as break down their customers into segments to forecast expected decreases in demand for each segment. Shopping centers must adapt to provide multichannel options that could help boost future visits and ensure business stability if another epidemic were to trigger travel restrictions.

With recent developments of the COVID-19, it is safe to say that it will leave the global economy and Vietnam real estate market with significant near-term damage. Current drastic prevention and precautionary measures are unprecedented, and though we cannot fully estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the market, its initial effects on the market have been troubling. It is an imperative for companies to stay proactive and act promptly, staying flexible in the short term while coming up with strategies to transform their sector and reduce prolonged repercussions should a similar event occur again. Opportunity arises during dark times, and companies that innovate and plan accordingly are those who will come out on top when we return to normalcy.

KABUL — The Taliban were on the brink of total victory in Afghanistan on Sunday, with their fighters ordered to wait on the outskirts of the capital and the government conceding it was preparing for a "transfer of power".

Militants surrounded Kabul following an astonishingly quick rout of government forces in recent days, with troops incapable of holding onto territory without US military support.

The fall of Kabul will see the hardline Islamic group take back power two decades after US-led forces toppled it in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

"The Islamic Emirate instructs all its forces to stand at the gates of Kabul, not to try to enter the city," a spokesman for the Taliban tweeted as residents reported insurgents on the outskirts of the city.

"Until the completion of the transition process, the responsibility for the security of Kabul is with the other side (the Afghan government)".

The United States began moving its citizens and Afghan staff to Kabul airport, with the help of thousands of troops deployed to the capital to assist with the evacuation.

The Taliban's imminent takeover triggered fear and panic in Kabul among residents fearful of the group's hardline brand of Islam.

The Afghan government signalled earlier there were negotiations underway to avoid bloodshed in Kabul, and to hand power to the Taliban.

"The Afghan people should not worry... there will be no attack on the city and there will be a peaceful transfer of power to the transitional government," Interior Minister Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal said in a recorded speech.

Afghan President left the country

President Ashraf Ghani -- who is widely expected to resign – is said to have left the country on Sunday, hours after the Taliban ordered its fighters to wait on the outskirts of the capital following an astonishing rout of government forces.

"The former Afghan president has left the nation," Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the peace process, said in a video on his Facebook page.

Earlier Ghani in a video message released to media urged what remains of his security forces to maintain law and order.

There are fears of a security vacuum in the capital as thousands of police and other armed services members have abandoned their posts, uniforms and even weapons.

"It is our responsibility and we will do it in the best possible manner," Ghani said, hours after the Taliban seized two nearby prisons and released thousands of inmates.

Suhail Shaheen, based in Qatar as part of the Taliban's negotiating team, said the group wants a swift takeover.

"In next few days, we want a peaceful transfer," he told the BBC.

Evacuations

The scale and speed of the insurgents' advance have shocked Afghans and the US-led alliance that poured billions into the country over the past two decades.

President Joe Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 1,000 US troops to help secure the emergency evacuation from Kabul of embassy employees and thousands of Afghans who worked for American forces and now fear Taliban reprisals.

That was on top of the 3,000 American soldiers deployed in recent days, and 1,000 left in-country after Biden announced in May that the final withdrawal of the US military presence in Afghanistan would be completed by September 11.

That decision has come under increased scrutiny given the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, but he insisted Saturday there was no choice.

"I was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan -- two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth," Biden said.

Ghani's government was left completely isolated on Sunday after the insurgents overran the anti-Taliban northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif and the eastern city of Jalalabad.

Like with most of the other captured cities, the seizure of power came after government forces surrendered or retreated.

Videos posted on pro-Taliban social media accounts showed the group's heavily armed fighters in cities across the country, waving white flags and greeting locals.

Most of the fighters appeared young, suggesting they were most likely infants or unborn when the Taliban was toppled from power in 2001. AFP

By Minh Hương

HÀ NỘI — Social distancing due to COVID-19 has created more local stock investors in Việt Nam, especially among internet-savvy young people.

According to data, there were 619,911 new accounts opened in the first six months of the year, an increase of 58 per cent compared to the first six months of 2020, which also registered a record number of new accounts.

As a freelance photographer, Nguyễn Quang Anh, 24, in Liễu Giai Street, Hà Nội did not have a lot of work even before the social distancing orders were put in place.

Anh said the boredom of having to stay at home because of the social distancing order and fewer working opportunities led him to invest in the stock market with some investment-friendly and user-friendly applications.

Anh told Việt Nam News: "Being hit by the fourth wave of COVID-19 and with everything digitised, it is a good time to focus on investing. It is one of the few activities we can do when we must stay at home.”

With more money, Lê Tuấn Phong, 28, in Láng Hạ Street chooses to invest in stocks and ETFs listed on the HCM City Stock Exchange (HoSE) via a prestige open fund.

Phong said a good fund would help him make bigger profits, however, he also wanted to invest by himself.

Phong told Việt Nam News: "It is not difficult to find information on social networks through financial investment groups and securities and digital currencies," adding the majority of investors were his age.

There are groups with hundreds of thousands of people, who update content and operate live streaming investment channels, sharing financial knowledge, and attracting a lot of followers.

Since last year, the number of investors on mobile apps has increased sharply. Local investment apps specializing in investments and stocks like Finhay and Infina are attractive to young investors.

Recently, Infina, announced an oversubscribed US$2 million seed round from Saison Capital, Venturra Discovery, 1982 Ventures, 500 Startups, Nextrans, and angel investors like executives at Google and Netflix.

Launched in January 2021, the app serves the investment demands of users between the ages of 25 and 40 with a minimum contribution of $25. Those investors can choose from assets including savings accounts, term deposits, fractionalized real estate and mutual funds.

At the launch of the app, the firm said only about 3.2 per cent of people in Vietnam had invested in stocks. That rate had increased thanks to a high internet penetration rate of more than 70 per cent.

Experts in the market said that the growth was largely contributed to the technology which allows investors to open an account online.

According to Dragon Capital Vietnam, a number of open-ended fund investors under the age of 35 on digital channels account for approximately 60 per cent of the total number of investors in Viet Nam.

The fund calculated that their average investment amount was surprisingly high compared to the average income in Việt Nam, at VNĐ18 million ($782) per month.

They said the trend of investing through mobile technology will play a more dominant role in the market moving forward.

As a long-standing fund management company in Việt Nam with more than $5 billion in assets under its management, Dragon Capital Vietnam sees the future for investors in technology platforms.

On July 26 it introduced the DragonX investment application to the market, which is seen as a breakthrough for investment fund management in Vietnam. Together with the launch of DragonX, the fund also adjusted the minimum investment required to only VNĐ100,000 while completely waiving the purchase fee to attract more investors.

DragonX provides users with investment knowledge in an easy to understand way through posts, daily newsletters and investment videos from the firm’s team of experts.

Trần Thanh Tân, vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dragon Capital Vietnam told local media: "I believe that a country's financial market can only develop strongly if there are a large number of local investors. DragonX is our way to bring people closer to good investment opportunities in the Vietnamese financial market.

Beware of tricks

Nguyễn Thế Truyền, director of Thiên Thanh Law Partnership, the City Bar Association, Hà Nôị said with the internet environment, people can transact easily and some of them were too eager to pour their money into apps with the dream of "becoming a billionaire".

In April more than 1,800 people in HCM City were cheated of millions of US dollars by an investment platform app called Coolcat, which announced itself as an insurance investment firm with more than five years of experience headquartered in the UK. It then vanished taking with it all of the money of the app users in the city.

Truyền said being at home for long periods of time, people often find new things to try however investment is not easy. A 'quick money' mindset could lead them to be drawn into using fraudulent apps.

In early July, the leader of the State Securities Commission of Vietnam (SSC) announced despite COVID-19's complicated development, the local indexes continued to set new records, helping the stock market enjoy the second fastest growth rate in the world. — VNS

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ambassador Denny Abdi writes to Việt Nam News on the 76th anniversary of the Independence Day of Indonesia (August 17).

On August 17, 1945, Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta, the founding fathers of Indonesia, proclaimed Indonesia's independence on behalf of all Indonesian people. The determination for independence among Indonesians was a result of hundred years of colonisation.

Nonetheless, the proclamation of independence was only a start for building a nation. The struggle continues as Indonesia develops its more than 17,000 islands with diverse ethnic groups. The country has endured political turmoil and economic downturn tests and is now the third-largest democracy with prospective economic growth.

The journey is never easy, but we are thankful that Indonesia can achieve its position and prestige in the global arena today.

This year marks the 76th anniversary of hard-earned independence. The theme for the celebration is "Indonesia Tangguh, Indonesia Tumbuh" (A Resilient Indonesia; A Growing Indonesia).

Before the pandemic, August used to be all about carnival and popular games like balap karung (sack race) or makan kerupuk (eating crackers). During these festivities, people get together in a patriotic spirit and rejoice in happiness.

The celebrations now move to the digital platform through the Indonesian Digital House. Furthermore, the flag-hoisting ceremony will be conducted with limited attendance and participated by the public virtually.

As 2020 was a challenging year, the pandemic has also offered valuable lessons on the importance of global cooperation to promote health infrastructure and governance, economic resilience, multilateralism, and setting aside rivalries.

Now is the time to promote unity and cooperation. No one, no country should be left behind. Because during this global pandemic, no one is safe until everyone is safe.

That is why Indonesia is keen on conducting vaccine diplomacy. Our vaccine diplomacy is not only aimed at securing vaccine provision for domestic use but also paving the way for equal access to vaccines for all nations.

Overview of Indonesia – Việt Nam Relations

The traditional relations between Indonesia and Việt Nam were built on shared feelings and determination to fight colonisation for independence. The historic reciprocal visits of the renowned leaders, President Hồ Chí Minh and President Soekarno, in 1959 were a testament to the closeness of both countries.

Ambassador Denny Abdi meets with Minister of Industry and Trade, June 22, 2021. Courtesy Photo of the embassy

Nowadays, our friendly ties are positively manifested in the closeness of our leaders. For example, President Joko Widodo hosted Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính at the Bogor Palace in April 2021. Later, in July, President Widodo held a telephone conversation with President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc affirming both leaders' commitment to strengthen relations further.

Indonesia and Việt Nam are among the strongest and fastest-growing economies in the region. Both countries' economy represents 45 per cent of the ASEAN economy. Moreover, Indonesia and Việt Nam are home to around 60 per cent of people in ASEAN. With the increasing purchasing power in both countries, we can imagine the future of these two countries as the engine of growth of our region.

With this potential, Việt Nam and Indonesia carry a promising future for cooperation that can bring more benefit. Việt Nam is Indonesia's fourth largest economic partner in ASEAN and ranked ninth as Indonesia's biggest export destination globally.

In terms of investment, Indonesia was among the first countries to invest in Việt Nam after the Đổi Mới policy in 1986. Despite the pandemic, the total bilateral trade in 2020 was US$8.2 billion. To achieve the targeted bilateral trade of US$10 billion, we need to boost potential cooperation, such as strengthening industrialization based on research and innovation, developing our digital economy, and enhancing fisheries cooperation.

I am impressed by how Việt Nam is determined to build its automotive industry. The birth of VinFast as the first "Made in Việt Nam" car is the nation's pride. It is also important to note that the company focused on acquiring the technology from other countries and building its cars with a Vietnamese touch.

In Indonesia, the digital economy is the fastest growing industry. Google, Temasek, Bain & Company has projected the value of Indonesia's digital economy transactions to reach US$124 billion by 2025. Bukalapak, an Indonesian tech-unicorn, recently recorded the country's biggest initial public offering ever. The company helps millions of Indonesia's mom-and-pop kiosks ("warung") to get online.

I believe that collaboration in developing the digital economy ecosystem will benefit both Indonesia and Việt Nam.

Indonesia and Việt Nam also hold great potential in fisheries cooperation as both are blessed with rich marine resources. The two nations shall promote collaboration in producing key seafood products to become ASEAN contributors to the world's food supply. Moreover, stakeholders from both countries can also learn from each other to enhance their capability in developing sustainable aquaculture and seafood processing industries.

In facing the pandemic and future challenges, Indonesia and Việt Nam must continue working closely together. With deepened collaboration, I am confident that the two countries will reach their utmost potentials and become the drivers of growth in ASEAN. VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@HÀ NỘI — HDI Global SE and International Finance Corporation have entered into a strategic partnership to help strengthen PVI Holdings into a leading insurance company in Việt Nam and Southeast Asia.

HDI has sold a 6.29 per cent stake in PVI Holdings to IFC.

Together, they own more than 51 per cent, and own more than 54 per cent of voting rights.

IFC joins PVI Holdings as an additional long-term anchor investor alongside HDI Global and Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PVN), who remain major shareholders.

HDI Global and IFC, including two investment funds managed by the IFC Asset Management Company – IFC Emerging Asia Fund and IFC Financial Institutions Growth Fund -- intend to join forces and improve PVI Group's corporate governance, risk management and compliance policies, aligning them with international best practices.

They also intend to consolidate PVI's position as the leading provider of insurance solutions in Vietnam’s commercial and industrial sectors and drive its expansion into Southeast Asia.

Besides, they seek to expand its status as a leading provider of non-life insurance products.

Long-term commitment

Following the sale of the shares to IFC, HDI Global will continue to remain the biggest shareholder in PVI Holdings with 45.9 per cent of the charter capital and 48.1 per cent of voting rights.

It intends to retain the investment and achieve majority shareholding over the long term.

Việt Nam is part of the emerging economic regions in Southeast Asia.

Through its shareholding in PVI Holdings, HDI Global is one of the leading property insurers in the region, and hopes to expand its dominance.

Since its purchase of stakes in PVI Holdings, HDI Global has played a significant role in supporting the regional expansion of the company with management know-how.

As a result, the insurer has created a large number of jobs for highly qualified people in Việt Nam.

IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in developing countries.

IFC Asset Management Company, one of its divisions, mobilises and manages capital for investment in businesses in developing and frontier markets.

As an industrial lines insurer, HDI Global SE meets the needs of SMEs, industrial companies and corporate customers with insurance solutions that are specifically tailored to their requirements.

In addition to its prominent position in the German and European markets, the company also has operations in more than 150 countries through foreign branch offices, subsidiary and peer companies and network partners.

It is thus able to offer its customers local policies for their global operations, which ensure that the established service and insurance protection is extended for all covered risks worldwide.

HDI Global SE is a company under the Industrial Lines Division of the Talanx Group. The rating agency Standard & Poor’s has given the Talanx Primary Group a financial strength rating of A+/stable (strong). Talanx AG is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Ex-change in the SDA.

The 3,700 employees in this division generated gross written premiums of 6.7 billion euros in 2020.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Core value and core technology will help start-ups to grow sustainably. — File Photo

HÀ NỘI — Core value and core technology are important factors for start-ups to scale-up quickly and develop sustainably, experts have said.

According to the CEO of Le Group of Companies Lê Quốc Vinh, the model of burning-cash to scale-up is no longer appropriate and proved to have weaknesses in the context of the pandemic.

For a start-up, a key problem is choosing which way to go in developing business strategies: burning-cash to scale-up to seize market opportunities or to go the long way towards sustainable development, Vinh said.

Bùi Thành Đô, Founder and CEO of Thinkzone Ventures, said that the investment trend in start-ups was changing in recent years, adding that a number of start-ups were focusing more on core value and core technology.

Still, start-up firms must choose models of rapid growth which is critical to attract venture capital funds, he said, adding that venture capital funds often eye companies that could potentially expand by at least 20 times over four to five years because the initial scale of start-ups was often very small.

He said that ThinkZone was now investing in a taxi operation platform which was developing core technology to connect 110 taxi companies. This platform never scaled-up too fast an its revenue remained modest.

However, Đô said that start-up firms could develop rapidly and sustainably at the same time if they had core value and technology to help solve big problems for large markets.

According to Nguyễn Chí Thanh, deputy director general of Viettel Telecom, a key partner of the national digital transformation competition for start-ups Viet Solutions, after two years the competition received more than 600 applications, about 10 per cent of which had cooperation with Viettel to provide services to more than 120 million customers in countries which Viettel had invested in.

Thanh said that start-up companies which cooperated with Viettel after Viet Solutions were not prominent in the media, but were sustainable.

"Start-ups today tend to be more cautious and choose sustainable development models, while focusing on core value to create different values, not following market trends," he said.

Thanh said that start-ups could still scale fast if they could grasp market opportunities, then focus on developing sustainably later, adding that burning-cash to scale-up was a risky model, especially when there were market fluctuations.

To survive and succeed, start-ups should determine what their core strengths were and focus on doing well with core value, he said. Start-ups which lacked market experience should choose investors who already had market share for cooperation to develop quickly and effectively.

"Start-ups need to identify what the market, society and economy needs to place focus on," he said. — VNS

MEKONG DELTA - Shrimp businesses in the Mekong Delta, the country’s main producer and exporter of the crustacean, have been able to sustain both despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cà Mau City has the largest number of shrimp processing and exporting businesses in the delta.

Nguyễn Thành Phương, head of the city’s Economy Department, said 14 businesses had registered to have more than 6,000 employees living on their premises to continue with production, with some large businesses even renting hotels and kindergartens for accommodation.

In Bạc Liêu Province, seafood processing businesses have huge payrolls and so arranging accommodation is more challenging, according to Phan Văn Sáu, director of the province Department of Industry and Trade.

But with the pandemic under control, the province only seeks to ensure businesses comply with all preventive measures, and so the number of on-site staff at a given time has been declining.

If the pandemic worsens, local authorities would consider temporarily closing businesses that could not comply with safety regulations, he said.

According to many delta provinces, the prices of raw shrimp have been fluctuating, dropping by up to VNĐ10,000 (US$0.43) per kilogramme at the start of August when provinces extended social distancing.

Amid the pandemic, harvesting, trading and transportation of products have been affected, processing plants have had to cut down on worker numbers, which has caused output to fall, and containers are often stuck at ports and inspection checkpoints.

Nevertheless, the country’s shrimp exports in the first seven months of the year increased by 15.5 per cent year-on-year to around 240,000 tonnes.

Revenues grew by 16 per cent to US$2.19 billion.

Export to the US, Japan and the EU grew sharply.

According to the Việt Nam Industry and Trade Information Centre, global demand for shrimp is on the rise, especially in large markets.

With supply from other countries taking a hit from the pandemic, Việt Nam’s exports in the next few months are likely to rise enormously due to the numerous free trade agreements it has and its production remaining steady.

Shrimp exports from delta provinces will remain abundant due to the many sales contracts businesses there have signed, but rising transport costs and potential COVID-related complications remain major challenges, according to many provinces.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Businesses are demontrating their civic role in joining the fight against the coronavirus pandemic to keep people safe.

The HCM City public hospital system is facing overloads due to a surge in infections which reached more than 100,000 in the past 60 days. Meanwhile, people and businesses face problems in food and supply distribution due to the impact of COVID-19.

The pandemic also shows the profound connection between social development and businesses. This pandemic reminds businesses to pay close attention to activities that bring value to the community. Therefore, it is an opportunity for brands to take action and place a reliable label in people’s hearts and minds day by day.

In cooperation with the authorities, many businesses voluntarily donated property such as land, buildings and factories for the construction of field hospitals. Other businesses donated food, medicine, medical equipment, and ambulances to support the frontline forces against the pandemic. Many people also volunteered to help repel this pandemic.

Private healthcare providers were among the many that took prompt action in sharing their duty with the medical system in treating COVID-19 patients and alleviate the stress on public hospitals. Hoan My Thu Duc International General Hospital proposed to HCM City Health Department to convert the entire function of the hospital to a COVID-19 treatment centre. After officially announced as a COVID-19 treatment centre, Hoan My Thu Duc COVID-19 treatment hospital has 100 beds in the first phase and the number of beds will be increased to 200 in the second phase. Helping on the frontline were more than 3,000 volunteers including doctors, nurses, and medical staff working at Hoan My system’s 15 hospitals and six clinics. This is a campaign organised by Hoan My, called “One Hoan My – Millions of trust” to treat COVID-19 patients in their newly converted hospital.

The community has highly appreciated this timely contribution which helps relieve the pressure in this unwanted situation. The board of directors of Hoan My Medical Corporation said: “Hoan My is not an outsider in this battle even though our businesses were impacted greatly by the pandemic. We need to take action to help the medical system overcome those difficulties.”

Wholehearted care for people

From Hoan My’s perspective, the core foundation leading to those activities’ success is sincerity and resolve in their responsibilities despite hardship. One of the approaches is to promote the connection and co-operation among businesses, between businesses and social organisations, enterprises and the authorities.

Ph.D, M.D, Nguyen Tuan, CEO of Hoan My Thu Duc International General Hospital, said: “To finish this construction as soon as possible, we had to rapidly convert the function of Hoan My Thu Duc Hospital into a place that meets the requirements for COVID-19 treatment. All medical equipment needed for treatment was also furnished within a week. Hoan My’s doctors, nurses, and medical staff are all willing to join the battle to repel the pandemic with the spirit ‘One Hoan My - Millions of trust’. Despite the emerging challenges for us, I believe in our strength and the competence that would help us beat the pandemic. And the happiness will come to us.”

Nguyen Anh Duc, living in Binh Tan district, said: “The images of doctors, nurses and medical staff suffering from exhaustion after a long day working non-stop has brought a grateful feeling in our hearts. The pandemic has pushed them to the limit of health and endurance. Even then, they still manage and overcome it to keep people safe. They are our heroes in white blouses.”

HCM City People’s Committee Chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong praised the timely support of Hoan My Medical Corporation. He said: “Although several shortcomings occur, the operation of the hospital has gone well, especially in patient admission. This comes from the high determination and great efforts of Hoan My’s doctors and medical staff. The core value of Hoan My has been vividly re-affirmed as “One Hoan My – Millions of trust.”

"The success of Social Responsibility (CSR) and Social Value Sharing (CSV) activities will make a positive impact on society and push the development of the business. Research from Edelman stated that when hit by a crisis, a brand name that focuses on their customers’ profit would never be delayed on the path to success. So, COVID-19 is considered an opportunity for better development of businesses. Otherwise, those who only pay attention to their own benefits would be boycotted and sink into oblivion permanently.”

HCM CITY — Supply chains in HCM City and the southern provinces are at great risk of snapping because many businesses have been forced to stop operating or sharply reduce production to comply with the COVID-19 prevention regime.

According to the Ministry of Planning and Investment, in July the city’s index of industrial production (IIP) dropped by nearly 20 per cent, Long An Province’s by 14.5 per cent and Cà Mau Province’s by 13.7 per cent.

Đồng Tháp, Trà Vinh and Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu all saw declines of 2-6 per cent.

The remaining provinces have managed to maintain positive growth, but with Covid-19 still very much a threat that is expected to change in the coming months.

Chu Tiến Dũng, chairman of the HCM City Union of Business Association, said in the city alone an average of 1,800 businesses have exited the market every month this year, 18.99 per cent higher than in the same period last year.

According to experts, the high rate is very worrisome.

The Việt Nam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers said soon as stricter social distancing requirements were adopted by 19 southern provinces and cities, exports fell by 15 per cent in the second half of July. Exports for the full month fell 4 per cent year-on-year to US$763 million, and the downward trend would continue, it said.

The chairman of the HCM City Association of Garment, Textile, Embroidery and Knitting, Phạm Xuân Hồng, said the city currently requires employees to live in their workplace to ensure businesses continue to function, but it is only suitable for the short term since no business could bear the costs otherwise.

With textile and garment being a labour-intensive industry that requires a few thousands to tens of thousands of workers, it is impossible to bear the cost of accommodation for such numbers, he added.

The rate of textile and garment plants closing due to the pandemic has reached 30-35 per cent, according to the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association (Vitas).

Hồng pointed out the vaccination rate for textile and garment workers remained very low, especially in key production hubs in the south-western and south-eastern regions.

Due to the inability to ensure the production situation as planned, the disruption of the supply chain had also put huge pressure on many textile and garment enterprises.

It is an industry in which any failure to deliver in time would cause customers to cancel orders, impacting it over the medium term.

According to experts, accelerating vaccination to reach herd immunity is the best way to restore production.

Vitas is one of the four associations that petitioned the Government to speed up vaccinations and help businesses buy vaccines for their workers. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Chinese swimming coach, Huang Guohui, of the Vietnamese national swimming team died in quarantine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics.

“Coach Huang passed away on August 11. We are in isolation, so we don’t know the situation yet and we are waiting for the result of the police investigation," Trần Đức Phấn, head of the Vietnamese delegation to the Tokyo Olympics and deputy director of the Việt Nam Sport Administration, confirmed.

According to Phấn, the coach received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Huang and members of the Vietnamese delegation returned home from Japan on August 4, after completing the competition at the Tokyo Olympics. After returning to Hà Nội, the team are in isolation for 14 days at a hospital in the capital.

Phấn said the death of coach Huang is a great loss for Vietnamese swimming.

At the Tokyo Olympics 2020, the Chinese expert was the only professional coach for swimmers Nguyễn Huy Hoàng and Nguyễn Thị Ánh Viên. He rarely appeared in front of cameras, but has been with the Vietnamese swimming team for many years.

Under his guidance, Vietnamese swimmers won the 800m bronze medal and 1,500m silver medal at the Asian Games (ASIAD) 2008 alongside many gold medals at the 23rd, 26th, 29th and 30th SEA Games. At the last SEA Games in 2019 in the Philippines, Huang’s swimmers contributed a total of five gold medals.

Huang also directly trained No 1 swimmer of the country Hoàng for the past five years at the Cần Thơ National Sports Training Centre. He helped Hoàng improve and gain achievements, notably the 2018 Youth Olympic gold medal, the 2019 SEA Games gold medal and the 2018 ASIAD silver medal.

Huang brought his family to live in Việt Nam in 2015.

On his Facebook page, Hoàng posted a status with a photo of coach Huang teaching young swimmers.

"May you rest in peace. We will always be grateful and remember you forever. You will always be in my heart," said Hoàng. VNS

HÀ NỘI — The economy was basically stabilised in the first seven months of this year, with remarkable achievements recorded in many spheres, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính said on Wednesday.

Speaking at the Government's regular meeting, held via teleconference, the PM said attention has been paid to cultural and social affairs, while social security had been ensured.

“This is also the common assessment of international organisations and institutions,” he said.

Chính said the pandemic was still under control, adding that major pandemic clusters had been contained.

Some localities have effectively implemented the Government’s Resolution No. 68, providing timely support for employees and employers affected by the pandemic, he added.

He asked agencies and localities to raise public awareness and responsibility, and encouraged residents to seriously observe COVID-19 prevention and control regulations.

All-level Party Committees and the entire political system should carry forward their role to strictly implement relevant directives, the government leader said.

“Each agency, enterprise, commune and ward must be a fortress to fight the pandemic, and each citizen must be a soldier in combat,” he said.

The PM affirmed Việt Nam’s sound vaccine strategy, explaining that apart from imports, the Government and agencies WERE working hard to accelerate the transfer and research of vaccine production technology to produce vaccines domestically.

Although work is going smoothly, domestic vaccine production and recognition requires more time and must follow strict scientific and legal procedures, he said.

The PM stressed the need to avoid any disruptions in supply chains while regulations on goods circulation are strictly observed.

He said it was time to focus on combating the pandemic because a successful fight against COVID-19 would promote socio-economic development and facilitate socio-economic recovery.

However, he said, economic development should be maintained for resources to prevent and control the pandemic.

He asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote vaccine diplomacy and the Ministry of National Defence to support pandemic prevention and control.

The Ministry of Public Security was assigned to assist frontline forces and ensure security and order for people while the Ministry of Information and Communications was directed to strengthen dissemination campaigns and counter false allegations.

The PM noted that ministries, agencies, and localities must step up the fight against corruption, refrain from acts causing trouble for the people, and prepare documents for submission to the upcoming second session of the 15th National Assembly.

Vaccination will be sped up once more vaccines available

The Ministry of Health will cooperate with the Ministry of National Defence and the Ministry of Public Security to speed up the inoculation with up to 2 million shots of vaccines a day, said Deputy Minister of Health Trần Văn Thuấn.

Speaking at a monthly government press conference on Wednesday, he said the MoH would accelerate the vaccination when more vaccines arrive in the country.

As many as 11 million out of 18 million allocated doses of vaccines have been administered to people, accounting for 65 per cent, Thuấn said.

Hồ Chí Minh City, the country's current largest pandemic hotspot, is leading the inoculation campaign with over 3.5 million doses administered out of more than 4 million doses received. The capital of Hà Nội has injected about 1.5 million out of 3 million doses the city has been allocated.

Thuấn said the vaccination rate will be accelerated in HCM City and other provinces in the coming days.

The deputy minister said the viewpoint of the MoH was to inject the vaccines quickly but safely. Emergency resuscitation is helpful for the vaccination when needed.

The MoH has also transferred 10,000 doses of imported drugs from India to provide for the treatment of patients in southern provinces, he said.

More than 11,000 medical workers and students have been mobilised to support HCM City and southern provinces.

Thuấn said he hoped that with the drastic participation of the entire political system, the MoH and the Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, the situation would soon be stabilised and the pandemic would be put under control in the next month. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Finance (MoF) said that the State Securities Commission of Việt Nam (SSC) will consider adjusting the fluctuation limit when necessary.

In a report assessing Việt Nam's stock market for the 2021-2023 period, the Việt Nam Financial Consulting Association (VFCA) proposed to raise the fluctuation limit of the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE) to 10 per cent, from 7 per cent, this year to meet the new development of the stock market.

Regarding the above proposal of the VFCA, the SSC said that adjusting the fluctuation limit is one of the measures to stimulate the market to increase the size and liquidity, which aims at balancing the supply and demand of securities and increasing attractiveness for investors.

According to Circular No. 120/2020/TT-BTC on trading listed stocks, trading registration and fund certificates, corporate bonds, covered warrant listed on the securities trading system, Việt Nam’s stock exchanges will decide the fluctuation limit/market circuit breaker after being approved by the SSC.

Based on the actual conditions of the market, the SSC decides to apply the market circuit breaker or the market circuit breaker in combination with the fluctuation limit.

Since 2000, HOSE has made nine changes in the fluctuation limit, including seven upward adjustments and two downward adjustments, said MoF.

HÀ NỘI — The Government is to roll out a VNĐ118 trillion (US$5.2 billion) COVID-19 relief package by the end of the year, said deputy minister of finance Nguyễn Đức Chi during a government meeting on Wednesday.

The package's main targets are businesses that have been affected by the pandemic. If qualified, they would be eligible for tax cuts, reduction in land use fees and delays for other payments. Industries that have been severely affected by the pandemic such as tourism and transport may look forward to VAT tax exemptions on top of other support measures. Another relief package worth up to VNĐ20 trillion is being considered to help businesses facing extraordinary difficulties.

Notably, the ministry has proposed the Government slash taxes and fees by half for small-to-medium-sized businesses and businesses with annual sales under VNĐ200 billion.

"The Ministry of Finance has been gathering opinions and feedback from other ministries and Governmental agencies regarding the packages. Once completed, a proposal will be presented in the earliest working session of the National Assembly Standing Committee for review," said Chi.

Meanwhile, major commercial banks with the State as a shareholder including Vietinbank, Vietcombank, BIDV and Agribank have agreed to cut interest rates in the amount of VNĐ4 trillion. The banks said they will further reduce another VNĐ4 trillion in interest rates for businesses in HCM City and southern Bình Dương Province, and certain provinces that have been put under lockdown since late May. In addition, all banking services for said localities will be provided free of charge.

Đào Minh Tú, deputy governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), said the SBV has instructed commercial banks to adjust interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic. Interest rates for business loans have declined by 1.2-1.5 per cent on average during last year. During the first seven months of 2021, banks have further slashed their interest rates by 0.5 per cent.

As the country fights to contain the virus. The SBV has asked banks to cut back on their own expenses to ensure they have more resources dedicated to supporting businesses. The Vietnam Banks Association and its 16 members have pledged to reduce interest rates for business in the amount of VNĐ20.5 trillion by the end of the year, Tú said.

"The SBV's top priority is for businesses to receive all the support they require to mount a comeback once the pandemic is under control," he said. The SBV also said it will keep an eye on the banks to make sure they will make good on their pledges. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The stormy season is starting in Hà Nội and residents are increasingly concerned about flooding during heavy rain.

In the last few decades, floods have become more frequent in the capital city.

Climate change is said to be one of the causes of heavy rain and flooding, however, many experts believe natural factors are only part of the issue, with poor urban planning, construction and management also to blame, according to Kinh tế & Đô thị (Economic & Urban Affairs) newspaper.

Dr. Vũ Hoài Đức, architect and lecturer of Vietnam National University, Hà Nội, said that many urban projects in Hà Nội have taken into account natural disasters and climate change.

However, there was a lack of participation from experts in irrigation science and environmental resources in the planning process, Đức told the newspaper.

Therefore, responding to extreme weather such as heavy rain and floods is a problem for Hà Nội, especially in the western region where there are many rural areas located by rivers' banks.

For example, floods in 2017 and 2018 broke dykes along the Tích and Bùi rivers in Chương Mỹ District, submerging thousands of houses.

In the past, Hà Nội saw flooding in the inner city because this area has poor drainage infrastructure and is densely populated. But now, flooding has spread to the suburbs and newly-built urban areas.

The master plan for Hà Nội’s development to 2030 approved by the then Prime Minister in 2011 raised two important issues of urban economic development and environmental protection.

These issues have been realised in zoning plans and projects on technical infrastructure including drainage, green areas, parks and lakes.

However, after implementation, many targets set out in these plans and projects were not met.

This is because the urbanisation rate is still low while population growth exceeds the overall planning target, leading to overloaded infrastructure. The slow construction of satellite towns and eco-towns results in a lack of green space for the city.

In the inner city area, the relocation of the headquarters of ministries, branches, higher education institutions and industrial production facilities to save land for public spaces has not been carried out effectively. Due to shortcomings in the implementation of the master plan, the city is facing environmental problems such as air pollution, garbage, wastewater, and flooding.

Việt Nam is one of the countries heavily affected by climate change, and the impacts of climate change are presenting themselves even faster than expected.

Hà Nội is also suffering due to shortcomings in urban planning.

Although the master plan took into account drainage issues including surface water, wastewater and rain water, the rapid population growth has led to an increase in domestic wastewater.

Moreover, in recent years, there are incidences of heavy rainfall of up to 300-400mm, which has surpassed the calculated threshold of the drainage that is for 200-250mm.

The drainage system now is overloaded, causing heavy flooding, even in areas that have never been flooded before such as around Hoàn Kiếm Lake and the Old Quarter.

Many urban planning experts believe that, along with the overall adjustment of the Hà Nội Development Master Plan towards environmental protection, plans on technical infrastructure need further research in order to overcome the shortcomings and build urban areas that adapt to climate change.

Architect Đào Ngọc Nghiêm, former director of the Hà Nội Planning and Architecture Department, said: “In order to prepare for climate change, Hà Nội has not only to deal with local flooded spots but also evaluate the whole city's drainage system so as to combine drainage requirements with urban development demands as well as combine drainage treatment with building of green spaces.”

“With the rapid urbanisation rate, the city needs to approve the adjustment of the infrastructure plan to improve drainage capacity for both the inner city and the suburbs," Nghiêm said.

Meanwhile, Đức said that Hà Nội could learn from developed countries to have technical solutions to cope with extreme weather phenomena causing flooding in urban areas.

For areas along Hồng (Red) and Đuống rivers, planning projects should involve experts in environmental resources, hydrometeorology and irrigation.

“With the advancement of science and technology, there is nothing that cannot be solved. The problem is how to find a solution to work together among related sectors,” said Đức. VNS

Nguyễn Hoàng Bảo Đại, 27, is the third Vietnamese to be honoured as a Google Developer Expert in the field of Machine Learning. He is also the initiator of an AI model that can generate ten melodies in one second. Đại talks with Lương Hương about the project.

Inner Sanctum: Please introduce yourself?

My name is Nguyễn Hoàng Bảo Đại. I’m working as a natural language processing research scientist and attending a graduate programme at the National University of Singapore.

I was introduced to music at a very young age but only took it seriously at the age of 12 when I started taking piano lessons. At first, I didn’t want to take up music because I always thought that it was not a subject for boys but I kept learning the piano to satisfy my father’s wishes. However, after a long time being exposed to music and experiencing many things, I started to unconsciously fall for it. Music has now become an integral part of my life, making me happy and inspiring me to do anything.

After finishing high school, I wanted to apply for the composition department of HCM City Conservatory of Music but my family did not encourage me to follow this path. My teachers also advised me to pursue maths or any other natural science subjects, of which I was pretty good at school.

In the end, I decided to apply for Information Technology like my best friend. I was really disoriented at that time and just wanted to go to university to have a friend whom I could talk to and sing to. Unfortunately, we couldn’t make it because I passed the entrance exam but my friend didn’t so I had to study by myself, however, it was also the beginning of my career with Information Technology as well as in Artificial Intelligence.

Inner Sanctum: How did the idea of music-writing AI, still a new concept in Việt Nam, come to you?

The idea originated from my habit of writing music. I have always spent a lot of time writing melodies because I think that only good melodies make beautiful songs. Sometimes, I finish writing a melody but then leave it because I’m not totally satisfied. I thought that if I could shorten the time for writing melodies, the whole process would become faster and the songwriters could release their works sooner.

On the other hand, AI has also been applied in various fields so I started thinking about applying AI in the fields of artistic creation, and assisting Vietnamese songwriters specifically.

After two years, my current AI model can write a piece of music that lasts for 10 seconds, 5 minutes, or even longer. It will take in a prime melody, which is a short piece of music as input to capture the stylistic intent, then create the melodies exactly as I want.

For example, if I provide it with a gentle, mellow melody, I will have 10 soft, mellow songs with lyrical ballads. If I provide a piece of music that has a slightly faster tempo, I will get 10 songs with a dynamic vibe. Moreover, when I lack ideas, I can ask the AI model to generate songs on its own without any prime melody.

Inner Sanctum: What were your difficulties as a pioneer in the field in Việt Nam and how have you overcome them?

The first difficulty in building this AI model was a shortage of data, which I believe that all other AI engineers will face. As I want to build a model that can generate music in the Vietnamese pop ballad style, I chose a training method based on supervised learning that requires a lot of data. However, I cannot use the available music of Vietnamese artists because it is not my desired input. I can find and collect the proper data online but it is insufficient and difficult to standardise as I wish as each source has its own format.

The second difficulty I encountered was the problem of human resources. The whole project has been implemented by myself as I consider it as a personal project and have managed it with my own limited budget. I often hesitate to invite others to help on complicated issues as we have no guarantee of results or finance to support.

Therefore, I decided to solve the problems myself. To get the file in the desired format, I have to sit on a midi keyboard every day and save each one. Many a little makes a mickle, and over a year I think I have accumulated enough data to train the AI model.

Inner Sanctum: Are you now satisfied with the melodies generated by your AI model?

It has achieved about 80 per cent of my expectation. The composing speed is also impressive as it only needs one second to generate 10 different melodies. Such capacity has saved me much time in composing and finalising the music.

I have written a lot of songs with the help of AI, but it takes many stages thereafter to introduce one to the market, such as writing the lyrics, writing the mix, finding the singer, doing the mixing, mastering and even PR/marketing, so they are mainly serving my personal demands.

Inner Sanctum: What do you think of the possibility that music-writing AI will become increasingly popular and replace songwriters in the future?

I highly appreciate the potential application of AI in the music industry. Music marketing is currently a hot field. All brands want to have catchy music for their promotions and advertisements.

The production of promotional music includes a time-consuming phase, similarly to my composing stage: the client listens to the demo and chooses the best version. I believe this process is time-consuming for the composer because they have to create music to meet the customer's request. I think that using AI to write music and make proposals is the fastest and most effective approach because it will save labour and time for both sides.

In addition, music writing AI will also be applied to shorten the production time of a music project. Currently, my AI model supports the process of composing pop tunes so that the producers can spend more time on the rest of the project and create better final products.

However, I don't think it's possible for AI to replace musicians, or it will take a long time to happen. Each songwriter has his/her own musical style. As long as the audience still has the demand for that style, AI will not yet replace their roles. Moreover, the training data is still human-generated so it still needs to depend on people. VNS

HCM CITY– Switzerland has gifted Việt Nam US$5.5 million worth of medical supplies to support its fight against COVID-19.

Thirty ventilators, 500,000 sets of antigen tests and 280,000 medical masks arrived at HCM City’s Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport from the European country on Friday.

Swiss Vice President and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis visited Việt Nam earlier this month to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

He said Việt Nam would soon recover from the pandemic and agreed that the two countries need to continue to share experiences in COVID prevention and reviving the economy.

Switzerland has also been offering support to other Asian countries in their fight against COVID-19, including Thailand, Indonesia and Mongolia. – VNS

HÀ NỘI — Enterprises producing dried foods are struggling to meet increased demand caused by social distancing measures, due to a lack of raw materials.

Kajiwara Junichi, General Director of Acecook Vietnam Co told VnEconomy that the implementation of the "3 on-site" model, as part of the businesses continuity arrangements while social distancing measures are in place, has made the company's total production output decrease.

Currently, the number of employees participating in the "3 on-site" model accounts for only half of his company’s total workforce, he said.

This has led to reduced output and a failure to meet market demand. Meanwhile, some cases of COVID-19 infection were detected among their transport partners. This has affected the delivery of goods between branches of the company and to its distributors and supermarkets, he added.

Saigon Aquatic Product Trading JSC is also facing the same problem.

VnEconomy cited the company’s general director Trương Tiến Dũng as saying that his company was forced to close a facility producing fish cakes, canned and dried goods due to lack of raw materials. This resulted in a shortage of these products in its retail chains such as food stores and supermarkets.

In order to overcome this challenge, his firm is looking for alternative sources of raw materials to make up for the current shortage, Dũng said.

At a recent online meeting in HCM City, Lý Kim Chi, President of the Food and Foodstuff Association of Hồ Chí Minh City (FFA), said that up to now, many food companies have still maintained their production. However, some of them that implemented the "3-on-site" model could only utilise 50-60 per cent of their workforce, resulting in shortages of goods.

Insufficient raw materials were also problematic, according to the FFA.

It explained that producing a food product required many different types of raw materials. Raw material suppliers could shut down production at any time if they had F0 infected cases. Without a certain type of key raw material, businesses might have to stop their production altogether. That meant consumer goods and essential foodstuffs would be insufficient.

Chi cited a field of green onions in Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province as an example. In the pre-pandemic period, traders would come to that field to buy green onions and transport onions to factories in HCM City by trucks. However, amid the pandemic traders could not rent trucks to transport onions. That resulted in an inadequate source of green onion, causing difficulties for instant noodles producers who needed the green onion to make the seasoning.

In order to deal with this issue, food businesses petitioned the State management agencies to allow them to temporarily find alternative sources of auxiliary materials such as spices, flavourings and additives or adjust the appropriate quantity of materials while ensuring the quality, safety and basic characteristics of food products so that they would not affect the health of users.

For example, for instant noodles, food firms could reduce the number of auxiliary materials such as dried green onion and pepper, depending on the supply available, if the material suppliers stopped operation, Chi said.

Under the Food Safety Law and related regulations, with the above adjustments, companies had to redo the procedures for self-declaration of products and change the packaging, according to Chi.

However, doing this right now would take a long time, Chi said, adding that the cost of reprinting packaging would be very high. Meanwhile, it was so wasteful to discard old packaging, leading to the possibility that companies had to temporarily shut down production.

Thus, the FFA petitioned the State management agencies to replace the above procedures by allowing businesses to send detailed written reports to the agencies along with offering transparent information for consumers.

In particular, it suggested HCM City authorities deliver forecasts on market demand while drawing consumption plans and then proposing to neighbouring provinces that they expand their scale of production.

It was also necessary to set up a working group that would be responsible for solving difficulties for businesses in a timely manner and a hotline to receive information. That would help prevent the disruption of production and trade chains in the current context.

The city also needed to foster stronger exchanges and partnerships with neighbouring provinces with large supplied of raw material, Chi added. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Shares extended last week's gains, propped up by strong money flows in banks and securities companies, but foreign traders continued to sell, posing risks to the market in the short term.

On the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange, the VN-Index closed Monday up 1.03 per cent at 1,370.96 points. The southern market's index increased 1.2 per cent last week.

Liquidity continued to improve with nearly 828 million shares worth VNĐ27.5 trillion (US$1.2 billion) traded, up 12 per cent in volume and 15 per cent in value compared to last week's figures.

In the afternoon trade, money was poured into banking and securities stocks, supporting the market's rally. These two sectors gained an average of 2.1 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively, according to data on vietstock.vn.

Six of the top 10 biggest contributors to the VN-Index on Monday were banks. They are Techcombank (TCB), Military Bank (MBB), VPBank (VPB), Vietcombank (VCB), Vietinbank (CTG) and BIDV (BID) with growth of between 1 per cent and 4.7 per cent each.

Securities firms also climbed strongly. The biggest listed brokerage house Saigon Securities Inc (SSI) soared 5.3 per cent; Hồ Chí Minh Securities Corp (HCM) also grew 5.3 per cent, and VNDirect Securities (VND) increased 3.3 per cent.

However, slumps of Vinhomes (VHM) and Vingroup (VIC) were the main drag, restraining the market growth.

Vingroup has registered to sell nearly 100.5 million shares of Vinhomes, equivalent to 3 per cent of Vinhomes' charter capital, after VHM hit a record high of VNĐ120,000 ($5.22) a share on Friday, becoming Việt Nam's biggest listed company with a market capitalisation of VNĐ402 trillion ($17.5 billion).

VHM slipped 3.3 per cent and VIC decreased 0.3 per cent on Monday.

The transaction will be carried out between August 19 and September 17 through order matching or put-through transactions. According to Vingroup's statement, the sale is aimed at increasing working capital and investment in subsidiaries.

On the Hà Nội Stock Exchange, the HNX-Index increased 1.95 per cent to close the day at 343.53 points with nearly 194 million shares worth VNĐ4.9 trillion traded.

However, contrasting to domestic traders, foreign investors continued to offload Vietnamese shares. They were responsible for net sell value of VNĐ956 billion on the HCM City's bourse, the highest value in the last five sessions. They offloaded shares worth VNĐ40 billion in Hà Nội's market.

Many securities companies are still issuing buy-in recommendations on the prediction the market would continue its rally, but analysts on cafef.vn have warned investors that the stock market has experienced a fairly long bull cycle and they should be wary of the chasing-price strategy. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The electronics industry is forecast to have a robust year, driven by the increase in demand for communication's products due to demand caused by social distancing measures implemented to tackled rising cases of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade said that as the COVID-19 pandemic has developed exports of many products saw significant drops although some key industrial products saw considerable increases in the first seven months of this year.

Statistics showed that the export of phones and components brought in $29.35 billion from January – July, up 11.9 per cent against the same period last year. More than 128 mobile phones were produced in the period, up by 14.1 per cent.

That Việt Nam’s phones and components exports kept growing was a good sign, signalling a year of strong growth for the electronics industry, which would contribute significantly to the country’s economic recovery and to achieving growth targets, the ministry said.

Phones and components were the top export products of Việt Nam, which account for 15.8 per cent of the country’s total export revenue in the first seven months of this year, followed by electronic products, computers, and components with an export value of $27.4 billion.

The ministry said that the electronics industry would continue to grow in the remaining months of this year, driven by the increase in demand for communication products. A number of companies that produce computer and electronics products in other countries had been forced to close down due to the impacts of the virus.

The ministry predicted that the export value of computers, electronic components and other products of Việt Nam would hit US$50 billion this year, representing a rise of 13.5 per cent against 2020.

Nguyễn Thị Thu Thủy, Deputy Director of the Trade Promotion Agency’s Export Promotion Centre, said that the Vietnamese economy continued to see significant changes in the structure of export products. From a country with agricultural products and labour-intensive products being the main exports, Việt Nam was gradually transitioning to producing more high-tech export products with higher added value such as electronics and electronic components.

The ministry said that Việt Nam's electronics products were exported to more than 100 countries including China, ASEAN, Japan and the Republic of Korea and were expanding their presence in EU markets.

In the first quarter of this year, Việt Nam granted licences for capital increases for a number of electronic products, including Korea's LG Display Hải Phòng and Singapore's Fukang Technology. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Registration fees for new electric cars are to be cut by half compared to those with internal combustion engines, following recommendations by the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

It is hoped the reduced fee will encourage more consumers to go electric, a growing trend around the world, as part of the country's effort to combat pollution and be more environmentally friendly.

The registration reductions mean that owners of, for example, VinFast's new model VF e34 with a retail price tag of VNĐ690 million (US$30,000) will pay VNĐ35-40 million (depending on where they register the vehicle) instead of VNĐ70-80 million.

The fee reduction will be in effect for five years.

The drop in fees will see a reduction in government coffers of around VNĐ5 trillion as car registration fees make up a significant portion of income for provinces and cities. Registration fees for cars accounted for 69 per cent of the total registration fee for all vehicles in 2017, 70 per cent in 2018, 74.6 per cent in 2019 and 79 per cent in 2020.

The fee reduction will not apply to owners of used electric cars, who will have to pay around 2 per cent of the vehicle's price tag, minus depreciation.

The country's largest conglomerate and sole electric vehicle maker VinGroup has asked the Government to grant special consumption tax cuts and registration fee reductions for electric cars. The group also produces cars with internal combustion engines and electric bikes.

Multiple ministries have voiced support for the proposal.

Deputy minister of transport Lê Đình Thọ said the switch to electric vehicles would help reduce the country's carbon emissions in line with international environment and climate change agreements.

Regarding the cuts in special consumption tax, also for a period of five years, the Ministry of Finance said this matter must be decided by the National Assembly. For the cuts to be even considered, the National Assembly must be willing to make modifications to the country's Laws on Special Consumption Tax, which unlike registration fees do not fall under the Government's discretion.

Right now, the special consumption tax for electric cars is at 15 per cent for vehicles with nine seats or fewer, 10 per cent for 10-16 seaters and 5 per cent for 16-25 seaters.

During the first seven months of 2021, more than 185,000 cars were produced or assembled in Việt Nam, a 40 per cent increase from the same period last year. On average, 838 new cars are sold every day nationwide. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — By issuing stock dividends and private offering from equity and issuing stocks for foreign investors, VPBank is expected to raise its charter capital to VNĐ75 trillion (US$3.3 billion).

At an online meeting with analysts and individual investors on Thursday, VPBank’s leader said that besides the recent plan to issue shares with a total rate of 80 per cent, including 62.15 per cent to pay dividends and 17.85 per cent to be issued from equity, the bank plans to increase charter capital through sources like the sale of 49 per cent of FE Credit's capital for nearly $1.4 billion and the private offering of 15 per cent of capital for strategic foreign shareholders.

If these deals are completed, VPBank’s charter capital will increase to VNĐ75 trillion by 2022. This is even higher than that of State-owned banks such as Vietcombank, BIDV and VietinBank, making it the bank with the highest charter capital in the market.

VPBank is consulting shareholders in writing on the issuance of stock dividends and additional issuance from the development investment fund and the reserve fund for supplemental charter capital.

Accordingly, the bank is expected to issue a maximum of nearly two trillion new shares, equivalent to the total issuance value of VNĐ19.76 trillion to increase charter capital. Shareholders with 10,000 shares of VPBbank will receive a total of 8,000 new shares, including 6,215 shares from dividends and 1,785 shares from equity.

After the issuance, the bank's charter capital will increase to nearly VNĐ45.1 trillion. This is one of the three sources for the capital rise mentioned above.

Regarding business results, the bank’s leader said that its total revenue climbed 22.5 per cent in the first six months of the year. Of which, net interest income reached VNĐ18 trillion, up 17 per cent. — VNS

BÌNH THUẬN — About 650 fishing ships have resumed operations at La Gi Fishing Port in Bình Thuận Province after being suspended for nearly three weeks due to the latest COVID-19 outbreak.

The port in the south-central province’s La Gi Town suspended operation from July 24 under the Prime Minister's Directive No.16 on COVID-19 prevention and control measures.

The town’s People’s Committee on August 12 issued a document to better manage fishing activities under social distancing. The fishing ships will be licensed to operate if crew members have negative COVID-19 test results within 72 hours prior to departure, and the ships install monitoring devices on board.

All ship owners and crew must fully comply with regulations and guidance on pandemic prevention and control measures of the government, local pandemic checkpoint and border guard stations, and inter-sectoral COVID-19 prevention and control stations.

Before leaving the port, the ship captain must have a departure card issued by the local pandemic checkpoint and border guard station.

The ship owner can ask the port management board to prepare food, fuel and other necessities for offshore fishing trips.

After boarding the ship, the crew must stay on board until the ship leaves the port to minimise the risk of infections.

The ship captain must inform the port’s management board about the ship’s registration number and the amount of caught seafood at least three hours in advance before entering the port.

The caught seafood must be unloaded and transported out of the port under the guidance of the port management board.

La Gi Town is one of several COVID-19 hotspots in the province with more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases recorded.

La Gi Fishing Port has the highest density of ships entering and leaving the province and a large-scale anchorage for more than 2,000 ships to avoid storms.

Bình Thuận is one of the four largest fishing grounds in Việt Nam. The province’s fishing industry has gained positive achievements due to COVID-19 prevention and control measures, favourable weather, and cooperation among business firms. — VNS

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nguyễn Quốc Hùng, general secretary of the Việt Nam Banking Association

Outbreaks of COVID-19, especially in the first half of 2021, are negatively affecting the repayment of debt. This increases the pressure of bad debt on the banking system.

Nguyễn Quốc Hùng, general secretary of the Việt Nam Banking Association, spoke to Vietnam News Agency about this issue.

What do you think about the banks' process of restructuring bad debt?

The implementation of Resolution No. 42/2017/QH14 on the settlement of bad debts of credit institutions has recorded many positive results. Specifically, the resolution has created a legal corridor for credit institutions to recover debts.

Agencies have also actively supported banks in debt recovery and handling of collateral. Moreover, customers' awareness of debt repayment is much higher than before.

The credit institutions have been restructuring bad debts to reduce the bad debt ratio to a safe level.

At the same time, the professional level in analysis, appraisal and evaluation of new loans of bank employees has also been improved, thus restricting bad debts.

However, the development of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting production and business activities and the whole economy.

The State Bank of Việt Nam has issued Circular 03/2021/TT-NHNN on amending and supplementing a number of articles of Circular No. 01/2020/TT-NHNN on credit institutions and foreign bank branches carrying out debt rescheduling and giving exemption from or reduction of loan interest and charges to help their clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Debt recovery at present is very difficult for credit institutions due to regulations on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it relies mainly on the customer's sense of debt repayment.

An important job for the banks is to urge their customers to concentrate on the payment of old debts. Then, they propose plans on paying new debts to stabilise business in the post-pandemic period.

At this moment, I think that banks have built their own scenarios. Besides reducing interest rates to support people, the banks have also actively improved their financial capacity to ensure good operations in the future.

Many banks have gained large profits in the context of businesses and the economy facing difficulties. What do you think about this?

Bank profits need to be viewed comprehensively and objectively. This profit is the result of a long restructuring process in the past five years. The banks have spent all resources to raise their charter capital and capital adequacy ratio (CAR). There are banks that have not paid dividends for many years to reserve capital for risk.

On the other hand, the banks are implementing debt restructuring according to the State Bank's regulations, so they do not have to make provision for risks. Therefore, profits tend to increase.

Another factor is that the application of digital banking has created favourable conditions for customers and also brought benefits to the banks. Because when the customers do not use cash, the amount of money in their accounts will increase. This is the demand deposit with a very low-interest rate so there is a big gap between the interest of the demand deposit and lending interest rates.

What is the credit growth outlook in the last six months of the banking system? What solution is there to achieve the growth target but still ensure credit quality?

The State Bank has recently adjusted credit targets. This is a very appropriate step at present. The pandemic is very complicated, but I hope that with strong solutions from the Government, it will soon be controlled.

Then business will return to stability and continue production. The businesses whose production was interrupted due to the pandemic will resume operation with higher working intensity and greater capital needs. Therefore, the banks also need to create favourable conditions to give financial supports to those businesses.

In addition, enterprises producing essential goods for domestic use and export also need capital. The banks need to evaluate the efficiency of the enterprises' business plans to provide capital in a timely manner. This is an opportunity for production recovery.

Meanwhile, the State Bank of Việt Nam recently approved credit room extensions for several banks, signalling that priority would be given to credit institutions that reduced lending rates to support businesses and people to overcome the impact of the pandemic by year-end. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Health has allowed HCM City to use one million doses of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine Vero Cell.

The shipment of the vaccine, imported by the State-owned Saigon Pharmaceutical Group (Sapharco) in HCM City, arrived at the city’s Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport on July 31.

Early in July, the health ministry gave permission for Sapharco to import Vero Cell with the sponsorship of Vạn Thịnh Phát Holdings Group, a private conglomerate founded by a Vietnamese national of Chinese origin in HCM City.

The vaccines are being preserved at the company’s cold storage and have not yet used pending quality controls.

The Ministry of Health said the vaccines meet requirements for administration after being examined by the National Institute for Control of Vaccine and Biologicals.

Vero Cell was approved for emergency use by the WHO in May, and given conditional approval for use in Việt Nam on June 4. The first 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government to Việt Nam have been used for Chinese nationals living and working in the country, Vietnamese residents in border areas with China and people who engage in trade and service exchanges with Việt Nam's northern neighbour. — VNS

The banking group also performed poorly with losers including Military Bank (MBB), Sacombank (STB), Techcombank (TCB), Vietcombank (VCB), and Tiên Phong Bank (TPB).

On the other side, best performing blue-chips included Vietinbank (CTG), Vinhomes (VHM), Vingroup (VIC) and Bảo Việt Holdings (BVH).

“The market remained in the green for most of the session but reversed at the end of the afternoon session as investment cash flow narrowed,” said BIDV Securities Co.

“Short-term profit-taking pressure appeared as the market is gradually approaching the resistance level of 1,380 points. Meanwhile, foreign investors continued to be net sellers on both HNX and HoSE.

“With the domestic and foreign cash flows showing signs of weakening at the resistance level, VN-Index can continue maintaining the consolidation period at 1,350-1,380 points,” it said.

Foreign investors net sold VNĐ143.43 billion on HOSE. They were net sellers on HNX with a value of VNĐ25.57 billion.

HÀ NỘI — The Vietnamese Government has issued a national strategy on the research, development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) till 2030 with a view to gradually turning Việt Nam into an innovation and AI hub in ASEAN and the world.

Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Bùi Thế Duy said the strategy aims for Việt Nam to be among four leading countries in ASEAN and 50 nations globally in terms of AI research, development and application by 2030; build 10 prestigious AI trademarks in the region; and develop three national big data and high-performance computing centres.

By 2030, Việt Nam will set up 50 interconnected open databases in economic sectors in service of the effort.

To such end, the country is fine-tuning legal documents and creating a legal framework regarding AI, as well as promoting international cooperation in the field.

Further attention should be paid to human resources training and building databases that are synchronous with computing infrastructure.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out nearly two years ago, the application of AI in healthcare in Việt Nam has become a bright spot in the world. AI has helped ease burdens on medical workers and anti-pandemic forces through tracing apps and epidemiological maps.

The Hà Nội University of Science and Technology officially debuted an international centre on AI under the model of a mixed international research centre. It is expected to conduct basic studies and create “Make in Việt Nam” core technologies.

Prof. Hồ Tú Bảo, director of the centre, said the digital environment was creating invaluable opportunities to develop the country and master important technologies, including AI.

Minister Duy said construction on the National Innovation Centre began at Hoà Lạc Hi-Tech Park to support the start-up system in Việt Nam, contributing to renewing the country’s growth model based on advanced technologies. — VNS

On the other hand, Masan Group (MSN), Novaland (NVL) and Khang Điền House (KDH) were the ones that corrected, losing more than 1 per cent.

The oil and gas group performed well at the end of the session, with Petrovietnam General Services JSC Corporation (PET), PetroVietnam Drilling & Well Services Corporation (PVD) all reaching the ceiling prices, while PV OIL (OIL), Bình Sơn Refinery (BSR), PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation (PVS) all advanced more than 6 per cent.

The seafood group also made strong gains with Minh Phú Corporation (MPC), Vĩnh Hoàn Corporation (VHC), and Mekong Fisheries Joint Stock Company (AAM) all gaining more than 1 per cent.

KB Securities Vietnam said the market had entered a recovery period thanks to investors’ confidence in the Government's timely pandemic control policy, accelerating the vaccination progress.

“However, at the present time, the COVID-19 pandemic still develops complicatedly so the market is still facing the risk of falling again,” it said.

“From March 2020, the market has witnessed four correction phases. Except for the quick and unexpected adjustment at the end of March 2020, the three correction phases in June 2020, January 2021 and July 2021 were all quite expected,” said Lã Giang Trung, Director of Passion Investment Fund Management Company.

“In July 2021, VN-Index recorded a 13 per cent drop. It is likely that the index has created a short-term bottom. After each correction, the index often makes an increase of about 30 per cent. Therefore, VN-Index could reach 1,600-1,700 points by the end of this year,” he said.

The HNX-Index on the Hà Nội Stock Exchange (HNX) also climbed 1.33 per cent to 335.08 points.

HÀ NỘI Securities companies are optimistic about stock market movements this week and are betting the positive trend will continue but the market will witness alternative ups and downs during its uptrend.

The benchmark VN-Index on the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE) increased by 0.3 per cent to close last week at 1,357.05 points.

The index gained a total of 1.16 per cent last week.

An average of 739.5 million shares was traded on the southern exchange during each session last week, worth VNĐ23.9 trillion (US$1 billion).

According to SSI Securities Joint Stock Company (SSI), the VN-Index had recovered from the support area of ​​1,352 - 1,340 points, along with an increase in trading volume. The index had returned to the uptrend.

BOS Securities Joint Stock Company (BOS) said the VN-Index received strong support at the area around 1,340 points in the last session of last week.

Technical indicators still maintained signals that the market would recover, BOS said.

“However, the market is likely to face difficulties at 1,370 points in the short term as profit-taking pressure is increasing. Fluctuations are expected to appear more often when the index enters this zone. BOS recommends investors prioritise market observation and maintain their current portfolio,” it said.

“The stock market had a dramatic reversal in the last minutes of the session. Many stocks rose again when the cash flow entered the market robustly and decisively,” Việt Dragon said in last Friday’s market report.

“However, we still see that the stock market is risky and has not shown any signs of stability. Therefore, investors who are holding stocks can sell and should not disburse at this time,” it said.

“The VN-Index got support and reversed back to gaining thanks to a strong cash inflow that can match the profit-taking pressure. It is expected that the VN-Index will continue to recover and will approach the resistance zone of 1,370 points,” it said.

“The effective containment of the COVID-19 pandemic and proper monetary and fiscal policies will be important supportive elements for the market in this period,” said Nguyễn Anh Khoa, Head of Analysis and Investment Consulting Department of Agriseco Securities.

“The resistance area of 1,370-1,400 points will still be a challenge. Therefore, it is likely that the market will witness alternating dropping sessions while gradually moving up to 1,400 points in the second half of August,” he said.

“Although some provinces in Việt Nam are experiencing increasingly strict social distancing measures, the economy continues to show resilience, underpinned by the strength of demand both at home and abroad,” said Anand Pathmakanthan, Head of Regional Equity Research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities Limited.

“This wave of the disease may gradually subside from September, thanks to strict containment measures and accelerated vaccination that will help put the country back on a more solid growth trajectory, with supply chain repositioning being a key long-term driver,” he told a recent online meeting held by Maybank Kim Eng.

“The VN-Index may increase by 10 per cent in the second half of 2021, led by real estate, materials, logistics and retail stocks. With the financial sector showing positive signals when the growth spreads across the market, we still see attractive opportunities in leading banks such as Techcombank (TCB), Vietcombank (VCB), Military Bank (MBB) and VPBank (VPB),” he said.

“The VN-Index had a third consecutive week of recovery last week with increased liquidity compared to the previous week and higher than the 20-week average,” said Saigon-Hanoi Securities Joint Stock Company (SHS).

“Foreign investors turned to be net sellers last week with more than VNĐ2.2 trillion on both exchanges, which also put pressure on the market,” it said.

Industrial stocks gained the most last week with stocks such as Vinaconex (VCG) increasing by 5.2 per cent, Geleximco (GEX) rising by 5.4 per cent, and Hải Phòng Port Joint Stock Company (PHP) gaining by 27.5 per cent.

They were followed by materials stocks such as Hoà Phát Group (HPG) increasing by 0.5 per cent, Nam Kim Group (NKG) rising by 3.6 per cent, Petro Việt Nam Cà Mau Fertiliser JSC (DCM) increasing by 10.6 per cent, and PetroVietnam Fertiliser & Chemicals Corp (DPM) increasing by 19.8 per cent.

The baby, weighing 2.8kg, is being looked after at the hospital, while the mother has been sent to quarantine at the lung hospital for COVID-19 patients.

She was rescued by local traffic police when her family was driving a motorbike back to their hometown in Nghệ An Province from southern Bình Dương Province on Thursday.

The 26-year-old woman needed help when the family, including a two-year old boy, took a break at Phổ Cường Commune of the province. The traffic police then took her to the hospital just hours before she gave birth.

Two traffic police officers who escorted the pregnant woman to the hospital were quarantined as soon as the woman, her husband and two-year-old son tested positive for coronavirus at the hospital.

This is the second time a woman with COVID-19 has given birth successfully in the province after a similar case on June 30.

HÀ NỘI — Amid soaring fertiliser prices compared to early this year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development proposed the Ministry of Industry and Trade plan a comprehensive inspection on fertiliser production, business, import and export activities in southern provinces.

Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Trần Thanh Nam said that fertiliser prices in the country and around the world have continuously increased since the beginning of the year.

Specifically, Cà Mau urea increased by 72 per cent from VNĐ6,800 per kilo to VNĐ11,700 per kilo.

DAP Đình Vũ fertiliser rose by 67.3 per cent from VNĐ8,550 to VNĐ14,300 per kilo.

Explaining the reason for the increase in fertiliser prices, experts said prices of input materials for fertiliser production has risen.

Sulfur rose over 200 per cent compared to the lowest point of 2019; ammonia increased by nearly 200 per cent, followed by single fertilisers such as urea, DAP, superphosphate and others.

In addition, global oil, gas and fuel prices increased, resulting in soaring prices for transportation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a serious shortage of containers, meaning the cost of transporting containers increased by up to five times. Those are the main reasons for increasing fertiliser prices.

Additionally, China has restricted exports, therefore, there has been a partial lack of fertiliser for some periods.

In agriculture, the summer-autumn crop is the period requiring the most fertiliser, pushing up demand.

As prices of domestically produced and imported fertiliser increase by 50-73 per cent, it is giving rise to the risk of rampant speculation in fertiliser, as well as declining quality.

In order to stabilise fertiliser prices, Team 970 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development proposed that its counterpart at the Ministry of Industry and Trade direct market management departments of southern provinces to regularly inspect and review stores of agricultural materials to clamp down on speculation and stockpiling to create artificial scarcity.

It also proposed the co-ordination with inspectors of the Plant Protection Department and members of the provincial steering committee 389 to step up inspections of fertiliser production, business and import and export activities in the southern area, ensuring the quality and price of fertiliser products in accordance with the State's regulations.

Fertiliser is a commodity subject to price stabilisation, but the stabilisation would be difficult when the price increase was mainly due to the increase in raw material prices, said Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Trần Quốc Khánh at a meeting with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Wednesday.

It was even more difficult to apply administrative regulations to the market when Việt Nam had made international commitments, he noted.

Therefore, he emphasised the view that the two ministries would agree on solutions to propose to the Government.

At the same time, it is suggested that production enterprises continue to provide adequate sources of goods to the market, rationalise costs and try to have a lower selling price than import prices, giving priority to fertilisers for domestic agricultural production and not export. — VNS

QUẢNG TRỊ ­— A man in the central province of Quảng Trị has successfully developed an organic farming model in combination with online trading of safe food.

Nguyễn Đăng Vương, a 37-year-old farmer in Vĩnh Chấp Commune of Vĩnh Linh District, has contributed to protecting consumer health and increased his income.

Vương had long-held the desire to build his own brand of safe organic food to the market.

So in 2015, when he had the opportunity to visit Japan, he went to study organic fertiliser production, microbial feed and organic farming.

By visiting and studying domestic and foreign organic models for a long time, he was able to build his own business.

In 2019, Vương decided to use his modest savings to set up a farm on his family’s 4 hectares of agricultural land.

By early last year, he had invested more than VNĐ1 billion (US$43,600) in setting up nine separate and closed breeding areas.

His farm is currently raising more than 3,000 chickens, 1,000 ducks and more than 30 pigs, including domestic pigs and wild boar hybrids.

He faced many difficulties and failures, which initially discouraged him.

“The first days were the most difficult time. After many times of failing to incubate probiotics for animal feed, I wanted to give up,” said Vương. “But I thought ‘no pain, no gain’ and I was determined to keep going. If one batch was spoiled, I made another one. After many failures, I finally found the right formula and ratio.”

His animals were fed organic foods made by himself as he absolutely refused to use weight gaining substances and antibiotics.

A highlight of Vương’s organic farming model is the use of spoiled and leftover fruit and vegetables from markets, households, schools and restaurants to process animal feed.

He collects the fruit and vegetables, then purees and brews them using micro-fermentation with garlic yeast and other substances.

To increase protein for animal feed, he raises black fly larvae and uses by-products such as fish heads, intestines, beer and bean residue.

The animal feed is only fed to livestock and poultry after being processed in accordance with the accurate procedures.

He takes a month longer than conventional breeding farms to sell his animals because they do not use stimulants and weight gaining substances.

However, he says that his animals are less susceptible to diseases, and as the meat and eggs have no antibiotics or chemical residues they are more delicious.

Vương’s meat and eggs are favoured by the market and sold at 30-35 per cent higher than other produce.

Online trading

To find stable buyers for his products, Vương uses social networks and apps such as Facebook, YouTube and Zalo for marketing and sales.

Through these channels, he has uploaded hundreds of videos sharing his experience organically raising chickens, pigs and ducks as well as promoting his produce to consumers.

He has made video clips about the process of producing animal feed, raising animals, butchering, meat processing and product packaging.

Gradually, his produce has gained a foothold in the market.

To meet the needs of consumers, besides wholesale, he also directly delivers goods to households.

Every year, Vương makes VNĐ180-200 million (US$4,200-4,500) in profit.

Vương’s farm has also created regular jobs for five local labourers with an average monthly income of VNĐ5-6 million per person.

From the initial success, Vương is investing in building a brand of Vĩnh Chấp Organic Chicken and establishing Vương Tây Sơn Clean Agriculture Cooperative with the aim of helping other farmers in his hometown.

Lê Đức Quang Huy, chairman of Farmers' Association of Vĩnh Chấp Commune said: “Vương’s model of organic farming and clean food production is a new and successful direction in the locality. The model has not only brought high economic values to his family but also created jobs for local labourers in the commune.”

In the near future, the association plans to expand Vương’s model in the commune and establish an organic livestock cooperative in order to develop agricultural production. – VNS

HÀ NỘI — Hà Nội plans to test a total of 1.3 million people for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between August 9 and 17.

This is believed to be the largest sample collection ever in the city.

High-risk groups would be prioritised for testing.

The first priority is the red group. The group includes people who live in wards and communes at very high risk of infection and people who have to travel and meet people for work.

The second priority is the orange group. The group includes people working in factories, enterprises, production facilities, traditional markets, supermarkets, hospitals and medical centres and people in risk areas according to regulations of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control.

The last priority is the green group. The group consists of people who live in “green zones”, which means pandemic-free areas in the city, who do not have to travel or come into contact with other people.

The testing drive is part of the local health sector’s efforts to detect cases, curb the outbreak and separate COVID-19 patients from the community in order to gradually control the pandemic as per the direction of the Government and the city’s Party Committee.

The funding for the tests will be drawn from the city's budget; sources of aid; support from domestic and foreign organisations and individuals and other lawful sources.

The city’s Party Committee ordered relevant agencies to urgently improve testing capacity to reach over 200,000 samples per day and return the test results as soon as possible.

The committee also tasked agencies to mobilise medical forces of the police, army and private sector to participate in taking samples, ensuring speed, accuracy, efficiency and safety.

To reach the target, chairman of the People’s Committee Chu Ngọc Anh assigned responsibility to the Health Department in testing while the city’s Centre for Disease Control was told to conduct epidemiological investigations as well as identify risk areas and the number of samples needed to be tested.

The city’s districts and towns were asked to co-ordinate in making lists, taking samples, mobilising local forces to ensure a smooth collection of samples and avoid cross infection during the collection of samples, he said. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The COVID-19 outbreak during the second quarter has hit some beer producers, especially large ones in the market.

In its second-quarter business results, Hanoi Liquor And Beverage JSC (Halico, HNR) said that its net revenue continued to drop 37 per cent year-on-year to more than VNĐ17.2 billion (US$756,574), resulting in a loss of VNĐ12.35 billion in profit after tax, nearly double the loss of VNĐ6.5 billion in the same period last year.

In the first quarter, the company posted a rise of 34 per cent in revenue to nearly VNĐ36 billion, with a loss of just VNĐ1 billion.

As of June 30, Halico lost VNĐ13.3 billion, raising the total accumulated undistributed loss to VNĐ458 billion.

Restrictions on gatherings and parties during each outbreak to contain COVID-19, along with regulations on deterring drink driving, caused a strong fall in alcohol demand.

Meanwhile, Sabeco (SAB) reported consolidated revenue in the second quarter of VNĐ7.27 trillion, similar to the same period last year. It still recorded a profit after tax of VNĐ1.2 trillion, but as expenses increased sharply during the period, the indicator dropped 12 per cent.

In the first six months of 2021, its revenue reached VNĐ13.2 trillion, up 9 per cent over the year, with profit after tax climbing 6 per cent to nearly VNĐ2.1 trillion.

Sabeco said that it has implemented many comprehensive solutions to optimise management and continue to promote sales activities, minimising the impact of the third and fourth wave of the pandemic and improving business efficiency. According to the report, the company's total advertising and promotional expenses in the first half of the year increased by 62 per cent year-on-year to VNĐ1.24 trillion.

Accounting for a large market share in the north, Habeco (BHN) also ended the second quarter with a decrease in profit over the same period.

Its financial statement showed that Habeco’s net revenue reached over VNĐ1.9 trillion, down 9 per cent compared to the second quarter of 2020.

Due to the rise in expenses, its profit after tax declined by 26 per cent over last year to VNĐ182 billion. Habeco said that the increase in expenses was mainly due to advertising, promotion, support and other expenses.

This is consistent with the plan to focus resources on promotional programmes approved by Habeco shareholders at the latest Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2021.

In the first six months of the year, Habeco achieved VNĐ3.3 trillion in net revenue and VNĐ230 billion in profit after tax, rising 15 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively.

Many small beer businesses see growing profits

Besides Sabeco, Habeco and Halico, most listed beer companies in the market are subsidiaries and joint ventures related to the branded products of Saigon Beer or Hanoi Beer.

Companies like Saigon Beer Western (WSB), Saigon - Phú Thọ Beer (BSP), SaiGon-SongLam Beer (BSL), and Sai Gon - Mien Trung Beer JSC (SMB) recorded great performance.

Accordingly, Saigon Beer Western’s net revenue and profit after tax climbed 35 per cent and 16.2 per cent, respectively, in the second quarter.

SaiGon-SongLam Beer and Sai Gon - Mien Trung Beer also recorded strong growth in profit, up 43 per cent and 29.5 per cent, respectively.

And while Saigon - Phú Thọ Beer witnessed a small fall of nearly 2 per cent, its profit after tax still gained 54 per cent during the same period. The rise in profit was mainly driven by a strong decline in expenses in financial activities and sale expenses. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Over 15 tonnes of Vietnamese frozen Ri6 durian exported to Australia by Ưu Đàm company sold out within only two days, reported the Việt Nam Trade Office in Australia.

Another batch of 45 tonnes still on the way to the country has also been fully ordered by stores.

In October 2019, the office brought half a tonne of frozen durian to Australia for the first time for a promotional campaign, inviting locals to taste the fruit on an antique car on the streets of Sydney, which created a huge effect that even newspapers in the top durian exporting country reported about the event.

With the slogan “Ri6 Durian - Another king”, Vietnamese Ri6 durian became a phenomenon when some stores in Sydney complained to the Việt Nam Trade Office in Australia because they were not approved by ASEAN Produce Company to distribute Ri6 durian.

Despite the social distancing order in Australian cities since early 2021, Ri6 remains popular. The lowest floor price is up to 18.99 AUD (US$14) per kilo for whole frozen durian and 20-25 AUD per kilo for peeled durian.

After an online conference held by the Ministry of Industry and Trade on August 6, the Việt Nam Trade Office in Australia worked with major importers to continue to import more durian and agricultural products in August. The Ưu Đàm company alone signed a memorandum of understanding with the office to ship 100-150 tonnes of Ri6 durian to Australia.

According to the office, the Vietnamese Ri6 durian has already earned a name in Australia so exporters should pay attention to maintaining the quality of their fruit. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@National Assembly deputies ratified the Europe-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the Europe-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA) on Monday morning. Vietnam News Agency spoke to various officials about the EVFTA's implementation as well as opportunities and challenges facing Việt Nam on the way to better access to the European market.

Minister of Industry and Trade Trần Tuấn Anh.

Minister of Industry and Trade (MoIT) Trần Tuấn Anh

The EVFTA is an important new-generation free trade agreement, in which Việt Nam is a party. The conclusion of negotiations, signing and ratification of the agreement came thanks to the Party's and the State's great political efforts and determination as well as smooth and effective co-ordination among ministries and sectors from grassroots.

In the context that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the production and import-export situation of not only Việt Nam but worldwide, the ratification of the EVFTA is extremely important to accelerating the process of economic recovery and directing the strategic shift of production, supply and consumption chains towards sustainability and more equilibrium for Việt Nam and EU member states.

On the business side, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the EVFTA approval and supportive methods will improve the competitiveness of Vietnamese products and businesses, providing them market diversification opportunities and helping regain growth momentum after the disease outbreak.

To ensure the effective and full implementation of the agreement, the Government has assigned the MoIT to elaborate on the major orientation and main contents of the Government's Action Plan on the Implementation of EVFTA.

The MoIT has implemented five main task groups, in which propaganda, information dissemination and awareness-raising about opportunities and challenges of the agreement have been promoted.

The ministry in collaboration with the Việt Nam Association of Small and Medium Enterprises recently held a meeting to help SMEs take advantage of opportunities and effectively implement the EVFTA. In this conference, we created truly full awareness about the opportunities, challenges and requirements for the business community to renew itself and improve competitiveness.

The MoIT has also researched and assessed the opportunities to access the EU market and each member state in particular for industries and commodities Việt Nam has advantages in or potential. Since then, it set up specific, practical and effective strategies and solutions to help businesses, especially small, medium and micro enterprises, promote goods export and deeply participates in production networks, value chains, and regional and global supply chains.

The MoIT has opened in-depth training for local managers and the business community on the important contents of the agreement, ensuring they fully understood the agreement.

We have also implemented solutions to improve competitiveness and develop human resources with support programmes, including activities of the Supporting Industry Programmes, the National Programme on Trade Promotion and the National Brand Programme. We have provided trade information to promote Việt Nam’s products and production and supply capacity, paving the way for Vietnamese enterprises to join the EU’s supply chain.

We have never had such a proactive, thorough and methodical preparation for the implementation of an FTA agreement like this. The Government has an overall Action Plan, and the MoIT has a detailed plan to organise continuous and regular implementation.

EuroCham Chairman Nicolas Audier

EuroCham Chairman Nicolas Audier

EuroCham welcomes the positive vote on the EVFTA and EVIPA in the National Assembly. The EVFTA will enter into force soon, while the EVIPA will be implemented later, following ratification in each individual EU member state. This historic milestone signals the start of a new relationship with the EU. This agreement represents a vote of confidence in Việt Nam, as it is just the second ASEAN nation to sign an FTA with the EU.

It will usher in an era of increased trade and investment, and begin the process of phasing out almost 99 per cent of tariff lines and barriers to trade over the next decade. It will also open up new markets to European investment and innovation, and promote sustainable development in Việt Nam.

The EVFTA is now more important than ever, as trade wars and a global pandemic disrupt normal business operations on an unprecedented scale. Free, fair and rules-based trade is the best roadmap to economic growth, and Việt Nam will now have privileged access to an EU consumer market of around 500 million people who will be keen to do business with and invest in a strong, secure, and prosperous nation at the heart of Asia.

Ever since negotiations for the EVFTA first began, EuroCham has been one of its strongest advocates. This agreement represents a true ‘win-win’ not just for European and Vietnamese enterprises; but also for citizens on both sides.

Now, the next step is to ensure a smooth and effective implementation. EuroCham, its 17 sector committees and 1,000 members look forward to working hand-in-hand with Việt Nam to ensure that all sides can unlock the full potential of the EVFTA now and in the future.

Director of Ho Chi Minh City Center of International Integration Support Phạm Bình An

Phạm Bình An, Director of Ho Chi Minh City Center of International Integration Support

Different from other free trade agreements, the EVFTA is a bilateral trade agreement between Việt Nam, a relatively small and developing economy with the EU, a union of 27 countries with a long development history. Therefore, Việt Nam is also given certain incentives such as the EU committed to cutting tariffs more deeply and faster to enable Vietnamese goods to reach deeper into this market. However, at the same time, it also requires Việt Nam to reform institutions, create conditions and ensure benefits for EU investors to do business in the country.

Việt Nam has commitments from the EU for the deepest tariff cuts with more than 86 per cent of tariff lines immediately. After seven years, 99.7 per cent of tariff lines will be eliminated. Then, tariff barriers will be gone but it does not mean Vietnamese goods are free to enter the EU because non-tariff barriers are challenges for Vietnamese businesses and products.

To be exported to EU, Vietnamese products must meet the criteria of intra-regional origin, meaning raw materials and products must originate from Việt Nam, the EU or other countries which already have free trade agreements with EU.

Most of the raw materials for Việt Nam’s production and export to EU are imported from China and other countries in Southeast Asia.

EU consumers also require goods to meet the values ​​of sustainable development, social responsibility, environmental friendliness, and even animal welfare factors.

Chairman of Business Association of HCM City Chu Tiến Dũng.

The EVFTA will open up great opportunities for industries such as agricultural products, food processing, furniture, textiles and garment and footwear of Việt Nam to improve competitiveness and access more deeply to hold a bigger market share in the EU market.

Meanwhile, the EVIPA will be a driving force for EU businesses and investors to promote co-operation and investment in Việt Nam. Besides capital raising, Vietnamese businesses can absorb new technologies, equipment and high-quality machines.

However, the EU is one of the markets with the most demanding quality of goods and technical standards in the world. To take advantage of tariff preferences, industries and businesses must meet rules of origin, so it is necessary to quickly find the appropriate supply of raw materials.

For activities to attract investment, Vietnamese enterprises must upgrade their capacities adequately, paying special attention to information transparency and balancing mutual benefits.

HCM City cannot compete with other provinces in attracting investment in production factory projects due to limited public land funds, but it is a centre for connecting trade, developing and providing high-quality finance, technologies and human resources services for trade and investment co-operation between Việt Nam and EU. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The event is one of the ministry’s initiatives to boost Vietnamese exports to the Halal market and built a strategic and comprehensive plan for the industry in Việt Nam. — Photo baoquocte.vn

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam needs to accelerate the development of its Halal industry in the near future in order to take full advantage of the lucrative market, said Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Quang Hiệu.

Hiệu delivered the statement at a workshop held virtually by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday. The event was one of the ministry’s initiatives to boost Vietnamese exports to the Halal market and built a strategic and comprehensive plan for the industry in Việt Nam.

Halal foods are "permitted" and "legal" products under Islamic Law with extremely detailed and strict standards.

The global Halal market has huge potential and was growing fast with promising prospects due to the Muslim population which was growing globally from Southeast Asia, South Asia to the Middle East and North Africa, Hiệu said.

He added the Halal economy was very diverse and comprised seven main sectors, including food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tourism, fashion, Islamic finance, media and entertainment. In which, food and Islamic finance were two areas less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two areas were forecast to recover and further develop after the pandemic.

Particularly, the Halal food industry covered not only production and processing but also related to many other fields such as raw materials and logistics services (preservation, packaging and transportation). Therefore, the development of the Halal food industry, or the larger Halal industry, will promote the development of ancillary services and fields.

Meanwhile, the trend of using Halal products was also increasing, even among non-Muslims because Halal products met environmental and food safety criteria.

But Hiệu said Việt Nam’s market share in the global Halal market was quite modest as Vietnamese producers had been struggling to obtain Halal certification.

According to preliminary statistics from localities, about 58.7 per cent of provinces and cities nationwide had initially exported Halal food to foreign markets while nearly 41.3 per cent failed to have certified Halal products.

Additionally, Halal standards and regulations were increasingly tightened and a Halal certification was not permanent and equally recognised by countries. Vietnamese firms were also facing stiff competition from many rivals who had already established strong footholds in the Islamic markets, Hiệu added.

However, participants at the event agreed that despite all these, the global Halal market remained promising for Việt Nam as the country held competitive edges in food production, tourism, textile and garment, and pharmaceuticals, which were dubbed pillars of the Halal economy.

It has also signed many free trade agreements (FTAs), including a number of new-generation deals, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), EU-Việt Nam FTA (EVFTA), and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

In order to not miss any chance to access the Halal market, it was critical for Việt Nam to step up international cooperation to shape suitable strategies for the development of the Halal industry, they said.

Fostering co-operation in developing regulations and standards for Halal products and Halal certification organisations in Việt Nam in harmony with that of major importing countries would be also needed. That would facilitate the trade of Halal products globally while promoting the exchange of Halal products and services of Việt Nam with global Halal markets, participants suggested.

In the future, Hiệu said, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will work closely with other ministries, agencies and sectors, research institutes and businesses and associations to draw up development strategies for Việt Nam's Halal industry, which would focus on strengthening bilateral co-operation between Việt Nam and partners on Halal products as well as signing agreements on increasing the production and distribution of Việt Nam's Halal food to key markets.

Facilitating bilateral and multilateral agreements on mutual recognition of Halal certifications and organisations granting Halal certification and seeking foreign investment in Việt Nam's Halal industry would be also prioritised.

The Global Halal Food Market Report 2021-24 published by DinarStandard estimates global halal food trade to be valued at US$129 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $140 billion by 2024.

This increasing trend was largely driven by an increase in consumer demand, followed by a rising Muslim population globally, the report said, adding that the industry was also witnessing an increasing preference for convenient, nutritionally enriched, and functional food & beverages amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Islamic economy space had also attracted the attention of top global brands creating innovative products and services across sectors. The governments of both OIC and non-OIC countries, food companies, and the private sector were making significant investments in the Halal market, according to the report. — VNS

It is 4am. Millions of people are sleeping in HCM City.

But on one side of the city, coaches and athletes of HCM City's Sport Training Centre are perspiring from hard work, with their T-shirts covered in dust. They are busy with activities such as preparing vegetables and fruit to support people in need in quarantine.

HCM City has been a national hotspot of the coronavirus for weeks. Currently thousands of positive cases are announced every day, and the city has been under lockdown since July 9.

"Dozens of tonnes of vegetables are coming here from cities and provinces. They are a gift of sponsors to us during these difficult days," said Đoàn Công Tuấn, coach for the tug of war. He is certainly in a war at the moment.

"We are here to help receive the food, divide them into portions and deliver to privileged and poor people. We have to work early in the morning to bring these fresh and green gifts to them in time," he said.

After receiving 18 tonnes of vegetables from Đà Lạt, they continue packing more than 30 tonnes of squash, marrow and peanuts, which travelled through the night to the city.

After the vegetable deliveries, they all move to the Minh Đức Secondary School in District 1 to clean the campus, which is a quarantine area for F0 patients.

"Sometime we are really exhausted but encourage each other to try harder for the day that our city clears of COVID-19. That dream helps us to continue with his meaningful work," Tuấn said.

A little way from Tuấn's place, his athlete Trần Gia Luật also has no time to rest. He is busy all the time, receiving and guiding people in District 7's Tân Quy and Tân Thuận Đông communes who are coming to have tests.

While many people help by staying and training at home under the social distancing rule, Luật converts his unexpected rest into volunteering

The three-time national champion is also student of the Phạm Ngọc Thạch University of Medicine. Following a call of the university's directorate, Luật registered to join the city campaign to resist the deadly disease outbreak.

Together with classmates, he takes part in importing data and taking samples for testing.

He also helps people to check their temperatures, declare their health status online and reminds them to follow the healthcare regulations.

"It is hot today and will heavily rain tomorrow but it cannot stop us from working. We have to use all of our ability to complete work here on time. People in other quarantine areas are waiting for us," said Luật.

"It is really meaningful work. I am happy contributing my energy to the campaign when the country needs me. We are working with a joyful mind and positive spirit. Sometimes, we are nervous when waiting for results, and then it is great to know they are okay. They are like our family members and we all yell 'negativeee!' and laugh out loud."

Support whatever and whenever

It is 11.30am. Under the strong heat of the sun, taekwondo martial artist Châu Tuyết Vân keeps working hard as a medical assistant.

In the outbreak period, all sport activities have been paused. Vân, apart from training herself, has taken part in a programme that provides taekwondo training and English courses. In her rest time, she takes off her uniform to join the COVID fight.

In Gò Vấp District, Vân puts on a protective gown, face mask and shield, gloves, shoes and head covers. She helps answer people's inquiry and instructs them in steps to be tested. She supports medical people to check temperatures, take samples, and clean the area when needed.

After Gò Vấp, she rushes to Thạnh Lộc Commune in District 12 for the same job before going to wholesale markets to deliver fresh produce to people in need.

"Sometime, people do not understand our job. They refused to do the health declaration and shout at us. We have to persuade them a lot and even force them to declare,” said Vân

"But it is just several cases. Otherwise, people love us for what we are doing. They share food and drink with us, so sweet! Their love releases our tiredness and readiness to work harder."

Due the pandemic, volunteering activities can be held anytime. Vân and her team must be ready even if it is early morning or midnight.

"It is a pandemic which is happening through the nation. Volunteers are really important to help the task force. We are athletes but also members of the community. We not only focus on training but also participate in social activities. It is a good way to perfect my personality,” said Vân.

"I know that it is not easy job, and it could put me in dangerous situation but I really want to help. Supporting people brings happiness for me and people who we help. It is my way to strengthen my country."

Recognising the importance of volunteering, former national team goalkeeper Bùi Tiến Dũng also wants to help.

The 2018 Asian U23 championship silver holder supports doctors at Thủ Đức City Hospital.

“The more I go through the more I see people's love and care for each other. Medical workers, police and many others are working hard to fight COVID-19. I believe that to live is to share. You can share whatever you have -- money, energy, love, sympathy and understanding," said Dũng.

"I want to quietly support them, heroes in the frontline against this pandemic. I wish all of them strong and good health."

HCM City FC's Dũng is currently resting as the national football premier league can only return next February.

He is member of the 'We Love Sài Gòn' charity group. With about 100 members including many footballers such as defender Đoàn Văn Hậu and striker Hà Đức Chinh, the group has given away 1,000 meals to poor people, doctors and nurse every day since it started months ago.

Earlier, Dũng and his agent Nguyễn Đắc Văn presented microwaves, high flow nasal devices, protective kits and food to field hospitals around the city.

Dũng lost his place in HCM City FC's first team because of his poor performance, but has set a target of taking his place back when the national leagues come back, and to wins head coach Park Hang-seo's belief in him for a slot in a national team that will have many international challenges in 2022.

He is one of the football stars, such as Trần Hữu Đông Triều and Nguyễn Trọng Hoàng, among many athletes supporting the country with whatever they have and whenever they can. VNS

HCM CITY – Many universities have added another admission method for candidates who are under special consideration for high school graduation this year.

The HCM City University of Economics, for example, has announced the results for students using admission methods that are independent from high school graduation 2021 exam scores.

The school added an admission method for candidates under special consideration for high school graduation in 2021. The new method is based on candidates’ 10th, 11th and 12th grade results and a number of other optional criteria such as international English certificates and prizes from provincial and city competitions, among others.

The HCM City University of Economics has reserved 200 slots for this admission method, 150 of which are for the HCM City campus and 50 for the Vĩnh Long Province branch.

The head of the training department of HCM City University of Economics, Nguyễn Khắc Quốc Bảo, said this was the university’s effort to support students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not affect the criteria of other admission methods based on high school graduation exam scores announced earlier.

The HCM City University of Medicine and Pharmacy has added another full-time university entrance method for students eligible for special consideration for high school graduation in 2021 as well.

Specifically, the school will select students based on their results of the Competency Assessment Exam of Vietnam National University, Hà Nội and Vietnam National University, HCM City in 2021, together with their high school results.

The additional enrollment quota under this method will not exceed three per cent of the target for each faculty that was previously allocated by the school.

To create favorable conditions for 12th graders under special consideration for high school graduation this year, Phạm Ngọc Thạch Medical University also added a method based on candidates’ high school results in five semesters.

Each faculty is expected to add no more than 4 per cent of the target. The admission score is the total results of Math, Chemistry and Biology, plus bonus points.

If many candidates have the same total points for admission, the school will consider the average score for Foreign Language in five semesters, the average score in the 12th grade and the average score in Literature in five semesters.

Candidates applying under this new admission method must meet certain conditions, including good “moral score", and average scores of Math, Chemistry and Biology in five semesters of 6.5 and higher. Other rules are applied for Medicine, Pharmacy and Odonto-Stomatology majors.

International University, under the Vietnam National University, HCM City, has allocated 5 to 10 per cent of the school’s target for the new admission method, while the HCM City University of Agriculture and Forestry has set aside 150 slots.

The additional admission method aims to support new candidates without affecting the interest of candidates who participated in the previous admission methods, according to many schools. – VNS

The EU-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) came into effect on August 1, becoming the most comprehensive trade agreement the European Union (EU) has concluded with a developing country in Asia.

As the bloc’s second free trade agreement signed with the ASEAN region, after Singapore, it is tipped to strengthen bilateral relations between Việt Nam and the EU significantly.

Spurred by ongoing tensions between the US and China, as well as the pandemic closing borders, a growing number of companies are shifting capital and production, with the EVFTA potentially turning Việt Nam into the manufacturing hub of Asia.

Under the deal, Việt Nam not only opens up for EU companies but also offers the bloc the best possible access to its market. Along a 10-year roadmap, nearly all tariff lines will be cut.

In the first six months of 2020, Việt Nam exported US$18.61 billion worth of goods to EU, down 8.9 per cent over the same period last year, according to official data.

The EVFTA opens a big consumption market for Vietnamese products, especially agricultural products. According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, exports to the EU are expected to increase by about 42.7 per cent by 2025 and 44.37 per cent by 2030.

As Việt Nam’s top trade partner in Europe, Germany is in prime position to benefit from the deal.

German Ambassador to Việt Nam, Dr Guido Hildner, said: “The agreement has a huge, positive impact on the relationship between Việt Nam on the one side and the European Union, including its member states, such as Germany, on the other side. It lifts up their relationship to a higher level and opens the door to more intensive co-operation.

"The agreement is not just about tariffs. It will modernise the Vietnamese economy.”

The scope of the agreement could even have a global impact on the Vietnamese trade environment.

“The agreement will bring growth in trade, not just in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality.

"If Vietnamese food producers improve the quality of their products in order to meet EU standards, in terms of safety, health, hygiene, environment, that will enable them to reach a higher export value.

"Their products will be more attractive and more competitive, not only within the EU, but also worldwide,” Dr Hildner said.

Huge milestone

One company which already has a presence in Việt Nam is B. Braun, a medical equipment manufacturer.

Torben Minko, managing director of B. Braun Vietnam and co-chairman of the German Business Association (GBA), has high hopes for the agreement.

“I think the FTA is a great milestone for us as German companies, but also for European companies, especially over the next couple of years.

"It's very important that 99 per cent of all tariff lines will be eliminated. And that, of course, will be a great opportunity for German and European products here to Việt Nam because we then are in the same playing field as other countries who already entered into free trade agreements with Việt Nam, for example, Japan, South Korea or Australia.”

With the economy taking a significant hit due to COVID-19, the EVFTA could help Việt Nam return to the high levels of growth seen in recent years.

“I believe the EVFTA will give a great boost when it comes to GDP growth, not only for Việt Nam but also for the European Union and Germany. The FTA will be a great opportunity for both countries.

“Việt Nam is even able to boost their GDP growth into a double-digit area, which is quite unique in the world,” Minko added.

Trịnh Đức Kiên, vice director of Kego Company Ltd., a producer and supplier of wooden products, said: “Talking about the advantages of the trade deal, we usually mention the tax aspect because when the trade deal goes into effect, the tax will be reduced to zero, especially for wood companies.

“However, if we assess this advantage, it doesn’t create a strong development in the near future because even before the EVFTA, companies like mine received many tax incentives when exporting to the EU. The tax is about 0 – 6 per cent, depending on products.”

For Kiên, the biggest benefit the EVFTA brings is the chance for development and advancement.

“We need to look at the general picture. Wooden products exported to other markets do not have strict rules on origin,” Kiên added.

“But now to export to the EU, we must follow their requirements, such us our disposable wooden knives, spoons and plates will need FSC certification to guarantee the wood materials are legal and traceable – only then we can export our products to the EU.”

The EU has high standards on quality, so to export goods, businesses have to meet some tough requirements. If one business meets these, it opens up possibilities in other demanding markets.

“With these requirements, businesses who want to enter the EU market must change. So it puts pressure to force us to change and develop,” Kiên said.

“And once we can sell products in the EU market, it will become our passport to let us enter other markets such as the US and Japan.”

Bright future

The deal offers a whole lot more than just tax cuts, setting the stage for a closer partnership between one of the world’s largest economies and Asia’s most exciting powerhouse.

The German Ambassador added: “The agreement is a very modern instrument. It goes beyond the question of tariffs and addresses, for instance, labour rules or environmental standards.

“So, it will bring a modernisation push to the Vietnamese economy. There is also the human dimension. The agreement will bring together people from both sides and it will open up an area for the exchange of ideas.”

Through such co-operation, the global slump of 2020 could be short-lived, and economic recovery closer than expected. — VNS

Hồng Vân & Nguyễn Thu Hà

Six decades since August 10, 1961, the day the first flight carrying Agent Orange/dioxin sprayed the chemical over southern Việt Nam as a defoliant, millions of Vietnamese people are still feeling the losses and pain caused.

Now one young Vietnamese artist born in France has created graphic designs to help people, especially the younger generation, understand more about the history and consequences of the deadly chemical.

Võ Trâm Anh's work features 10 panels about the history of Agent Orange, its consequences on humans and the environment, and a micro-credit project set up to help disabled people in the areas affected by Agent Orange in central province of Quảng Bình.

“Today images, videos, all the visual media are predominant. When you see a big bold image, it always catches your attention,” Anh told Việt Nam News in an online interview.

“To me making a big block of text into something colourful and attractive would draw people's attention even when it’s not a topic that they would have wanted to learn about in the first place.”

The exhibition will be on display at General Union of Vietnamese in France (​UGVF) in Paris until September 18.

Anh first learned about Agent Orange when she was a small child and her interest was inspired by her father.

She added: “I learned about the chemical at primary school age, like seven or eight years old. My dad is a photo journalist and he made a photo report about Agent Orange. He showed me the pictures of people who were exposed to it, consequences of people who were ill or malformed.

“I was young and shocked by these pictures. It stayed in the back of my mind somehow.”

Though six decades have passed, millions of people still bear mental and physical scars of Agent Orange.

Among 4.8 million people who were exposed to it in Việt Nam, hundreds of thousands have already died and millions of others are now suffering serious illnesses, deformities and disabilities.

A Vietnamese French woman Trần Tố Nga filed a claim in 2014 against the multinational corporations that manufactured and sold the toxin which was used by American troops during the war in Việt Nam.

Her claims were refused by France's Evry Court in May this year yet the 79-year-old former war correspondent was successful in bringing the AO issue to international public debate.

Anh, 22, is among hundreds of thousands of people across France who have voiced their support for Nga with movements and a range of advocacy activities.

She said: “The media began to talk about it [the trial] more. I remembered this and with my dad, we went to support events and followed the news.

“I want to share the fight of this woman. If people are aware of this topic, we can spread to the world, create a movement and make the world a better place if possible.”

Anh said the graphic elements would make her work more appealing.

She said: “In March this year I decided to make comic blog posts about it to make this topic more accessible and more widely known for the population.

“I think my audience is quite young so it’s the perfect way to portray the topic that is quite complex at first sight. It has a childish and colourful style, is easy to read and understand so it can make difficult topic more understandable.”

Anh said she hoped to bring her exhibition to the world.

She and the exhibition’s organisers have planned to translate her work into English, Vietnamese and German.

They are also trying to get a room at the city hall of the 13th arrondissement, home to Paris' principal Asian community.

Visitors gather at the exhibition at the General Union of Vietnamese in France.

Võ Định Kim, a representative of Collectif Vietnam Dioxine, an organiser of the exhibition, said the display is one of a series of activities to mark the 60th anniversary since Agent Orange was first used in Việt Nam.

He said this is also a way for them to tell Agent Orange stories and the suffering of the victims, so they can raise their voice against Agent Orange and fight for justice.

Though Anh was not born in Việt Nam, she has felt an urge to learn about her country of origin.

“A lot of people like me who are Vietnamese but born in France don’t really know about the topic because it’s not something you learn at school. It’s always good to have a grasp of what happened in your country of origin especially this kind of topic which I think is upsetting. It’s also very unfair,” she said. VNS

So we all had high hopes for our beloved Hồ Chí Minh City, often still referred to as Sài Gòn, its former name. But, well, you know what I'm trying to say. Times are tough. Just looking at all the devastation around the southern metropolis is enough to break the will of any man or woman.

COVID, this most vicious of airborne diseases, is reducing humans to that most basic but pivotal function of human life: breathing.

Everyone comes to life at birth with a breath, and then they exhale. If they are not able to breathe again then that is it, life is over. Your heart may still be beating, but once the lungs are not able to take in any fresh air, then it is no use even if other organs are still functioning well.

This deadly disease is an invisible enemy. It gets into your system and your cells and multiplies fast to destroy your respiratory organs. It reduces the oxygen in your blood and makes you gasp for air.

Doctors throughout the world are telling us how to combat the virus: be cautious with your breath, use facemasks as a guard, keep your distance.

In the mid-seventies Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Nhật Ánh wrote a popular poem Thành phố tình yêu và nỗi nhớ (The City of Love and Nostalgia); though it does not mention Sài Gòn directly, everyone knows what it is about. It contains the poignant lyrics, "Darling, listen, can you hear the city breathe?"

In March 1976, the writer had left Sài Gòn with thousands of other young men and women to venture further into distant lands, clearing landmines, reclaiming land, and helping to rebuild the nation. Away from the hustle and the bustle of the city, he was full of its memories: the age-old green foliage of the tamarind trees, familiar winding roads, the wharf along Sài Gòn River, images he soon set to poetry.

Composer Phạm Minh Tuấn was so moved by the words he even put them to music. As an activist, Tuấn had spent many years living in the jungle and like Ánh was also nostalgic for the great southern city. The song was eventually sung by Cẩm Vân and became an instant hit. Today, the notion of listening to the city breathing feels like a more powerful metaphor than ever before.

In 1976, reunified Việt Nam's National Assembly voted to change the name of Sài Gòn to Hồ Chí Minh City, to commemorate the founder of contemporary Việt Nam, but many in the city still refer to it by its old name, or simply as The City. The city's breath can be heard in the rhythm of its early birds, or in its workers from around the country who went there to find an opportunity, a raise or a better living.

But these days, the city is gasping for breath. Respiratory machines are needed, quite literally.

A new community Facebook group called, Nhóm cứu trợ oxy, giúp nhau mùa dịch (Oxygen Relief Group, Pandemic Help) was put together on August 5, with 850 signed up members with an active list of oxygen cylinder providers and transportation for coronavirus patients that need treatment in their homes.

The sudden surge in oxygen cylinder demand has pushed the cost up to VNĐ4 to 5 million each, though it is recommended people only buy them with a doctor’s prescription.

Patients can order oxygen as doctors prescribe, but with a daily increase in the city of around 3,000 to 4,000 patients, it is hard for a people to present their prescriptions to oxygen providers.

Since the group has been set up, many urgent calls for cylinders have been posted in the group and charitable donors have also provided oxygen cylinders free of charge, if you tell them your doctor prescribed its use.

On one hand, it is a relief to see people get what they need as fast as possible, but on the other these cylinders pose a risk insofar as they could explode if not managed well according to instructions.

Watch our video on the oxygen delivery service in HCM City

Last week, a 40-year-old father had to violate the city's curfew to venture out for an oxygen cylinder for his son, who was fighting another disease. He was arrested for his violation, but his story moved many people, including Hoàng Tuấn Anh, the creator of the country’s now famous 'Rice ATMs', which provided rice to thousands in need during the three previous coronavirus waves.

Ever the practical sort, he soon came up with an oxygen ATM machine network, teaming up with Việt Nam's Young Entrepreneurs Association and HCM City's youth union organisation to make his idea a reality.

He reportedly said that after sharing his Oxygen ATM on social media, he received an urgent call from someone who asked for help with oxygen to save their father's life.

As part of the network, volunteer delivery teams using protective gear set up oxygen cylinders near the homes of patients. Teams will set up oxygen ATM stations free of charge in all districts of Thủ Đức City. The Young Entrepreneurs Association shall provide 900 8-litre cylinders to be used at the stations

Patients who need a refill can call a hotline and volunteers will deliver to their homes. Those who need a new cylinder can borrow them free of charge.

Everyone is working their best to help the city regain its normal breath, so that it can get back to being strong and helping others again.

The city has been locked down for a long time but things can and will return to normal. For now, all we can do is stay calm, take a deep breath and keep up the fight. We are all with you. VNS
