NEW YORK — Ambassador Đặng Đình Quý, Việt Nam's Permanent Representative to the UN, has stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to avoid unexpected impacts of counter-terrorism measures on humanitarian activities.

Quý made the suggestion at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)’s virtual Arria-formula meeting on “Humanitarian action: overcoming challenges in situations of armed conflict and counter-terrorism operations” under the chair of Kenya.

The event drew the attendance of Raffi Gregorian, Deputy to the Under-Secretary-General of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Director of the UNOCT; Reena Ghelani, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)’s Director of Operations and Advocacy Division; Helen Durham, Director of International Law and Policy at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); and Ambassador Fatima Kyari Mohammed, Permanent Observer of the African Union to the UN.

The Vietnamese ambassador underlined that anti-terrorism measures must be in conformity with the UN Charter and international law.

He underlined the need for all countries to effectively implement UN resolutions, evaluate negative impacts of anti-terrorism measures right from the process of building and applying them.

The best way to protect civilians is to prevent and settle conflicts, and maintain sustainable peace, Quý stressed.

Participants were worried about the accelerating risk of terrorism in Africa, calling on the UNSC to reaffirm the requirement to protect humanitarian action space and promote dialogue and experience sharing.

They confirmed their commitments to fight terrorism, protect civilians, create optimal conditions for humanitarian activities in line with humanitarian principles, and effectively implement UN resolutions in the field. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Winne Wong, Mastercard Country Manager for Việt Nam, Cambodia & Laos, discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed Vietnamese consumers' spending habits, how it has helped drive cashless payment in the country and the lasting impact it may have on the country's transition process to cashless payment in the future.

Mastercard Country Manager - Winnie Wong

How has the pandemic changed consumer behaviours and spending habits, in particular their payment preference?

The pandemic has been changing many aspects of our life. Three years ago, when I first came to Việt Nam, cash was still the dominant payment form that people heavily relied on, as I recall it accounted for 75 - 90 per cent of the transactions.

Việt Nam then was different from countries where cashless payments have high adoption rates like Singapore, for example. With everything being cashless, I could go out and easily survive with only 2 dollars in my wallet, as I have my phone and digital payment apps like Apple Pay. However, in Việt Nam, I found myself needing a lot of cash in my wallet, which was an inconvenient practice, especially when I forgot to prepare cash in my wallet.

Since last year, we have witnessed a huge shift to digital payment, in online transactions. Due to social distancing orders, we turn to cashless or online payments in order to minimise physical contact.

This trend toward digital payment is happening across the region, according to our new payments index. At least 94 per cent of people in the Asia Pacific now consider using at least one emerging payment method such as a mobile wallet or digital currency in the coming years, a remarkable change in people’s payment preference as compared to prior to the pandemic where people hardly considered it seriously in Việt Nam.

For a population that preferred cash and cards predominantly, the pandemic really prompted the acceptance of cashless at an unprecedented pace, as from what I observed, Vietnamese people are more likely to ask if the money could be transferred, moving away from the traditional cash reliance mindset.

What other advantages do cashless payments have over traditional cash-based transactions?

We at Mastercard are advocating for cashless because we believe in the many benefits that it offers. Number one is the data from cashless transactions, which also provides great help to the government, banks, and societies in general, in planning.

For example, when you withdraw VNĐ1 million in cash from an ATM and spend it in a shop, there is no record or data of that transaction. But that kind of data is very useful for government planning or for the banks to understand their customers better so they can improve services or even expand their credit line.

For many local micro, small & medium sized enterprises (MSMEs), one of their biggest financial challenges is that they cannot get loans from the banks and must look elsewhere for funding. Such difficulty is caused by their cash-based business operations, which provides no visibility for the banks to examine the business financial capabilities other than income tax statements and financial statements. Such documents are not sufficient for banks to grant businesses a high-value loan of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they could only show a modest yearly income of ten thousand dollars.

Digital payments record a trail of transactions. Banks can look at this digital proof of money into your account and even proactively reach out to offer you credit. This is called being banked, which is not only about having a bank account, but also having access to financing and a presence in the formal economy, so as to get financing from legal entities approved by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). The data is there to protect consumers as well. For instance, if the banks overcharged consumers, SBV could step in.

It's important for such data to be available to governments and formal institutions so they can make the right decisions for people and for businesses.

As a large part of Việt Nam's population still remains unbanked or underbanked, what has Mastercard done to address this issue?

As a global company, we understand that different markets require different approaches. We focus on each market environment and seek to understand what is important to the consumers, as well as areas that we can add value to the market. It's not about Mastercard doing and winning more but about how our solutions can help the government’s cashless agenda, how we use our resources to support the government's directives, and how we cooperate with the banks, fintech companies, the SBV and other partners to drive the bigger objectives for the market.

One of the initiatives we are working on is the unbanked (individuals or households with no bank accounts) or the underbanked (individuals or households with bank accounts but rely on alternative methods to fund purchases and finance). We understand there is a large effort by Việt Nam to address this issue and we are working with our partners to find ways to leapfrog and reach these groups in the most efficient manner.

What's more important is to always ask ourselves whether we still follow the same ways as in the past. For example, the rural areas of Việt Nam have high mobile penetration and Internet penetration rates, even among the unbanked or underbanked segments. So, we try to figure out ways to leverage that advantage to drive cashless payment faster and expand it wider in a more customer-friendly and secured manner. We also put efforts into finding ways to replicate our programmes from different countries and their successes when bringing them to Việt Nam.

What can Việt Nam, as a country, do to speed up the transition to cashless payment?

Việt Nam has been driving the fourth industrial revolution, a collective priority of the whole government. The SBV also serves this goal with efforts to promote a cashless agenda, to build up the capabilities of local partners such as NAPAS, and for international institutions including Mastercard to contribute to.

As the framework for the transition is already in place, along with the fact that the government and the country itself is already welcoming the development, SBV can advance the progress by providing a sandbox - a safe testing environment - for fintech companies such as Mastercard to experiment innovative cashless solutions that are novel to Việt Nam.

It's crucial that banks can test new models and take losses with minimized or no repercussions in a safe playground. The fear of failing and facing great consequences, especially within big institutions, will inhibit innovations. Furthermore, with failure we can learn our lessons and continuously improve our methods. Therefore, providing fintech innovators the safeguard assurance of no penalty when any thing occurs during their experiment will help accelerate the digital transformation further.

HÀ NỘI — The Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) has made a final determination in its investigation into the dumping and subsidising of certain upholstered seating from China and Việt Nam, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Trade Remedies Authority of Việt Nam (TRAV).

Accordingly, out of eight Vietnamese enterprises that co-operated in the investigation, only one is subject to the anti-subsidy tax of 3.7 per cent and the rest will avoid this tax. The anti-subsidy tax rate for non-cooperating businesses is 5.5 per cent.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade attributed the positive result to the close co-operation between the ministry and relevant agencies and People's Committees of provinces and cities to collect information and answer questions from the Canadian side.

The fact that Canada believed that the majority of Vietnamese enterprises do not receive subsidies from the Government shows the transparency of the country’s policy and law enforcement. It also reflected that Việt Nam's economic sectors are operating in an equally competitive market, said the TRAV.

Regarding the anti-dumping investigation, in the CBSA’s final conclusion, most of the enterprises that co-operated in the investigation receive duty rates ranging from 10 to 20 per cent, compared to preliminary levels of 20-90 per cent.

The duty rate for those who didn’t cooperate in the investigation is up to 179.5 per cent. Meanwhile, Chinese enterprises are subject to anti-subsidy tax from 1.1 to 81.1 per cent and anti-dumping duty of between 9.3 and 188 per cent.

In addition to the CBSA's investigation into dumping and subsidising, the Canadian International Trade Court (CITT) is investigating to determine the damage to the domestic industry.

The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) is reported to continue its inquiry to determine whether the imports are harming Canadian producers. It is expected to issue a decision by September 2.

According to the Canadian data, during the investigation period of the case from June 2019 to the end of September 2020, the export turnover of upholstered seats from Việt Nam to Canada reached approximately US$135.6 million, accounting for 10.08 per cent of Canada's total imports of this item.

The TRAV has urged the concerned exporters to keep a close watch on the case and fully co-operate with the CBSA during its investigation. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — HCM City, the current COVID-19 epicentre of Việt Nam, will extend its strict social distancing measures for another month until September 15 given the risk of a resurgence, Phan Văn Mãi, vice secretary of the city's Party Committee, said on Sunday.

Speaking at a meeting to receive goods and necessities for people affected by the pandemic in HCM City, Mãi said the pandemic could become more severe if the city relaxes its vigilance.

“Therefore, it’s essential that social distancing be applied to reduce the number of new cases and gradually bring the city to a 'new normal' state", he said.

In order to do so, people's awareness is the most important factor, he emphasised.

Mãi said the city has gone 80 days since the fourth wave of infections broke out with the Delta mutation. The period of social distancing, especially the five weeks of tightening Government’s Directive 16, were "unprecedentedly difficult" days for the political system and people.

The city has made great efforts to control outbreaks and infection chains, removing hundreds of locked down areas, promoting control of red zones, as well as expanding green zones. The health sector also cured more than 70,000 people and administered vaccines for over 4.5 million people.

With the spirit of making all efforts to take care of people, the city has tried its best to reduce difficulties, while ensuring the supply of goods and issuing support packages.

Mãi said the pandemic in HCM City has been partially controlled but is still very complicated; the number of infections is still high; the treatment system is overloaded and its operation is not synchronous. The process of receiving and treating COVID-19 cases is sometimes not efficient and the death rate has not decreased.

He said the Government’s requirement to control the pandemic by September 15 is challenging, but it was the common desire of the people. Leaders of the city affirmed maximum priority towards pandemic prevention, while putting the health and life of the people first and foremost.

To achieve this goal, Mãi said HCM City will focus on implementing four main tasks.

The first is to thoroughly apply social distancing, limiting the source of infection, each person and each household must strictly comply with the requirements of social distancing and the 5K message.

"The pathogen remains widespread in the community, close contacts make it more easy to spread, and that could be very dangerous for people with weak immune systems, the elderly, or those with underlying medical conditions,” he said.

Secondly, the city takes good care of people's lives in the coming days of social distancing, ensuring people’s needs for goods and necessities are met.

The city will mobilise all possible resources to deploy welfare packages for the poor, elderly people who live alone, freelance workers who lost their jobs, to ensure the basic life of people until they return to a “new normal” life.

Third, the city will focus on effective treatment strategies, reducing mortality. The city is expanding the number of hospitals and treatment facilities to meet the needs of emergency, oxygen support, medical care and deploying F0 home treatment.

Fourth, the city is speeding up vaccination to achieve herd immunity. However Mãi emphasised that even when the vaccination rate is high, implementing the 5K message is still a requirement.

The need to impose social distancing for one more month was also noted earlier on Saturday by Secretary of HCM Party Committee Nguyễn Văn Nên at a conference about assessment of pandemic prevention and control results after two weeks of implementing Directive 12, issued by the HCM City Party Committee's Standing Commission on strengthening several measures to implement the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic in HCM City.

The city has implemented the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 on social distancing rules since July 9 and started to impose even more restrictions from July 24 to contain spread of the virus.

On July 23, the Municipal People's Committee decided to extend the application of social distancing measures until August 1.

On August 1, the city issued a decision on imposing city-wide social distancing measures under the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 for an additional 14 days from 0:00 on August 2. — VNS

Vietnamese deputy foreign minister Nguyễn Quốc Dũng talks about the outcomes of the 54th Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (AFMM-54) and Related Meetings last week. The agenda ranged from COVID-19, to the digital economy and the South China Sea.

What can you tell us about the main highlights of this series of ASEAN meetings?

The meetings took place as ASEAN faces numerous serious challenges, from the resurgence of COVID-19 with the new, more dangerous variant, to increasing strategic competition in the region, South China Sea issue, and the Myanmar situation.

In the face of all of these, the meeting highlighted the increasing role and resolve of ASEAN, and that other countries in the region and in the world are committed to respecting the role of ASEAN in Southeast Asia.

With regards to the Myanmar situation, the meeting has made progress in further concretising the five-point consensus reached by ASEAN leaders in their special meeting in late April and arriving at the appointment of Brunei’s Second Minister of Foreign Affairs Erywan Pehin Yusof as ASEAN Special Envoy to Myanmar. Decisions were also made with regards to the implementation of humanitarian support for Myanmar via the ASEAN Human Assistance Coordinator under the leadership of the ASEAN General Secretary.

Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, ASEAN has affirmed the continuation of cooperation plans. It has also received cooperation commitments from its partners to help the regional grouping deal with the pandemic, vaccine supply, as well as help in terms of economic recovery plans.

In terms of diplomatic relations, ASEAN partners all recognise and support the role of ASEAN, and are respectful of ASEAN opinions, especially in this time of hardship.

Countries are eager to align their strategies and policies with regional cooperation and ASEAN's Indo-Pacific Outlook.

It could be said that through the series of meetings last week, ASEAN’s diplomatic ties have been consolidated a great deal.

What were the initiatives Việt Nam proposed to promote consensus in ASEAN on handling its challenges?

On the back of a successful ASEAN Chairmanship in 2020, Việt Nam continues to promote the results of the many initiatives that we set out last year, intertwined with Việt Nam’s interests in the ASEAN agenda – including sub-regional cooperation.

Việt Nam has also played a very active role in solving problems, difficulties and deadlocks because of different views and opinions during the meeting. It was Việt Nam that made many proposals and lobbied countries to come to an agreement on Myanmar, on Myanmar's special envoy, as well as on reaching consensus for Britain to become a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN.

We have also pushed for ASEAN Dialogue Partners to step up commitment with ASEAN in terms of vaccine support, including supply and technology transfers.

Despite the difficulties caused by the pandemic, how has ASEAN made progress in its efforts to implement the ASEAN Community Vision 2025?

COVID-19 is a huge challenge that demands the utmost focus of all countries. Still, ASEAN community building is progressing. We are glad that the ASEAN Community blueprint for 2025 has been rolled out evenly across all pillars. A total of 96 per cent of the action items of the political-security community have been acted upon. The economic pillar has been 88 per cent completed. The socio-cultural pillar has been 72 per cent completed. Those are very encouraging results.

The plans set out, such as implementing the ASEAN Community’s Post-2025 Vision, has seen ASEAN establish a roadmap and a High-Level Task Force to implement this goal, as well as continue to carry out an assessment of the implementation of the ASEAN Charter.

It can be said that the group is paying sufficient attention to conduct the tasks set out for this year.

Speaking of vaccines, it was certainly a hot topic in the discussions. Currently, how has the ASEAN COVID-19 Response Fund been used?

The fund was set up last year and so far it has US$20.5 million in contributions from member countries and ASEAN Dialogue Partners.

ASEAN has decided to allocate $10.5 million to buy COVID-19 vaccines for member countries through UNICEF. Currently, the agreement between ASEAN and UNICEF is being finalised. We hope it will be concluded soon.

In terms of post-pandemic recovery, what agreement has ASEAN reached through this meeting?

Firstly, ASEAN is determined not to allow disruptions to the supply chain, and to well maintain the transactions and trade with countries, and create the highest possible conditions in this situation for businesses to keep up investment and trade.

ASEAN will promote cooperation for digital transformation. The ASEAN ministers in charge of digital cooperation have approved the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025, which is a huge step forward that would propel member countries to boost e-commerce.

At the same time, ASEAN is determined to take advantage of the signed agreements on free trade and agreed to attempt to ratify the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as soon as possible.

Security, maritime and airspace security in the South China Sea (known in Việt Nam as the East Sea) was high on the agenda. What have been the converging points that ASEAN and its partners have arrived at?

The South China Sea still has its issues but ASEAN remains committed to its consistent principles, which are supporting and underlining the need to maintain peace, security, freedom of flight and navigation in the region and build trust. Countries must also exercise restraint and refrain from actions that could escalate tensions, militarise or build up artificial islands, or any action that could undermine the rights and interests of other littoral countries.

The participating countries strongly agreed to uphold the role of international law, especially emphasising that the 1982 UNCLOS is the framework to govern the activities and use of the world’s seas and oceans.

Importantly, participating countries also concurred that the Code of Conduct (COC) of Parties in the South China Sea must be substantive, comprehensive and consistent with international law, especially UNCLOS.

What's new is that China has now accepted the ASEAN position/principles and that will guide the COC negotiation process between the two sides in the coming time. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam administered over 1.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, the highest one-day increase since the country starts its vaccination campaign on March 8, according to the health ministry's report on Wednesday.

The total doses given in Việt Nam reached 11,341,864 and the number of fully vaccinated people crossed the mark of 1 million (1,036,102 specifically) as of Tuesday.

The country has currently received some 18.7 million doses of vaccines of various types, mostly AstraZeneca and Moderna.

Up to 2.5 million doses of Moderna along with 250,000 doses of Sinopharm, donated by the US and Chinese governments respectively, would remain in storage until second doses are given.

The health ministry said that 72 per cent of the received doses have been distributed.

According to the National Government Portal on COVID-19 Vaccination, HCM City, the epicentre of the fourth wave of infections and which has been allocated the most vaccines, is leading the race with over 3.5 million doses administered. The southern city has given at least one jab to 51.66 per cent of the official population over 18 years old (around 7 million).

Hà Nội, also the recipient of a large number of vaccines, has administered about 1.5 million doses, with 25.41 per cent of the population getting at least one vaccine shot.

Health Minister Nguyễn Thanh Long, during a meeting on Tuesday, has asked for close collaboration between the medical sector and the army as vaccines will come in great quantity especially in the final months of the year, including vaccines like Pfizer which need to be preserved in strict conditions.

The Health Ministry issued a document on scheduled allocation of vaccines for localities between now and year’s end to ensure vaccination progress.

Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Huy Dũng said more than 2.4 million people downloaded the electronic health record app.

Minister Long suggested the Ministry of Information and Communications soon launch a campaign to call on residents to download the app, fill in health declarations, register for vaccination, as well as issue vaccination certificates via software.

All 63 cities and provinces have so far updated data on the software.

Helicopters to transport COVID-19 vaccines

Military forces are ready to be on duty around the clock and mobilise helicopters to transport COVID-19 vaccines to islands and disadvantaged areas, according to Deputy Minister of Defence Vũ Hải Sản.

Minister of Health Nguyễn Thanh Long said receiving, transporting and storing vaccines have been implemented resolutely by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the army. They established eight cold storages facilities to keep and preserve vaccines with a total capacity of 60 million doses.

He added that 63 trucks with cold storage capabilities have been delivered to the army to transport vaccines to localities as scheduled.

Deputy minister Sản added that the Ministry of Defence has mobilised and trained staff and prepared vehicles to be ready to transport vaccines when needed.

The ministry would have transportation plans right after more doses of vaccines arrive in Việt Nam, he said. — VNS

HCM CITY — The Sài Gòn Hi-tech Park Business Association has sought city authorities’ permission for its workers to travel to work from home since organising accommodation on-site for them is difficult.

Since July 15 businesses at the park in District 9 have been providing accommodation to workers as mandated by the city, either in their premises or other lodging places nearby.

Besides the enormous cost, they are also facing problems such as vehicles transporting staff or meals getting stuck at checkpoints, delaying work and stressing workers.

Many skilled personnel needed by their employers are also stuck at home, and their availability again would help restore production.

According to the association, long term solutions are needed to reconcile the strict distancing requirements under Directive 16 with the financial and psychological burden on businesses and staff.

In the event, it has suggested a pilot initiative allowing key, experienced workers at two businesses who have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose to commute to work from home between July 16 and 30.

They have to sign commitments to only travel to their home and workplace, and strictly follow pandemic regulations. Their movements will be monitored by an application or other methods.

Their workplace will be separated from the other workers’.

Their family members too will not be allowed to leave home during the duration of the trial, and will be tested at home for COVID.

The two businesses will transport them and frequently test them.

The pilot will continue even if some test positive as long as their number is less than 10 per cent of the total.

The plan has been submitted to the park management board and HCM City Business Association. Hồ Thị Thu Uyên, head of SBA, hoped it would help the Government and businesses overcome the pandemic.

HÀ NỘI — The 28th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF-28) took place virtually on August 6 as part of the 54th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting (AMM 54) and Related Meetings.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Bùi Thanh Sơn led the Vietnamese delegation to the forum, which gathered representatives from 27 countries.

Exchanging views on the ARF’s future direction, participating countries reaffirmed the importance of the ARF as a leading forum for promoting dialogue and constructive co-operation regarding security issues in the region. They supported the ARF in enhancing its actions and continuing to play an important role in the regional architecture with ASEAN at the centre.

The meeting approved 38 activities for 2021-22 in such areas as peacekeeping, marine waste, the law of the sea and fisheries, and ferry traffic safety. In particular, Việt Nam will co-chair some of them, including those on strengthening co-operation on law enforcement at sea; security and safety standards in the use of nuclear energy; and disease response and recovery.

On international and regional issues, the forum shared a common perception on the importance of peace, security, stability, safety and freedom of navigation and overflight in the East Sea.

Participating foreign ministers reaffirmed the principles of settling disputes in the waters by peaceful measures and self-restraint, as well as upholding international law.

They underscored the full implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC) and welcomed new progress in building an effective and efficient Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC) in line with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Speaking at the meeting, Sơn said over the past three decades, ARF has proven its values and strength in promoting dialogues, co-operation and trust building in the region.

Expressing his concern over socio-economic impacts caused by COVID-19, the minister called for joint efforts against the pandemic, and suggested partners in ARF, especially countries that are taking the lead in vaccine production, continue their co-operation with ASEAN to ensure fair and equitable vaccine access and facilitate the transfer of vaccine production technology.

For the East Sea issue, he reiterated the principle stance of ASEAN and Việt Nam, and stressed the significance of promoting trust, exercising restraint, and taking no actions that would complicate the situation and harm the maritime environment.

Disputes and differences should be resolved through peaceful measures in line with international law and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982 UNCLOS), he said.

The minister affirmed that Việt Nam will actively work with other ASEAN member countries and China to build an effective and substantive Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC) in accordance with international law and the 1982 UNCLOS.

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s approach and initiatives laid out by Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính’s at the United Nations Security Council High-level Open Debate on “Enhancing Maritime Security - A Case for International Cooperation” earlier this week have drawn appreciation from international experts, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reports.

Mr. James Rogers, co-founder and Director of Research at the UK's Council on Geostrategy, who specialises in British geostrategic and maritime power, and Euro-Atlantic, Indo-Pacific and Polar geopolitics, in an interview with the VNA correspondent in the UK, agreed with PM Chính’s emphasis on the fact that given the significance of the sea for the system of international commerce, it was important to keep it open and free for access by all countries.

Mr. Rogers said although most countries had signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which governs the behaviours that countries can undertake at sea, some countries had ignored rules and regulations they subscribed to in the past. That was the problem for all countries, not just those around the South China Sea (called the East Sea in Việt Nam), he said.

The British expert acknowledged the importance of regional coordination for maritime security in the South China Sea as proposed by PM Chính, pointing out that this should be facilitated not only in the UN, but also in ASEAN, particularly in relation to regulations of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. He also pointed to the necessity for a coordination mechanism that encourages countries to uphold important maritime norms established through the UNCLOS system.

He agreed with the Vietnamese PM's point that regulations and conduct of states at sea must comply with both the UN Charter and UNCLOS system, saying that any additional future policy or proposals in relation to the East Sea security and maritime rights must correspond to these rules and regulations that the countries have subscribed to.

He said it was very good seeing Việt Nam as an important regional power and close partner with many different countries in the world, including the UK, taking the lead in bringing this issue to international attention. He also acknowledged the role of Việt Nam and its support and leadership in dealing with security issues in the South China Sea, given the country's important location.

Regarding maritime security cooperation between Việt Nam and the UK, Mr. Rogers said the two countries would have many different opportunities in the coming years given the UK's increasing presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

He said the UK's deployment of the carrier strike group (CSG 21) in the region demonstrated that the country was undertaking its tilt towards the Indo-Pacific, which was put forward in the UK government's integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy released in March this year.

He pointed out that the UK understands the strategic significance of the Indo-Pacific and the South China Sea in Southeast Asia in particular, and therefore, takes the region seriously when deploying its largest and most powerful maritime group in the region.

As the UK intends to deploy later this year two patrol vessels permanently in the region beyond the periodic deployment, which will interact with regional partners, of which Việt Nam is an important one, Mr. Rogers said he saw the prospect for enhancing Việt Nam-UK cooperation.

Lauding Việt Nam’s proposals, Professor Giuseppe Cataldi from the University of Naples “L’Orientale”, who is President of the International Association of Maritime Law, reiterated Việt Nam’s call for relevant parties to intensify dialogue and cooperation and respect for international law, particularly the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Agreeing with Việt Nam’s view that UNCLOS is the "Constitution" of the seas and oceans, Cataldi said that countries needed to comply with the provisions of this original legal document and avoid unilateral actions that may escalate current maritime disputes.

Dr. Antonio Albanese, expert in world geopolitics, director of AGC Communication, assessed that Việt Nam’s proposals not only showed the universality in the global context, but also contributed to promoting a substantive approach to solving specific problems of the region. Việt Nam had affirmed its support for ensuring maritime security based on clear and consistent rules within the UN framework and concretised into common codes of conduct, he stated.

Việt Nam’s stance of resolutely opposing any unilateral actions and seeking multilateral and peaceful solutions was a suitable choice for the interests of each country and the globe’s common interests, thus ensuring equal access for all countries, especially in the fields of international trade and navigation, he added.

As an expert in Asian geopolitics, Prof. Antonio Fallico, President of the Conoscere Eurasia Association in Veneto, stated that Việt Nam’s proposals clearly demonstrated a foreign policy of peace and cooperation and its responsibility for regional and international stability and security.

From the Czech Republic, Dr. Takashi Hosoda, an expert on Việt Nam and the Asia-Pacific from the country’s Charles University, said that PM Chính’s speech could be considered an important milestone for the relations between Việt Nam and India because the Prime Minister of India – the rotating Chairman of the UN Security Council – was the one who took the initiative to organise, and also presided over the UNSC meeting.

Việt Nam and India played increasingly important roles in ensuring the maintenance of maritime security in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific as well as resolving issues related to peace and security in the region. The two countries also shared many strategic similarities, so it was important for Việt Nam to enhance cooperation with India, Hosoda stated.

He spoke highly of the proposals made by the Vietnamese Government leader to contribute to solving maritime security challenges, especially the need for the international community to raise awareness of the importance of maritime security as well as threats to marine security.

To that end, the expert suggested Việt Nam make specific contributions within the bilateral and multilateral cooperation frameworks, including the cooperation mechanisms between the European Union (EU) and Asian countries such as the EU Critical Maritime Route Wider Indian Ocean (CRIMARIO).— VNS

TOKYO — Vietnamese Ambassador to Japan, Vũ Hồng Nam, paid a working visit to Niigata to foster economic partnerships between the Japanese prefecture and Vietnamese localities.

During the trip on Tuesday, Ambassador Nam met with Niigata Governor Hideyo Hanazumi, expressing his hope that COVID-19 will be controlled soon, so that businesses of both countries can promote their co-operation activities.

Hideyo Hanazumi said that the Niigata administration and other localities highly value the Vietnamese Embassy's role in connecting firms of Niigata and Việt Nam, and pledged to create optimal conditions for improving investment efficiency.

At a talk with leaders of Sanjo city in Niigata and a number of local firms investing in Việt Nam, Nam said that Vietnamese consumers are interested in steel products of Japan, expressing his hope that the city will continue to support businesses investing in Việt Nam, especially in overcoming the pandemic.

Sanjo Mayor Ryo Takizawa said that the city is pleased to become the major unit to implement co-operation projects using the Japanese government's ODA in Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Province through the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA).

Takizawa said that the Sanjor Chamber of Commerce and Industry signed a cooperation document on human resources training with the Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Department of Industry and Trade in 2017.

Local firms in Sanjo spoke highly of online exchange events between business communities of Sanjo and Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu in May.

HCM CITY — More medical personnel from other provinces are being deployed in HCM City, Việt Nam’s COVID-19 epicentre, as the burden on hospitals worsens and as the city considers paying recovered COVID-19 patients, who have high natural immunity, to help with prevention and control activities.

The city is in need of 12,000 more personnel, including doctors and nurses who can treat symptomatic patients with underlying medical conditions from the second to fifth levels. Medical staff skilled in resuscitation and intensive care are especially needed.

Many hospitals are struggling to care for more COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 Resuscitation Hospital set up in Thủ Đức City, which has admitted over 1,000 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, is in dire need of more medical personnel since the number of patients admitted has exceeded its capacity.

Trần Thanh Linh, deputy head of Chợ Rẫy Hospital's intensive care unit and deputy director of COVID-19 Resuscitation Hospital, said the latter was designed to have 500 beds for its first phase, but currently it is already treating around 600 patients.

It has been receiving personnel from Chợ Rẫy Hospital and is working on improving its treatment capacity to 700 hospital beds.

While medical equipment there is still able to satisfy demand, more machinery and medicines will be needed in the future, he said.

Sixteen field hospitals have been established to treat the rising number of F0 (infected) cases. The Phú Nhuận COVID-19 No. 1 Field Hospital, for example, was put into service on August 12 in Phú Nhuận District.

The hospital treats second and third-level patients according to the city’s five-level admission and treatment plan for COVID-19 patients. The patients at the hospital include symptomatic cases with underlying medical conditions who may become moderately or severely ill.

With 350 beds, including 60 beds for resuscitation, and a wide variety of medical equipment, it aims to reduce the number of worsening F0 cases who need to be transferred to hospitals for specialised medical intervention, alleviating stress on such facilities.

The field hospital currently has 65 medical staff treating more than 20 patients.

Dr. Tăng Chí Thượng, deputy director of HCM City’s Department of Health, said that city districts must be proactive in finding, admitting and monitoring local F0 cases.

According to the HCM City Centre for Disease Control, the city has nearly 58,000 medical staff and 20,000 personnel involved in the fight against COVID-19.

More than 4,000 personnel are from central hospitals and other hospitals in provinces and cities, and there are tens of thousands of volunteers.

Help from recovered patients

Chairman of HCM City People’s Committee Nguyễn Thành Phong has asked the Health Department to suggest payment policies for recovered COVID-19 patients who could help the city in COVID prevention and control activities.

The city has a total of 65,135 COVID-19 patients who have been discharged from hospitals since January.

Vice Director of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases Nguyễn Trung Cấp told Vietnam News Agency that most people who have recovered from COVID-19 are likely to be immune for several months afterwards. One study concluded that immune responses from past infections reduced the risk of reinfection by 83 per cent for at least five months.

However, even though the COVID-19 reinfection rate is low, it is still possible, so people recovering from COVID-19 must take preventive measures and get vaccinated as soon as possible, Cấp said.

Phong has also asked city departments to conduct a survey on human resources and medicine at designated hospitals and, based on the results, make decisions about the best use of staff, medicine and transfer of COVID-19 patients.

The city also asked the Ministry of National Defence and the Government’s special task force to add more doctors and nurses to field hospitals and COVID-19 treatment hospitals, and increase contact tracing, testing, and the number of vaccination sites.VNS

HÀ NỘI – Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính on Saturday launched a special emulation movement that appeals to people nationwide to stay united and join in efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The campaign was launched at the first meeting of the Central Emulation and Rewards Council in the 2021- 26 tenure in Hà Nội.

PM Chính, who is also Chairman of the council, said the COVID-19 pandemic, with the emergence of new variants that are more contagious and dangerous, has been developing in many localities, causing serious impacts on society, the economy, and people’s lives. It may last a long time and is posing major challenges to the pandemic fight and socio-economic recovery efforts.

He asked authorities at all levels, organisations, agencies, localities, and people across the country to focus on the key tasks of encouraging all people to actively join the COVID-19 fight so as to successfully contain the virus and protect people’s health and lives, while promoting production and business activities to help boost economic recovery and development, create resources for the combat, and guarantee social security, especially for the disadvantaged.

At the same time, he emphasised the importance of the implementation of the motto “speedy tracing, fast zoning, reasonable testing, effective treatment, stopping the spread of infections”.

Chính said the entire political system would continue to focus on pandemic prevention and control. Party committees and authorities at all levels must uphold their responsibility in the spirit of creativity, daring to think, daring to do, and daring to take responsibility. They must create consensus among people, be proactive, flexible, apply pandemic prevention and control solutions, and have plans and scenarios to promptly respond in all situations.

Frontline forces, including officials, medical staff, army, police and volunteer teams, should continue to show they're willing to stand strong in difficult times with enthusiasm and dedication to the community, Chính said.

Enterprises and entrepreneurs of all economic sectors are encouraged to promote patriotism, consensus, solidarity, and efforts to overcome difficulties and challenges, maintaining and stabilising production to ensure labourers’ incomes.

The Government leader expressed his belief that with the common efforts and the unanimity of the entire Party, people, and army, along with support from overseas Vietnamese and the international community, the country will defeat the pandemic and soon return to the new normal.

At the meeting, the PM’s decision on appointments of officials to the Central Emulation and Rewards Council was announced.

Accordingly, the council comprises 19 members. Its vice chairpersons are President of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee Đỗ Văn Chiến, Vice President Võ Thị Anh Xuân, Minister of Home Affairs Phạm Thị Thanh Trà, and President of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour Nguyễn Đình Khang.

Participants also discussed draft working regulations of the council, task outcomes in the first seven months of 2021, and the key duties for the remaining months of this year. — VNS

The capital city is currently placed under Directive 16 at least until August 23, pending renewal, in bid to curb COVID-19 spread. — VNA/VNS Photo Thành Đạt

HÀ NỘI — Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính stressed the importance of accelerating testing and ‘filtering’ all COVID-19 cases out of the community during lockdown period in a bid to soon lift restrictions and restore economic activities.

He made the order on Sunday via a videoconference with cabinet members and leaders of 36 provinces and cities that are currently placed under lockdown in line with Government’s Directive 16, including major urban centres like Hà Nội, HCM City, and Đà Nẵng.

Chính commended localities who have introduced additional measures “higher than Directive 16” earlier than required to quickly head off a surge of infections, depending on their specific situation.

With the efforts of all stakeholders, the lockdown for the last month has led to some initial positive results that lay the foundation for better outcomes in the future, but overall, the stated objectives have not been accomplished, the Government leader said.

PM Chính noted that prevention and control measures are unprecedented so it’s better to be learning as we go.

He required localities to set out a clear plan, a set of objectives, and measures to achieve that roadmap.

With a current shortage of vaccines and lack of specific treatment medicines for COVID-19, we have to pursuit lockdown and social distancing measures to not let outbreaks continue for a long time, allowing attention to be focused on economic development, to create the resources for long-term prevention and control efforts and ensure people’s livelihoods, avoid economic and health crises, PM Chính said, as Việt Nam does not have abundant resources and a strong economy like developed nations

According to the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, after 26 days of Directive 16 in the 19 cities and provinces of the southern region, 216,719 cases of COVID-19 have been recorded as new cases found through screening in the community are trending down.

Health minister Nguyễn Thanh Long said during the social distancing period, there have been localities that have not enforced the rules seriously enough, demanding HCM City and southern region pursue restrictions at the highest level to reduce new cases and improve admission of COVID-19 patients to bring down the death rate.

While praising the efforts of localities with severe outbreaks like HCM City, Bình Dương, and Đồng Nai, PM Chính noted the situation remains complicated, and the highest priority, for now, is the containment of outbreaks, and even in ‘safe zones’, economic and production activities must be mindful of health measures.

He asked localities to strictly enforce lockdown measures in the spirit of ‘stay where you are’ to avoid transmission, conduct testing and isolation of COVID-19 cases, and make use of the ‘golden window’ that is the lockdown period to contain the virus.

The PM wants health authorities to issue instructions for businesses and the public to conduct self-testing.

Localities, based on their situation and conditions, could allow the quarantine of COVID-19 cases and their contacts at home but must monitor these cases to avoid spreading the virus to their relatives and to the community. Localities with few cases should still go with centralised quarantine strategy.

With regards to treatment, PM Chính requested localities prepare adequate human resources, medical supplies, and logistics to treat patients and minimise deaths and study and pilot treatment of COVID-19 patients at home in a way that ensures safety and effectiveness.

The Ministry of Health must continue to mobilise, train and allocate more health workers to hotspots and improve the capacity of the district health level.

Hospitals must immediately eliminate unnecessary administrative procedures and prioritise saving lives before serious cases could develop, in the spirit of "admission and first aid first, procedures later”.

In terms of vaccinations, PM Chính asked for faster administration of COVID-19 vaccines for priority groups, especially people over 50, consider setting up separate vaccination sites for those in that age group, and buy vaccines approved for use in children.

He stressed that the State provides vaccines for all people free of charge. The Government permits businesses and local governments to look for vaccine supplies, but the health ministry would be in charge of quality controls, licensing storage, and free administration for all people.

The Government leader reiterated the demand to not let have anyone go without food, essential goods, and medical attention. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs should coordinate to see how to distribute social welfare packages directly to people in need.

Local political organisations, as well as the police and military units, must listen to the people’s feedback and requests and aspirations to

quickly handle any arising situations as well as ensuring security and order in the society.

PM Chính also asked localities and ministries to coordinate and remove all barriers that disrupt trade, ensure smooth flow of goods – especially essential goods for people and raw materials for production for experts, listen to feedback from businesses to quickly remedy their measures and restrictions, and have policies in place for businesses to support the implementation of the three on-site model (working, eating, resting at the factory/workplace).

He urged localities to prepare scenarios in cases more restrictive measures might be needed to contain outbreaks. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The official visit to Laos by President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc and his wife will reaffirm Việt Nam’s strong and comprehensive support to the process of national reform, defence and construction of Laos.

It will take place on Monday and Tuesday at the invitation of Thongloun Sisoulith, General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) Central Committee and President of Laos.

The visit will highlight Việt Nam’s attention to maintaining and developing the great friendship, special solidarity and comprehensive partnership between the two countries.

As neighbours, Việt Nam and Laos have walked hand in hand through many challenges, reinforcing their solidarity and loyalty. The bilateral ties, founded by President Hồ Chí Minh and President Kaysone Phomvihane and nurtured by generations of leaders and people of both nations, have been thriving to be “more stable than mountains, more long-lasting than rivers.”

Relations have become a factor ensuring the success of the revolutionary cause of each country and a valuable asset of both Parties and nations, which must be protected and reinforced and transferred to next generations, Vietnamese Party General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng said while receiving Lao Party General Secretary and President Thongloun Sisoulith on June 28, 2021.

Amid complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic, the two countries have managed to maintain visits and communication in different formats.

Defence-security and external relations have continued to be important pillars, with joint efforts ensuring security and maintaining a shared border of peace and friendship as well as searching and repatriating remains of Vietnamese volunteers and experts who died in Laos during the war.

The two sides have effectively implemented the annual consultation mechanisms between Chairpersons of the Party Central Committee’s Commissions for External Relations and Ministers of Foreign Affairs, while regularly exchanging information about regional and international issues of mutual concern, and coordinating together and promoting mutual support at multilateral forums, especially within the ASEAN, the UN and sub-regional mechanisms.

In the context of complicated COVID-19 developments in both countries, the bilateral multifaceted partnership has still developed.

In the 2016-20 period, trade reached US$4.8 billion. In the first six months of 2021, the figure hit $670 million, up 36.5 per cent over the same period last year.

Vietnam now has 209 valid investment projects worth about $5.16 billion in Laos, ranking third among foreign investors in the country.

The Lao Government has agreed to open the Dak Ta-Ok (Xekong)–Nam Giang (Quảng Nam) border gate to promote trade exchanges between the two sides.

Along with expanding export activities, both sides have focused on cooperation in personnel training for transport and construction and energy industry.

They both have concentrated on enhancing partnership in education-training and human resources development. The two Ministries of Education and Training have issued plans of cooperation in the 2021-30 period. This year, Việt Nam will give 1,220 scholarships to Lao officials and students, while Laos will offer 60 scholarships to Việt Nam. More than 16,600 Lao students are already studying in Việt Nam.

Partnerships among localities, especially those along the shared border have been strengthened.

People-to-people exchanges have been increased with various cultural, art and sports activities, contributing to deepening the Vietnam-Laos relationship. — VNS

HCM CITY – The Ministry of Health plans to pilot an initiative to have COVID-19 patients treated at home with medicines, health supplements and care instructions in HCM City from August 16 at a time when COVID-19 treatment facilities are becoming overwhelmed.

Tests will be carried out at home and in the community and medicines and health supplements will be provided to patients and closely monitored by medical experts.

Food and groceries will be provided to households with patients since their family members will not be allowed to step out.

The ministry will provide detailed guidelines for taking care of patients, monitoring their health and seeking medical assistance if their condition worsens.

Helping COVID patients at home access medical care in time, thus reducing the burden on treatment facilities and fatality rates is of utmost importance, according to the ministry.

Minister of Health Nguyễn Thanh Long said home care would reduce the chance of pandemic spread.

HCM City has been trialling a programme to have asymptomatic patients quarantining at home since mid-July.

Phan Văn Mãi, deputy secretary of the city Party Committee, said medical facilities’ capacity has already been exceeded though the pandemic situation remains dire.

There is also a need for 12,000 more doctors and nurses to treat symptomatic patients with underlying medical conditions.

The city is focusing on reducing the death rate in the next 30 days.

The ministry has updated its treatment regime based on global case studies and the pandemic situation, which indicates that nearly 80 per cent of patients have few or no symptoms.

After piloting it in HCM City, the ministry will consider expanding it to the rest of the country.

According to the HCM City Centre for Disease Control, as of Saturday there were more than 35,000 COVID-positive people quarantined and monitored at home, and another 13,000 in quarantine facilities.

The city is the country’s pandemic epicentre with more than 144,000 cases by 6pm, Saturday. – VNS

Robyn Mudie*

Việt Nam’s year as ASEAN Chair has taken place during an unprecedented time in modern history. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented us collectively with new threats, both to our health security and our economies. Việt Nam has managed the many challenges posed by this situation, including in its capacity as ASEAN Chair, skilfully and dutifully.

Australia has been pleased to support Việt Nam throughout this year, both as a Strategic Partner to Việt Nam and to ASEAN.

At the ASEAN-Australia Summit, East Asia Summit and RCEP Summit over the weekend, Prime Minister Scott Morrison made Australia’s commitment to recovery, resilience and security very clear: Australia is investing in partnerships in Southeast Asia; and the region’s priorities are our priorities.

The first step to addressing the impacts of COVID-19 is to bolster our regional health response.

We want all countries to have access to safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines. That is why the Australian Government has announced a A$500 million package to support access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

This includes a A$21 million contribution to the new ASEAN Centre for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases, which will help combat COVID-19 and prepare the region for future pandemics.

Recognising the importance of a broader approach to health security, we will provide A$24 million to combat other infectious diseases in the Indo-Pacific through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

Australia is also focused on supporting economic recovery after COVID-19.

Last year, Australia’s two-way trade with ASEAN nations was more than A$122 billion and two-way investment stocks rose to over A$250 billion.

Our trade and investment relationship with Việt Nam is already very strong, and the prospects for future growth are bright.

Extensive work has taken place this year on the joint Australia-Việt Nam Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy with a number of initial recommendations now being finalised, including a set of initiatives to foster close business links with Việt Nam. This will contribute to the Strategy’s aim for both countries to become top ten trade partners and double investment.

Our businesses and our people will benefit from the historic signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, which will open up new markets and new economic opportunities. To ensure RCEP is a success, Australia is supporting ASEAN countries to implement its trade commitments with A$46 million as part of a Regional Trade for Development Initiative.

We also recognise the importance for Việt Nam, as well as other coastal ASEAN states, of its vast maritime resources. Through an investment of A$65 million across the region, we will support the ongoing development of marine resources and ensuring maritime domains are secure and prosperous.

In order to grow our economies, we also need to develop high-quality, sustainable infrastructure that meet the needs of the communities it serves.

Australia’s commitment of A$70 million to support quality infrastructure investment in the region represents a partnership with Southeast Asian countries. Australia has demonstrated expertise in developing infrastructure that we are keen to share, including on the transition to renewable energy technologies and climate-resilient infrastructure.

Our funding will support policy and regulatory reforms to deliver economic and social benefits for all. And we will make sure ASEAN partners have access to the technical and policy advice they need.

Together, we can build smart, sustainable and resilient cities across the region.

To support our Mekong partners to recover from COVID-19, and to narrow the development gap, we’ve announced a new A$232 million Mekong-Australia Program, with an investment in one of the region’s most important assets – human capital.

Australia’s funding will provide new scholarships for future leaders. It will boost economic capability by providing technical assistance. It will build environmental resilience and strengthen cyber and critical technology capabilities.

Việt Nam will receive special attention, through support to implement the Vietnam-Australia Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy once realised.

Việt Nam’s year as ASEAN chair came against the backdrop of significant geostrategic shifts which are presenting new challenges to stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. The health and prosperity of our countries rely on our region’s security and stability.

Australia strongly supports ASEAN’s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. Our support is grounded in a firm belief that a peaceful, inclusive, sovereign and resilient Indo-Pacific is in all our interests.

To bolster our region’s security needs, Prime Minister Morrison announced a further A$104 million to support closer Defence ties with the region and greater security capability.

The comprehensive initiatives announced by Australia are an investment in resilience, recovery and security in our region. They are also an investment in the future of our partnership with Southeast Asia and ASEAN.

Việt Nam’s steady leadership over the past year has reinforced ASEAN’s pivotal role in the region. As we recover and rebuild from COVID-19, Australia will be with Việt Nam, and all nations of Southeast Asia, every step of the way. VNS

HCM CITY — On Sunday, as HCM City announced its plan to extend strict lockdown for another month until September 15, hundreds of migrant workers have packed their bags and personal belongings and rushed to the city's gateways in a bid to leave for their hometowns in the surrounding provinces of Đồng Nai, Bình Thuận, and some central provinces.

Using loudspeakers, police officers at the checkpoints on National Road No 1 struggled to prevent them from leaving the city, urging them not to congregate and telling people to remain where they stay as per the Government's order. The law enforcement and local authorities took note of their information and address to provide support later.

By Sunday noon, many remained at the checkpoints, refusing to return to the places they have been staying in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo

One man named Hoàng from Phú Yên Province told Vietnam News Agency his family has been unemployed due to the outbreak and lockdown measures but has not received any financial support, while the rent and daily expenses have become too much of a burden. He knows he is not supposed to leave on his own personal vehicle out of the city but he has no option.

His story is shared by many others waiting anxiously to return home, afraid they might not be able to go on.

Many provinces have organised 'repatriation' trips (by trains and airplanes) and subsequent centralised quarantine facilities for their people in recent days as the outbreak situation in the southern city worsens, but many others remain behind.

HCM CITY — The Government always gives the highest priority to allocating COVID-19 vaccines to HCM City, said Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam at an online meeting with municipal leaders on COVID-19 prevention and control on Wednesday.

At the meeting, Đam, who is also Head of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, highly valued efforts made by the municipal authorities in the fight against the pandemic, while urging the city to improve the work in the future.

Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Nguyễn Thành Phong said the city has recorded initial positive results in controlling the pandemic as the number of new cases is slowing.

Up to now, nearly 63,000 patients have been given the all-clear from coronavirus, while over 32,600 are under treatment at health facilities in the city, Phong reported.

The city has worked with the Ministry of Health to operate four more intensive care units (ICU) with 1,750 beds while establishing five satellite emergency facilities supporting the city’s 115 Emergency Center.

The city has established a centre to receive and provide essential goods for local residents. It also completed the disbursement of the first support package worth over VNĐ700 billion (US$31 million) for those affected by the pandemic. Another VNĐ900 billion-assistance package is being launched.

He suggested that the Government allocate more vaccines for the city.

Phong also proposed that the Government and the Government's Special Working Group direct localities’ pandemic prevention and control forces at checkpoints to support and create favourable conditions for goods transportation.

He said localities can arrange traffic police and inspectors at these checkpoints to promptly deal with problems and ensure smooth transportation of goods between provinces.

Đam acknowledged the city's important adjustments in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, while asking the municipal authorities to effectively and safely organise goods deliveries, and adjust regulations accordingly.

He said the city needs to consider setting up transshipment delivery points at the district level so that shippers using motorbikes can move within the district. For deliveries between districts, goods can be transported by cars and trucks.

While waiting for general guidance, the city needs to pay attention to and provide credit support to those who are borrowing from banks for daily spending on food and other necessities, the deputy PM noted.

Regarding vaccine supply for the city, he affirmed that HCM City is always given the highest priority in vaccine access, requesting the municipal authorities to prepare for resumption of production and manufacturing once all residents are fully vaccinated.

Apart from accelerating COVID-19 vaccination, the city needs to organise periodic testing for local residents, the Deputy PM said, adding that after the period of social distancing, HCM City should consider gradually re-opening sale points but still ensure safety.

He highly evaluated the municipal authorities’ efforts to provide social security packages for local people, while requesting the city to further speed up COVID-19 testing for drivers. — VNS

With 52,000sq.km of fishing area, this province is one of the three key fishing grounds of Việt Nam. Its Phú Quý Island District has a strategic location in marine economy and security and defence. There are also oil and gas fields in the water of the province. We have huge potential to develop the marine economy especially tourism, renewable energy and seafood exploitation and processing, in association with the island and sea sovereignty protection.

Bình Thuận Province’s Party Committee issued an action plan to make the province become one with a strong, sustainable and comprehensive marine economy. In order to achieve the goals, the province also takes into account other tasks including conservation, climate change, marine environment protection and coastal encroachment prevention, among others.

The coastal area will become a driving force to promote growth with the development of urban and tourist areas, coastal industrial and service zones and clusters, along with renewable energy and seaport system development. The priority industries include tourism, energy, manufacturing and processing and logistic services.

In tourism for example, the province will build many luxury tourism areas with resorts, ecology, heath treatment and water sports. In the next five years, tourism is expected to become a spearhead economic sector. Mũi Né National Tourism Zone is targeted to be one of the leading destinations in the Asia-Pacific region in the next 10 years.

In industry, the province will promote both manufacturing and processing, and energy industries. It prioritises offshore wind power and Liquefied Natural Gas power projects. Offshore wind power is a new industry that is both cost-effective and sustainable. Several local and foreign investors have looked at investment opportunities and asked for permission to survey the wind power projects with the total capacity of up to 22,000MW. However, it should be noted that whether they are to be approved or not also depends on the National Power Development Master Plan in 2021-2030 and other sea and island-related issues.

To achieve the goals, the province has accelerated the construction of the infrastructure system in coastal areas and Phú Quý Island. Many structures have been or are being built, including Hàm Tân-La Gi industrial, service and urban zone in Hàm Tân District, coastal roads and logistics facilities for fishing. In addition, the province has strengthened the capacity of the fishery surveillance forces to protect aquatic resources and combat illegal unreported and unregulated fishing.

We also aim to develop Phú Quý Island District to ensure that it can fulfil the marine security and defence tasks and serve as a logistical and technical base for Trường Sa (Spratly) Archipelago and the DK1 rigs. Phú Quý will also serve as a marine search and rescue centre for the central southern region.

At the same time, the province will strengthen its national defence capacity, build a strong armed force, enhance its combat readiness and meet the requirements of protecting sovereignty over sea and islands. It will also focus on building and consolidating the all-people defence as well as strengthen the efficiency of law enforcement forces at sea. At the same time, it will pay attention to improving the life quality of locals in coastal localities and Phú Quý Island District.

Could you tell us more about the proposals and recommendations of Bình Thuận Province to the 13th National Party Congress on the task of marine economy development in association with sovereignty protection in the upcoming term?

Tapping sea and island potentials is a significant and strategic issue in most countries especially in the context that the resources on land are becoming exhausting. The resolution on the strategy for the sustainable development of Việt Nam’s marine economy to 2030 and vision to 2045, known as Resolution No 36, affirmed that Việt Nam will be a strong and rich country based on the sea. The marine economy is not merely about fishing and exploitation of the ocean’s natural resources. The combination of sectors; marine infrastructure; socio-economic, security and defence factors all contribute to the development of the marine economy.

Despite impressive achievements, Việt Nam has yet to tap the potentials of a country with more than 3,000km-long coastline. There are shortcomings in the development process including the unsustainable development, lack of planning and poor management. Fishing activities have not been controlled properly, leading to the depletion of aquatic resources.

Sustainable development of the marine economy in association with sovereignty protection is an imperative and strategic, long-term task. To this end, it is necessary to develop sectors that have high added-value, use modern technologies and are environmentally friendly while still ensuring the security and defence as well as protecting the sovereignty of the nation.

Việt Nam is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change, therefore it needs to work on solutions to protect the ocean environment and develop the marine economy sustainably.

Bình Thuận aims to become a province strong in ocean economy. The province has many solutions to develop its maritime economy and has achieved positive initial results, however, there is still much room to tap its potentials and make breakthroughs.

One of the projects much anticipated by locals is Phan Thiết airport. The plan to build an airport in Phan Thiết was approved by the then Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng in 2014 and it will be used for both civil and military purposes. Nearly 600ha of land have been cleared ready to build an airport. We hope that Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc will direct competent authorities to accelerate the progress of the project to put the airport into operation soon.

Investment in some projects in Bình Thuận is also facing legal difficulties. Bình Thuận Province has the largest titanium reserve in the country with more than 82,000ha, accounting for some 10 per cent of the province’s total land.

We hope that permission will be given for the implementation of development projects on the surface of areas of mineral reserves.

With 192km-long coastline, Bình Thuận has many beautiful beaches for tourism development. However many have also degraded by erosion. We hope that the Government has programmes to support the building of sea dykes which are used for both erosion prevention and military defence purposes.

For Phú Quý, we hope to continue to receive support and investment from the Government so that this will be a district rich in economy and strong in defence and security. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Government has set a target for HCM City, the epicentre of the current wave of infections, to contain its COVID-19 outbreak by September 15.

Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has just signed Resolution 86 of the Government on the implementation of urgent measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic to implement Resolution 30 of the National Assembly.

According to the resolution , the Government aims for HCM City to control its outbreak before September 15; Bình Dương, Long An, Đồng Nai provinces before September 1; and other localities before August 25.

The resolution said that many agencies, units and localities have not taken serious, decisive or substantive measures in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, while inspection and supervision is still lax in many places.

These include slow responses to the changing situation, slow vaccination rates, lax management of social distancing, as well as congestion in the transport of goods.

The pandemic is still unpredictable, while the supply of vaccines is limited and there is not yet any specific treatment for the virus, so the Government emphasised that pandemic prevention is an urgent task.

The Resolution stipulates urgent and specific solutions to prevent, repel and move towards good control of the pandemic in order to prevent a crisis both in public health and the socio-economic sector.

Regarding the application of urgent measures, the Government assigned local leaders to proactively decide and direct their subordinates to strictly apply solutions corresponding to the level of risk in the spirit of Directive 15, Directive 16 and Directive 19 of the Prime Minister. Based on the actual situation, they may apply these solutions earlier and at higher levels but not later and lower than the provisions in the above documents.

The Government pays special attention to social distancing and other measures in anti-pandemic work that must be strictly implemented from the very beginning, at all levels. Leaders of localities are asked not to procrastinate, hesitate, lack determination or lack responsibility. Instead, they should take the lead, be creative when implementing the task, draw lessons from the work and made quick adjustments when the situation changes.

All localities must strictly implement the motto "go to every alley, knock from door to door, check every person", detect and handle people who come from pandemic-affected areas without declaring and people leaving localities which are applying social distancing without permission.

One of the other urgent solutions proposed by the Government is to allow localities to proactively and flexibly apply necessary measures such as restricting some vehicles or asking people not to leave their homes for a certain period of time.

Speed up testing

Localities need to speed up testing among high-risk groups of people in order to detect new cases as soon as possible, the resolution said. Localities must not miss new F0s and not let them continue to travel and spread the virus further.

For areas with widespread infections such as HCM City and neighbouring provinces, it is necessary to enhance testing, care and treatment, ensuring the maximum reduction in the rate of severe cases, mortality and spread to other areas.

The Ministry of Health is tasked with promptly distributing vaccines to provinces and cities, in which priority is given to densely populated localities, those with many infections and fatalities, as well as any large and crowded urban areas.

The resolution also asked the Ministry of Health to build pandemic response scenarios for all levels, based on which the procurement of equipment and materials can be calculated.

The Ministry of Health, ministries, branches and localities can mobilise public and private health systems and social resources to promptly coordinate in the implementation of COVID-19 prevention, treatment and vaccination.

The Government also requested the Ministry of Finance, ministries, branches and localities to prioritise the arrangement and allocation of the state budget and other lawful resources to ensure funding for the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control work.

The Government requested the cutting of at least 50 per cent of spending on conferences, travelling expenses of ministries, central agencies and localities (except for the expenses of important and urgent activities and to serve the pandemic prevention and control work). — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has sent a dispatch to several ministers, ordering a revision of laws to address difficulties in investment and business amid the complex developments of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The document was sent to the ministers of Planning and Investment, Finance, Industry and Trade, Natural Resources and Environment, Construction, Transport, Agriculture and Rural Development, Information and Communications, Justice, and Home Affairs.

It pointed out that after reviewing the recommendations of all the 63 provinces and cities, agencies detected specific obstacles and difficulties facing investment, production and business activities caused by the overlapping and inconsistency of several legal documents.

A revision by Government Office detected a number of points that need to be studied, amended and supplemented immediately to remove problematic issues specified in 29 laws related to State management of 10 ministries.

To promptly remove difficulties and obstacles, clear bottlenecks, mobilise all social resources, and promote production and business, the Government leader requested ministers to direct and prioritise resources for the revision, research, amendment and supplementation of legal documents under their authority.

The highest priority should be given to speeding up the amendment and supplementation of legal regulations that are overlapped, disputable and inconsistent, he stressed. — VNS

HCM CITY — Việt Nam, especially the current hotspot HCM City, needs to maintain stringent social distancing measures and stress that each individual and family plays a decisive role in reducing infection chains, overseas-Vietnamese experts said at a webinar on Thursday.

Dr Vũ Ngọc Khuê, a Vietnamese-American, said the country’s pandemic epicentre should be able to contain the latest outbreak that began in late April within the next four weeks.

“Four weeks would be enough for the city to contain the spread. The first two weeks will detect symptomatic FO (COVID patients) cases for quarantine, while the next two weeks will detect cases that have had longer incubation periods” and may not be showing symptoms, he added.

Severe cases will need more time for treatment and recovery in a hospital or at isolation facilities, he said, adding that the city should focus on critically ill patients to minimise the number of deaths.

In addition to having medical staff fully equipped with proper equipment, all resources including military forces should be mobilised for the fight.

Trần Trọng Hùng, a Vietnamese-Polish man who is vice chairman of the Vietnamese Community in Poland, said that the COVID-19 Prevention and Support Committee in Poland developed a COVID-19 prevention manual, stressing the role of each individual and each family.

All people, including those fully vaccinated, must strictly implement measures such as hand washing, keeping a distance, wearing a mask, and limiting gatherings. People should contact medical staff immediately to have a COVID test when they have symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or headache.

To quickly recover, you should practise breathing exercises to support the lungs, and keep a thermometer, blood pressure monitor and oximeter at home.

Testing is key

Experts said that even with the promising prospects of COVID vaccinations, it will take some time for vaccines to be delivered to the general population.

The surge of the more transmissible Delta variant has made testing more vital, even among vaccinated people. Testing, tracking, tracing and isolating quickly, massively and smartly are all needed to prevent future rebounds of infections following social distancing measures.

Dr. Nguyễn Đức Thái, a Vietnamese-American and co-founder of TransMed-VN forum, said that Việt Nam has conducted three main kinds of testing. The first is an antibody or serology test, a blood test that looks for signs of a previous infection to help understand the pervasiveness of the disease in communities.

The second is a rapid antigen test, which can deliver results in less than 15 minutes, a less accurate alternative but one that is very good at identifying when people are infectious. The third is the more accurate PCR tests, which requires a laboratory, according to Thái.

With the delta variant surging throughout the world, more testing is paramount.

Dr Thái said the city could use a highly sensitive and cost-effective test that uses artificial intelligence to detect pathogens (called AIMS RT-PCR technology) as recommended by Dr. Hồ Hữu Thọ of the Hà Nội Military Medical Academy.

The test, which can take a pooling sample of 100, is very accurate and suitable for large-scale testing or city-wide testing, he noted.

Japanese-Vietnamese Trần Ngọc Phúc, president of the Japanese medical equipment firm Metran, and chairman of the Association of Vietnamese in Japan, said the city should buy low-cost ventilators that are easy to use so that doctors at all levels can safely use them.

The city should also buy more CPAP machines, oxygen generators and saturation oximeters to meet the needs of patients treated at home to reduce the transfer of patients to hospitals, he added.

An online monitoring system for patients with unstable medical conditions could be used, and mobile medical teams should be set up to better diagnose and take care of patients at home.

Dr. Võ Toàn Trung, Vietnamese-French, said the city needed to prepare for a worst-case scenario, especially if the rate of positive cases exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system.

Dương Anh Đức, vice chairman of the People’s Committee, said the city would consider all of the recommendations and expressed gratitude to overseas Vietnamese, including those at home and abroad, for providing medical equipment and essential items.

After successfully containing the virus in 2020 and early this year, the country now faces a serious outbreak, with HCM City and southern provinces accounting for most new infections. HCM City, the largest hotspot, has recorded more than 137,000 cases since the beginning of the fourth wave in late April.

Việt Nam recorded 9,667 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday and a further 326 people died of COVID. The new cases take the total number of infections to 246,568 and the total number of deaths to 4,813.

The country has administered 12,098,821 doses of vaccines. A total of 1,092,700 people have received two doses.

HÀ NỘI- Many countries in the world have showed serious concerns over China’s recent deployment of over 200 ships around Sinh Tồn island cluster in Việt Nam’s Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelago and requested the country to immediately bring these vessels out of the area and end all provocations.

In a regular press conference, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry’s Spokeswoman Lê Thị Thu Hằng said that the operation of the Chinese ships within the territorial waters of Sinh Tồn Đông island in the Trường Sa archipelago violated Vietnam’s sovereignty and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)’s regulations on the operation of foreign vessels in the territorial waters of coastal nations, run counter to the spirit and content of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC), and complicated the situation, which is unfavourable for the process of negotiations between ASEAN and China on a Code of Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (COC).



The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said in a diplomatic protest that the swarming and threatening presence of the Chinese ships creates an atmosphere of instability and shows that China is ignoring its commitments to promoting peace and stability in the region.



At a reception for Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto on March 30, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga voiced his concern over China’s activities in the waters, including the enforcement of its Coast Guard Law which allows patrol ships to use weapons. Both sides spoke highly of the importance of maintaining free and open navigation based on international law.



Meanwhile, Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Koshikawa Kazuhiko tweeted that the South China Sea (called the East Sea in Việt Nam) issues are directly related to peace and stability and concern for all parties.



“Japan strongly opposes any action that heightens tensions. We support the enforcement of the Rule of Law in the sea and work with the international community to protect the free, open, and peaceful seas,” he stressed on his Twitter account.



Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Steven Robinson tweeted that “Australia supports an Indo-Pacific region which is secure open and inclusive. The South China Sea – a crucial international waterway – is governed by international rules and norms, particularly UNCLOS. We remain concerned about destabilising actions that could provoke escalation”.

Responding to China’s statement that the vessels operating around the Sinh Tồn island cluster are fishing ships and they were just taking shelter from rough seas, Jay Batongbacal, Director of the University of the Philippines’s Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said that a reconnaissance flight by the Philippine Air Force showed that around 200 vessels have been there for weeks.



“Satellite photos also show that the decks of these vessels are very, very clean. It's as if they're brand new,” he said, adding that “One big worry, of course, is that they might be preparing to occupy the reef in order to construct another artificial island”.



Gregory B. Poling, who is Director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that China’s acts are “suspicious” as the boats, tied up “with military precision” beside each other, “are not fishing,” they're parked.



Collin Koh, a Research Fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies under Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, stated that China’s activities are escalating tensions in the East Sea.



It can be said that China’s recent activities in the East Sea have continued challenging international law and violating the sovereignty and sovereign rights of other countries.



In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague issued a ruling rejecting all China’s illegal sovereignty claims in the East Sea. VNA/VNS

HÀ NỘI — State President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc held a meeting with Chairman of the Lao National Assembly Saysomphone Phomvihane in Vientiane, Laos, on Tuesday.

PM Phúc also attended and spoke at the 9th National Assembly (NA) of Laos. He is the first foreign leader to speak at the new Lao National Assembly House exactly 10 years after the speech by Nguyễn Phú Trọng, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Việt Nam and the then-Chairman of the National Assembly of Việt Nam in 2011.

Expressing the honour, President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc said there were few bilateral relationships in the world like the one between Việt Nam and Laos, which have supported each other over the years. He emphasised the relations between the nations’ founding fathers and comrades.

The President said that "in the hearts of each Vietnamese and Laotian citizen, the special relationship between Việt Nam and Laos is always strong, as stated by His Royal Highness and President Souphanouvong: 'Higher than the mountain, longer than the river, wider than the sea, more beautiful than the full moon, more fragrant than any flower'.”

Phúc expressed his appreciation when witnessing the great achievements of the Laotian people after 46 years of national construction and 35 years of conducting renovation work under the leadership of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

The President also expressed his pleasure that over the years, cooperation between the two countries in all fields from politics, foreign affairs, defence, security, economy, culture and society had been increasingly expanded, bringing benefits to the two peoples.

Many practical cooperation projects between the two countries on telecommunications networks, transportation, hydropower, rubber plantations, coffee, schools and hospitals, had been completed and put into use in many remote regions and provinces of Laos. These had made an important contribution to socio-economic development and improving people's living standards in the country.

Phúc said that the political relations would continue to be the overall direction of the special relationship between Việt Nam and Laos. The support of the national assemblies of the two countries would be a solid legal foundation for the effective cooperation of the governments, the Fatherland Front, localities and social organisations, and businesses of the two countries.

The two sides agreed that education, training and human resources development would be a strategic field of cooperation that serves the development needs of each country.

Việt Nam is willing to expand its support to Laos in training human resources. Besides increasing the number of scholarships, the two sides need to work closely to improve the quality of enrolment, teaching and learning in order to better meet the needs of the Lao market, Phúc said.

“An important issue for the leaders of the two countries is to raise economic cooperation to a higher level to match the special friendship. We can't stay poor forever, we have to work together to get stronger and get richer,” Phúc said.

The State President also suggested that the two sides cooperate in transforming to a digital economy, developing e-commerce, digitising education, healthcare, finance and modern banking services.

Chairman of the Lao National Assembly Saysomphone Phomvihane said the legislative bodies of the two countries would make efforts to strengthen cooperation, contributing to fostering the great friendship between Laos and Việt Nam, which had been built by generations of leaders. VNS

By Lương Thu Hương

A series of paintings depicting the experience of a young freelance illustrator receiving the coronavirus vaccine has recently gone viral on Vietnamese social media.

Only one day after being posted on her Nguyễn Vũ Xuân Lan’s Facebook page, the series Nhật Ký Đi Tiêm (COVID-19 Vaccination Diary) received over 5,000 likes and nearly 1,000 shares.

It has also been shared on the Facebook of UNICEF Việt Nam where it garnered over 79,000 likes after just two days.

COVID-19 Vaccination Diary is effectively a short comic book including 18 paintings. Each sketch details the process of a girl, presumably the painter herself, as she goes through the various stages of the inoculation, from registering and being notified via text message of the time and place of injection, through to being screened and injected, and finally being consulted on how to rest and stay healthy at home after the jab.

The picture diary is a string of cute drawings accompanied by simple but humorous dialogue.

Nguyễn Vũ Xuân Lan came up with the idea of the COVID-19 Vaccination Diary after returning home from being vaccinated on July 30.

“Before that, I used to feel doubts about the vaccination due to much conflicting information related to it, about anaphylaxis or the huge crowds waiting for injections in the hospital,” Lan said.

“However, my experience was surprisingly smooth and pleasant. Feeling safe and happy back home, I wanted to share this first-hand experience so that everyone can better understand the vaccination process and be less bewildered. I also hope that it would partly encourage others to get the injections.”

The 32-year-old freelance illustrator said that she finished the picture diary within four days of getting the injection.

“I started to have a fever while drawing so I had to take a day off. When my fever came down and I regained my composure, I continued to draw,” she said.

COVID-19 Vaccination Diary aims to record a life memory of the painter, but on receiving a vast array of positive comments, she realised that it has done much more.

“My series of paintings has offered a more positive view of the vaccination and answered a few frequently asked questions, so I feel like I have been contributing a small part to the fight against the pandemic,” she said.

The diary is not Lan’s first work related to the pandemic. Previously she created a series of paintings of small children going to quarantine during the pandemic, which attracted over 12,000 likes and hundreds of comments.

A picture within Lan's series of paintings about little children going to quarantine during the pandemic.

On her Facebook page named X.Lan, the illustrator captioned the photo album: "Drawing some cute moments to relieve stress during the pandemic."

Lecturer turns illustrator

Lan currently works as a freelance illustrator. Her work revolves around drawing and illustrating brands, advertising articles, books, teaching drawing for adults and creating graphics.

However, she was not officially trained in the arts and is a graduate of the University of Languages and International Studies at Việt Nam National University where she worked as an English lecturer.

“In 2013, while still an English lecturer, I used to make random drawings or short comics during my free time and uploaded them to my Facebook. Some of them went viral and I started to be noticed, which made me happy to keep drawing for the next few years,” said Lan.

“In 2016, I realised I wanted to take drawing more seriously so I decided to take a year off from teaching. I didn't think I would make a living from drawing. It was just because I liked it enough to spend time being serious about it. I thought that it was just a year and if I didn’t try, I would regret it later. If it didn't work out, it would not be too late to resume teaching. However, I was so satisfied that I never went back to teaching."

Lan’s paintings mostly revolve around her personal life, depicting small but memorable moments that she encounters each day.

“I observe and take notes a lot so there is always an abundance of ideas in my mind waiting to be drawn,” she said.

On her personal page, Lan describes herself simply: “I'm not good with words, so I draw to tell my stories.”

Since embarking on her new path, Lan cannot remember how many art projects she has been involved in. Some highlights include drawing illustrations for a book, entitled 199 mấy Hồi Ấy Làm Gì (What Were You Doing in the 1990s), a series of pictures on the issue of gender violence for CARE Vietnam, and the cartoon Kindness is Contagious for UNICEF.

The contents of Lan’s paintings mostly revolve around her personal life, depicting small but memorable moments that she encounters every day.

One of her most unforgettable memories as a freelance illustrator was receiving a request to draw the steps for wearing personal protective equipment. The pictures were to be presented to medical workers at Bạch Mai Hospital, and the client seemed to be the owner of a printing shop for hospitals.

“I drew the pictures very quickly so that he could present them to the doctors in time. The drawing process helped me to understand how hard it was for the medical staff, as using a protective suit involves dozens of steps, each of which demands proper disinfection, Lan said.

“The complete suit is enough to keep them safe from the virus and consists of many layers, but the doctors have to suffer from great heat and exhaustion.

"Sadly, the pictures still have not been presented to the doctors because the client contracted the virus and been taken to hospital for treatment."

Lan revealed that she would continue to draw and share any interesting experiences she encounters during this unforgettable global health crisis.

“I hope everyone will find moral support and comfort during these difficult days,” she said. VNS

BÌNH DƯƠNG— Bình Dương Emergency Resuscitation Field Hospital, specialising in treating patients with severe COVID-19, has been put into operation on Thursday in the southern province of Bình Dương’s Thuận An District.

The field hospital, with a total of 437 beds, was built inside the Becamex International General Hospital in just six days, to treat COVID-19 patients in the province.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the field hospital on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn said the field hospital was built thanks to the great efforts of local authorities as well as the support of both human resources and medical equipment from the Government and Hà Nội Medical University Hospital.

Sơn also said when the number of COVID-19 patients increased very quickly in the province, with many severe cases, the local authorities proposed the ministry set up the field hospital.

Associate Professor Nguyễn Lân Hiếu, director of Hà Nội Medical University Hospital, who was recently assigned to be the head of the field hospital, said it was implemented very quickly thanks to requisition of the available facilities and modern machinery from Becamex International General Hospital.

We are now focused on upgrading rooms to increase the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and preparing oxygen and compressed air, ventilators and dialysis machines, he added.

The field hospital could conduct ECMO techniques to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, he said.

The field hospital includes medical staff of Hà Nội Medical University Hospital, Becamex International General Hospital, Bình Dương General Hospital and teams of doctors and nurses from many localities, especially from the northern provinces, he said.

Võ Văn Minh, chairman of the People’s Committee of Bình Dương Province, said at the opening ceremony of the field hospital that he thanked the health ministry, Associate Professor Nguyễn Lân Hiếu as well as all medical staff.

Minh also said he hoped all doctors and medical staff of the field hospital would overcome difficulties and improve the efficiency of treatment for COVID-19 patients.

On August 12, the number of COVID-19 cases in Bình Dương was 3,028, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 36,776 since the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.— VNS

HÀ NỘI — President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc and General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) Central Committee and President of Laos Thongloun Sisoulith on Monday emphasised the need to continue deepening the two sides’ political relations, and agreed to make 2022 the "Year of Friendship and Solidarity between Việt Nam - Laos, Laos – Việt Nam 2022".

General Secretary and President Thongloun Sisoulith warmly welcomed President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on his official visit to Laos, which took place right after the success of each country’s Party's Congress and the election of each country's National Assembly deputies.

The General Secretary and President of Laos appreciated that Laos was the first country Phúc visited in his new position, which indicated the special importance of Laos in Việt Nam’s policies.

The two leaders affirmed that the Parties, States and peoples of the two countries have always given each other valuable support, assistance, and goodwill in the cause of national liberation and reunification. They said that the two countries will continue to give the highest priority to constantly consolidating and cultivating the great friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Việt Nam and Laos.

The two leaders also expressed their delight at the development of the cooperative relationship in recent years.

PLZEŇ The daily life of Vietnamese families in the Czech Republic is featured at an exhibition in Plzeň City that is located nearly 80km from Prague.

Vietnam Stories, the name of the exhibition, showcases 50 photos by Czech photographer and teacher Jindřich Štreit, who is considered one of the most important exponents of Czech documentary photography.

It is jointly organised by the City Council in collaboration with the Vietnamese association in Plzeň.

Vietnam Stories also features traditional Vietnamese customs and habits that are still preserved and practised in the Czech Republic, such as national holidays, birthdays, weddings and death anniversaries.

Speaking at the opening of the exhibition, Štreit said that he had researched and integrated into the Vietnamese community to capture the most authentic angles of their life for the photo collection.

“I personally have a very good relationship with the Vietnamese community in North Morava and they themselves, especially young people, have enthusiastically helped me to make this meaningful series of photos,” the 75-year-old photographer said.

According to Eliška Bartáková, Deputy Mayor of Plzeň City, the Vietnamese community has been in the Czech Republic for three generations and is integrating very well into Czech society.

“Vietnamese people obey the law, study hard, run businesses and make many positive contributions to society. It is perfectly fine and normal for two peoples of the Czech Republic and Việt Nam to harmoniously live and develop together in the country.”

Dr Nguyễn Duy Nhiên, Chairman of the Vietnamese Association in the Czech Republic, said the association greatly appreciates the photos capturing the life of the Vietnamese community by photographer Štreit.

He added that Vietnam Stories would help to enhance the friendship and relations between the two nations.

A visitor to the exhibition and photography enthusiast, Vojtěch Štajek, recalled that the number of Vietnamese people coming to the Czech Republic has increased significantly since the 1990s.

There used to be many differences in lifestyle and perception between the Czech and Vietnamese communities. At first, Czech people were amazed at the Vietnamese unyielding struggle and hard-working manner, he said.

“However, over time, it was that strong will of the Vietnamese people and their positive contributions to society that have convinced the Czech people, so today the Vietnamese community has truly integrated and lives in harmony with all other ethnic groups in the Czech Republic.

“We really consider the Vietnamese as our people. The photos displayed at this exhibition have accurately reflected their life that I witness every day,” he added.

According to Nguyễn Hoài Thanh, Chairman of the Vietnamese Association in Plzeň, the community of over 6,000 Vietnamese living in this city wholeheartedly supports the exhibition, expecting that Vietnam Stories will help Czech people better understand the customs and habits of Vietnamese people.

Vietnam Stories will last until August 27.

Jindřich Štreit, born September 5, 1946 in Vsetín, is a Czech photographer and teacher known for his documentary photography. He concentrates on documenting the rural life and people of Czech villages.

The photographer began taking photographs in 1964, during his studies at the Pedagogical Faculty of Palacký University in Olomouc. VNS

HÀ NỘI – Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính made proposals on how to effectively tackle challenges to maritime security while addressing the high-level open debate on “Enhancing Maritime Security – A Case for International Cooperation” of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), held virtually on August 9.

He highlighted the need to increase comprehensive awareness of the significance of seas as well as possible threats to maritime security, as it is essential to promote responsibility and political resolve, reinforce trust, build closer and more effective cooperation mechanisms to ensure a maritime environment of peace and stability, and exploit maritime resources sustainably.

"Maritime security is a global issue, so it needs a global solution," he continued, suggesting setting up a network of mechanisms and initiatives on regional maritime security to be coordinated by the UN to increase the sharing of information and experience, and take joint actions to cope with common challenges in a timely manner.

Policies, laws and behaviours of countries should be in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982 UNCLOS), and activities that would complicate the situation and cause tensions should be averted, he said.

Việt Nam has worked to actively contribute to maintaining an environment of peace and security, as well as the ecology and sustainable development in the region and the world, the PM emphasised.

"Việt Nam is resolved, together with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, to seriously, fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC), and negotiate to build a substantive and effective Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC) in accordance with international law and the 1982 UNCLOS," he said.

The Prime Minister’s attendance at the debate was made at the invitation of PM Narendra Modi of India that is holding the UNSC’s rotating Presidency.

This is the first time maritime security has been discussed as an exclusive agenda item at the UNSC.

Participants expressed their concern over increasing threats to maritime security and safety, and shared their view on the need to strengthen international cooperation to cope with such challenges, observe international law, especially the 1982 UNCLOS, and promote regional and global initiatives to enhance maritime security.

The UNSC adopted a presidential statement calling for stronger regional and international cooperation to address challenges to maritime security and safety, acknowledging the significance of the UNCLOS, calling on the UN and the international community to further support countries to improve their capabilities and share experience in handling threats to maritime security.

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam and the Czech Republic have vowed to work together in many ways to fight COVID-19.

Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính on Monday held phone discussions with his Czech counterpart Andrej Babis.

PM Babis agreed to transfer half a million vaccination doses along with a number of testing kits to Việt Nam. The pledge comes after the Czech Republic recently committed to donating 250,000 doses.

The Vietnamese PM said that donation demonstrates the precious support that illustrates the solid friendship between the two countries over the last 70 years.

He asked his counterpart to also consider giving Việt Nam any surplus vaccines they may have in the future.

The Czech leader expressed his appreciation for support given by the Vietnamese Government and the Vietnamese diaspora in the Czech Republic to his people since the beginning of the pandemic.

He added that even though the virus is still rampant in his country, his government stands ready to support and collaborate with Việt Nam in eradicating the pandemic.

He also said they would encourage other European countries to donate COVID-19 vaccines popular in the region to Việt Nam, namely AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Sinopharm.

The two PMs also discussed different areas of the multifaceted collaboration and agreed to maintain diplomatic visits in a flexible manner to adapt to the ever-changing COVID-19 situations.

PM Chính invited his Czech counterpart to visit Việt Nam as soon as possible, and Babis said he hopes the trip can take place this year.

The Vietnamese PM also thanked the Czech government for its support of Việt Nam’s negotiation and signing of the EU–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA).

The two leaders agreed to enhance cooperation in automobile, transport, education-training, national defence and fruit exports, as well as developing a Việt Nam-Czech Republic non-stop flight.

They both agreed to collaborate more in the multinational forums and discussed international matters of mutual interest, which include issues in the East Sea (known internationally as the South China Sea).

They both emphasised the need to maintain security and peace in this maritime area, which includes taking actions such as promoting the role of international law and considering the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS 1982) as the legal framework that governs all maritime activities. — VNS

NINH THUẬN – The south-central province of Ninh Thuận is taking measures to increase the number of its products made under the country’s ‘one commune – one product’ programme.

OCOP includes commercial products and services like food, beverages, handicrafts, and rural tourism services, which are rated up to a highest of five stars.

Lê Huyền, deputy chairman of the province People’s Committee, said to develop OCOP products, Ninh Thuận was enabling co-operatives and production establishments to participate in the programme.

It was providing them with machinery and facilities, helping develop production linkages between stakeholders and raw material growing areas, training human resources, and carrying out trade promotion activities for OCOP products, he said.

It would promote the sales of these products through modern distribution channels like supermarkets and e-commerce platforms, he said.

Producers would get help in using advanced technologies to improve quality and value, with competent agencies overseeing quality from production to sales, he said.

The province has had 69 OCOP products, including 10 four – star and 51 three - star products as of last year including honeydew melon, jujube, grapefruit, Cà Ná fish sauce, aloe vera products, garlic, and red onion.

These have not only helped improve the value of the province’s agriculture production and rural economy but also promoted its brands, according to the People’s Committee.

The products are in high demand both inside and outside the province.

The Thái Thuận – Ninh Thuận Manufacture and Trading Agricultural Company Limited in Ninh Sơn District’s Nhơn Sơn Commune produces 10 OCOP products, including grape and jujube.

Nguyễn Đình Quang, its director, said through local and central government support policies, the company had developed production linkages for its grape and jujube products.

In early July it began selling its four-star green grapes on e-commerce platform sendo.vn, he said.

“The company will also sell grapes and jujube products on other e-commerce platforms. This will help sell them more conveniently and maintain the production and value of agricultural products during the COVID – 19 pandemic.”

The province is spending more than VNĐ6.1 billion (US$266,000) this year to develop 20 – 30 new OCOP products.

Đặng Kim Cương, director of its Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said this year the province would also upgrade the quality levels of its existing products.

The province has 38 products, including specifically identified ones, that can be developed into OCOP items, according to a steering board tasked with developing them.

Ninh Thuận, which has the lowest rainfall in the country, has 12 specifically identified products, including asparagus, sheep, goat, Mỹ Nghiệp brocade, and Bàu Trúc pottery.

Its asparagus, for instance, enjoys great demand and stable prices even amid the pandemic.

The province has more than 200ha under asparagus, mostly in Ninh Phước, Ninh Hải, Thuận Bắc, and Ninh Sơn districts and Phan Rang – Tháp Chàm City.

Ninh Thuận is the country’s largest producer of asparagus, grape, jujube, sheep, and goat as its weather and soil are ideal for them.

Along with tourism

The province is promoting OCOP products together with tourism.

Its Department of Industry and Trade is showcasing the province’s OCOP products at six popular tourism destinations including the Vĩnh Hy and Hang Rái tourism areas and the tourism night market.

Last year it organised two fairs to introduce the products and two conferences to discuss linking up with buyers in Bình Thuận and Lâm Đồng provinces and HCM City.

The province also subsidised 50 companies that participated in eight trade fairs held locally and in other provinces and cities last year. – VNS

HCM CITY — HCM City is set to extend lockdown measures until September 15, the date set by the Government for the southern city to have its severe COVID-19 outbreaks under control, the city's officials have said.

“The situation is complicated and can last for a long time, the number of cases tends to decrease but the number of deaths is still high,” Vice Chairman of HCM City People’s Committee Dương Anh Đức said on Friday at the daily press briefing.

From August 5, on average, the city recorded 3,687 cases a day, of which 78.6 per cent were in locked down areas, 2.3 per cent in quarantined areas, 17.7 per cent via screening tests at hospitals.

The city currently has 1,558 critical patients, and 16 on ECMO. As many as 10,421 are asymptomatic and being treated at home. More than 12,000 patients have been treated for more than seven days and are recovering.

“The most worrying problem is the high death rate, at about 241 deaths a day.”

Thus, the city now focuses on improving treatment efficacy, with the highest goal being reducing the number of deaths in 22 localities in the city.

It is forecast that after August 15, the number of cases will still be around 3,000 a day.

“Therefore, if we do not drastically implement strong anti-pandemic measures, it will be difficult to maintain the results, and the situation may even get worse,” Đức said.

Phan Văn Mãi, deputy secretary of the city Party Committee, said the city would strengthen measures from August 15 to September 15, divided into two phases - from August 15 to August 31 and from August 31 to September 15. Specific measures have been determined for each phase.

It is expected that on August 15, the city will announce the details of the plan, with strict social distancing measures according to the Government’s Directive 16 continuing.

Sinopharm vaccine

Vice Chairman Đức said that the city’s Department of Health on Friday started to administer the batch of one million doses of Sinopharm's Vero Cell COVID-19 vaccine to its residents.

This batch of vaccines had undergone quality controls and approved by the Ministry of Health, Đức said at a press conference providing updates about anti-pandemic activities in HCM City Friday morning.

Đức said currently the supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to Việt Nam remained very limited. In August and September, about three million doses were expected to be delivered, among which the allocation to HCM City would not be sufficient since many provinces and cities were also facing similar scarcity.

Therefore, in August, in HCM City, "the best is what we have at the moment”, he said.

The city would administer vaccinations, ensuring all vaccines are qualified and licensed by WHO and the Ministry of Health. People must be aware of their own health and act together with the community to contribute to improving the city's anti-pandemic efforts, he said.

With current resources, HCM City can inject 350,000 shots per day or more.

Currently, HCM City has five million doses of Sinopharm's Vero Cell vaccine, and is trying to bring five more million doses of Moderna by the end of this year.

Regarding the five million Moderna vaccine doses, Đức said the vaccination was completely non-profit, coming from the donations of businesses, who wanted to ensure vaccine coverage for its employees, then support the city in injections for priority groups.

Đức emphasised that the city organised vaccination for all people, and treated all qualified vaccines equally. — VNS

HCM CITY — A total of 85,608 people in HCM City were vaccinated with Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) on Saturday, the municipal Department of Health announced on Sunday.

The doses used are part of the first shipment of 1 million doses of the Chinese vaccine that were imported by HCM City-based Sapharco under the sponsorship of the private group Vạn Thịnh Phát and delivered to the southern city last month.

Another one million doses of the 5-million-doses contract arrived at Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport on Saturday, pending quality controls before being administered.

The department also said that two districts including Phú Nhuận and Cần Giờ had completed the first dose vaccination for people over 18 years old. Specifically, Phú Nhuận District has a vaccination rate of 152,387 out of 163,961 people, reaching 92.94 per cent of the population. Cần Giờ District has vaccinated 54,130 people, reaching 97.3 per cent. The district has more than 71,000 people, of which those over 18 years old number more than 59,000.

A medical worker consults a resident before the injection.

Trần Thị Xuân Hải and her son had the vaccination at the An Hội Primary School in Gò Vấp District in an excited mood.

"Before getting the injection, I was told that I was to be vaccinated with Vero Cell vaccine, but I was not worried. I think any type of vaccine is fine as long as the disease could be prevented, and the sooner is the better. The doctor here enthusiastically consulted us about the vaccination and I felt even more reassured. After the injection, I feel that I am still healthy," said Hải.

People fill in their personal information and sign to agree to receive the vaccine.

A medical worker gives a Vero Cell vaccination to a resident.

Nguyễn Công Sơn, 55, in Gò Vấp District, said he was advised by the medical staff about the type of vaccine being injected. Believing in the State, he did not hesitate and signed to agree to receive the Vero Cell vaccine.

Nguyễn Hồng Lâm, deputy chairman of the Ward 12 People’s Committee in Gò Vấp District, said the ward had given clear information about the vaccine and injection work to local residents.

All of the injection sites were organised well to ensure security and preventive measures.

HCM City's officials have said that the injection of the vaccines are voluntary and all vaccination sites communicate clearly with the people about the vaccine being offered, amid some hesitancy against the Chinese vaccine, despite it having been approved by WHO and the Vietnamese health ministry.

On Friday, for example, a video clip circulating online showed people leaving a vaccination site on Huyền Trân Công Chúa Street, District 1, HCM City, after being told by health workers that AstraZeneca vaccines had run out and only Sinopharm vaccines were left, on the first day of the 1 million shipment being rolled out. HCM City's representative said they are aware of the incident but the administration of Chinese vaccine still continued at the site throughout the day.

17,916 doses of Sinopharm's vaccine were administered on Friday, according to the city's health authorities.

To date, Việt Nam has received 2.5 million doses of Sinopharm vaccines, with the 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government in June reserved for people in border areas neighbouring China, Chinese nationals in Việt Nam, and people who wish to go to China for trade, studying or work, as well as those who have the need for the vaccine.

HCM City is currently the biggest COVID-19 hot spots with healthcare system straining to deal with the large caseload, and amid global shortage, the city is quickly running out of vaccines to give to its residents.

Việt Nam currently relies mostly on Western vaccines, primarily AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, in its mass vaccination drive. — VNS

Doctor Trần Danh Cường, director of the National Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology talked to Sức khỏe & Đời sống (Health & Life) newspaper about COVID-19 vaccinations for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

Is COVID-19 dangerous to pregnant women? Do they face more risk of catching it than others?

Studies conducted all over the world show that pregnant women face the same risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 as other people.

However, once catching the virus, pregnant women are vulnerable because, during pregnancy, a woman's immune system can be weakened.

During pregnancy the pregnant woman's uterus will be larger, pushing the diaphragm up and making the lung capacity low, which obstructs their breathing. So, the oxygen demand of pregnant women is higher than that of normal people.

As pregnancy progresses, fluid may accumulate in tissues, usually in the feet, ankles, and legs, causing them to swell and appear puffy. This condition is called edema. The edema is also seen in the upper respiratory tract mucosa, which easily causes damage to the upper respiratory tract. If infected with COVID-19, the pregnant women are more at risk.

Underlying health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, chronic lung disease will also cause complications during pregnancy.

Together with the above factors, if pregnant women get COVID-19, they will face a high risk of serious complications which require intensive care, ventilators and ECMO.

Vaccinating pregnant women against COVID-19 is very important.

Is the COVID-19 vaccination safe for pregnant women?

When a pregnant woman catches SARS-CoV-2, two of the most common issues are if the virus goes to the fetus and if the unborn child catches COVID-19.

When we tested amniotic fluid samples from pregnant women after giving birth, blood samples from the umbilical vein and throat fluid samples from the mother and the pathology of the placenta, scientists did not detect any SARS-CoV-2 virus in the samples.

This confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not enter the amniotic cavity where the baby grows.

Normally, in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the exchange between the mother and the fetus is modest, so the risk of transmitting of SARS-CoV-2 virus from mother to child is very low.

However, if an infection occurs at this stage, the risk to the baby is great and can potentially cause abnormalities in the fetus because this is the period of formation and development of the important organs of the fetus.

In the next stage, the possibility of infection between mother and child is very strong, but the risk of causing birth defects is lower because important organs of the fetus have already formed.

According to the latest COVID-19 vaccination guidelines of Việt Nam’s health ministry, pregnant women at 13 weeks and more can get COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccination for the mothers will help produce antibodies against the COVID-19, their babies may benefit from vaccine antibodies that pass through the placenta.

I think that the ministry’s guideline is reasonable using scientific proof ensuring safety for both mothers and their children. The benefits of the vaccination are much more when compared with the risks it might bring.

If the COVID-19 vaccination is taken by breastfeeding mothers, will it affect their babies?

Studies show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not spread through breastfeeding. So, if having the COVID-19, breastfeeding mothers still can breastfeed their babies as long as they strictly take anti-infection measures.

What should pregnant or breastfeeding women do before and after they get COVID-19 vaccines?

The COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women is necessary to protect them from the SARS-CoV-2.

Before getting a COVID-19 vaccine shot, pregnant women need a medical check to identify the health conditions of them and their babies.

Pregnant women with underlying health conditions need more careful medical checks. I think that only those with risks of preeclampsia, placental abruption and other serious obstetric complications should delay the COVID-19 vaccination.

As a medical facility assigned by the Ministry of Health to take care of and protect the health of pregnant and postpartum women, my hospital has prepared all necessary elements to vaccinate pregnant women after 13 weeks and breastfeeding mothers. VNS

HCM CITY — Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính called on people nationwide to exercise their rights and obligations to elect the most deserving deputies to the 15th National Assembly and all-level People’s Councils for 2021-2026 term as he cast his ballot at a polling station in the Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta city of Cần Thơ.

Chính said he was particularly emotional witnessing the excitement of voters in Cần Thơ and those in the Mekong Delta in exercising their rights and obligations of citizens, contributing to building “a socialist state ruled by law and of the People, by the People and for the People.”

“We feel the trust and confidence of the people and voters in the Party and State,” he noted.

He said it was important to organise a “democratic, fair and transparent election in accordance with the law and on schedule as planned.”

“People nationwide must elect the most deserving representatives to the People’s Councils at all levels for 2021-2026 and the 15th National Assembly, the highest state power agency,” Chính said. “The selection is made through a strict process and in accordance with the law.”

On Saturday, Chính worked in Trà Vinh Province on the preparation for the elections. On the same day, he also met with Cần Thơ City’s health sector to discuss COVID-19 prevention and safety.

Given the spread of COVID-19, PM Chính urged voters to observe pandemic prevention and control regulations on the election day.

PM Chính said the health sector in localities must have plans for voters who are on duty in the fight against the pandemic, those who are quarantined, and those who are being treated for the disease.

In localities where the outbreak remains unpredictable, each polling station must have a separate area for the temporary quarantine of suspected COVID cases, per the Ministry of Health regulations, according to Chính.

In a related move, former President Nguyễn Minh Triết and Secretary of Bình Dương Provincial Party Committee Trần Văn Nam cast their first ballots at the polling station No 5 in Phú Thuận Hamlet, Phú An Commune, Bến Cát Town.

According to the Bình Dương Province’s Election Commission, the province has established 1,100 election teams (each team has 10-21 members) in 1,100 polling stations, of which there are 22 special teams (including 16 armed forces and six drug rehabilitation facilities and prisons).

More than 1.7 million voters are expected to go to polling stations in Bình Dương Province.

Representatives of 91 companies with more than 12,000 employees said they would create the most favourable conditions for the employees to vote.

In addition, more than 1 million voters in Tây Ninh went to polling stations.

In Bình Phước Province, from early morning, hundreds of thousands of voters went to polling stations.

Elections at hotspot border areas

To ensure that COVID-19 prevention forces at border areas can vote, the An Giang Province Election Commission set up mobile ballot boxes for pandemic prevention forces to join in the elections at border areas with Cambodia.

From the early morning, the first voters came to polling station No. 11 at Vinh Ngươn border station at Núi Sam Ward in Châu Đốc City.

All the voters had their temperatures checked and their hands disinfected during procedures.

According to Major Cao Ngọc Khuê, a politician from Vĩnh Ngươn Border Guard Station, the station has 29 teams and checkpoints for COVID-19 prevention and control near the border, with a total of 244 voters from three forces (border guards, police and the military).

“We have set up four polling stations, of which three mobile ballot boxes will be transported to checkpoints at the borders with Cambodia so that the pandemic prevention teams can exercise their right to vote while on duty at border areas,” he said.

According to An Giang Province’s Election Commission, the province has 200 teams and checkpoints for COVID-19 prevention and control near the Cambodian border.

As many as 69.2 million voters are eligible to go to 84,767 polling stations across the country to elect deputies to the 15th NA and all-level People’s Councils for 2021-2026 on Sunday.

The National Election Council, Election Committees and election units at all localities have been asked to ensure safety and security for the election.

The election will end at 7pm the same day.

The lists of elected deputies to the People’s Councils at all levels and the National Assembly are expected to be announced 10 days and 20 days after election day, respectively, according to the National Election Council. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The success of the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020 showed Việt Nam is not only an active ASEAN member but also a strong, trustworthy and special mainstay, especially at a challenging time like the COVID-19 crisis, said Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc.

Addressing a conference of the ASEAN National Committee 2020 in Hà Nội on Friday to review the Việt Nam's chairmanship of the bloc, PM Phúc said on the back of strong will, determination and actions of the ASEAN Community, effective co-operation with partners and helmed by Việt Nam, the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020 had been a complete success with a record number of adopted documents and Việt Nam’s initiatives and priorities becoming a common asset of the bloc.

He highlighted success in ensuring security and safety as well as popularising the images of a peaceful and stable ASEAN Community and Viet Nam to international friends.

The PM also expressed his pride in the success of the 41st General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA-41) and the eighth meeting of the Council of ASEAN Chief Justices (CACJ).

He said the adopted regional strategies were a hallmark of the success of the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020, adding that the theme 'Cohesive and Responsive' suits the circumstances, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

He reviewed progress in the building of the ASEAN Community in the spirit of maintaining its central role. Under the direction of Việt Nam, ASEAN flexibly adapted to uncertainties. For the first time, the ASEAN Summit was held three times this year instead of twice.

According to him, ASEAN’s success has brought invaluable lessons in terms of pooling collective power not only on regional but also global scale in response to the common challenges of humankind.

With achievements throughout 2020, Việt Nam’s will, brainpower and stature had been clearly demonstrated, he said.

Throughout 25 years of entry to ASEAN, Việt Nam has made important contributions to the grouping and become a crucial member building rules in ASEAN and the region.

Looking back on ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020, PM Phúc mentioned several invaluable lessons, with the first and foremost being unified directions of the Party and State leaders and their close watch on national external activities this year, as well as tapping the collective power of the entire political system, social organisations and people to contribute to the success of the year.

The second one is the effective collaboration between the Government and National Assembly organs in organising AIPA-41 and ASEAN 2020.

The third lesson is upholding Việt Nam’s diplomatic identity by consistently pursuing goals while flexibly adopting strategies to turn risks into opportunities, together with sincerity and integrity for common benefits and responsibilities.

The fourth is active and thorough preparations in terms of agenda, reception, security and communications for the country’s major external activities.

The fifth is the importance of multilateral diplomacy and the role of ASEAN in Việt Nam’s external guideline of smoothly combining bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, tapping the effectiveness of multilateral events to deepen bilateral ties, and pooling international resources for national development.

The sixth lesson is the harmonious combination of internal and external relations. The success of the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020 was greatly attributed to by Viet Nam's achievements in performing the dual tasks of controlling the pandemic and recovering socio-economic development, supporting businesses and taking care of people's lives.

Emphasising the success of the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020, the Prime Minister said this was a comprehensive success in all aspects, from content and reception work to security and healthcare. Information, communications, culture, and promotion were implemented methodically and effectively. In the 36th and 37th ASEAN Summits, there were no major incidents or errors on any front.

On behalf of the Government, PM Phúc praised all leaders, officers, soldiers, employees of ministries, departments, agencies from central to local levels, as well as businesses, sponsors, media agencies and people nationwide for their efforts to contribute to the success of the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020.

Amid complicated and unpredictable developments in the world and the region, and tough foreign relation tasks, the Government leader agreed with the proposal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue promoting the success of the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020 to raise Vietnam's global position and boost its international economic integration.

Việt Nam should implement the priority tasks of ASEAN, especially initiatives put forth by the country during the chairmanship year, he said, adding it would work with other ASEAN countries to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and promote overall and sustainable economic recovery while taking advantage of opportunities brought by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

The PM said the success of the ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020 was a new victory of the Party's multilateral foreign policy.

“This provides new vitality for us to confidently and proactively make greater victories in the process of deep and effective international integration,” he concluded. — VNS

HCM CITY — The Ministry of Information and Communications and Ministry of Health has called on localities to take full advantage of information and technology to administer vaccinations rapidly and effectively.

Speaking at an online conference on IT applications in COVID-19 prevention and control, Đỗ Công Anh, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Information and Communications Department of Informatisation emphasised that utilising IT in the vaccination campaign would ensure the campaign’s transparency.

Four vaccination management platforms have been built by the military-run telecom group Viettel under the guidelines of the two ministries, including the electronic health record app, a portal for COVID immunisation information at tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn/portal, a system supporting national vaccination at tiemchungcovid19.moh.gov.vn, and an MCC Centre, with its database to be managed centrally and transparently.

The databases of these platforms are strictly managed, ensuring transparency of information for both people and State management agencies. The vaccination management system has been implemented in five steps from vaccination registration to post-vaccination monitoring.

People can register to get a COVID-19 vaccine via the e-health record application and immunisation information portal. After receiving the information, departments of health in specific areas will guide people to vaccination sites.

The health departments will be in charge of allocating vaccines to vaccination sites. After being vaccinated, people can track their vaccination records via the two platforms.

The data will be centrally managed on the national COVID-19 vaccination management platform and will support the National Immunisation Steering Committee to monitor vaccination results and manage the entire nationwide vaccination campaign.

Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Huy Dũng said the vaccination management platform was capable of managing vaccines from their arrival in Việt Nam, to their storage, distribution, and shipping to vaccination sites and to the point of injection. Each dose, each batch, each type of vaccine has been tightly managed at each vaccination site.

"The IT application will help us deploy the vaccination campaign more rapidly and conveniently,” he said.

Võ Thị Trung Trinh, Deputy Director of the HCM City’s Department of Information and Communications said the application of the national vaccination management platform in the fifth phase of the city-wide vaccination campaign has increased the number of vaccinated people to 930,230 after 10 days.

"In the fifth phase, the vaccination programme has accelerated very quickly. In the first days there were only a few thousand injections per day. But the number has reached over 100,000 per day in recent days,” she said.

Trinh also said the department had suggested measures to deal with unexpected situations that arise in different localities.

In addition, the city also recommended the department send IT staff to standardise vaccination registration data and ensure the apps were being used effectively.

The department will make a list of people that need to be vaccinated on the national immunisation portal and e-health book app and use pandemic data to point out the hot spots where rapid vaccination is needed.

Anh confirmed the practice of using the IT applications in HCM City was a valuable test case for expanding the technology nationwide.

He has asked the departments of health and information and communications to register for vaccination via the e-health record application or immunisation information portal tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn.

All vaccination sites, including mobile ones, must be connected to the internet. Technological systems and platforms related to COVID-19 vaccination would be further upgraded, he said. — VNS

HCM CITY Two Vietnamese films by Marcus Mạnh Cường Vũ and Nguyễn Phan Linh Đan have been included at the Busan Film Festival, while the new horror movie by Lê Bình Giang has been introduced at the Locarno Film Festival.

The Asian Project Market (APM) at the Busan Film Festival, which recently announced 26 films participating this year, will take place from October 12-14 within the framework of the Busan International Film Festival 2021 in South Korea.

Among 26 films participating in APM, two are Vietnamese movies, including Memento Mori: Water from director Vũ and producers Nguyễn Hoàng Điệp and Nguyễn Trinh Hoan, and the film If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood from director Đan and producer Ngô Thị Bích Hạnh.

Memento Mori: Water is the second movie in the Memento Mori the Movie trilogy, written and directed by Vũ since 2019. The series is inspired by a true story in the book Điểm đến cuộc đời (Destination of Life) by author Đặng Hoàng Giang.

The film tells the story of Hà, a mother who has a son with bone cancer. The main event offers Hà an opportunity to experience sympathy and enlightenment, among other insights.

The movie is currently in pre-production, and is scheduled to start filming in 2022 and be released in 2023.

The first movie of the series, Memento Mori: Land, is seeking community funds to complete its post-production.

Director Vũ told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper that it was a great honour to be included in the Busan Film Festival.

“This is the first crucial recognition for the project. Every filmmaker in Asia looks forward to APM during his or her first steps,” he said, adding that this "relay station" is especially meaningful as the film industry is facing difficulties due to the pandemic.

Little information is currently available for the movie If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood. Its director Đan took part in the 2019 Busan Film Festival in his role as cinematography director for the movie Bí mật của gió (The Secret of the Wind) directed by Nguyễn Phan Quang Bình, who is Đan’s father.

Đan plans to return to the festival this year as a film director. This is Đan’s first time as a director for a movie, after making a number of music videos, commercials and short film projects.

APM is rated as the best "filter" of Asian art film projects, and 26 selected movies this year are from 15 countries.

Giang’s horror movie

Variety magazine on August 7 reported that director Lê Bình Giang’s horror movie Who Created Human Beings is part of the Open Doors programme at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland between August 4 and 14.

The film is about a policeman named Sinh and his girlfriend Linh who are both Catholic. The characters and plot are inspired by real people whom Giang knows.

The film explores the differences between the older generation and their adult children, as well as certain religious and social norms.

Shooting for the film starts in a mountain village during the rainy season in 2022. VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@While the shift to online learning amid COVID-19 prompted discussions around how to ensure quality quickly, the conversation is now evolving into how to look more into students’ needs and use student feedback to improve quality.

This trend was discussed among nearly 800 leaders, experts, and academics at the recent workshop on Quality Assurance for Online and Digitally Enhanced Learning, the biggest industry-facing event co-hosted by RMIT Vietnam since the pandemic started.

Nearly 800 leaders, experts, and academics at the recent workshop on Quality Assurance for Online and Digitally Enhanced Learning, the biggest industry-facing event co-hosted by RMIT University and the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training

Drawing experience from universities and tertiary education authorities in both Australia and Viet nam, the experts shared some lessons learned from the recent period of online and hybrid learning.

A holistic approach

Representatives from RMIT University, Deakin University and the Australian Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) all highlighted that the online student experience is more than just about learning. As such, a high-quality education needs to cater for the holistic student experience regardless of the delivery mode.

Professor Shona Leitch, Associate Deputy Vice-Chancellor Education at RMIT University, commented: “All considerations should be student-centric, from designing online course contents and learning environments, to setting learning outcomes and the actual teaching and assessment.”

Beyond that, student support mechanisms should be available on virtual platforms as well. At RMIT, student services like the library, recreation centre, student advice, academic support, wellbeing, and career advice are now all accessible online with some being accessible by students 24/7.

“We also conduct student surveys throughout the semester and quality confirmation checks on all courses, which enable us to adapt to our students’ expectations and ensure that our staff have the capability and support they need to make continuous improvement,” Professor Leitch added.

Digital is the new norm

Experts agreed on the need to think of online learning not as a second choice, but a current necessity and constant element of modern education going forward. Such a mindset would help steer actions that improve the quality of online teaching and learning.

According to quality assurance specialist Dr Nguyen Huu Cuong, educational institutions need to prioritise equipping their faculty with the capacity to teach online and their students with the skills to learn online.

“Online education requires specific online teaching materials as well. Though a challenge for many Vietnamese institutions, the way forward for them is to upgrade their digital libraries so that both academics and students can access high-quality online resources,” Dr Cuong said.

Online delivery also urges academics to think about assessment more creatively. Authentic assessment (rather than traditional exams) has been adopted by many Australian universities including RMIT, and such experience was shared with their Vietnamese counterparts at the workshop.

Quality assurance framework

In a move to support online education, the Vietnamese Prime Minister has approved several plans to develop distance learning. Moreover, Viet Nam's Ministry of Education and Training has issued distance learning frameworks, regulations allowing a 30% online component in undergraduate and doctorate programs, criteria for assessing the quality of distance education programs, as well as research projects and directives for implementation.

According to Associate Professor Pham Van Tuan from the University of Da Nang, AUN-QA Lead Assessor, “constitutes of quality in online learning include the institutional strategy, teaching and learning methodology, online-appropriate student assessment methods, course development, professional development for online teaching staff, IT skills development for tech support staff, and more.”

“Institutions need to build an online learning quality assurance framework covering the constituent elements of quality identified, and comply with the regulations that govern online learning,” he emphasised.

Overall, the Australian and Vietnamese experts at the workshop agreed that online and digitally enhanced learning is an exciting area to collaborate in. They expect to use the lessons learned from the past 18 months to give students a much deeper and richer experience in the future.

HCM CITY — The HCM City People’s Committee plans to establish technical standards to develop a single smart card that could be used for all types of public transport.

The city aims to create inter-linkages between automatic fare collection (AFC) systems as well as convenience for card users.

If metro lines, rapid buses and water buses have many kinds of AFC systems, the cost to interlink these systems would be too high, according to city officials.

The committee has sought clearance from the Ministry of Transport to give the city the authority to decide on the technical standards for all AFC systems in public passenger transport on waterways and roads.

An AFC system is in line with the city’s smart-city project which promotes the use of cashless payments.

In a related issue, the city’s Transport Department is considering investment in an automatic payment system that could be used for all types of public transport.

The city launched a one-year pilot project on the use of cashless payment for public buses in March 2019, and later extended it to the end of this year.

The pilot is expected to encourage more residents to use the bus system. Passengers need to register to get a bus card, which is similar to a bank card.

The cashless payment was first used on bus route No 86 from Bến Thành Market in District 1 to Tôn Đức Thắng University in District 7.

The project is being piloted on a total of eight bus routes instead of 18 bus routes as previously planned. More than 10,300 smart bus cards were issued to passengers by the end of last year.

After preliminary review and evaluation, the city will decide on how to proceed with the project.

The pilot scheme will also be applied to metro lines, rapid buses and boats in the future.

The Việt Nam Thương Tín Commercial Joint Stock Bank (VietBank) and Zion Company received approval to carry out the pilot project, which uses capital from enterprises instead of funds from the city or state budget. — VNS

HÀ NỘI – Through global ups and downs over the past more than five decades, the role and mettle of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been reinforced and sharpened, making the bloc more complete and become stronger, Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Bùi Thanh Sơn has stressed in an article on the occasion of the association’s 54th founding anniversary (August 8, 1967-2021).

Sơn highlighted that ASEAN had been one of the most important and successful regional organisations in the world, leading a wide and deep connectivity process, creating and maintaining peace, stability and development in Southeast Asia and the entire region.

From a group of war-divided countries, ASEAN had risen to a 10-member bloc with more than 650 million people having diverse cultural identities and a giant economic community having the fifth largest combined GDP in the world, a trust-worthy partner of many countries and an organisation playing a central role in dialogue, cooperation and connectivity processes in the region, he noted.

The formation of an ASEAN Community with three key pillars of ASEAN Political-Security Community, ASEAN Economic Community and ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community, is evidence for the bloc’s vitality, promoting the regional connectivity process to a new height for peace, cooperation and prosperous development, the article says.

The minister underscored fundamental principles of the bloc, including solidarity, consensus and not interfering in internal affairs of member states, stressing that ASEAN member countries had been supporting each other in overcoming adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The “ASEAN Manner” of solidarity and unity has helped the association and its members overcome tough times in the region and the world, turning the bloc into a more mature organisation with a higher role in the region.

Thanks to its prestige, position and central role, the association has expanded external relations and received support from the international community.

So far, ASEAN has set up dialogue partnerships with 11 countries and important organisations. Many standpoints and regulations of ASEAN, such as the ASEAN Charter, the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) have been supported and welcomed by the international community and partners.

On the basis of respecting international law and settling disputes and differences through peaceful measures in line with international law and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ASEAN has made important contributions to maintaining a peaceful and stable environment in the East Sea, which have been supported by the international community, the article says.

In terms of economic integration, so far, intra-bloc trade has accounted for about 25 percent of the total trade revenue of the whole bloc. The effective implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community is pushing the association closer to a united market with a scale of nearly US$3 trillion. Besides, the association is also the centre of an expanded economic space with a network of eight free trade agreements (FTA), including the ASEAN Free Trade Area and seven FTAs with important partners, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), creating a free trade area accounting for 30 percent of the population and 32 percent of GDP of the world.

Over the past 54 years, ASEAN can be proud of itself as a successful regional connectivity model. The bloc’s achievements laid a foundation for ASEAN to be optimistic about the future growth of the grouping, the article stresses.

Sơn underlined that ASEAN had been placed at an important position in the external policy and international integration of Vietnam. "ASEAN is a gateway to bring Vietnam to wider playgrounds in the region and the world. Joining ASEAN is a decision of strategic vision of the Party and State, contributing to establishing a new development status for the country, reinforcing a peaceful and stable environment and optimising external resources for the country’s development and enhancement of its position."

Vietnam has seriously implemented its commitments and obligations as an ASEAN member, while making various important contributions to the promotion of intra-bloc solidarity, the building of the ASEAN Community and the implementation of the ASEAN Vision 2025, the article says.

Vietnam had performed the role of the ASEAN Chair three times, all in tough times of the association, Sơn noted. In the 2000-2001 period, the association entered a transitional period in Community building after experiencing the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. In 2010, the association realised its Community vision amid the serious impacts of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Meanwhile, the year of 2020 saw the outbreak of COVID-19 on a global scale, leading to complicated changes in the international situation.

With the cohesive and responsive spirit and the persistence to ASEAN principles, Việt Nam had joined hands with other ASEAN members to drive the association through hard times, actively adapting and responding to the new situation, firmly maintaining the trend of cooperation and connectivity in the region, affirming the central role and enhancing the position of the association. Many initiatives put forward by Việt Nam in 2020 had become a shared property of ASEAN, including the ASEAN COVID-19 Respond Fund and the ASEAN Regional Reserve of Medical Supplies for Public Health Emergencies.

Realising its foreign policy set by the 13th National Party Congress and with a new status after 35 years of “Đổi Mới” (Renewal), Việt Nam had continued to work with other ASEAN members to build a Community of solidarity and strength, firmly holding the central role in the regional security architecture.

Vietnam would continue to make efforts to effectively implement initiatives and agreements, contributing to the settlement of common issues of ASEAN and the region, affirmed Sơn, stressing the need to foster coordination among ministries, sectors, localities and businesses in promoting ASEAN cooperation, with focus on personnel training.

The way ahead may be tough, but with the promotion of the ASEAN manner and unique value, along with the determination and great development potential of member countries, ASEAN would make new chapters of success in building the ASEAN Community of solidarity, strength, self-reliance, bringing about benefits to all members and making important contributions to peace, stability and prosperity in the region.

“Việt Nam will continue to spare no efforts, together with ASEAN, to realise this fine goal,” Sơn concluded. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Nguyễn Quốc Dũng, Deputy Foreign Minister of Việt Nam and Head of Việt Nam’s ASEAN Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM), has penned an article reviewing the ASEAN centrality in the year 2020, when Việt Nam successfully fulfilled the chairmanship role.

Below is the full text of his article.

“2020 drew to a close with complex and multidimensional upheavals that have not been witnessed in the regional and global politics and economy in a long time. As Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc put it, the “ASEAN 2020 ship” has navigated through “rough sea and tumultuous storms of the COVID-19 pandemic, but rocked by economic recessions, disrupted trading activities, and growing strategic competition between major powers in the world that is playing out right within the region.

Undaunted, the “ASEAN 2020 ship”, under the steering of Việt Nam and the cooperation from member countries and partners and friends, have strongly overcome the adversity, reaffirmed its central position in the region, and elevated its reputation and profile in the international arena.”

ASEAN Centrality: the fruit of long, patient building process

The notion of “ASEAN centrality” started to gain traction among the group’s member countries since around 2005-06 when ASEAN perceived a growing pressure and sway from outside partners.

In that context, centrality is understood as that ASEAN always coordinates perspectives and actions in its cooperation relationship with partners so as to maintain the group’s ‘main driver’ role, as well as uphold the group’s central role in shaping regional cooperation structures based on ASEAN-led forums and frameworks.

With the birth of the ASEAN Charter, ASEAN centrality has been codified – the notion becoming both the goal and guiding light for ASEAN activities.

From the five founding members, ASEAN had gradually opened up to the current 10 countries of Southeast Asia, transforming the region from a state of conflict, division, and full of doubts in the Cold War era to a region of peace, solidarity, cooperation and development – making ASEAN one of the world’s models of regional cooperation. In addition, ASEAN has set up dialogue partnership with nine countries and one international organisation (the United Nations) and one important regional player (the European Union).

Other than bilateral frameworks, ASEAN also established many important forums and mechanisms – including ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), ASEAN+3, and East Asia Summit (EAS) – which help bind partners more strongly into regional dialogue and cooperation processes.

ASEAN centrality also comes from initiatives, ideas, and agenda for the sake of mutual benefits that the Association proposes and leads the implementation, based on common principles and code of conduct that the Association has built as well as on the interests of the dialogues and cooperation brought about by the many mechanisms and forums that the Association has set up.

From ASEAN’s proposals, a series of regional cooperation and linkage programmes have been implemented such as: free trade agreements, connectivity plans, etc. Dozens of external partners have voluntarily participated and committed to complying with the principles and provisions set out in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC), which is considered ASEAN’s “set of rules” in governing the conduct of countries in the region.

In joining ASEAN's cooperation mechanisms and frameworks, major countries not only reap benefits from various cooperation plans and programmes with ASEAN, but also have opportunities to meet, converse and work together. ASEAN's major forums and events – with a friendly atmosphere of dialogue and cooperation – have served as a good environment for leaders and ministers of major nations to have bilateral meetings to build trust and overcome differences.

From the achievements and experiences, in 2015, ASEAN concretised the “ASEAN centrality” notion into five key aspects – the central role within an independent and resilient ASEAN, a central role in the face of hot-button issues in the region, a central role in relations with major countries and other dialogue partners, a central role in the regional structure, and finally, a central role in participating in and resolving issues and challenges of global concerns.

2020: ASEAN centrality reaffirmed in the face of unprecedented challenges

“Adversity tests strength as fire test gold,” in 2020, against unprecedented challenges, the ASEAN centrality has been fully asserted in every way.

First, the theme of ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020 – “Cohesive and Responsive” – showcases all aspects of the “ASEAN centrality”.

If solidarity, cohesion, and strong cooperation serves as a solid foundation, then timely responsiveness and adaptation is the way for ASEAN to continue to reaffirm its leading role in the region.

Overcoming the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, ASEAN continues to firmly maintain the momentum of building the ASEAN Community, promoting the effective implementation of plans and programmes to realise the goals stated in the ASEAN Community Vision 2025.

Facing the risk of cancellation of ASEAN summits and meetings due to interrupted aviation activities, under the chair of Việt Nam last year, ASEAN has flexibly and promptly moved hundreds of conferences and meetings to virtual format. In 2020, more than 550 conferences and meetings have been held in this manner. This not only helped carry on the momentum of dialogue and cooperation in the region, but also helped shape a new way of operation, helping to enhance ASEAN’s resilience and flexibility.

Along with that, ASEAN continued to assert an important role and voice on essential issues related to regional peace and security. Faced with the adverse ramifications of increased competition and friction among major powers, on August 8, 2020, ASEAN Foreign Ministers issued a Statement on the Importance of Maintaining Peace and Stability in Southeast Asia.

In this Declaration, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers affirmed their strong, shared commitment to the maintenance of peace, security, neutrality and stability, the rule of law, contributions to strengthening mutual trust and confidence, and working towards building an open, transparent, inclusive and rules-based regional architecture, thereby reinforcing ASEAN's central role.

With complex issues such as the South China Sea (known in Việt Nam as the East Sea), ASEAN always works closely, maintains consensus and a common voice. In particular, in 2020, the role of international law was emphasised by many countries, especially the role of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the legal framework governing all activities in the seas and oceans.

ASEAN has been continuing to expand and deepen existing partnerships, including agreeing to upgrade ASEAN-EU relations to a strategic partnership level, while at the same time, proactively deploying many measures to strengthen relations with other partners.

In 2020, ASEAN agreed to grant the status of development partners to Italy and France, opening opportunities to further promote cooperation with these countries in the coming time. As many partners have been seeking to draw ASEAN into their own regional initiatives and strategies, ASEAN has persistently upheld the goals, principles and priorities outlined in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and at the same time, mobilised these very partners to support and back ASEAN in implementing the directions and priorities stated in the Outlook report for the mutual benefit of peace, stability, and development.

At the global level, ASEAN has made great efforts to participate and contribute to the resolution of common challenges and problems. Many proposals on promoting sustainable development, combating climate change, ensuring gender equality and women’s empowerment have been approved and put into practice.

ASEAN cooperation with the UN and relevant authorities continues to be strengthened. In addition, the conclusion of the negotiations and inking of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) not only will bring practical benefits to the participating countries but also this is an important contribution of ASEAN in the efforts to strengthen trust and create more impetus for multilateralism and the multilateral trading system.

“ASEAN centrality” is both the goal and the guiding principle of ASEAN activities. The central role is not an "privilege" that is automatically available to the Association, the bloc can only create and nurture its “centrality” through its prestige, sincerity and the stance of “neutrality, peace, dialogue and cooperation” that has been constructed from the relentless efforts of ASEAN during its long journey of formation and development. Through unprecedented hardships and challenges, “ASEAN centrality” has been consolidated and strengthened in 2020.

In its capacity as ASEAN Chair in 2020, Việt Nam has accompanied the group to overcome never-before-seen hardship, and reaffirmed its position as one of the “core”, “leading” members who actively build and shape the rules in ASEAN and the region.

As Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc said at the review meeting of the ASEAN National Committee 2020, on December 11 last year, Việt Nam has truly proved a “solid and reliable source of support, especially in the moments when ASEAN grappled with arrays of difficulties and challenges.”

These results will create an important foundation for Việt Nam and ASEAN countries to continue to steer the "ASEAN ship" to conquer all challenges, become more connected and boast higher adaptive capacity, and achieve new victories in the coming time.” — VNS

In late 2019 and early 2020, China announced its 'Four-Sha' sovereignty claims over the East Sea in two diplomatic notes sent to the UN Secretary-General, aiming to replace the so-called 'nine-dash line' that had been previously rejected by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).



It claimed in the notes that it holds “undeniable sovereignty” over the Dongsha (Pratas Islands), Xisha (Viet Nam’s Hoang Sa (Paracel) Archipelago), Nansha (Viet Nam’s Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago), and Zhongsha (Macclesfield Bank) Archipelagos.



China said those are archipelagos so it can use the straight baselines to define baselines and waters, adding that these groups of islands have archipelagic waters, territorial waters, 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves calculated from the straight baselines.

Contrary to UNCLOS

Let us consider China's claim based on the provisions of international law, especially the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

UNCLOS specifies that only "archipelagic states", made up entirely of one or more archipelagos, can use straight baselines to connect the outer points of the outermost islands and coral reefs of an archipelago with some outstanding conditions as follows:

1. An archipelagic state may draw straight archipelagic baselines joining the outermost points of the outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago provided that within such baselines are included the main islands and an area in which the ratio of the area of the water to the area of the land, including atolls, is between 1 to 1 and 9 to 1.

2. The length of such baselines shall not exceed 100 nautical miles, except that up to 3 per cent of the total number of baselines enclosing any archipelago may exceed that length, up to a maximum length of 125 nautical miles.

In addition, UNCLOS states that: "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.”

We can take a look at the legal regime of the islands cited by China to clearly see the errors in China's claim.

Clearly, China is not an archipelagic state "made up entirely of one or more archipelagoes", so the baseline straightening the archipelago to connect the islands outside the 'Four Shas' is completely contrary to the provisions of UNCLOS.

First, consider Zhong Sha (Macclesfield Bank), a reef with a depth of at least 9.2m. Per UNCLOS, it is not a subject for territorial claims. According to Chatham Academy scholar and journalist Bill Hayton, because there was absolutely no knowledge of the reefs in the South China Sea, in the past, when translating the names of a series of reefs from English into Chinese, the words "bank" or "shoal" were mistakenly translated into island or sandbank. It was this mistake that led China to name Macclesfield Bank as the 'Nansha Archipelago,' and then had its name changed to 'Zhongsha Archipelago' in 1947.

China recently included several shoals, such as Scarborough Shoal and St. Esprit Shoal, into the so-called Zhongsha, he said, stressing that the expansion is not persuasive as these shoals are located quite far from the Macclesfield Bank.

The 2016 PCA ruling clarified UNCLOS’s “fit for living” concept and stated islands in the Spratly Archipelago are only rock islands, meaning they have no exclusive economic zones or continental shelves.

Similarly, the Paracel and the Pratas Islands are rock islands without exclusive economic zones or continental shelves.

Attempt to rewrite UNCLOS

By making the 'Four Sha' claims (Dongsha, Xisha, Nansha, and Zhongsha), China attempted to take advantage of UNCLOS’s terms to rewrite the convention.

Comparing the court's arguments against the islands in the Paracel Islands (under Vietnamese sovereignty), it can be seen these islands with their natural conditions have never before had a stable population community considering it as home; meanwhile, economic activities are purely natural resources exploitation activities; the ratio of land area and water in the archipelago area is much smaller than the ratio of 1:9. Therefore, the islands of the Paracel Islands are only rocky islands and cannot use straight baselines to connect the islands on this archipelago to form archipelagic waters.

The last 'Sha' in the 'Four Shas' - Pratas Islands - is currently controlled by Taiwan (China), and is actually a collection of coral reefs that only protrude from the water surface during ebb tide, except for one coral rock. As such, this cannot be considered an archipelago but only a rock, without an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.

By using this tactic, China attempted to rewrite UNCLOS. Combined with using its military power to harass and its economic power to bribe countries both inside and outside of the East Sea, China wishes to turn its illogical arguments into reality to monopolise the waters.

Such claims were rejected by Việt Nam in its own diplomatic note sent to the UN Secretary-General, in which it affirmed its sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction, and other legitimate rights in the East Sea. Việt Nam also asserted UNCLOS is the only legal basis with comprehensive and thorough regulations on the territorial rights of waters between Việt Nam and China.--VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Governor of the State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV) Nguyễn Thị Hồng has directed commercial banks in the Mekong Delta region to support rice producers and traders to overcome difficulties amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The latest outbreak of the pandemic has negatively affected the paddy and rice supply chain, from production and distribution to consumption and export, especially in the Mekong Delta region.

Under Document No 5747/NHNN-TD issued earlier this week, commercial banks must ensure they fully and promptly meet capital needs and expand credit limits for rice traders so they have enough capital to purchase more paddy and rice, and increase their storage, preservation and processing establishments.

Banks also need to step up reforms and simplify their internal procedures to shorten the loan approval time besides diversifying appropriate credit products and working directly with rice traders and businesses to have effective solutions to overcome difficulties.

However, the SBV noted, the lending must still meet the Government’s current credit rules to ensure legal cash flow management and debt recovery.

It is necessary to continually promote the implementation of credit policies for agricultural and rural development, of which focus is placed on lending to models of chains from paddy and rice production to purchasing, processing, preservation and consumption, according to the SBV.

Banks need to continually implement solutions, such as restructuring repayment terms, keeping the debt group unchanged, exempting and reducing interest and fees for loans, to remove difficulties for COVID-19-affected customers, including rice producers and traders, to help them restore production and business.

They must follow closely the rice market’s developments and lending to purchase and temporarily store paddy and rice in the area to promptly report and propose solutions to the provincial and municipal People's committees during the implementation.

According to Đỗ Hoài Nam, Chairman and General Director of Intimex Group, complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it difficult for rice trading. Rice traders are facing obstacles due to social distancing measures, especially in the stage of loading and unloading, causing big problems for exporters.

Nam underlined the significance of promptly controlling COVID-19 as well as faster vaccinations for workers in food producing and processing companies.

The Việt Nam Food Association also said due to pandemic prevention and control regulations, it is difficult for domestic companies to buy, process and export rice. Meanwhile, the opportunity is high for Việt Nam to increase exports as global demand is rising and supplies are falling, especially from big exporters like India and Thailand.

Rice supply chain faces risk of disruption

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said more than 1.5 million hectares of rice in the Mekong Delta with eight million tonnes are ready for harvest, but there are no traders to buy the grain.

Farmers in the south are unable to sell their produce while consumers are struggling to buy food, a frustrating paradox created by COVID-19 travel restrictions and the closure of both wholesale and retail markets.

The threat of disruption in the supply means prices have fallen by 10-25 per cent from a month ago, or VNĐ500-800 per kilogramme.

However, farmers still cannot sell their rice.

Trần Văn Nam of Cần Thơ City said he has just harvested around 20 tonnes of high-quality rice. Two months before the harvest, a trader came and deposited VNĐ9 million for his rice and agreed to buy at VNĐ6,000 a kilogramme, but since social distancing began and transportation has become very difficult, the trader has opted to forfeit deposit and prices have started to fall relentlessly.

Nguyễn Văn Kiên, a large rice trader in Cần Thơ, said many traders have chosen to forego deposit rather than buy the rice at the committed prices since that would increase their losses.

"In previous years in the summer-autumn rice crop I used to buy 50,000-60,000 tonnes of rice from farmers in Hậu Giang, An Giang, Bạc Liêu, and Kiên Giang provinces, but this year I bought only 5,000 tonnes because I cannot transport it to large markets like HCM City."

He has 100 employees buying rice from throughout the delta, and they all have to carry COVID-19 negative test results that are only valid for three days while the procurement takes them one to two weeks, he said.

The Việt Nam Food Association said since social distancing began, half of the 120 rice enterprises in the delta have suspended operations and the rest have reduced their capacity by half.

To resolve these problems, the Vietnam Food Association calls for the Ministry of Industry and Trade and other related ministries to create favourable conditions for traders to buy and distribute rice by prioritising for vehicles rice transporting the grain and vaccinating workers in the rice and food supply chains.

HÀ NỘI — The Hà Nội People's Committee has issued a plan to provide enough medical oxygen for a scenario in which the number of COVID-19 patients in the city reaches 40,000.

The move aims at ensuring adequate medical oxygen for hospitals and medical facilities under the management of the city's Department of Health (DoH) and using resources in the treatment of patients reasonably, economically, and effectively.

The plan is implemented in three phases, responding to scenarios in which the number of COVID-19 patients hits 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000, respectively.

The patients are classified in line with the severity of the disease based on the Ministry of Health's guidance. They are asymptomatic patients with mild (83.6 per cent) and moderate levels (7 per cent), severe patients needing oxygen (3.8 per cent) and very severe patients needing invasive and non-invasive ventilation (3.6 per cent), and critical patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) intervention (2 per cent).

Therefore, there will be 3,120 patients requiring medical oxygen (9.4 per cent) if the number of coronavirus infections is up to 40,000.

The treatment facilities will be divided in accordance with the disease severity. There will be establishments that care for moderate patients, severe and critical patients requiring intensive care treatment as well as those that treat mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.

To carry out the plan effectively, it is necessary to involve the entire political system, relevant departments, agencies, and units. There should be close coordination between forces to assure the capacity to store medical oxygen, supply and transport of the oxygen to the hospitals and medical facilities under the management of the DoH. — VNS

VIENTIANE – President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on Monday met with Lao Prime Minister Phankham Viphavanh, and visited and held separate meetings with former Party and State leaders of Laos.

They include Khamtai Siphandone, former President of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) and former President of Laos, and former Party General Secretaries and former Presidents Choummaly Sayasone, and Bounnhang Vorachith.

On the same day, President Phúc received Sinlavong Khutphaythoun, President of the Lao Front for National Construction Central Committee, and Khambay Damlath, President of the Laos – Vietnam Friendship Association Central Committee.

At these meetings, the current and former leaders of Laos stressed that President Phúc's selection of Laos for his first overseas visit in his new position showed that the Vietnamese Party and State, and the President himself have attached special importance to preserving, protecting and nurturing the great friendship, special solidarity, and comprehensive cooperation between the two nations.

President Phúc and the current and former leaders of Laos highly evaluated the measures having been applied by each other's country to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. They expressed their delight at timely mutual support between the two nations amid the pandemic.

Agreeing on orientations for collaboration in the time to come, they highlighted the need to well coordinate with each other in the implementation of high-level agreements, the Agreement on Bilateral Cooperation for 2021-2025, and the Vietnam-Laos Cooperation Strategy for 2021-2030.

They agreed to support the Vietnamese and Lao Governments in speeding up the implementation of important joint projects such as Vũng Áng ports, Hà Nội-Vientiane expressway, Vientiane-Vũng Áng railway, Laos-Việt Nam friendship park in Vientiane, Nongkhang airport, and hospitals in Laos’ Houaphan and Xiangkhouang provinces.

They agreed to strengthen Việt Nam – Laos collaboration at multilateral forums, particularly at the UN, ASEAN, and sub-regional cooperation mechanisms, to contribute to peace, stability, and development in the region and in the world.

In the evening, General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee and President of Laos Thongloun Sisoulith and his spouse hosted a banquet in honour of President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, his wife and the Vietnamese delegation.

Deputy PM discusses bilateral cooperation areas

Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Lê Văn Thành during his talks with Lao Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Planning and Investment Sonexay Siphandone on the same day suggested Việt Nam and Laos boost cooperation in institution-policy, infrastructure and human resources in the time ahead.

Thanh said many Vietnamese firms wanted to invest in the neighbouring country, and called on Laos to further streamline its procedures and offer more incentives to investors.

The two countries have ample room for trade and investment cooperation, he said, suggesting the establishment of a special working group in charge of drawing up specific cooperation programmes, and removing roadblocks for joint projects.

Sonexay Siphandone said the two sides should step up border trade and collaboration in electricity and mining, intensify infrastructure connectivity, and upgrade border gates to facilitate trade and transportation of goods.

Vietnamese fruits are favoured in Laos, he said, noting the two countries’ ministries and agencies would work on mechanisms and policies on goods production and exchange, and increase online exchanges amid COVID-19.

The Deputy PMs agreed to designate 2022 as the Year of Việt Nam-Laos, Laos-Việt Nam Friendship and Solidarity to mark the 60th founding anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties and 45 years of the signing of the Việt Nam-Lao Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.

Vietnamese, Lao Fronts boost cooperation

President of the Vietnam Fatherland Front (VFF) Central Committee Đỗ Văn Chiến also met with his Lao counterpart Sinlavong Khoutphaythoune in Vientiane on Monday.

Chiến and Sinlavong affirmed that the relationship between the VFF and the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) had developed fruitfully over the past time, with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Cambodian, Lao and Vietnamese Front organisations on the cooperation programme for the 2020-2023 period.

The two sides will hold an online conference in mid-September to exchange experience in Front work and discuss specific cooperation contents for the coming years.

The VFF Central Committee would propose a grand programme to celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and Laos and the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Vietnam-Laos Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in 2022 under the direction of President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, Chiến added.

Vietnamese, Lao provinces seek to deepen ties

Chairman of the People's Committee of the Vietnamese northern province of Bắc Giang Lê Ánh Dương meanwhile had a meeting with Khamlieng Outthakaison, Secretary of the provincial Party Committee and Governor of Xaysomboun province of Laos.

Earlier the same day, the two provinces signed a cooperation agreement for 2021 – 2025.

At the meeting, the Vietnamese and Lao officials underscored that their provinces boast favourable geographical locations and tremendous potential for cooperation, especially in farming and animal husbandry.

The two sides also exchanged experience in COVID-19 prevention and control. Bac Giang province was once a pandemic hotspot of Vietnam that had successfully controlled the pandemic. VNA/VNS

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s NanoDragon satellite was delivered to Japan on August 11 ahead of its planned launch into space, according to the Việt Nam National Space Centre (VNSC) under the Việt Nam Academy of Science and Technology.

The centre said the satellite would be transferred to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The NanoDragon satellite (NDG), a nano-layer CubeSat satellite which weighs 3.8kg, was developed by the VNSC. It is expected to be launched into orbit from the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture in the fiscal year 2021 (to March 2022) of Japan.

The satellite is the product of a project to design, manufacture, launch and test operation of a nano-sized microsatellite under the national space science and technology programme in the 2016-2020 period.

The process of researching, designing, integrating, and testing the satellite's functions was carried out completely in Việt Nam by VNSC researchers.

The satellite was developed with the purpose of demonstrating it could use micro-satellite beam technology to receive the Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal to track and monitor activities at sea.

The centre said after the manufacturing, integration and functional testing were conducted in Việt Nam between March 9-April 9, the satellite has passed pre-launch environmental testing at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan.

Along with the satellite development process, a ground station to operate the satellite after its launch has been installed and is ready for operation at the VNSC in the Hoà Lạc Hi-Tech Park in Hà Nội.

Previously, the VNSC also successfully developed the 1kg microsatellite PicoDragon, and the 50-kg satellite MicroDragon, which were launched into orbit in 2013 and 2019, respectively. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Exports of Vietnamese agricultural products via border gates to China are facing numerous difficulties. Ministries, localities and branches from the two countries are urged to make greater efforts in facilitating the clearance of these products, senior officials have said.

Online newspaper congthuong.vn cited Lương Trọng Quỳnh, vice chairman of the Lạng Sơn People's Committee, as saying that China examined all of Viet Nam's fruit shipments to the country. That would result in longer customs clearance time for Vietnamese fruit than those of other countries.

China had also strengthened the application of standards on origin and label quarantine while strictly controlling quality standards and food hygiene and safety for farm produce and fresh fruit and vegetables imported from Việt Nam. Meanwhile, many fruits of Việt Nam such as passion fruit, durian and custard apple were yet to be permitted for export to China, Quỳnh said.

Most businesses had failed to learn the latest information on Chinese export conditions such as those in quarantine and traceability, so they had encountered numerous difficulties in customs clearance. Therefore, localities that shared border gates with China petitioned ministries and branches to offer local businesses effective guidance in production so that their goods would meet requirements from the neighbouring country and customs clearance for these products would be faster, he said.

According to Đỗ Văn Duy, Director of Lào Cai Province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the province exported 760,000 tonnes of agricultural products via border gates to China for US$690 million over the past seven months of 2021. In which, dragon fruit saw the highest export value with $444 million, followed by mango with $120 million and watermelon with $28 million.

Despite these encouraging figures, import-export activities with China through the province’s border gates faced certain difficulties. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only Chinese drivers were allowed by the Chinese side to transport goods. That caused difficulties in trade activities via the province’s two international border gates, resulting in modest transport productivity and slow clearance of goods, Duy told a virtual conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) this week.

In order to better facilitate exports of agricultural products, the province had arranged officers responsible for issuing certificates of origin for export enterprises at the two border gates, Duy said, adding that it had also contacted the authorities of some Chinese localities to inform them about the pandemic situation in Việt Nam and disease prevention measures that Việt Nam had implemented. Meanwhile, it also suggested the Chinese localities remove difficulties for the clearance of fruit, including dragon fruit, through the Lào Cai-Hà Khẩu International Border Gate.

Duy also petitioned MARD to regularly update and notify local businesses of China's regulations on labels, traceability, planting area instructions, quarantine and testing, as well as embracing and building trademarks for Vietnamese agricultural products thus facilitating the long-term and stable exports of goods to foreign countries.

The ministry should also set up an agency that would be responsible for regulating local agricultural products, because, during the harvest season, agricultural products were transported in large amounts to border gates. If not regulated, they would suffer congestion. The establishment of the agency would help prevent agricultural products from damage or price pressure from Chinese traders, he said.

Trần Quốc Toản, Deputy Director of the Import-Export Department under Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) agreed. He urged MARD to closely monitor major growing areas and promptly coordinate with relevant agencies to regulate the volume of agricultural products transported to border gates in accordance with conditions and capacity in goods clearance of each border gate.

Also, the ministry should ask relevant agencies to guide farmers, traders and businesses on how to classify, pack and preserve farm produce appropriately to meet requests from Chinese traders, Toản said.

In his speech at the event, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phùng Đức Tiến called on closer co-ordination among relevant Chinese agencies with localities sharing border gates with China, ministries and sectors of Việt Nam in removing difficulties and facilitating the clearance of Vietnamese goods to China amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

China had issued a lot of new regulations on food safety, traceability, plant quarantine and animal quarantine. Thus, provinces that had good relations with Chinese localities should team up with the MoIT and MARD to disseminate these regulations to provinces, cities, businesses, associations, and farmers in a timely manner so that goods transported to border gates could enjoy smooth customs clearance, Tiến noted.

According to MARD, the country's export of agro-forestry-fisheries products increased by 26.7 per cent year-on-year in the seven-month period, topping $28.6 billion. During the period, China was the second-largest importer of Việt Nam's agricultural goods with a growth rate of about 36.5 per cent over the same period last year.— VNS

KABUL — The Taliban were on the brink of total victory in Afghanistan on Sunday, with their fighters ordered to wait on the outskirts of the capital and the government conceding it was preparing for a "transfer of power".

Militants surrounded Kabul following an astonishingly quick rout of government forces in recent days, with troops incapable of holding onto territory without US military support.

The fall of Kabul will see the hardline Islamic group take back power two decades after US-led forces toppled it in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

"The Islamic Emirate instructs all its forces to stand at the gates of Kabul, not to try to enter the city," a spokesman for the Taliban tweeted as residents reported insurgents on the outskirts of the city.

"Until the completion of the transition process, the responsibility for the security of Kabul is with the other side (the Afghan government)".

The United States began moving its citizens and Afghan staff to Kabul airport, with the help of thousands of troops deployed to the capital to assist with the evacuation.

The Taliban's imminent takeover triggered fear and panic in Kabul among residents fearful of the group's hardline brand of Islam.

The Afghan government signalled earlier there were negotiations underway to avoid bloodshed in Kabul, and to hand power to the Taliban.

"The Afghan people should not worry... there will be no attack on the city and there will be a peaceful transfer of power to the transitional government," Interior Minister Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal said in a recorded speech.

Afghan President left the country

President Ashraf Ghani -- who is widely expected to resign – is said to have left the country on Sunday, hours after the Taliban ordered its fighters to wait on the outskirts of the capital following an astonishing rout of government forces.

"The former Afghan president has left the nation," Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the peace process, said in a video on his Facebook page.

Earlier Ghani in a video message released to media urged what remains of his security forces to maintain law and order.

There are fears of a security vacuum in the capital as thousands of police and other armed services members have abandoned their posts, uniforms and even weapons.

"It is our responsibility and we will do it in the best possible manner," Ghani said, hours after the Taliban seized two nearby prisons and released thousands of inmates.

Suhail Shaheen, based in Qatar as part of the Taliban's negotiating team, said the group wants a swift takeover.

"In next few days, we want a peaceful transfer," he told the BBC.

Evacuations

The scale and speed of the insurgents' advance have shocked Afghans and the US-led alliance that poured billions into the country over the past two decades.

President Joe Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 1,000 US troops to help secure the emergency evacuation from Kabul of embassy employees and thousands of Afghans who worked for American forces and now fear Taliban reprisals.

That was on top of the 3,000 American soldiers deployed in recent days, and 1,000 left in-country after Biden announced in May that the final withdrawal of the US military presence in Afghanistan would be completed by September 11.

That decision has come under increased scrutiny given the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, but he insisted Saturday there was no choice.

"I was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan -- two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth," Biden said.

Ghani's government was left completely isolated on Sunday after the insurgents overran the anti-Taliban northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif and the eastern city of Jalalabad.

Like with most of the other captured cities, the seizure of power came after government forces surrendered or retreated.

Videos posted on pro-Taliban social media accounts showed the group's heavily armed fighters in cities across the country, waving white flags and greeting locals.

Most of the fighters appeared young, suggesting they were most likely infants or unborn when the Taliban was toppled from power in 2001. AFP

By Minh Hương

HÀ NỘI — Social distancing due to COVID-19 has created more local stock investors in Việt Nam, especially among internet-savvy young people.

According to data, there were 619,911 new accounts opened in the first six months of the year, an increase of 58 per cent compared to the first six months of 2020, which also registered a record number of new accounts.

As a freelance photographer, Nguyễn Quang Anh, 24, in Liễu Giai Street, Hà Nội did not have a lot of work even before the social distancing orders were put in place.

Anh said the boredom of having to stay at home because of the social distancing order and fewer working opportunities led him to invest in the stock market with some investment-friendly and user-friendly applications.

Anh told Việt Nam News: "Being hit by the fourth wave of COVID-19 and with everything digitised, it is a good time to focus on investing. It is one of the few activities we can do when we must stay at home.”

With more money, Lê Tuấn Phong, 28, in Láng Hạ Street chooses to invest in stocks and ETFs listed on the HCM City Stock Exchange (HoSE) via a prestige open fund.

Phong said a good fund would help him make bigger profits, however, he also wanted to invest by himself.

Phong told Việt Nam News: "It is not difficult to find information on social networks through financial investment groups and securities and digital currencies," adding the majority of investors were his age.

There are groups with hundreds of thousands of people, who update content and operate live streaming investment channels, sharing financial knowledge, and attracting a lot of followers.

Since last year, the number of investors on mobile apps has increased sharply. Local investment apps specializing in investments and stocks like Finhay and Infina are attractive to young investors.

Recently, Infina, announced an oversubscribed US$2 million seed round from Saison Capital, Venturra Discovery, 1982 Ventures, 500 Startups, Nextrans, and angel investors like executives at Google and Netflix.

Launched in January 2021, the app serves the investment demands of users between the ages of 25 and 40 with a minimum contribution of $25. Those investors can choose from assets including savings accounts, term deposits, fractionalized real estate and mutual funds.

At the launch of the app, the firm said only about 3.2 per cent of people in Vietnam had invested in stocks. That rate had increased thanks to a high internet penetration rate of more than 70 per cent.

Experts in the market said that the growth was largely contributed to the technology which allows investors to open an account online.

According to Dragon Capital Vietnam, a number of open-ended fund investors under the age of 35 on digital channels account for approximately 60 per cent of the total number of investors in Viet Nam.

The fund calculated that their average investment amount was surprisingly high compared to the average income in Việt Nam, at VNĐ18 million ($782) per month.

They said the trend of investing through mobile technology will play a more dominant role in the market moving forward.

As a long-standing fund management company in Việt Nam with more than $5 billion in assets under its management, Dragon Capital Vietnam sees the future for investors in technology platforms.

On July 26 it introduced the DragonX investment application to the market, which is seen as a breakthrough for investment fund management in Vietnam. Together with the launch of DragonX, the fund also adjusted the minimum investment required to only VNĐ100,000 while completely waiving the purchase fee to attract more investors.

DragonX provides users with investment knowledge in an easy to understand way through posts, daily newsletters and investment videos from the firm’s team of experts.

Trần Thanh Tân, vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dragon Capital Vietnam told local media: "I believe that a country's financial market can only develop strongly if there are a large number of local investors. DragonX is our way to bring people closer to good investment opportunities in the Vietnamese financial market.

Beware of tricks

Nguyễn Thế Truyền, director of Thiên Thanh Law Partnership, the City Bar Association, Hà Nôị said with the internet environment, people can transact easily and some of them were too eager to pour their money into apps with the dream of "becoming a billionaire".

In April more than 1,800 people in HCM City were cheated of millions of US dollars by an investment platform app called Coolcat, which announced itself as an insurance investment firm with more than five years of experience headquartered in the UK. It then vanished taking with it all of the money of the app users in the city.

Truyền said being at home for long periods of time, people often find new things to try however investment is not easy. A 'quick money' mindset could lead them to be drawn into using fraudulent apps.

In early July, the leader of the State Securities Commission of Vietnam (SSC) announced despite COVID-19's complicated development, the local indexes continued to set new records, helping the stock market enjoy the second fastest growth rate in the world. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ambassador Denny Abdi writes to Việt Nam News on the 76th anniversary of the Independence Day of Indonesia (August 17).

On August 17, 1945, Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta, the founding fathers of Indonesia, proclaimed Indonesia's independence on behalf of all Indonesian people. The determination for independence among Indonesians was a result of hundred years of colonisation.

Nonetheless, the proclamation of independence was only a start for building a nation. The struggle continues as Indonesia develops its more than 17,000 islands with diverse ethnic groups. The country has endured political turmoil and economic downturn tests and is now the third-largest democracy with prospective economic growth.

The journey is never easy, but we are thankful that Indonesia can achieve its position and prestige in the global arena today.

This year marks the 76th anniversary of hard-earned independence. The theme for the celebration is "Indonesia Tangguh, Indonesia Tumbuh" (A Resilient Indonesia; A Growing Indonesia).

Before the pandemic, August used to be all about carnival and popular games like balap karung (sack race) or makan kerupuk (eating crackers). During these festivities, people get together in a patriotic spirit and rejoice in happiness.

The celebrations now move to the digital platform through the Indonesian Digital House. Furthermore, the flag-hoisting ceremony will be conducted with limited attendance and participated by the public virtually.

As 2020 was a challenging year, the pandemic has also offered valuable lessons on the importance of global cooperation to promote health infrastructure and governance, economic resilience, multilateralism, and setting aside rivalries.

Now is the time to promote unity and cooperation. No one, no country should be left behind. Because during this global pandemic, no one is safe until everyone is safe.

That is why Indonesia is keen on conducting vaccine diplomacy. Our vaccine diplomacy is not only aimed at securing vaccine provision for domestic use but also paving the way for equal access to vaccines for all nations.

Overview of Indonesia – Việt Nam Relations

The traditional relations between Indonesia and Việt Nam were built on shared feelings and determination to fight colonisation for independence. The historic reciprocal visits of the renowned leaders, President Hồ Chí Minh and President Soekarno, in 1959 were a testament to the closeness of both countries.

Ambassador Denny Abdi meets with Minister of Industry and Trade, June 22, 2021. Courtesy Photo of the embassy

Nowadays, our friendly ties are positively manifested in the closeness of our leaders. For example, President Joko Widodo hosted Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính at the Bogor Palace in April 2021. Later, in July, President Widodo held a telephone conversation with President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc affirming both leaders' commitment to strengthen relations further.

Indonesia and Việt Nam are among the strongest and fastest-growing economies in the region. Both countries' economy represents 45 per cent of the ASEAN economy. Moreover, Indonesia and Việt Nam are home to around 60 per cent of people in ASEAN. With the increasing purchasing power in both countries, we can imagine the future of these two countries as the engine of growth of our region.

With this potential, Việt Nam and Indonesia carry a promising future for cooperation that can bring more benefit. Việt Nam is Indonesia's fourth largest economic partner in ASEAN and ranked ninth as Indonesia's biggest export destination globally.

In terms of investment, Indonesia was among the first countries to invest in Việt Nam after the Đổi Mới policy in 1986. Despite the pandemic, the total bilateral trade in 2020 was US$8.2 billion. To achieve the targeted bilateral trade of US$10 billion, we need to boost potential cooperation, such as strengthening industrialization based on research and innovation, developing our digital economy, and enhancing fisheries cooperation.

I am impressed by how Việt Nam is determined to build its automotive industry. The birth of VinFast as the first "Made in Việt Nam" car is the nation's pride. It is also important to note that the company focused on acquiring the technology from other countries and building its cars with a Vietnamese touch.

In Indonesia, the digital economy is the fastest growing industry. Google, Temasek, Bain & Company has projected the value of Indonesia's digital economy transactions to reach US$124 billion by 2025. Bukalapak, an Indonesian tech-unicorn, recently recorded the country's biggest initial public offering ever. The company helps millions of Indonesia's mom-and-pop kiosks ("warung") to get online.

I believe that collaboration in developing the digital economy ecosystem will benefit both Indonesia and Việt Nam.

Indonesia and Việt Nam also hold great potential in fisheries cooperation as both are blessed with rich marine resources. The two nations shall promote collaboration in producing key seafood products to become ASEAN contributors to the world's food supply. Moreover, stakeholders from both countries can also learn from each other to enhance their capability in developing sustainable aquaculture and seafood processing industries.

In facing the pandemic and future challenges, Indonesia and Việt Nam must continue working closely together. With deepened collaboration, I am confident that the two countries will reach their utmost potentials and become the drivers of growth in ASEAN. VNS

Trần Văn Dũng, director of Professional Affairs Department No 2, General Department of Civil Judgment Execution under the Ministry of Justice, speaks to the Voice of Vietnam (VOV) about improving efficiency of retrieving property connected to acts of corruption.

Despite a year-on-year increase in the proportion of retrieved property linked to corruption, the rate remains low. What do you think about this problem?

We have made efforts but the results are still not as expected. The proportion of asset recovery in corruption and economic cases is low compared to the total amount of appropriated or lost property.

This results from many causes, but mainly because the amount of distrained assets is much smaller than the recoverable value. For example, in the case of Huỳnh Thị Huyền Như, the amount of money to be executed was up to VNĐ15 trillion but the distrained assets (after being handled) were very modest.

Although the property has been distrained by authorities, the legality of the property is complicated, leading to delays in handling. In order to handle it, we need the involvement of many agencies and departments. The civil judgment enforcement agency alone cannot handle it.

In addition, the co-ordination between agencies in some cases is not good. For example, the transfer of judgments and documents from the proceeding agencies to the civil judgment enforcement agencies is slow in some cases.

Delays in handing over the judgments result in delays in transferring decisions and orders, leading to the delay in the execution of the judgments.

At some agencies, the Party committees and government leaders have not closely supervised the seizure of assets, leading to a delay in asset handling and reducing the process’ efficiency.

There are still some shortcomings in the laws and policies, which is a barrier for the authorities to recover the assets.

What difficulties has the Civil Judgment Execution Agency faced while retrieving property?

There are many obstacles. One of them is handling of more than 50 expired agricultural land use right certificates in Hứa Thị Phấn’s bank fraud case.

In recent months, the complicated development of COVID-19, especially in three cities - HCM City, Đà Nẵng, Hà Nội - with a large number of properties and cash that need to be recovered, had delayed many procedures.

In some economic cases with high value of recovered property, offenders have dispersed or transferred assets during investigation and prosecution. What measures must be taken to prevent this?

This is a relatively sensitive issue because it is related to the ownership of individuals and organisations which is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution and the law. It is necessary to grant more powers and uphold responsibilities of inspecting, auditing agencies so that they have power to distrain and freeze assets at the earliest stage.

If the investigative agencies have enough grounds to identify signs of violations, they should be granted the right to freeze the assets without having to wait for the prosecution decision as stipulated by the current Criminal Procedure Code.

Many think that taking actions too early would violate the property rights of the involved parties, especially when they were later found to have not committed a crime. I think when there is enough evidence, inspectors, auditors with their qualifications have enough grounds to determine the offences. They should be given the power to impose early punishments.

What will the Civil Judgment Execution Department do to improve the efficiency of corrupt property recovery?

Following the Directive of the Party Central Committee Secretariat, there will be many solutions to improve the efficiency of asset recovery in criminal cases related to corruption and economic cases.

We will review and make amendments to the laws on inspection, audit, criminal proceedings, civil judgment enforcement and related legal provisions.

Authorities at all levels must raise awareness about recovering corrupt assets and consider this an important task in the fight against corruption. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Chinese swimming coach, Huang Guohui, of the Vietnamese national swimming team died in quarantine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics.

“Coach Huang passed away on August 11. We are in isolation, so we don’t know the situation yet and we are waiting for the result of the police investigation," Trần Đức Phấn, head of the Vietnamese delegation to the Tokyo Olympics and deputy director of the Việt Nam Sport Administration, confirmed.

According to Phấn, the coach received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Huang and members of the Vietnamese delegation returned home from Japan on August 4, after completing the competition at the Tokyo Olympics. After returning to Hà Nội, the team are in isolation for 14 days at a hospital in the capital.

Phấn said the death of coach Huang is a great loss for Vietnamese swimming.

At the Tokyo Olympics 2020, the Chinese expert was the only professional coach for swimmers Nguyễn Huy Hoàng and Nguyễn Thị Ánh Viên. He rarely appeared in front of cameras, but has been with the Vietnamese swimming team for many years.

Under his guidance, Vietnamese swimmers won the 800m bronze medal and 1,500m silver medal at the Asian Games (ASIAD) 2008 alongside many gold medals at the 23rd, 26th, 29th and 30th SEA Games. At the last SEA Games in 2019 in the Philippines, Huang’s swimmers contributed a total of five gold medals.

Huang also directly trained No 1 swimmer of the country Hoàng for the past five years at the Cần Thơ National Sports Training Centre. He helped Hoàng improve and gain achievements, notably the 2018 Youth Olympic gold medal, the 2019 SEA Games gold medal and the 2018 ASIAD silver medal.

Huang brought his family to live in Việt Nam in 2015.

On his Facebook page, Hoàng posted a status with a photo of coach Huang teaching young swimmers.

"May you rest in peace. We will always be grateful and remember you forever. You will always be in my heart," said Hoàng. VNS

HÀ NỘI — The economy was basically stabilised in the first seven months of this year, with remarkable achievements recorded in many spheres, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính said on Wednesday.

Speaking at the Government's regular meeting, held via teleconference, the PM said attention has been paid to cultural and social affairs, while social security had been ensured.

“This is also the common assessment of international organisations and institutions,” he said.

Chính said the pandemic was still under control, adding that major pandemic clusters had been contained.

Some localities have effectively implemented the Government’s Resolution No. 68, providing timely support for employees and employers affected by the pandemic, he added.

He asked agencies and localities to raise public awareness and responsibility, and encouraged residents to seriously observe COVID-19 prevention and control regulations.

All-level Party Committees and the entire political system should carry forward their role to strictly implement relevant directives, the government leader said.

“Each agency, enterprise, commune and ward must be a fortress to fight the pandemic, and each citizen must be a soldier in combat,” he said.

The PM affirmed Việt Nam’s sound vaccine strategy, explaining that apart from imports, the Government and agencies WERE working hard to accelerate the transfer and research of vaccine production technology to produce vaccines domestically.

Although work is going smoothly, domestic vaccine production and recognition requires more time and must follow strict scientific and legal procedures, he said.

The PM stressed the need to avoid any disruptions in supply chains while regulations on goods circulation are strictly observed.

He said it was time to focus on combating the pandemic because a successful fight against COVID-19 would promote socio-economic development and facilitate socio-economic recovery.

However, he said, economic development should be maintained for resources to prevent and control the pandemic.

He asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote vaccine diplomacy and the Ministry of National Defence to support pandemic prevention and control.

The Ministry of Public Security was assigned to assist frontline forces and ensure security and order for people while the Ministry of Information and Communications was directed to strengthen dissemination campaigns and counter false allegations.

The PM noted that ministries, agencies, and localities must step up the fight against corruption, refrain from acts causing trouble for the people, and prepare documents for submission to the upcoming second session of the 15th National Assembly.

Vaccination will be sped up once more vaccines available

The Ministry of Health will cooperate with the Ministry of National Defence and the Ministry of Public Security to speed up the inoculation with up to 2 million shots of vaccines a day, said Deputy Minister of Health Trần Văn Thuấn.

Speaking at a monthly government press conference on Wednesday, he said the MoH would accelerate the vaccination when more vaccines arrive in the country.

As many as 11 million out of 18 million allocated doses of vaccines have been administered to people, accounting for 65 per cent, Thuấn said.

Hồ Chí Minh City, the country's current largest pandemic hotspot, is leading the inoculation campaign with over 3.5 million doses administered out of more than 4 million doses received. The capital of Hà Nội has injected about 1.5 million out of 3 million doses the city has been allocated.

Thuấn said the vaccination rate will be accelerated in HCM City and other provinces in the coming days.

The deputy minister said the viewpoint of the MoH was to inject the vaccines quickly but safely. Emergency resuscitation is helpful for the vaccination when needed.

The MoH has also transferred 10,000 doses of imported drugs from India to provide for the treatment of patients in southern provinces, he said.

More than 11,000 medical workers and students have been mobilised to support HCM City and southern provinces.

Thuấn said he hoped that with the drastic participation of the entire political system, the MoH and the Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, the situation would soon be stabilised and the pandemic would be put under control in the next month. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The stormy season is starting in Hà Nội and residents are increasingly concerned about flooding during heavy rain.

In the last few decades, floods have become more frequent in the capital city.

Climate change is said to be one of the causes of heavy rain and flooding, however, many experts believe natural factors are only part of the issue, with poor urban planning, construction and management also to blame, according to Kinh tế & Đô thị (Economic & Urban Affairs) newspaper.

Dr. Vũ Hoài Đức, architect and lecturer of Vietnam National University, Hà Nội, said that many urban projects in Hà Nội have taken into account natural disasters and climate change.

However, there was a lack of participation from experts in irrigation science and environmental resources in the planning process, Đức told the newspaper.

Therefore, responding to extreme weather such as heavy rain and floods is a problem for Hà Nội, especially in the western region where there are many rural areas located by rivers' banks.

For example, floods in 2017 and 2018 broke dykes along the Tích and Bùi rivers in Chương Mỹ District, submerging thousands of houses.

In the past, Hà Nội saw flooding in the inner city because this area has poor drainage infrastructure and is densely populated. But now, flooding has spread to the suburbs and newly-built urban areas.

The master plan for Hà Nội’s development to 2030 approved by the then Prime Minister in 2011 raised two important issues of urban economic development and environmental protection.

These issues have been realised in zoning plans and projects on technical infrastructure including drainage, green areas, parks and lakes.

However, after implementation, many targets set out in these plans and projects were not met.

This is because the urbanisation rate is still low while population growth exceeds the overall planning target, leading to overloaded infrastructure. The slow construction of satellite towns and eco-towns results in a lack of green space for the city.

In the inner city area, the relocation of the headquarters of ministries, branches, higher education institutions and industrial production facilities to save land for public spaces has not been carried out effectively. Due to shortcomings in the implementation of the master plan, the city is facing environmental problems such as air pollution, garbage, wastewater, and flooding.

Việt Nam is one of the countries heavily affected by climate change, and the impacts of climate change are presenting themselves even faster than expected.

Hà Nội is also suffering due to shortcomings in urban planning.

Although the master plan took into account drainage issues including surface water, wastewater and rain water, the rapid population growth has led to an increase in domestic wastewater.

Moreover, in recent years, there are incidences of heavy rainfall of up to 300-400mm, which has surpassed the calculated threshold of the drainage that is for 200-250mm.

The drainage system now is overloaded, causing heavy flooding, even in areas that have never been flooded before such as around Hoàn Kiếm Lake and the Old Quarter.

Many urban planning experts believe that, along with the overall adjustment of the Hà Nội Development Master Plan towards environmental protection, plans on technical infrastructure need further research in order to overcome the shortcomings and build urban areas that adapt to climate change.

Architect Đào Ngọc Nghiêm, former director of the Hà Nội Planning and Architecture Department, said: “In order to prepare for climate change, Hà Nội has not only to deal with local flooded spots but also evaluate the whole city's drainage system so as to combine drainage requirements with urban development demands as well as combine drainage treatment with building of green spaces.”

“With the rapid urbanisation rate, the city needs to approve the adjustment of the infrastructure plan to improve drainage capacity for both the inner city and the suburbs," Nghiêm said.

Meanwhile, Đức said that Hà Nội could learn from developed countries to have technical solutions to cope with extreme weather phenomena causing flooding in urban areas.

For areas along Hồng (Red) and Đuống rivers, planning projects should involve experts in environmental resources, hydrometeorology and irrigation.

“With the advancement of science and technology, there is nothing that cannot be solved. The problem is how to find a solution to work together among related sectors,” said Đức. VNS

Nguyễn Hoàng Bảo Đại, 27, is the third Vietnamese to be honoured as a Google Developer Expert in the field of Machine Learning. He is also the initiator of an AI model that can generate ten melodies in one second. Đại talks with Lương Hương about the project.

Inner Sanctum: Please introduce yourself?

My name is Nguyễn Hoàng Bảo Đại. I’m working as a natural language processing research scientist and attending a graduate programme at the National University of Singapore.

I was introduced to music at a very young age but only took it seriously at the age of 12 when I started taking piano lessons. At first, I didn’t want to take up music because I always thought that it was not a subject for boys but I kept learning the piano to satisfy my father’s wishes. However, after a long time being exposed to music and experiencing many things, I started to unconsciously fall for it. Music has now become an integral part of my life, making me happy and inspiring me to do anything.

After finishing high school, I wanted to apply for the composition department of HCM City Conservatory of Music but my family did not encourage me to follow this path. My teachers also advised me to pursue maths or any other natural science subjects, of which I was pretty good at school.

In the end, I decided to apply for Information Technology like my best friend. I was really disoriented at that time and just wanted to go to university to have a friend whom I could talk to and sing to. Unfortunately, we couldn’t make it because I passed the entrance exam but my friend didn’t so I had to study by myself, however, it was also the beginning of my career with Information Technology as well as in Artificial Intelligence.

Inner Sanctum: How did the idea of music-writing AI, still a new concept in Việt Nam, come to you?

The idea originated from my habit of writing music. I have always spent a lot of time writing melodies because I think that only good melodies make beautiful songs. Sometimes, I finish writing a melody but then leave it because I’m not totally satisfied. I thought that if I could shorten the time for writing melodies, the whole process would become faster and the songwriters could release their works sooner.

On the other hand, AI has also been applied in various fields so I started thinking about applying AI in the fields of artistic creation, and assisting Vietnamese songwriters specifically.

After two years, my current AI model can write a piece of music that lasts for 10 seconds, 5 minutes, or even longer. It will take in a prime melody, which is a short piece of music as input to capture the stylistic intent, then create the melodies exactly as I want.

For example, if I provide it with a gentle, mellow melody, I will have 10 soft, mellow songs with lyrical ballads. If I provide a piece of music that has a slightly faster tempo, I will get 10 songs with a dynamic vibe. Moreover, when I lack ideas, I can ask the AI model to generate songs on its own without any prime melody.

Inner Sanctum: What were your difficulties as a pioneer in the field in Việt Nam and how have you overcome them?

The first difficulty in building this AI model was a shortage of data, which I believe that all other AI engineers will face. As I want to build a model that can generate music in the Vietnamese pop ballad style, I chose a training method based on supervised learning that requires a lot of data. However, I cannot use the available music of Vietnamese artists because it is not my desired input. I can find and collect the proper data online but it is insufficient and difficult to standardise as I wish as each source has its own format.

The second difficulty I encountered was the problem of human resources. The whole project has been implemented by myself as I consider it as a personal project and have managed it with my own limited budget. I often hesitate to invite others to help on complicated issues as we have no guarantee of results or finance to support.

Therefore, I decided to solve the problems myself. To get the file in the desired format, I have to sit on a midi keyboard every day and save each one. Many a little makes a mickle, and over a year I think I have accumulated enough data to train the AI model.

Inner Sanctum: Are you now satisfied with the melodies generated by your AI model?

It has achieved about 80 per cent of my expectation. The composing speed is also impressive as it only needs one second to generate 10 different melodies. Such capacity has saved me much time in composing and finalising the music.

I have written a lot of songs with the help of AI, but it takes many stages thereafter to introduce one to the market, such as writing the lyrics, writing the mix, finding the singer, doing the mixing, mastering and even PR/marketing, so they are mainly serving my personal demands.

Inner Sanctum: What do you think of the possibility that music-writing AI will become increasingly popular and replace songwriters in the future?

I highly appreciate the potential application of AI in the music industry. Music marketing is currently a hot field. All brands want to have catchy music for their promotions and advertisements.

The production of promotional music includes a time-consuming phase, similarly to my composing stage: the client listens to the demo and chooses the best version. I believe this process is time-consuming for the composer because they have to create music to meet the customer's request. I think that using AI to write music and make proposals is the fastest and most effective approach because it will save labour and time for both sides.

In addition, music writing AI will also be applied to shorten the production time of a music project. Currently, my AI model supports the process of composing pop tunes so that the producers can spend more time on the rest of the project and create better final products.

However, I don't think it's possible for AI to replace musicians, or it will take a long time to happen. Each songwriter has his/her own musical style. As long as the audience still has the demand for that style, AI will not yet replace their roles. Moreover, the training data is still human-generated so it still needs to depend on people. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Shares extended last week's gains, propped up by strong money flows in banks and securities companies, but foreign traders continued to sell, posing risks to the market in the short term.

On the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange, the VN-Index closed Monday up 1.03 per cent at 1,370.96 points. The southern market's index increased 1.2 per cent last week.

Liquidity continued to improve with nearly 828 million shares worth VNĐ27.5 trillion (US$1.2 billion) traded, up 12 per cent in volume and 15 per cent in value compared to last week's figures.

In the afternoon trade, money was poured into banking and securities stocks, supporting the market's rally. These two sectors gained an average of 2.1 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively, according to data on vietstock.vn.

Six of the top 10 biggest contributors to the VN-Index on Monday were banks. They are Techcombank (TCB), Military Bank (MBB), VPBank (VPB), Vietcombank (VCB), Vietinbank (CTG) and BIDV (BID) with growth of between 1 per cent and 4.7 per cent each.

Securities firms also climbed strongly. The biggest listed brokerage house Saigon Securities Inc (SSI) soared 5.3 per cent; Hồ Chí Minh Securities Corp (HCM) also grew 5.3 per cent, and VNDirect Securities (VND) increased 3.3 per cent.

However, slumps of Vinhomes (VHM) and Vingroup (VIC) were the main drag, restraining the market growth.

Vingroup has registered to sell nearly 100.5 million shares of Vinhomes, equivalent to 3 per cent of Vinhomes' charter capital, after VHM hit a record high of VNĐ120,000 ($5.22) a share on Friday, becoming Việt Nam's biggest listed company with a market capitalisation of VNĐ402 trillion ($17.5 billion).

VHM slipped 3.3 per cent and VIC decreased 0.3 per cent on Monday.

The transaction will be carried out between August 19 and September 17 through order matching or put-through transactions. According to Vingroup's statement, the sale is aimed at increasing working capital and investment in subsidiaries.

On the Hà Nội Stock Exchange, the HNX-Index increased 1.95 per cent to close the day at 343.53 points with nearly 194 million shares worth VNĐ4.9 trillion traded.

However, contrasting to domestic traders, foreign investors continued to offload Vietnamese shares. They were responsible for net sell value of VNĐ956 billion on the HCM City's bourse, the highest value in the last five sessions. They offloaded shares worth VNĐ40 billion in Hà Nội's market.

Many securities companies are still issuing buy-in recommendations on the prediction the market would continue its rally, but analysts on cafef.vn have warned investors that the stock market has experienced a fairly long bull cycle and they should be wary of the chasing-price strategy. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The electronics industry is forecast to have a robust year, driven by the increase in demand for communication's products due to demand caused by social distancing measures implemented to tackled rising cases of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade said that as the COVID-19 pandemic has developed exports of many products saw significant drops although some key industrial products saw considerable increases in the first seven months of this year.

Statistics showed that the export of phones and components brought in $29.35 billion from January – July, up 11.9 per cent against the same period last year. More than 128 mobile phones were produced in the period, up by 14.1 per cent.

That Việt Nam’s phones and components exports kept growing was a good sign, signalling a year of strong growth for the electronics industry, which would contribute significantly to the country’s economic recovery and to achieving growth targets, the ministry said.

Phones and components were the top export products of Việt Nam, which account for 15.8 per cent of the country’s total export revenue in the first seven months of this year, followed by electronic products, computers, and components with an export value of $27.4 billion.

The ministry said that the electronics industry would continue to grow in the remaining months of this year, driven by the increase in demand for communication products. A number of companies that produce computer and electronics products in other countries had been forced to close down due to the impacts of the virus.

The ministry predicted that the export value of computers, electronic components and other products of Việt Nam would hit US$50 billion this year, representing a rise of 13.5 per cent against 2020.

Nguyễn Thị Thu Thủy, Deputy Director of the Trade Promotion Agency’s Export Promotion Centre, said that the Vietnamese economy continued to see significant changes in the structure of export products. From a country with agricultural products and labour-intensive products being the main exports, Việt Nam was gradually transitioning to producing more high-tech export products with higher added value such as electronics and electronic components.

The ministry said that Việt Nam's electronics products were exported to more than 100 countries including China, ASEAN, Japan and the Republic of Korea and were expanding their presence in EU markets.

In the first quarter of this year, Việt Nam granted licences for capital increases for a number of electronic products, including Korea's LG Display Hải Phòng and Singapore's Fukang Technology. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of Việt Nam wrapped up on Monday morning after eight working days, with its resolution adopted at the closing session.

On behalf of the congress’ presidium, Võ Văn Thưởng reported on the results of the election of the Political Bureau, the Party General Secretary, the Secretariat, the Inspection Commission, and the Chairperson of the Inspection Commission in the 13th tenure.

After that, the 13th Party Central Committee made its debut.

The congress warmly congratulated Nguyễn Phú Trọng on his re-election as General Secretary of the 13th-tenure Party Central Committee, and those who were elected to the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, the Secretariat, and the Inspection Commission for the 13th tenure.

On behalf of the 13th Party Central Committee, General Secretary and State President Nguyễn Phú Trọng emphasised that the 13th-tenure Party Central Committee pledges to exert utmost efforts to surmount every difficulty to fulfil duties and be determined to successfully implement the 13th National Party Congress’ resolution.

At the closing session, Lê Minh Hưng, Secretary of the 13th Party Central Committee, Chief of the Party Central Committee’s Office, and head of the note-takers’ board, read the congress’ draft resolution.

The congress then adopted the resolution.

The resolution stated that the congress agreed on the basic assessments of the implementation outcomes of the 12th National Party Congress’ resolution; the 1991 Platform on National Construction during the Transitional Period towards Socialism that was supplemented and developed in 2011; the 2011-2020 socio-economic development strategy; the 1991 Platform; the 35 years of “Đổi mới” (Renewal) policy; along with national development orientations and tasks for the future as noted in the documents submitted by the 12th-tenure Party Central Committee to the 13th congress.

The resolution said the achievements during the 35 years of “Đổi mới” and 30 years of implementing the 1991 Platform, especially the 10 years of the Platform supplemented and developed in 2011, have continued to affirm that the path to socialism in Việt Nam matches the reality in the country and the development trend of the era, and that the Party’s clear-sighted leadership is the leading factor determining the success of Việt Nam’s revolution.

Amid fast and complicated developments in the global situation, the Party’s Platform remains “the flag of ideology, the flag of combat, the flag gathering the great national solidarity” for the goal of a rich people, strong nation and an equitable, democratic, and civilised nation.

The resolution underlined the overall goals and concrete targets for 2025, 2030, and 2045; and identified major socio-economic development targets for 2021- 2025; orientations for national development for 2021-2030; and the six key tasks for the 13th tenure. It also highlighted three strategic breakthroughs.

Party General Secretary Trọng delivered the closing speech that reviewed the outstanding results and successes of the 13th National Party Congress.

In particular, the congress asserted that the Party will stay persistent in Marxism - Leninism and Hồ Chí Minh’s ideology, continually apply and develop them in a creative manner that matches the reality in Việt Nam in each period. It will also keep steadfast to the goal of national independence and socialism, and the “Đổi mới” policy for the goal of a rich people, strong nation and an equitable, democratic, and civilised nation.

The congress also stressed that the Party must enhance Party building and rectification work to a strong and clean Party and political system, push ahead with improving its mettle and leadership and ruling capacity in making and carrying out guidelines and policies in a way that matches the reality in Việt Nam and the development trend of the era.

The congress also pointed to the need to take timely action to institutionalise, concretise, and effectively implement the Party’s guidelines and the State’s policies and laws, while addressing shortcomings in the leadership, direction, and organisation of implementation.

The Party and State leader appealed to the entire Party, people, and army, along with compatriots both at home and abroad to make all-out efforts to successfully carry out the 13th Congress’ resolution. — VNS

HÀ NỘI – Việt Nam has been and will continue to be an active member of the international community and the United Nations (UN), affirmed President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc while hosting outgoing UN Resident Coordinator in Việt Nam Kamal Malhotra in Hà Nội on Wednesday.

The President stated Việt Nam will continue to make proactive and responsible contribution to the UN Security Council, join UN peacekeeping activities, and step up the implementation of UN sustainable development goals and climate-change commitments under the Paris Agreement.

He added the country will run for a seat in the UN Human Rights Council for the 2023 – 2025 tenure.

Phúc stated Việt Nam treasures UN organisations’ valuable support and cooperation over the past more than four decades, and appreciates their active role in helping the nation respond to COVID-19. He asked the UN to continue giving Việt Nam timely policy advice as well as technical and financial support.

The State leader reiterated that Việt Nam attaches importance to multilateralism and international law and backs the UN in promoting its central role in boosting solidarity and collaboration among nations to tackle global challenges, sustain international peace and security, and foster prosperity.

For his part, Malhotra thanked Vietnamese public agencies and sectors for their assistance for UN organisations and himself. He affirmed UN organisations in Việt Nam want to help the nation carry out its domestic development priorities and promote its role and position in the global stage.

He said that the highest priority of UN organisations now is to support Việt Nam’s COVID-19 response, especially in accessing vaccine through the COVAX Facility and in the transfer of vaccine production technologies so that Việt Nam can be self-sufficient in this regard.

Việt Nam has an increasingly important role and voice in the UN thanks to its active and responsible participation in and contribution to common affairs of the international community and the UN, Malhotra stated, adding that UN organisations will continue to support and accompany the country in its national development cause.

Top legislator's reception

National Assembly Chairman Vương Đình Huệ has expressed his hope that the United Nations (UN) will further support Việt Nam in COVID-19 combat and post-pandemic socio-economic recovery at a reception for Malhotra in Hà Nội the same day.

Huệ thanked Malhotra for his contributions and support to Viêkt Nam over the past 32 years.

For his part, Malhotra affirmed that the UN always stands side by side with Việt Nam in many major activities, as well as regional and international events.

The UN has helped the Southeast Asian nation not only in development but also in enhancing its position in the international arena, and closely coordinated with its legislative body.

Most recently, the UN has also assisted Việt Nam in COVID-19 prevention and control, notably in vaccine access, he said, stressing that such cooperation will certainly be further promoted in the time ahead. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Registration fees for new electric cars are to be cut by half compared to those with internal combustion engines, following recommendations by the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

It is hoped the reduced fee will encourage more consumers to go electric, a growing trend around the world, as part of the country's effort to combat pollution and be more environmentally friendly.

The registration reductions mean that owners of, for example, VinFast's new model VF e34 with a retail price tag of VNĐ690 million (US$30,000) will pay VNĐ35-40 million (depending on where they register the vehicle) instead of VNĐ70-80 million.

The fee reduction will be in effect for five years.

The drop in fees will see a reduction in government coffers of around VNĐ5 trillion as car registration fees make up a significant portion of income for provinces and cities. Registration fees for cars accounted for 69 per cent of the total registration fee for all vehicles in 2017, 70 per cent in 2018, 74.6 per cent in 2019 and 79 per cent in 2020.

The fee reduction will not apply to owners of used electric cars, who will have to pay around 2 per cent of the vehicle's price tag, minus depreciation.

The country's largest conglomerate and sole electric vehicle maker VinGroup has asked the Government to grant special consumption tax cuts and registration fee reductions for electric cars. The group also produces cars with internal combustion engines and electric bikes.

Multiple ministries have voiced support for the proposal.

Deputy minister of transport Lê Đình Thọ said the switch to electric vehicles would help reduce the country's carbon emissions in line with international environment and climate change agreements.

Regarding the cuts in special consumption tax, also for a period of five years, the Ministry of Finance said this matter must be decided by the National Assembly. For the cuts to be even considered, the National Assembly must be willing to make modifications to the country's Laws on Special Consumption Tax, which unlike registration fees do not fall under the Government's discretion.

Right now, the special consumption tax for electric cars is at 15 per cent for vehicles with nine seats or fewer, 10 per cent for 10-16 seaters and 5 per cent for 16-25 seaters.

During the first seven months of 2021, more than 185,000 cars were produced or assembled in Việt Nam, a 40 per cent increase from the same period last year. On average, 838 new cars are sold every day nationwide. — VNS

BÌNH THUẬN — About 650 fishing ships have resumed operations at La Gi Fishing Port in Bình Thuận Province after being suspended for nearly three weeks due to the latest COVID-19 outbreak.

The port in the south-central province’s La Gi Town suspended operation from July 24 under the Prime Minister's Directive No.16 on COVID-19 prevention and control measures.

The town’s People’s Committee on August 12 issued a document to better manage fishing activities under social distancing. The fishing ships will be licensed to operate if crew members have negative COVID-19 test results within 72 hours prior to departure, and the ships install monitoring devices on board.

All ship owners and crew must fully comply with regulations and guidance on pandemic prevention and control measures of the government, local pandemic checkpoint and border guard stations, and inter-sectoral COVID-19 prevention and control stations.

Before leaving the port, the ship captain must have a departure card issued by the local pandemic checkpoint and border guard station.

The ship owner can ask the port management board to prepare food, fuel and other necessities for offshore fishing trips.

After boarding the ship, the crew must stay on board until the ship leaves the port to minimise the risk of infections.

The ship captain must inform the port’s management board about the ship’s registration number and the amount of caught seafood at least three hours in advance before entering the port.

The caught seafood must be unloaded and transported out of the port under the guidance of the port management board.

La Gi Town is one of several COVID-19 hotspots in the province with more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases recorded.

La Gi Fishing Port has the highest density of ships entering and leaving the province and a large-scale anchorage for more than 2,000 ships to avoid storms.

Bình Thuận is one of the four largest fishing grounds in Việt Nam. The province’s fishing industry has gained positive achievements due to COVID-19 prevention and control measures, favourable weather, and cooperation among business firms. — VNS

CENTRAL REGION — Doctors from Đà Nẵng’s Centre for Disease Control (CDC) have warned of an increase in COVID-19 infections in lockdown zones as the daily average has remained around 63 cases since lockdown began on August 3.

The CDC said 19 out of 56 people – 34 per cent – at five locked-down wards in the district tested positive for SARS-COV-2 on Wednesday.

Testing has been sped up, while everyone is required to stay at home.

Travel among residents would spark increasing numbers of coronavirus infections in Sơn Trà District, and a travel ban must be strictly controlled by local authorities.

The district has allocated mobile food vans to locked-down areas, while home delivery services by community volunteers has been in place since August 5.

Up to 30 tonnes of vegetables have been taken to locked down residential areas on Tuesday, while the district received a donation of 15 tonnes of farm produce from Quảng Nam Province.

The CDC also said the city is treating 43 severe cases of COVID-19 out of 1,067 patients at hospitals since July 10.

The city’s People’s Committee has been discussing banning all travel throughout the city for a week.

Meanwhile, coronavirus infections have been controlled in Quảng Nam Province, as shopping, outdoor sporting activities and take-away food courts were resumed in Tam Kỳ city from Tuesday.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nguyễn Quốc Hùng, general secretary of the Việt Nam Banking Association

Outbreaks of COVID-19, especially in the first half of 2021, are negatively affecting the repayment of debt. This increases the pressure of bad debt on the banking system.

Nguyễn Quốc Hùng, general secretary of the Việt Nam Banking Association, spoke to Vietnam News Agency about this issue.

What do you think about the banks' process of restructuring bad debt?

The implementation of Resolution No. 42/2017/QH14 on the settlement of bad debts of credit institutions has recorded many positive results. Specifically, the resolution has created a legal corridor for credit institutions to recover debts.

Agencies have also actively supported banks in debt recovery and handling of collateral. Moreover, customers' awareness of debt repayment is much higher than before.

The credit institutions have been restructuring bad debts to reduce the bad debt ratio to a safe level.

At the same time, the professional level in analysis, appraisal and evaluation of new loans of bank employees has also been improved, thus restricting bad debts.

However, the development of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting production and business activities and the whole economy.

The State Bank of Việt Nam has issued Circular 03/2021/TT-NHNN on amending and supplementing a number of articles of Circular No. 01/2020/TT-NHNN on credit institutions and foreign bank branches carrying out debt rescheduling and giving exemption from or reduction of loan interest and charges to help their clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Debt recovery at present is very difficult for credit institutions due to regulations on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it relies mainly on the customer's sense of debt repayment.

An important job for the banks is to urge their customers to concentrate on the payment of old debts. Then, they propose plans on paying new debts to stabilise business in the post-pandemic period.

At this moment, I think that banks have built their own scenarios. Besides reducing interest rates to support people, the banks have also actively improved their financial capacity to ensure good operations in the future.

Many banks have gained large profits in the context of businesses and the economy facing difficulties. What do you think about this?

Bank profits need to be viewed comprehensively and objectively. This profit is the result of a long restructuring process in the past five years. The banks have spent all resources to raise their charter capital and capital adequacy ratio (CAR). There are banks that have not paid dividends for many years to reserve capital for risk.

On the other hand, the banks are implementing debt restructuring according to the State Bank's regulations, so they do not have to make provision for risks. Therefore, profits tend to increase.

Another factor is that the application of digital banking has created favourable conditions for customers and also brought benefits to the banks. Because when the customers do not use cash, the amount of money in their accounts will increase. This is the demand deposit with a very low-interest rate so there is a big gap between the interest of the demand deposit and lending interest rates.

What is the credit growth outlook in the last six months of the banking system? What solution is there to achieve the growth target but still ensure credit quality?

The State Bank has recently adjusted credit targets. This is a very appropriate step at present. The pandemic is very complicated, but I hope that with strong solutions from the Government, it will soon be controlled.

Then business will return to stability and continue production. The businesses whose production was interrupted due to the pandemic will resume operation with higher working intensity and greater capital needs. Therefore, the banks also need to create favourable conditions to give financial supports to those businesses.

In addition, enterprises producing essential goods for domestic use and export also need capital. The banks need to evaluate the efficiency of the enterprises' business plans to provide capital in a timely manner. This is an opportunity for production recovery.

Meanwhile, the State Bank of Việt Nam recently approved credit room extensions for several banks, signalling that priority would be given to credit institutions that reduced lending rates to support businesses and people to overcome the impact of the pandemic by year-end. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Health has allowed HCM City to use one million doses of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine Vero Cell.

The shipment of the vaccine, imported by the State-owned Saigon Pharmaceutical Group (Sapharco) in HCM City, arrived at the city’s Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport on July 31.

Early in July, the health ministry gave permission for Sapharco to import Vero Cell with the sponsorship of Vạn Thịnh Phát Holdings Group, a private conglomerate founded by a Vietnamese national of Chinese origin in HCM City.

The vaccines are being preserved at the company’s cold storage and have not yet used pending quality controls.

The Ministry of Health said the vaccines meet requirements for administration after being examined by the National Institute for Control of Vaccine and Biologicals.

Vero Cell was approved for emergency use by the WHO in May, and given conditional approval for use in Việt Nam on June 4. The first 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government to Việt Nam have been used for Chinese nationals living and working in the country, Vietnamese residents in border areas with China and people who engage in trade and service exchanges with Việt Nam's northern neighbour. — VNS

QUẢNG NGÃI — A pregnant woman who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 successfully gave birth to a boy at the Quảng Ngãi Provincial Obstetrics and Pediatrics hospital on Thursday.

The baby, weighing 2.8kg, is being looked after at the hospital, while the mother has been sent to quarantine at the lung hospital for COVID-19 patients.

She was rescued by local traffic police when her family was driving a motorbike back to their hometown in Nghệ An Province from southern Bình Dương Province on Thursday.

The 26-year-old woman needed help when the family, including a two-year old boy, took a break at Phổ Cường Commune of the province. The traffic police then took her to the hospital just hours before she gave birth.

Two traffic police officers who escorted the pregnant woman to the hospital were quarantined as soon as the woman, her husband and two-year-old son tested positive for coronavirus at the hospital.

This is the second time a woman with COVID-19 has given birth successfully in the province after a similar case on June 30.

Doctors said the baby boy has been receiving special care at the hospital, and tests for COVID-19 will be given later. VNS

QUẢNG TRỊ ­— A man in the central province of Quảng Trị has successfully developed an organic farming model in combination with online trading of safe food.

Nguyễn Đăng Vương, a 37-year-old farmer in Vĩnh Chấp Commune of Vĩnh Linh District, has contributed to protecting consumer health and increased his income.

Vương had long-held the desire to build his own brand of safe organic food to the market.

So in 2015, when he had the opportunity to visit Japan, he went to study organic fertiliser production, microbial feed and organic farming.

By visiting and studying domestic and foreign organic models for a long time, he was able to build his own business.

In 2019, Vương decided to use his modest savings to set up a farm on his family’s 4 hectares of agricultural land.

By early last year, he had invested more than VNĐ1 billion (US$43,600) in setting up nine separate and closed breeding areas.

His farm is currently raising more than 3,000 chickens, 1,000 ducks and more than 30 pigs, including domestic pigs and wild boar hybrids.

He faced many difficulties and failures, which initially discouraged him.

“The first days were the most difficult time. After many times of failing to incubate probiotics for animal feed, I wanted to give up,” said Vương. “But I thought ‘no pain, no gain’ and I was determined to keep going. If one batch was spoiled, I made another one. After many failures, I finally found the right formula and ratio.”

His animals were fed organic foods made by himself as he absolutely refused to use weight gaining substances and antibiotics.

A highlight of Vương’s organic farming model is the use of spoiled and leftover fruit and vegetables from markets, households, schools and restaurants to process animal feed.

He collects the fruit and vegetables, then purees and brews them using micro-fermentation with garlic yeast and other substances.

To increase protein for animal feed, he raises black fly larvae and uses by-products such as fish heads, intestines, beer and bean residue.

The animal feed is only fed to livestock and poultry after being processed in accordance with the accurate procedures.

He takes a month longer than conventional breeding farms to sell his animals because they do not use stimulants and weight gaining substances.

However, he says that his animals are less susceptible to diseases, and as the meat and eggs have no antibiotics or chemical residues they are more delicious.

Vương’s meat and eggs are favoured by the market and sold at 30-35 per cent higher than other produce.

Online trading

To find stable buyers for his products, Vương uses social networks and apps such as Facebook, YouTube and Zalo for marketing and sales.

Through these channels, he has uploaded hundreds of videos sharing his experience organically raising chickens, pigs and ducks as well as promoting his produce to consumers.

He has made video clips about the process of producing animal feed, raising animals, butchering, meat processing and product packaging.

Gradually, his produce has gained a foothold in the market.

To meet the needs of consumers, besides wholesale, he also directly delivers goods to households.

Every year, Vương makes VNĐ180-200 million (US$4,200-4,500) in profit.

Vương’s farm has also created regular jobs for five local labourers with an average monthly income of VNĐ5-6 million per person.

From the initial success, Vương is investing in building a brand of Vĩnh Chấp Organic Chicken and establishing Vương Tây Sơn Clean Agriculture Cooperative with the aim of helping other farmers in his hometown.

Lê Đức Quang Huy, chairman of Farmers' Association of Vĩnh Chấp Commune said: “Vương’s model of organic farming and clean food production is a new and successful direction in the locality. The model has not only brought high economic values to his family but also created jobs for local labourers in the commune.”

In the near future, the association plans to expand Vương’s model in the commune and establish an organic livestock cooperative in order to develop agricultural production. – VNS

HÀ NỘI — Hà Nội plans to test a total of 1.3 million people for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between August 9 and 17.

This is believed to be the largest sample collection ever in the city.

High-risk groups would be prioritised for testing.

The first priority is the red group. The group includes people who live in wards and communes at very high risk of infection and people who have to travel and meet people for work.

The second priority is the orange group. The group includes people working in factories, enterprises, production facilities, traditional markets, supermarkets, hospitals and medical centres and people in risk areas according to regulations of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control.

The last priority is the green group. The group consists of people who live in “green zones”, which means pandemic-free areas in the city, who do not have to travel or come into contact with other people.

The testing drive is part of the local health sector’s efforts to detect cases, curb the outbreak and separate COVID-19 patients from the community in order to gradually control the pandemic as per the direction of the Government and the city’s Party Committee.

The funding for the tests will be drawn from the city's budget; sources of aid; support from domestic and foreign organisations and individuals and other lawful sources.

The city’s Party Committee ordered relevant agencies to urgently improve testing capacity to reach over 200,000 samples per day and return the test results as soon as possible.

The committee also tasked agencies to mobilise medical forces of the police, army and private sector to participate in taking samples, ensuring speed, accuracy, efficiency and safety.

To reach the target, chairman of the People’s Committee Chu Ngọc Anh assigned responsibility to the Health Department in testing while the city’s Centre for Disease Control was told to conduct epidemiological investigations as well as identify risk areas and the number of samples needed to be tested.

The city’s districts and towns were asked to co-ordinate in making lists, taking samples, mobilising local forces to ensure a smooth collection of samples and avoid cross infection during the collection of samples, he said. — VNS

It is 4am. Millions of people are sleeping in HCM City.

But on one side of the city, coaches and athletes of HCM City's Sport Training Centre are perspiring from hard work, with their T-shirts covered in dust. They are busy with activities such as preparing vegetables and fruit to support people in need in quarantine.

HCM City has been a national hotspot of the coronavirus for weeks. Currently thousands of positive cases are announced every day, and the city has been under lockdown since July 9.

"Dozens of tonnes of vegetables are coming here from cities and provinces. They are a gift of sponsors to us during these difficult days," said Đoàn Công Tuấn, coach for the tug of war. He is certainly in a war at the moment.

"We are here to help receive the food, divide them into portions and deliver to privileged and poor people. We have to work early in the morning to bring these fresh and green gifts to them in time," he said.

After receiving 18 tonnes of vegetables from Đà Lạt, they continue packing more than 30 tonnes of squash, marrow and peanuts, which travelled through the night to the city.

After the vegetable deliveries, they all move to the Minh Đức Secondary School in District 1 to clean the campus, which is a quarantine area for F0 patients.

"Sometime we are really exhausted but encourage each other to try harder for the day that our city clears of COVID-19. That dream helps us to continue with his meaningful work," Tuấn said.

A little way from Tuấn's place, his athlete Trần Gia Luật also has no time to rest. He is busy all the time, receiving and guiding people in District 7's Tân Quy and Tân Thuận Đông communes who are coming to have tests.

While many people help by staying and training at home under the social distancing rule, Luật converts his unexpected rest into volunteering

The three-time national champion is also student of the Phạm Ngọc Thạch University of Medicine. Following a call of the university's directorate, Luật registered to join the city campaign to resist the deadly disease outbreak.

Together with classmates, he takes part in importing data and taking samples for testing.

He also helps people to check their temperatures, declare their health status online and reminds them to follow the healthcare regulations.

"It is hot today and will heavily rain tomorrow but it cannot stop us from working. We have to use all of our ability to complete work here on time. People in other quarantine areas are waiting for us," said Luật.

"It is really meaningful work. I am happy contributing my energy to the campaign when the country needs me. We are working with a joyful mind and positive spirit. Sometimes, we are nervous when waiting for results, and then it is great to know they are okay. They are like our family members and we all yell 'negativeee!' and laugh out loud."

Support whatever and whenever

It is 11.30am. Under the strong heat of the sun, taekwondo martial artist Châu Tuyết Vân keeps working hard as a medical assistant.

In the outbreak period, all sport activities have been paused. Vân, apart from training herself, has taken part in a programme that provides taekwondo training and English courses. In her rest time, she takes off her uniform to join the COVID fight.

In Gò Vấp District, Vân puts on a protective gown, face mask and shield, gloves, shoes and head covers. She helps answer people's inquiry and instructs them in steps to be tested. She supports medical people to check temperatures, take samples, and clean the area when needed.

After Gò Vấp, she rushes to Thạnh Lộc Commune in District 12 for the same job before going to wholesale markets to deliver fresh produce to people in need.

"Sometime, people do not understand our job. They refused to do the health declaration and shout at us. We have to persuade them a lot and even force them to declare,” said Vân

"But it is just several cases. Otherwise, people love us for what we are doing. They share food and drink with us, so sweet! Their love releases our tiredness and readiness to work harder."

Due the pandemic, volunteering activities can be held anytime. Vân and her team must be ready even if it is early morning or midnight.

"It is a pandemic which is happening through the nation. Volunteers are really important to help the task force. We are athletes but also members of the community. We not only focus on training but also participate in social activities. It is a good way to perfect my personality,” said Vân.

"I know that it is not easy job, and it could put me in dangerous situation but I really want to help. Supporting people brings happiness for me and people who we help. It is my way to strengthen my country."

Recognising the importance of volunteering, former national team goalkeeper Bùi Tiến Dũng also wants to help.

The 2018 Asian U23 championship silver holder supports doctors at Thủ Đức City Hospital.

“The more I go through the more I see people's love and care for each other. Medical workers, police and many others are working hard to fight COVID-19. I believe that to live is to share. You can share whatever you have -- money, energy, love, sympathy and understanding," said Dũng.

"I want to quietly support them, heroes in the frontline against this pandemic. I wish all of them strong and good health."

HCM City FC's Dũng is currently resting as the national football premier league can only return next February.

He is member of the 'We Love Sài Gòn' charity group. With about 100 members including many footballers such as defender Đoàn Văn Hậu and striker Hà Đức Chinh, the group has given away 1,000 meals to poor people, doctors and nurse every day since it started months ago.

Earlier, Dũng and his agent Nguyễn Đắc Văn presented microwaves, high flow nasal devices, protective kits and food to field hospitals around the city.

Dũng lost his place in HCM City FC's first team because of his poor performance, but has set a target of taking his place back when the national leagues come back, and to wins head coach Park Hang-seo's belief in him for a slot in a national team that will have many international challenges in 2022.

He is one of the football stars, such as Trần Hữu Đông Triều and Nguyễn Trọng Hoàng, among many athletes supporting the country with whatever they have and whenever they can. VNS

The HCM City University of Medicine and Pharmacy has added another full-time university entrance method for students eligible for special consideration for high school graduation in 2021 as well.

Specifically, the school will select students based on their results of the Competency Assessment Exam of Vietnam National University, Hà Nội and Vietnam National University, HCM City in 2021, together with their high school results.

The additional enrollment quota under this method will not exceed three per cent of the target for each faculty that was previously allocated by the school.

To create favorable conditions for 12th graders under special consideration for high school graduation this year, Phạm Ngọc Thạch Medical University also added a method based on candidates’ high school results in five semesters.

Each faculty is expected to add no more than 4 per cent of the target. The admission score is the total results of Math, Chemistry and Biology, plus bonus points.

If many candidates have the same total points for admission, the school will consider the average score for Foreign Language in five semesters, the average score in the 12th grade and the average score in Literature in five semesters.

Candidates applying under this new admission method must meet certain conditions, including good “moral score", and average scores of Math, Chemistry and Biology in five semesters of 6.5 and higher. Other rules are applied for Medicine, Pharmacy and Odonto-Stomatology majors.

International University, under the Vietnam National University, HCM City, has allocated 5 to 10 per cent of the school’s target for the new admission method, while the HCM City University of Agriculture and Forestry has set aside 150 slots.

The additional admission method aims to support new candidates without affecting the interest of candidates who participated in the previous admission methods, according to many schools. – VNS

Six decades since August 10, 1961, the day the first flight carrying Agent Orange/dioxin sprayed the chemical over southern Việt Nam as a defoliant, millions of Vietnamese people are still feeling the losses and pain caused.

Now one young Vietnamese artist born in France has created graphic designs to help people, especially the younger generation, understand more about the history and consequences of the deadly chemical.

Võ Trâm Anh's work features 10 panels about the history of Agent Orange, its consequences on humans and the environment, and a micro-credit project set up to help disabled people in the areas affected by Agent Orange in central province of Quảng Bình.

“Today images, videos, all the visual media are predominant. When you see a big bold image, it always catches your attention,” Anh told Việt Nam News in an online interview.

“To me making a big block of text into something colourful and attractive would draw people's attention even when it’s not a topic that they would have wanted to learn about in the first place.”

The exhibition will be on display at General Union of Vietnamese in France (​UGVF) in Paris until September 18.

Anh first learned about Agent Orange when she was a small child and her interest was inspired by her father.

She added: “I learned about the chemical at primary school age, like seven or eight years old. My dad is a photo journalist and he made a photo report about Agent Orange. He showed me the pictures of people who were exposed to it, consequences of people who were ill or malformed.

“I was young and shocked by these pictures. It stayed in the back of my mind somehow.”

Though six decades have passed, millions of people still bear mental and physical scars of Agent Orange.

Among 4.8 million people who were exposed to it in Việt Nam, hundreds of thousands have already died and millions of others are now suffering serious illnesses, deformities and disabilities.

A Vietnamese French woman Trần Tố Nga filed a claim in 2014 against the multinational corporations that manufactured and sold the toxin which was used by American troops during the war in Việt Nam.

Her claims were refused by France's Evry Court in May this year yet the 79-year-old former war correspondent was successful in bringing the AO issue to international public debate.

Anh, 22, is among hundreds of thousands of people across France who have voiced their support for Nga with movements and a range of advocacy activities.

She said: “The media began to talk about it [the trial] more. I remembered this and with my dad, we went to support events and followed the news.

“I want to share the fight of this woman. If people are aware of this topic, we can spread to the world, create a movement and make the world a better place if possible.”

Anh said the graphic elements would make her work more appealing.

She said: “In March this year I decided to make comic blog posts about it to make this topic more accessible and more widely known for the population.

“I think my audience is quite young so it’s the perfect way to portray the topic that is quite complex at first sight. It has a childish and colourful style, is easy to read and understand so it can make difficult topic more understandable.”

Anh said she hoped to bring her exhibition to the world.

She and the exhibition’s organisers have planned to translate her work into English, Vietnamese and German.

They are also trying to get a room at the city hall of the 13th arrondissement, home to Paris' principal Asian community.

Visitors gather at the exhibition at the General Union of Vietnamese in France.

Võ Định Kim, a representative of Collectif Vietnam Dioxine, an organiser of the exhibition, said the display is one of a series of activities to mark the 60th anniversary since Agent Orange was first used in Việt Nam.

He said this is also a way for them to tell Agent Orange stories and the suffering of the victims, so they can raise their voice against Agent Orange and fight for justice.

Though Anh was not born in Việt Nam, she has felt an urge to learn about her country of origin.

“A lot of people like me who are Vietnamese but born in France don’t really know about the topic because it’s not something you learn at school. It’s always good to have a grasp of what happened in your country of origin especially this kind of topic which I think is upsetting. It’s also very unfair,” she said. VNS

So we all had high hopes for our beloved Hồ Chí Minh City, often still referred to as Sài Gòn, its former name. But, well, you know what I'm trying to say. Times are tough. Just looking at all the devastation around the southern metropolis is enough to break the will of any man or woman.

COVID, this most vicious of airborne diseases, is reducing humans to that most basic but pivotal function of human life: breathing.

Everyone comes to life at birth with a breath, and then they exhale. If they are not able to breathe again then that is it, life is over. Your heart may still be beating, but once the lungs are not able to take in any fresh air, then it is no use even if other organs are still functioning well.

This deadly disease is an invisible enemy. It gets into your system and your cells and multiplies fast to destroy your respiratory organs. It reduces the oxygen in your blood and makes you gasp for air.

Doctors throughout the world are telling us how to combat the virus: be cautious with your breath, use facemasks as a guard, keep your distance.

In the mid-seventies Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Nhật Ánh wrote a popular poem Thành phố tình yêu và nỗi nhớ (The City of Love and Nostalgia); though it does not mention Sài Gòn directly, everyone knows what it is about. It contains the poignant lyrics, "Darling, listen, can you hear the city breathe?"

In March 1976, the writer had left Sài Gòn with thousands of other young men and women to venture further into distant lands, clearing landmines, reclaiming land, and helping to rebuild the nation. Away from the hustle and the bustle of the city, he was full of its memories: the age-old green foliage of the tamarind trees, familiar winding roads, the wharf along Sài Gòn River, images he soon set to poetry.

Composer Phạm Minh Tuấn was so moved by the words he even put them to music. As an activist, Tuấn had spent many years living in the jungle and like Ánh was also nostalgic for the great southern city. The song was eventually sung by Cẩm Vân and became an instant hit. Today, the notion of listening to the city breathing feels like a more powerful metaphor than ever before.

In 1976, reunified Việt Nam's National Assembly voted to change the name of Sài Gòn to Hồ Chí Minh City, to commemorate the founder of contemporary Việt Nam, but many in the city still refer to it by its old name, or simply as The City. The city's breath can be heard in the rhythm of its early birds, or in its workers from around the country who went there to find an opportunity, a raise or a better living.

But these days, the city is gasping for breath. Respiratory machines are needed, quite literally.

A new community Facebook group called, Nhóm cứu trợ oxy, giúp nhau mùa dịch (Oxygen Relief Group, Pandemic Help) was put together on August 5, with 850 signed up members with an active list of oxygen cylinder providers and transportation for coronavirus patients that need treatment in their homes.

The sudden surge in oxygen cylinder demand has pushed the cost up to VNĐ4 to 5 million each, though it is recommended people only buy them with a doctor’s prescription.

Patients can order oxygen as doctors prescribe, but with a daily increase in the city of around 3,000 to 4,000 patients, it is hard for a people to present their prescriptions to oxygen providers.

Since the group has been set up, many urgent calls for cylinders have been posted in the group and charitable donors have also provided oxygen cylinders free of charge, if you tell them your doctor prescribed its use.

On one hand, it is a relief to see people get what they need as fast as possible, but on the other these cylinders pose a risk insofar as they could explode if not managed well according to instructions.

Watch our video on the oxygen delivery service in HCM City

Last week, a 40-year-old father had to violate the city's curfew to venture out for an oxygen cylinder for his son, who was fighting another disease. He was arrested for his violation, but his story moved many people, including Hoàng Tuấn Anh, the creator of the country’s now famous 'Rice ATMs', which provided rice to thousands in need during the three previous coronavirus waves.

Ever the practical sort, he soon came up with an oxygen ATM machine network, teaming up with Việt Nam's Young Entrepreneurs Association and HCM City's youth union organisation to make his idea a reality.

He reportedly said that after sharing his Oxygen ATM on social media, he received an urgent call from someone who asked for help with oxygen to save their father's life.

As part of the network, volunteer delivery teams using protective gear set up oxygen cylinders near the homes of patients. Teams will set up oxygen ATM stations free of charge in all districts of Thủ Đức City. The Young Entrepreneurs Association shall provide 900 8-litre cylinders to be used at the stations

Patients who need a refill can call a hotline and volunteers will deliver to their homes. Those who need a new cylinder can borrow them free of charge.

Everyone is working their best to help the city regain its normal breath, so that it can get back to being strong and helping others again.

The city has been locked down for a long time but things can and will return to normal. For now, all we can do is stay calm, take a deep breath and keep up the fight. We are all with you. VNS
