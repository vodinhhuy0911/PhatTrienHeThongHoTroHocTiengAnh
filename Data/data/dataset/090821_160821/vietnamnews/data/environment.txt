NEW YORK — Ambassador Đặng Đình Quý, Việt Nam's Permanent Representative to the UN, has stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to avoid unexpected impacts of counter-terrorism measures on humanitarian activities.

Quý made the suggestion at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)’s virtual Arria-formula meeting on “Humanitarian action: overcoming challenges in situations of armed conflict and counter-terrorism operations” under the chair of Kenya.

The event drew the attendance of Raffi Gregorian, Deputy to the Under-Secretary-General of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Director of the UNOCT; Reena Ghelani, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)’s Director of Operations and Advocacy Division; Helen Durham, Director of International Law and Policy at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); and Ambassador Fatima Kyari Mohammed, Permanent Observer of the African Union to the UN.

The Vietnamese ambassador underlined that anti-terrorism measures must be in conformity with the UN Charter and international law.

He underlined the need for all countries to effectively implement UN resolutions, evaluate negative impacts of anti-terrorism measures right from the process of building and applying them.

The best way to protect civilians is to prevent and settle conflicts, and maintain sustainable peace, Quý stressed.

Participants were worried about the accelerating risk of terrorism in Africa, calling on the UNSC to reaffirm the requirement to protect humanitarian action space and promote dialogue and experience sharing.

They confirmed their commitments to fight terrorism, protect civilians, create optimal conditions for humanitarian activities in line with humanitarian principles, and effectively implement UN resolutions in the field. — VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Winne Wong, Mastercard Country Manager for Việt Nam, Cambodia & Laos, discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed Vietnamese consumers' spending habits, how it has helped drive cashless payment in the country and the lasting impact it may have on the country's transition process to cashless payment in the future.

Mastercard Country Manager - Winnie Wong

How has the pandemic changed consumer behaviours and spending habits, in particular their payment preference?

The pandemic has been changing many aspects of our life. Three years ago, when I first came to Việt Nam, cash was still the dominant payment form that people heavily relied on, as I recall it accounted for 75 - 90 per cent of the transactions.

Việt Nam then was different from countries where cashless payments have high adoption rates like Singapore, for example. With everything being cashless, I could go out and easily survive with only 2 dollars in my wallet, as I have my phone and digital payment apps like Apple Pay. However, in Việt Nam, I found myself needing a lot of cash in my wallet, which was an inconvenient practice, especially when I forgot to prepare cash in my wallet.

Since last year, we have witnessed a huge shift to digital payment, in online transactions. Due to social distancing orders, we turn to cashless or online payments in order to minimise physical contact.

This trend toward digital payment is happening across the region, according to our new payments index. At least 94 per cent of people in the Asia Pacific now consider using at least one emerging payment method such as a mobile wallet or digital currency in the coming years, a remarkable change in people’s payment preference as compared to prior to the pandemic where people hardly considered it seriously in Việt Nam.

For a population that preferred cash and cards predominantly, the pandemic really prompted the acceptance of cashless at an unprecedented pace, as from what I observed, Vietnamese people are more likely to ask if the money could be transferred, moving away from the traditional cash reliance mindset.

What other advantages do cashless payments have over traditional cash-based transactions?

We at Mastercard are advocating for cashless because we believe in the many benefits that it offers. Number one is the data from cashless transactions, which also provides great help to the government, banks, and societies in general, in planning.

For example, when you withdraw VNĐ1 million in cash from an ATM and spend it in a shop, there is no record or data of that transaction. But that kind of data is very useful for government planning or for the banks to understand their customers better so they can improve services or even expand their credit line.

For many local micro, small & medium sized enterprises (MSMEs), one of their biggest financial challenges is that they cannot get loans from the banks and must look elsewhere for funding. Such difficulty is caused by their cash-based business operations, which provides no visibility for the banks to examine the business financial capabilities other than income tax statements and financial statements. Such documents are not sufficient for banks to grant businesses a high-value loan of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they could only show a modest yearly income of ten thousand dollars.

Digital payments record a trail of transactions. Banks can look at this digital proof of money into your account and even proactively reach out to offer you credit. This is called being banked, which is not only about having a bank account, but also having access to financing and a presence in the formal economy, so as to get financing from legal entities approved by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). The data is there to protect consumers as well. For instance, if the banks overcharged consumers, SBV could step in.

It's important for such data to be available to governments and formal institutions so they can make the right decisions for people and for businesses.

As a large part of Việt Nam's population still remains unbanked or underbanked, what has Mastercard done to address this issue?

As a global company, we understand that different markets require different approaches. We focus on each market environment and seek to understand what is important to the consumers, as well as areas that we can add value to the market. It's not about Mastercard doing and winning more but about how our solutions can help the government’s cashless agenda, how we use our resources to support the government's directives, and how we cooperate with the banks, fintech companies, the SBV and other partners to drive the bigger objectives for the market.

One of the initiatives we are working on is the unbanked (individuals or households with no bank accounts) or the underbanked (individuals or households with bank accounts but rely on alternative methods to fund purchases and finance). We understand there is a large effort by Việt Nam to address this issue and we are working with our partners to find ways to leapfrog and reach these groups in the most efficient manner.

What's more important is to always ask ourselves whether we still follow the same ways as in the past. For example, the rural areas of Việt Nam have high mobile penetration and Internet penetration rates, even among the unbanked or underbanked segments. So, we try to figure out ways to leverage that advantage to drive cashless payment faster and expand it wider in a more customer-friendly and secured manner. We also put efforts into finding ways to replicate our programmes from different countries and their successes when bringing them to Việt Nam.

What can Việt Nam, as a country, do to speed up the transition to cashless payment?

Việt Nam has been driving the fourth industrial revolution, a collective priority of the whole government. The SBV also serves this goal with efforts to promote a cashless agenda, to build up the capabilities of local partners such as NAPAS, and for international institutions including Mastercard to contribute to.

As the framework for the transition is already in place, along with the fact that the government and the country itself is already welcoming the development, SBV can advance the progress by providing a sandbox - a safe testing environment - for fintech companies such as Mastercard to experiment innovative cashless solutions that are novel to Việt Nam.

It's crucial that banks can test new models and take losses with minimized or no repercussions in a safe playground. The fear of failing and facing great consequences, especially within big institutions, will inhibit innovations. Furthermore, with failure we can learn our lessons and continuously improve our methods. Therefore, providing fintech innovators the safeguard assurance of no penalty when any thing occurs during their experiment will help accelerate the digital transformation further.

HÀ NỘI — The Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) has made a final determination in its investigation into the dumping and subsidising of certain upholstered seating from China and Việt Nam, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Trade Remedies Authority of Việt Nam (TRAV).

Accordingly, out of eight Vietnamese enterprises that co-operated in the investigation, only one is subject to the anti-subsidy tax of 3.7 per cent and the rest will avoid this tax. The anti-subsidy tax rate for non-cooperating businesses is 5.5 per cent.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade attributed the positive result to the close co-operation between the ministry and relevant agencies and People's Committees of provinces and cities to collect information and answer questions from the Canadian side.

The fact that Canada believed that the majority of Vietnamese enterprises do not receive subsidies from the Government shows the transparency of the country’s policy and law enforcement. It also reflected that Việt Nam's economic sectors are operating in an equally competitive market, said the TRAV.

Regarding the anti-dumping investigation, in the CBSA’s final conclusion, most of the enterprises that co-operated in the investigation receive duty rates ranging from 10 to 20 per cent, compared to preliminary levels of 20-90 per cent.

The duty rate for those who didn’t cooperate in the investigation is up to 179.5 per cent. Meanwhile, Chinese enterprises are subject to anti-subsidy tax from 1.1 to 81.1 per cent and anti-dumping duty of between 9.3 and 188 per cent.

In addition to the CBSA's investigation into dumping and subsidising, the Canadian International Trade Court (CITT) is investigating to determine the damage to the domestic industry.

The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) is reported to continue its inquiry to determine whether the imports are harming Canadian producers. It is expected to issue a decision by September 2.

According to the Canadian data, during the investigation period of the case from June 2019 to the end of September 2020, the export turnover of upholstered seats from Việt Nam to Canada reached approximately US$135.6 million, accounting for 10.08 per cent of Canada's total imports of this item.

The TRAV has urged the concerned exporters to keep a close watch on the case and fully co-operate with the CBSA during its investigation. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — HCM City, the current COVID-19 epicentre of Việt Nam, will extend its strict social distancing measures for another month until September 15 given the risk of a resurgence, Phan Văn Mãi, vice secretary of the city's Party Committee, said on Sunday.

Speaking at a meeting to receive goods and necessities for people affected by the pandemic in HCM City, Mãi said the pandemic could become more severe if the city relaxes its vigilance.

“Therefore, it’s essential that social distancing be applied to reduce the number of new cases and gradually bring the city to a 'new normal' state", he said.

In order to do so, people's awareness is the most important factor, he emphasised.

Mãi said the city has gone 80 days since the fourth wave of infections broke out with the Delta mutation. The period of social distancing, especially the five weeks of tightening Government’s Directive 16, were "unprecedentedly difficult" days for the political system and people.

The city has made great efforts to control outbreaks and infection chains, removing hundreds of locked down areas, promoting control of red zones, as well as expanding green zones. The health sector also cured more than 70,000 people and administered vaccines for over 4.5 million people.

With the spirit of making all efforts to take care of people, the city has tried its best to reduce difficulties, while ensuring the supply of goods and issuing support packages.

Mãi said the pandemic in HCM City has been partially controlled but is still very complicated; the number of infections is still high; the treatment system is overloaded and its operation is not synchronous. The process of receiving and treating COVID-19 cases is sometimes not efficient and the death rate has not decreased.

He said the Government’s requirement to control the pandemic by September 15 is challenging, but it was the common desire of the people. Leaders of the city affirmed maximum priority towards pandemic prevention, while putting the health and life of the people first and foremost.

To achieve this goal, Mãi said HCM City will focus on implementing four main tasks.

The first is to thoroughly apply social distancing, limiting the source of infection, each person and each household must strictly comply with the requirements of social distancing and the 5K message.

"The pathogen remains widespread in the community, close contacts make it more easy to spread, and that could be very dangerous for people with weak immune systems, the elderly, or those with underlying medical conditions,” he said.

Secondly, the city takes good care of people's lives in the coming days of social distancing, ensuring people’s needs for goods and necessities are met.

The city will mobilise all possible resources to deploy welfare packages for the poor, elderly people who live alone, freelance workers who lost their jobs, to ensure the basic life of people until they return to a “new normal” life.

Third, the city will focus on effective treatment strategies, reducing mortality. The city is expanding the number of hospitals and treatment facilities to meet the needs of emergency, oxygen support, medical care and deploying F0 home treatment.

Fourth, the city is speeding up vaccination to achieve herd immunity. However Mãi emphasised that even when the vaccination rate is high, implementing the 5K message is still a requirement.

The need to impose social distancing for one more month was also noted earlier on Saturday by Secretary of HCM Party Committee Nguyễn Văn Nên at a conference about assessment of pandemic prevention and control results after two weeks of implementing Directive 12, issued by the HCM City Party Committee's Standing Commission on strengthening several measures to implement the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic in HCM City.

The city has implemented the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 on social distancing rules since July 9 and started to impose even more restrictions from July 24 to contain spread of the virus.

On July 23, the Municipal People's Committee decided to extend the application of social distancing measures until August 1.

On August 1, the city issued a decision on imposing city-wide social distancing measures under the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 for an additional 14 days from 0:00 on August 2. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam administered over 1.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, the highest one-day increase since the country starts its vaccination campaign on March 8, according to the health ministry's report on Wednesday.

The total doses given in Việt Nam reached 11,341,864 and the number of fully vaccinated people crossed the mark of 1 million (1,036,102 specifically) as of Tuesday.

The country has currently received some 18.7 million doses of vaccines of various types, mostly AstraZeneca and Moderna.

Up to 2.5 million doses of Moderna along with 250,000 doses of Sinopharm, donated by the US and Chinese governments respectively, would remain in storage until second doses are given.

The health ministry said that 72 per cent of the received doses have been distributed.

According to the National Government Portal on COVID-19 Vaccination, HCM City, the epicentre of the fourth wave of infections and which has been allocated the most vaccines, is leading the race with over 3.5 million doses administered. The southern city has given at least one jab to 51.66 per cent of the official population over 18 years old (around 7 million).

Hà Nội, also the recipient of a large number of vaccines, has administered about 1.5 million doses, with 25.41 per cent of the population getting at least one vaccine shot.

Health Minister Nguyễn Thanh Long, during a meeting on Tuesday, has asked for close collaboration between the medical sector and the army as vaccines will come in great quantity especially in the final months of the year, including vaccines like Pfizer which need to be preserved in strict conditions.

The Health Ministry issued a document on scheduled allocation of vaccines for localities between now and year’s end to ensure vaccination progress.

Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Huy Dũng said more than 2.4 million people downloaded the electronic health record app.

Minister Long suggested the Ministry of Information and Communications soon launch a campaign to call on residents to download the app, fill in health declarations, register for vaccination, as well as issue vaccination certificates via software.

All 63 cities and provinces have so far updated data on the software.

Helicopters to transport COVID-19 vaccines

Military forces are ready to be on duty around the clock and mobilise helicopters to transport COVID-19 vaccines to islands and disadvantaged areas, according to Deputy Minister of Defence Vũ Hải Sản.

Minister of Health Nguyễn Thanh Long said receiving, transporting and storing vaccines have been implemented resolutely by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the army. They established eight cold storages facilities to keep and preserve vaccines with a total capacity of 60 million doses.

He added that 63 trucks with cold storage capabilities have been delivered to the army to transport vaccines to localities as scheduled.

Deputy minister Sản added that the Ministry of Defence has mobilised and trained staff and prepared vehicles to be ready to transport vaccines when needed.

The ministry would have transportation plans right after more doses of vaccines arrive in Việt Nam, he said. — VNS

HCM CITY — The Sài Gòn Hi-tech Park Business Association has sought city authorities’ permission for its workers to travel to work from home since organising accommodation on-site for them is difficult.

Since July 15 businesses at the park in District 9 have been providing accommodation to workers as mandated by the city, either in their premises or other lodging places nearby.

Besides the enormous cost, they are also facing problems such as vehicles transporting staff or meals getting stuck at checkpoints, delaying work and stressing workers.

Many skilled personnel needed by their employers are also stuck at home, and their availability again would help restore production.

According to the association, long term solutions are needed to reconcile the strict distancing requirements under Directive 16 with the financial and psychological burden on businesses and staff.

In the event, it has suggested a pilot initiative allowing key, experienced workers at two businesses who have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose to commute to work from home between July 16 and 30.

They have to sign commitments to only travel to their home and workplace, and strictly follow pandemic regulations. Their movements will be monitored by an application or other methods.

Their workplace will be separated from the other workers’.

Their family members too will not be allowed to leave home during the duration of the trial, and will be tested at home for COVID.

The two businesses will transport them and frequently test them.

The pilot will continue even if some test positive as long as their number is less than 10 per cent of the total.

The plan has been submitted to the park management board and HCM City Business Association. Hồ Thị Thu Uyên, head of SBA, hoped it would help the Government and businesses overcome the pandemic.

LAI CHÂU — In response to the movement "Against plastic waste" launched by the Youth Union of Lai Châu Province, the Youth Union of Phong Thổ District launched their own sub-campaign "plastic for gifts".

It sought to encourage young people in Sin Suối Hồ Commune to collect plastic waste that could be exchanged for gift packs that included Lifebuoy antibacterial soap, hand sanitiser, and medical masks.

The 10-day campaign started on July 21.

First implemented in Lai Châu Province, the campaign aimed to change the habits of local people and encourage the sorting of waste at the source.

Many ethnic minority people brought plastic items such as bottles, and baskets used for packaging to exchange.

Đào Đức Định, Secretary of the Phong Thổ District's Youth Union said: "This campaign helps raise local people's awareness about the harmful effects of plastic waste, towards the total elimination of plastic waste.”

“We also want to guide local people toward changing their habit of using plastic products and help them to realise the benefits of keeping the environment clean, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Holding a gift bag in her hand, Sùng Thị Ké, 40, happily said that like many local people she was guided by Youth Union members. Her family picked up plastic bottles on the road and at home, then took them to the community house to exchange.

Hảng Thị Nú, 50, said "I find this programme is very useful and helps discourage people from littering, and at the same time we receive necessary household goods during the pandemic.”

At first, many people didn't know about the campaign, but words spread quickly.

Everyone in the village collected plastic, both at home and in street, and took it to be exchanged.

In particular, the children were excited and came together to help, Nú said.

After 10 days, more than 120 kg of plastic of all kinds was collected.

The youth union will help sell the used plastic, and the money will be transferred to the commune authorities to help fund COVID-19 prevention measures, provincial Youth Union's Secretary Đào Đức Định, said.

"Promoting taking an active role in the community and the spirit of volunteering among young people, the Youth Union will continue to spread the model to all 16 communes and towns in Phong Thổ District as well as the whole province," he said.

"Thereby, contributing to building awareness, positive attitudes and environmentally-friendly actions in the communities in the highlands.” —VNS

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s approach and initiatives laid out by Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính’s at the United Nations Security Council High-level Open Debate on “Enhancing Maritime Security - A Case for International Cooperation” earlier this week have drawn appreciation from international experts, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reports.

Mr. James Rogers, co-founder and Director of Research at the UK's Council on Geostrategy, who specialises in British geostrategic and maritime power, and Euro-Atlantic, Indo-Pacific and Polar geopolitics, in an interview with the VNA correspondent in the UK, agreed with PM Chính’s emphasis on the fact that given the significance of the sea for the system of international commerce, it was important to keep it open and free for access by all countries.

Mr. Rogers said although most countries had signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which governs the behaviours that countries can undertake at sea, some countries had ignored rules and regulations they subscribed to in the past. That was the problem for all countries, not just those around the South China Sea (called the East Sea in Việt Nam), he said.

The British expert acknowledged the importance of regional coordination for maritime security in the South China Sea as proposed by PM Chính, pointing out that this should be facilitated not only in the UN, but also in ASEAN, particularly in relation to regulations of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. He also pointed to the necessity for a coordination mechanism that encourages countries to uphold important maritime norms established through the UNCLOS system.

He agreed with the Vietnamese PM's point that regulations and conduct of states at sea must comply with both the UN Charter and UNCLOS system, saying that any additional future policy or proposals in relation to the East Sea security and maritime rights must correspond to these rules and regulations that the countries have subscribed to.

He said it was very good seeing Việt Nam as an important regional power and close partner with many different countries in the world, including the UK, taking the lead in bringing this issue to international attention. He also acknowledged the role of Việt Nam and its support and leadership in dealing with security issues in the South China Sea, given the country's important location.

Regarding maritime security cooperation between Việt Nam and the UK, Mr. Rogers said the two countries would have many different opportunities in the coming years given the UK's increasing presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

He said the UK's deployment of the carrier strike group (CSG 21) in the region demonstrated that the country was undertaking its tilt towards the Indo-Pacific, which was put forward in the UK government's integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy released in March this year.

He pointed out that the UK understands the strategic significance of the Indo-Pacific and the South China Sea in Southeast Asia in particular, and therefore, takes the region seriously when deploying its largest and most powerful maritime group in the region.

As the UK intends to deploy later this year two patrol vessels permanently in the region beyond the periodic deployment, which will interact with regional partners, of which Việt Nam is an important one, Mr. Rogers said he saw the prospect for enhancing Việt Nam-UK cooperation.

Lauding Việt Nam’s proposals, Professor Giuseppe Cataldi from the University of Naples “L’Orientale”, who is President of the International Association of Maritime Law, reiterated Việt Nam’s call for relevant parties to intensify dialogue and cooperation and respect for international law, particularly the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Agreeing with Việt Nam’s view that UNCLOS is the "Constitution" of the seas and oceans, Cataldi said that countries needed to comply with the provisions of this original legal document and avoid unilateral actions that may escalate current maritime disputes.

Dr. Antonio Albanese, expert in world geopolitics, director of AGC Communication, assessed that Việt Nam’s proposals not only showed the universality in the global context, but also contributed to promoting a substantive approach to solving specific problems of the region. Việt Nam had affirmed its support for ensuring maritime security based on clear and consistent rules within the UN framework and concretised into common codes of conduct, he stated.

Việt Nam’s stance of resolutely opposing any unilateral actions and seeking multilateral and peaceful solutions was a suitable choice for the interests of each country and the globe’s common interests, thus ensuring equal access for all countries, especially in the fields of international trade and navigation, he added.

As an expert in Asian geopolitics, Prof. Antonio Fallico, President of the Conoscere Eurasia Association in Veneto, stated that Việt Nam’s proposals clearly demonstrated a foreign policy of peace and cooperation and its responsibility for regional and international stability and security.

From the Czech Republic, Dr. Takashi Hosoda, an expert on Việt Nam and the Asia-Pacific from the country’s Charles University, said that PM Chính’s speech could be considered an important milestone for the relations between Việt Nam and India because the Prime Minister of India – the rotating Chairman of the UN Security Council – was the one who took the initiative to organise, and also presided over the UNSC meeting.

Việt Nam and India played increasingly important roles in ensuring the maintenance of maritime security in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific as well as resolving issues related to peace and security in the region. The two countries also shared many strategic similarities, so it was important for Việt Nam to enhance cooperation with India, Hosoda stated.

He spoke highly of the proposals made by the Vietnamese Government leader to contribute to solving maritime security challenges, especially the need for the international community to raise awareness of the importance of maritime security as well as threats to marine security.

To that end, the expert suggested Việt Nam make specific contributions within the bilateral and multilateral cooperation frameworks, including the cooperation mechanisms between the European Union (EU) and Asian countries such as the EU Critical Maritime Route Wider Indian Ocean (CRIMARIO).— VNS

HÀ NỘI – Scientists from the Institute of Oceanography under the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology have completed a collection of more than 20,000 specimens of sea creatures, with many new creatures discovered for the first time in Vietnamese waters or entirely new species.

This is the result of the national Project on Building a National Collection of Natural Creature Specimens.

Deputy Director of the Institute of Oceanography Hoàng Xuân Bền, who is responsible for directing the project, said that this is a large-scale and long-lasting piece of research.

The project aims to obtain a set of specimens of about 50 per cent of all marine species in the southern region for display and research that meet the standards of the Vietnam National Museum of Nature, and contribute to completing the national collection of natural specimens for research and display.

It also aims to improve the research capacity and skills of classifying sea creatures to support research on biodiversity to serve conservation and education on the marine environment.

The collection includes more than 20,100 specimens of plankton, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates which were discovered and collected in the 2015-2020 period. Of that, 2,626 specimens are for display and the rest are for research.

Bền said the organisation of field trips to collect, process and preserve specimens at sea was difficult due to the large sampling area stretching from Đà Nẵng to Kiên Giang, and diverse specimens in the deep and offshore areas in the Paracel and Spratly Archipelagos.

The classification of species and number of specimens collected was based on existing documents such as the Vietnam Red Book or the Vietnam Fauna and Flora guide. However, when scientists expanded the collection area, some rare species could be obtained in large quantities while some others decreased in number, even though the location and sampling method was the same.

"In order to collect specimens in the Spratly islands, we sought the support of Naval Region 4 and were allowed to collect samples using navy ships. We were also given the support of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology when collecting samples in offshore waters by the Academic Oparin research ship from the Russian Academy of Sciences and support from fishermen on Lý Sơn Islands when collecting specimens in the Paracel islands.

New sea creatures discovered

During the project, scientists have identified many new organisms that were first discovered in Việt Nam's waters or new species entirely.

Sơn fish is newly discovered in the waters around the Paracel islands.

Dragonets have been recorded in the waters of southern Bến Tre Province and seven other species of fish were discovered in the waters of Đà Nẵng, Quảng Ngãi, Bình Định and Nha Trang.

New soft corals have been reported in the waters of Cù Lao Chàm, Lý Sơn, Nha Trang and Ninh Thuận. Two new specimens of sponges have been found in the waters of Khánh Hòa, Ninh Thuận, Côn Đảo, Phú Quốc and Thổ Chu.

“These results show that the southern sea of ​​our country still has a lot to discover,” he said.

Bền said in order to conserve and develop biodiversity in southern seas, there should be specific solutions such as strengthening management activities in sustainable exploitation of coastal resources, especially coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and coastal wetlands.

Authorised agencies and local authorities needed to effectively manage marine areas and other important habitats; restore degraded habitats; develop appropriate policies in the management of marine resources, and raise people's awareness of compliance with the law in the exploitation and use of marine resources.

In particular, policy-makers needed to focus on investing in scientific research, including surveys and assessments of biodiversity of marine creatures in the southern seas, he said.

All specimens are on display at the Institute of Oceanography. VNS

CENTRAL REGION — Biodiversity conservation projects and forest protection in the central highlands region, over the past two years, have been either delayed or suspended as travel and mass gathering activities are limited by COVID-19 prevention measures.

Despite hosting online meetings and technical guide events, local rangers and conservationists have been unable to visit national parks and nature reserves to collect data and information from field studies among local communities in the region.

Dr Hà Thăng Long, head of the Frankfurt Zoological Society in Việt Nam, who researches langurs, said a number of plans had to be put on hold and no progress reports on wildlife populations at assigned national parks and reserves had been completed.

“Field surveys and forest trips for the supervision of the grey-shanked douc langurs population – one of the world's top 25 critically endangered primates, and on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUNC) Red List – were scheduled between May and June of 2021 in Kon Tum Province, but the plan has yet to be carried out,” he said.

Wildlife protection awareness educational programmes among ethnic groups and communities living in buffer zones of the national parks and have also not gone ahead.

“Activities around wildlife awareness education for local communities at the Sơn Trà Nature Reserve-based Nature Dance in Đà Nẵng have been cancelled, and the target of hosting 10,000 visitors in 2021 has failed due to social distancing orders through the first half this year,” he explained.

Long, who is also the founder of the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation-GreenViet, said distancing orders in provinces in the region have blocked a lot of communication between conservationists and ethnic groups including collecting information about the primates’ population from indigenous communities.

“Only online discussions and meetings have been held or phone conversations or information has been communicated by email in connection with parks and reserves. Practical or technical support for wildlife tracking devices is yet to be taken. The One Million Tree Plantation, an urban project in Hà Nội, Đà Nẵng and HCM City has also come to a halt as social distancing orders have expanded in the three cities.”

The langur researcher said a report on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the existence of wildlife species had yet to be released.

He warned that illegal hunting and logging activities at some localities in the central highlands would increase because of the number of unemployed people returning from urban areas, and local communities living around reserves and parks suffered a loss in revenue from community-based tourism and farm produce as a result of the pandemic.

Restrictions

Trịnh Viết Ty, director of managing director of Kon Chư Răng Nature reserve in Gia Lai Province, said coronavirus interrupted regular patrol plans, field surveys among international experts and ethnic groups meeting.

“At least five NGO projects have been halted because foreign experts could not get to the site. Related seminars and workshops were also cancelled. Four out of 13 rangers were also home quarantined due to indirect contact with a COVID-19 infection. The remaining members of the reserve had their travel limited as social distancing orders expanded from district to district of Gia Lai Province,” Ty explained.

He said a wildlife supervision project and a forest protection and management project were delayed by one year, while financial funding for the other projects was still yet to be allocated.

“Only 30 per cent of the planned forest patrol has been carried out since early this year due to a manpower shortage. Now one ranger has to cover the job of two at deep jungle stations – from 6km to 15km from the reserve’s administrative centre,” he said.

He blamed the coronavirus which has scared the ethnic Ba Na people who are now avoiding outsiders. The indigenous tribes had effectively locked themselves down to avoid SARS-COV-2 infections, he said.

Two communities in particular – Hlam Village in Sơn Lang Commune and Kon Von Village of Đắk Rong Commune in KBang District – have blocked their villages from outsiders.

“Village gates are blocked with fences. Strangers and people from other areas are prohibited from entering. Only resident villagers are allowed,” he said, saying only 50 per cent of the reserve’s staff had been vaccinated.

The director said 50-metre towers and drones had been used to continue monitoring the forest where possible along with biodiversity supervision smartphone apps.

Biologist Bùi Văn Tuấn said lockdown zones at some localities in the region forced his primates supervision plan to be extended to two years instead of six months.

He said transport interruptions also delayed field trips into the jungle from two to three months.

Long also said online meetings and digital applications were needed to promote communication in the case of pandemic interruptions that might occur in the future.

Equipment and financial funding for biodiversity conservation projects should be a priority in the post coronavirus period, he added. VNS

HCM CITY — More medical personnel from other provinces are being deployed in HCM City, Việt Nam’s COVID-19 epicentre, as the burden on hospitals worsens and as the city considers paying recovered COVID-19 patients, who have high natural immunity, to help with prevention and control activities.

The city is in need of 12,000 more personnel, including doctors and nurses who can treat symptomatic patients with underlying medical conditions from the second to fifth levels. Medical staff skilled in resuscitation and intensive care are especially needed.

Many hospitals are struggling to care for more COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 Resuscitation Hospital set up in Thủ Đức City, which has admitted over 1,000 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, is in dire need of more medical personnel since the number of patients admitted has exceeded its capacity.

Trần Thanh Linh, deputy head of Chợ Rẫy Hospital's intensive care unit and deputy director of COVID-19 Resuscitation Hospital, said the latter was designed to have 500 beds for its first phase, but currently it is already treating around 600 patients.

It has been receiving personnel from Chợ Rẫy Hospital and is working on improving its treatment capacity to 700 hospital beds.

While medical equipment there is still able to satisfy demand, more machinery and medicines will be needed in the future, he said.

Sixteen field hospitals have been established to treat the rising number of F0 (infected) cases. The Phú Nhuận COVID-19 No. 1 Field Hospital, for example, was put into service on August 12 in Phú Nhuận District.

The hospital treats second and third-level patients according to the city’s five-level admission and treatment plan for COVID-19 patients. The patients at the hospital include symptomatic cases with underlying medical conditions who may become moderately or severely ill.

With 350 beds, including 60 beds for resuscitation, and a wide variety of medical equipment, it aims to reduce the number of worsening F0 cases who need to be transferred to hospitals for specialised medical intervention, alleviating stress on such facilities.

The field hospital currently has 65 medical staff treating more than 20 patients.

Dr. Tăng Chí Thượng, deputy director of HCM City’s Department of Health, said that city districts must be proactive in finding, admitting and monitoring local F0 cases.

According to the HCM City Centre for Disease Control, the city has nearly 58,000 medical staff and 20,000 personnel involved in the fight against COVID-19.

More than 4,000 personnel are from central hospitals and other hospitals in provinces and cities, and there are tens of thousands of volunteers.

Help from recovered patients

Chairman of HCM City People’s Committee Nguyễn Thành Phong has asked the Health Department to suggest payment policies for recovered COVID-19 patients who could help the city in COVID prevention and control activities.

The city has a total of 65,135 COVID-19 patients who have been discharged from hospitals since January.

Vice Director of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases Nguyễn Trung Cấp told Vietnam News Agency that most people who have recovered from COVID-19 are likely to be immune for several months afterwards. One study concluded that immune responses from past infections reduced the risk of reinfection by 83 per cent for at least five months.

However, even though the COVID-19 reinfection rate is low, it is still possible, so people recovering from COVID-19 must take preventive measures and get vaccinated as soon as possible, Cấp said.

Phong has also asked city departments to conduct a survey on human resources and medicine at designated hospitals and, based on the results, make decisions about the best use of staff, medicine and transfer of COVID-19 patients.

The city also asked the Ministry of National Defence and the Government’s special task force to add more doctors and nurses to field hospitals and COVID-19 treatment hospitals, and increase contact tracing, testing, and the number of vaccination sites.VNS

HCM CITY – The Ministry of Health plans to pilot an initiative to have COVID-19 patients treated at home with medicines, health supplements and care instructions in HCM City from August 16 at a time when COVID-19 treatment facilities are becoming overwhelmed.

Tests will be carried out at home and in the community and medicines and health supplements will be provided to patients and closely monitored by medical experts.

Food and groceries will be provided to households with patients since their family members will not be allowed to step out.

The ministry will provide detailed guidelines for taking care of patients, monitoring their health and seeking medical assistance if their condition worsens.

Helping COVID patients at home access medical care in time, thus reducing the burden on treatment facilities and fatality rates is of utmost importance, according to the ministry.

Minister of Health Nguyễn Thanh Long said home care would reduce the chance of pandemic spread.

HCM City has been trialling a programme to have asymptomatic patients quarantining at home since mid-July.

Phan Văn Mãi, deputy secretary of the city Party Committee, said medical facilities’ capacity has already been exceeded though the pandemic situation remains dire.

There is also a need for 12,000 more doctors and nurses to treat symptomatic patients with underlying medical conditions.

The city is focusing on reducing the death rate in the next 30 days.

The ministry has updated its treatment regime based on global case studies and the pandemic situation, which indicates that nearly 80 per cent of patients have few or no symptoms.

After piloting it in HCM City, the ministry will consider expanding it to the rest of the country.

According to the HCM City Centre for Disease Control, as of Saturday there were more than 35,000 COVID-positive people quarantined and monitored at home, and another 13,000 in quarantine facilities.

The city is the country’s pandemic epicentre with more than 144,000 cases by 6pm, Saturday. – VNS

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is calling for contributions to a draft Government’s decree to concretise a number of articles in the amended Law on Environmental Protection that was approved by the National Assembly last November. The online newspaper Tài nguyên & Môi trường (Natural Resources and Environment) introduced some experts’ opinions.

Võ Tuấn Nhân, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment received contributions and opinions of many environmentalists, scientists and experts when compiling the amended law on environment protection and the draft decree to concretise some articles in the law.

The opinions were studied and included in 13 chapters, 197 articles and appendix of the draft decree.

The draft decree is expected to clarify responsibilities and obligations of individuals, organisation and authorised agencies in environmental protection. The decree compilers expect to receive opinions focusing on water, air and soil resources, the issuance of environment-relating licences, expanded responsibilities of producers, circle economy and solid waste treatment.

The decree is an important base for the implementation of the amended law that takes effects next year. It will regulate new and difficult issues that are applied in Việt Nam for the first time.

Nguyễn Việt Anh, head of Institute of Environmental Science and Engineering under National University of Civil Engineering

Article 86 in the amended law on environmental protection states that urban areas, new residential areas, trade, production and service establishments, industrial clusters must have waste water collecting and treating systems that are separate from rainwater treatment systems.

However, there is no guidance on urban waste water treatment in the draft decree. Meanwhile, many areas in Việt Nam are using the same system for both wastewater and rain water. Combined sewer systems are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe. Normally, combined sewer systems transport wastewater to a sewage treatment plant. After heavy rainfall, the wastewater volume in a combined sewer system can exceed the capacity of the sewer system or treatment plant. So, combined sewer systems are designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess wastewater directly to nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies. These overflows, called combined sewer overflows (CSOs), contain not only storm water but also untreated human and industrial waste, toxic materials, and debris.

It’s costly to build separate sewer systems for wastewater or rainwater, so I think that drainage projects and waste treatment projects could face difficulties in the future.

Specific regulations should be available for areas with existing combined sewer overflows (CSO). The regulation on waste water treatment work at industrial clusters should be imposed in areas that have yet to have a CSO.

Article 59 in the draft mentions the reuse of treated wastewater for activities of concentrated manufacture/trade or service areas or industrial clusters. It’s good but requires clear regulations on technical standards for treated wastewater to be reused.

Phùng Chí Sỹ - Vice President of Việt Nam Association for Conservation of Nature and Environment

Under the draft decree, the quality of surface water in rivers and lakes will be surveyed and assessed every three years while the quality of air will be surveyed and assessed every five years. I think that it should be five-year assessments for both surface water and air.

Article 62 mentions about safe distance from the pollution-causing facilities to residential areas. In my opinion, it’s not practical to identify the safe distance based on the pollution levels measured outside the pollution-causing facilities as they could release pollutants into the air differently. The safe distance should be calculated base on dispensability of emissions.

Nguyễn Ngọc Lý , Director of the Centre for Environment and Community Research (CECR), under the Union of Science and Technology of Việt Nam

Article 69 says that cost for solid waste treatment is covered by People’s Committees at all levels. The committees pay those who invest or provide solid waste treatment services. I think that the cost should be paid based on the “polluter pays principle” - a practice that those who produce pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment.

If People’s Committees continue spending public budget to cover waste treatment costs as they do now, we will be far away from implementing the “polluter pays principle” , circular economy and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) - a policy approach under which producers are given a significant responsibility, financial and/or physical, for the treatment or disposal of post-consumer products.

Đỗ Thanh Bái, Chemical Society of Việt Nam

The EPR should be closely integrated with circular economy and import regulations. If we don’t tighten control over importation, we will not solve waste-relating problems in the country, for examples, plastic waste or paper waste.

In List No 6 on the types of activities that are likely to cause pollution, in my opinion, it is necessary to add some types such as hazardous waste treatment, chemical enterprises producing paints, printing ink, solar cells, rechargeable batteries because these are highly polluting activities.

Đỗ Vân Nguyệt, Director/Country Manager at Live & Learn for Environment and Community

According to the experiences of countries around the world, environment monitoring has many different purposes such as education, warning, hotspot detection, and support for state management. Therefore, Articles 101 and 117 need to be clearly divided into subjects – monitoring for State management and monitoring for community purposes. If an organisation conducts an environment monitoring for community purposes, applying the State management process would be unreasonable, unfeasible and unscientific.

We have launched a number of studies by organisations and individuals community to provide community and State bodies with evidence and material for environmental education, research, application of science and technology.

The work promotes people's participation and the private sector in dealing with community issues.

If strict regulations are imposed, they will limit the participation of this group, which goes against the spirit of the Law on Environmental Protection 2020 which advocates for the participation of the entire population in environmental protection. Therefore, we suggest that organisations and individuals need to report to the State management agency about their work and public technical information on environmental monitoring. VNS

HCM CITY — On Sunday, as HCM City announced its plan to extend strict lockdown for another month until September 15, hundreds of migrant workers have packed their bags and personal belongings and rushed to the city's gateways in a bid to leave for their hometowns in the surrounding provinces of Đồng Nai, Bình Thuận, and some central provinces.

Using loudspeakers, police officers at the checkpoints on National Road No 1 struggled to prevent them from leaving the city, urging them not to congregate and telling people to remain where they stay as per the Government's order. The law enforcement and local authorities took note of their information and address to provide support later.

By Sunday noon, many remained at the checkpoints, refusing to return to the places they have been staying in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo

One man named Hoàng from Phú Yên Province told Vietnam News Agency his family has been unemployed due to the outbreak and lockdown measures but has not received any financial support, while the rent and daily expenses have become too much of a burden. He knows he is not supposed to leave on his own personal vehicle out of the city but he has no option.

His story is shared by many others waiting anxiously to return home, afraid they might not be able to go on.

Many provinces have organised 'repatriation' trips (by trains and airplanes) and subsequent centralised quarantine facilities for their people in recent days as the outbreak situation in the southern city worsens, but many others remain behind.

Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính in the decision issued late July on extension of lockdown across 19 southern cities and provinces has asked local authorities to guarantee livelihoods and healthcare of people so they could remain where they are. — VNS

HCM CITY — The Government always gives the highest priority to allocating COVID-19 vaccines to HCM City, said Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam at an online meeting with municipal leaders on COVID-19 prevention and control on Wednesday.

At the meeting, Đam, who is also Head of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, highly valued efforts made by the municipal authorities in the fight against the pandemic, while urging the city to improve the work in the future.

Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Nguyễn Thành Phong said the city has recorded initial positive results in controlling the pandemic as the number of new cases is slowing.

Up to now, nearly 63,000 patients have been given the all-clear from coronavirus, while over 32,600 are under treatment at health facilities in the city, Phong reported.

The city has worked with the Ministry of Health to operate four more intensive care units (ICU) with 1,750 beds while establishing five satellite emergency facilities supporting the city’s 115 Emergency Center.

The city has established a centre to receive and provide essential goods for local residents. It also completed the disbursement of the first support package worth over VNĐ700 billion (US$31 million) for those affected by the pandemic. Another VNĐ900 billion-assistance package is being launched.

He suggested that the Government allocate more vaccines for the city.

Phong also proposed that the Government and the Government's Special Working Group direct localities’ pandemic prevention and control forces at checkpoints to support and create favourable conditions for goods transportation.

He said localities can arrange traffic police and inspectors at these checkpoints to promptly deal with problems and ensure smooth transportation of goods between provinces.

Đam acknowledged the city's important adjustments in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, while asking the municipal authorities to effectively and safely organise goods deliveries, and adjust regulations accordingly.

He said the city needs to consider setting up transshipment delivery points at the district level so that shippers using motorbikes can move within the district. For deliveries between districts, goods can be transported by cars and trucks.

While waiting for general guidance, the city needs to pay attention to and provide credit support to those who are borrowing from banks for daily spending on food and other necessities, the deputy PM noted.

Regarding vaccine supply for the city, he affirmed that HCM City is always given the highest priority in vaccine access, requesting the municipal authorities to prepare for resumption of production and manufacturing once all residents are fully vaccinated.

Apart from accelerating COVID-19 vaccination, the city needs to organise periodic testing for local residents, the Deputy PM said, adding that after the period of social distancing, HCM City should consider gradually re-opening sale points but still ensure safety.

He highly evaluated the municipal authorities’ efforts to provide social security packages for local people, while requesting the city to further speed up COVID-19 testing for drivers. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Government has set a target for HCM City, the epicentre of the current wave of infections, to contain its COVID-19 outbreak by September 15.

Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has just signed Resolution 86 of the Government on the implementation of urgent measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic to implement Resolution 30 of the National Assembly.

According to the resolution , the Government aims for HCM City to control its outbreak before September 15; Bình Dương, Long An, Đồng Nai provinces before September 1; and other localities before August 25.

The resolution said that many agencies, units and localities have not taken serious, decisive or substantive measures in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, while inspection and supervision is still lax in many places.

These include slow responses to the changing situation, slow vaccination rates, lax management of social distancing, as well as congestion in the transport of goods.

The pandemic is still unpredictable, while the supply of vaccines is limited and there is not yet any specific treatment for the virus, so the Government emphasised that pandemic prevention is an urgent task.

The Resolution stipulates urgent and specific solutions to prevent, repel and move towards good control of the pandemic in order to prevent a crisis both in public health and the socio-economic sector.

Regarding the application of urgent measures, the Government assigned local leaders to proactively decide and direct their subordinates to strictly apply solutions corresponding to the level of risk in the spirit of Directive 15, Directive 16 and Directive 19 of the Prime Minister. Based on the actual situation, they may apply these solutions earlier and at higher levels but not later and lower than the provisions in the above documents.

The Government pays special attention to social distancing and other measures in anti-pandemic work that must be strictly implemented from the very beginning, at all levels. Leaders of localities are asked not to procrastinate, hesitate, lack determination or lack responsibility. Instead, they should take the lead, be creative when implementing the task, draw lessons from the work and made quick adjustments when the situation changes.

All localities must strictly implement the motto "go to every alley, knock from door to door, check every person", detect and handle people who come from pandemic-affected areas without declaring and people leaving localities which are applying social distancing without permission.

One of the other urgent solutions proposed by the Government is to allow localities to proactively and flexibly apply necessary measures such as restricting some vehicles or asking people not to leave their homes for a certain period of time.

Speed up testing

Localities need to speed up testing among high-risk groups of people in order to detect new cases as soon as possible, the resolution said. Localities must not miss new F0s and not let them continue to travel and spread the virus further.

For areas with widespread infections such as HCM City and neighbouring provinces, it is necessary to enhance testing, care and treatment, ensuring the maximum reduction in the rate of severe cases, mortality and spread to other areas.

The Ministry of Health is tasked with promptly distributing vaccines to provinces and cities, in which priority is given to densely populated localities, those with many infections and fatalities, as well as any large and crowded urban areas.

The resolution also asked the Ministry of Health to build pandemic response scenarios for all levels, based on which the procurement of equipment and materials can be calculated.

The Ministry of Health, ministries, branches and localities can mobilise public and private health systems and social resources to promptly coordinate in the implementation of COVID-19 prevention, treatment and vaccination.

The Government also requested the Ministry of Finance, ministries, branches and localities to prioritise the arrangement and allocation of the state budget and other lawful resources to ensure funding for the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control work.

The Government requested the cutting of at least 50 per cent of spending on conferences, travelling expenses of ministries, central agencies and localities (except for the expenses of important and urgent activities and to serve the pandemic prevention and control work). — VNS

HCM CITY — Việt Nam, especially the current hotspot HCM City, needs to maintain stringent social distancing measures and stress that each individual and family plays a decisive role in reducing infection chains, overseas-Vietnamese experts said at a webinar on Thursday.

Dr Vũ Ngọc Khuê, a Vietnamese-American, said the country’s pandemic epicentre should be able to contain the latest outbreak that began in late April within the next four weeks.

“Four weeks would be enough for the city to contain the spread. The first two weeks will detect symptomatic FO (COVID patients) cases for quarantine, while the next two weeks will detect cases that have had longer incubation periods” and may not be showing symptoms, he added.

Severe cases will need more time for treatment and recovery in a hospital or at isolation facilities, he said, adding that the city should focus on critically ill patients to minimise the number of deaths.

In addition to having medical staff fully equipped with proper equipment, all resources including military forces should be mobilised for the fight.

Trần Trọng Hùng, a Vietnamese-Polish man who is vice chairman of the Vietnamese Community in Poland, said that the COVID-19 Prevention and Support Committee in Poland developed a COVID-19 prevention manual, stressing the role of each individual and each family.

All people, including those fully vaccinated, must strictly implement measures such as hand washing, keeping a distance, wearing a mask, and limiting gatherings. People should contact medical staff immediately to have a COVID test when they have symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or headache.

To quickly recover, you should practise breathing exercises to support the lungs, and keep a thermometer, blood pressure monitor and oximeter at home.

Testing is key

Experts said that even with the promising prospects of COVID vaccinations, it will take some time for vaccines to be delivered to the general population.

The surge of the more transmissible Delta variant has made testing more vital, even among vaccinated people. Testing, tracking, tracing and isolating quickly, massively and smartly are all needed to prevent future rebounds of infections following social distancing measures.

Dr. Nguyễn Đức Thái, a Vietnamese-American and co-founder of TransMed-VN forum, said that Việt Nam has conducted three main kinds of testing. The first is an antibody or serology test, a blood test that looks for signs of a previous infection to help understand the pervasiveness of the disease in communities.

The second is a rapid antigen test, which can deliver results in less than 15 minutes, a less accurate alternative but one that is very good at identifying when people are infectious. The third is the more accurate PCR tests, which requires a laboratory, according to Thái.

With the delta variant surging throughout the world, more testing is paramount.

Dr Thái said the city could use a highly sensitive and cost-effective test that uses artificial intelligence to detect pathogens (called AIMS RT-PCR technology) as recommended by Dr. Hồ Hữu Thọ of the Hà Nội Military Medical Academy.

The test, which can take a pooling sample of 100, is very accurate and suitable for large-scale testing or city-wide testing, he noted.

Japanese-Vietnamese Trần Ngọc Phúc, president of the Japanese medical equipment firm Metran, and chairman of the Association of Vietnamese in Japan, said the city should buy low-cost ventilators that are easy to use so that doctors at all levels can safely use them.

The city should also buy more CPAP machines, oxygen generators and saturation oximeters to meet the needs of patients treated at home to reduce the transfer of patients to hospitals, he added.

An online monitoring system for patients with unstable medical conditions could be used, and mobile medical teams should be set up to better diagnose and take care of patients at home.

Dr. Võ Toàn Trung, Vietnamese-French, said the city needed to prepare for a worst-case scenario, especially if the rate of positive cases exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system.

Dương Anh Đức, vice chairman of the People’s Committee, said the city would consider all of the recommendations and expressed gratitude to overseas Vietnamese, including those at home and abroad, for providing medical equipment and essential items.

After successfully containing the virus in 2020 and early this year, the country now faces a serious outbreak, with HCM City and southern provinces accounting for most new infections. HCM City, the largest hotspot, has recorded more than 137,000 cases since the beginning of the fourth wave in late April.

Việt Nam recorded 9,667 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday and a further 326 people died of COVID. The new cases take the total number of infections to 246,568 and the total number of deaths to 4,813.

The country has administered 12,098,821 doses of vaccines. A total of 1,092,700 people have received two doses.

The webinar was organised by the State Committee for Overseas Vietnamese Affairs under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Overseas Vietnamese in HCM City. — VNS

CHÀM ISLANDS — Experts from the Chàm Island Maritime Protected Area (MPA) and Hội An are looking to drive monkeys back to the forest after the animals broke into houses.

The macaques were searching for food along Bãi Làng and Bãi Xếp beaches on the Islands.

Authorities said dozens of monkeys left the forest and entered homes in the area.

The animals were found getting closer to living areas in the last three years, with more visits since social distancing measures were implemented from late April.

Chairwoman of the islands’ people’s committee, Phạm Thị Mỹ Hương, said the monkeys didn't seem to be scared off by people.

She said monkeys broke into houses to get rice and food in the kitchen and fruit from the gardens.

She said residents reported that some monkeys even took a rice cooker.

Hương said islanders were warned not to harm the monkeys as the Chàm Islands are part of a protected biosphere site.

Residents were told to lock doors, gates and gardens, as well as install fences and shutters on windows.

Huỳnh Thị Thùy Hương from the Chàm Island Maritime Protected Area (MPA) said the incidents result from the rapid growth of the monkey population and limited food supply in recent years.

She said monkeys have become familiar with food given by tourists visiting the islands, and now they climb down the mountain in search of sustenance from travellers and residents.

Hương said MPA and the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation Research GreenViet have been working to protect endangered flora and fauna on the islands as well as primates.

Director of GreenViet, Trần Hữu Vỹ, said the group has been tracking the habitat and population of the monkeys and food chains in forests on Chàm Islands to limit risks of conflict with humans.

He said social distancing orders due to COVID-19 delayed field surveys and trips among conservationists.

Some residents attempted to drive the animals away by banging on metal pots, but they are warned to keep a distance so as to avoid being bitten or attacked, Hương said.

Islanders were warned not to feed monkeys fruit, snacks or bread.

She said Bãi Xếp Beach – at the foot of the mountain and nearest to forest – saw a gathering of 15 monkeys.

According to the latest report by GreenViet, at least eight groups of Rhesus macaques with nearly 90 individuals have been found living in the forests on the hills of the islands.

Chàm Islands-Hội An (including the total area of the Islands’ land and water and Hội An), which was recognised as a World Biosphere Reserve in 2009, 20km off the coast of Hội An, covers more than 33,000ha, including 1,500ha of tropical forests and 6,700ha of sea, featuring a wide range of marine fauna and flora.

The islands and buffer zones hosted around 1.5 million tourists per year, but the COVID-19 pandemic damaged the prosperous tourism growth on the islands and Hội An in 2020-21.

However, experts from the MPA said reduced tourism activities and waste around the Chàm Islands – a world biodiversity reserve site – would help the marine ecosystem in waters off the islands recover following an ecological system and coral reefs programme in 2020-21. — VNS

AN GIANG – The Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province of An Giang is facing an increase in erosion incidents along rivers and canals as authorities try to protect households living in erosion-prone areas.

On July 21, erosion 110 metres long and 8 – 10 metres inland caused damage to a road and 14 houses at an embankment in Châu Phú District’s Bình Long Commune.

The weak foundations of the embankment and the road, the heavy travel of boats and road vehicles, and the impact of the river flow and rainwater led to the erosion, according to the province’s Steering Committee for Climate Change Response, Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, and Search and Rescue.

On July 20, an area 45 metres long and 4.5 metres wide eroded along the Cái Sắn Canal in Long Xuyên City, causing partial damage to two houses and the collapse of two houses into the canal.

All road travel was suspended at the site. The eroded area is along a bend of the canal which has a high number of boats in transit that cause strong waves hitting the canal banks.

Lương Huy Khánh, head of the steering committee, said that the province People’s Committee, relevant departments and agencies, and local authorities in Long Xuyên City and Châu Phú District inspected the two eroded sites and proposed measures to prevent further erosion.

Long Xuyên City and Châu Phú District have encouraged households living near the two eroded sites to move their property to safe areas. Warning boards were installed in the area and staffs are monitoring the eroded sites.

The province's Department of Natural Resources and Environment is also checking the situation to resolve the matter.

In the first half of the year, An Giang had 12 erosion incidents, with a total length of nearly 800 metres, along rivers and canals, forcing eight households to move to safe areas.

In June alone, the province had seven erosion cases. The province People’s Committee declared an emergency at Châu Đốc River in An Phú Town after erosion of the eastern riverbank in An Thạnh Hamlet damaged houses and threatened the safety of locals.

Local authorities were told to take protective measures in high-risk erosion-prone areas and areas along rivers and canals that are illegally encroached upon to build houses and other projects.

The province has 52 erosion-prone areas, including six dangerous ones, according to its Department of Natural Resources and Resources. Nearly 20,000 households near the 52 areas need to be moved to safe areas.

Trần Anh Thư, vice chairman of the province People’s Committee, said the central government has offered financial support for erosion control along large rivers like Tiền, Hậu and Vàm Nao.

The province said it would solve erosion along large rivers by 2025.

It will also relocate households living in high-risk erosion-prone areas to safe areas, including seven residential clusters. – VNS

By Lương Thu Hương

A series of paintings depicting the experience of a young freelance illustrator receiving the coronavirus vaccine has recently gone viral on Vietnamese social media.

Only one day after being posted on her Nguyễn Vũ Xuân Lan’s Facebook page, the series Nhật Ký Đi Tiêm (COVID-19 Vaccination Diary) received over 5,000 likes and nearly 1,000 shares.

It has also been shared on the Facebook of UNICEF Việt Nam where it garnered over 79,000 likes after just two days.

COVID-19 Vaccination Diary is effectively a short comic book including 18 paintings. Each sketch details the process of a girl, presumably the painter herself, as she goes through the various stages of the inoculation, from registering and being notified via text message of the time and place of injection, through to being screened and injected, and finally being consulted on how to rest and stay healthy at home after the jab.

The picture diary is a string of cute drawings accompanied by simple but humorous dialogue.

Nguyễn Vũ Xuân Lan came up with the idea of the COVID-19 Vaccination Diary after returning home from being vaccinated on July 30.

“Before that, I used to feel doubts about the vaccination due to much conflicting information related to it, about anaphylaxis or the huge crowds waiting for injections in the hospital,” Lan said.

“However, my experience was surprisingly smooth and pleasant. Feeling safe and happy back home, I wanted to share this first-hand experience so that everyone can better understand the vaccination process and be less bewildered. I also hope that it would partly encourage others to get the injections.”

The 32-year-old freelance illustrator said that she finished the picture diary within four days of getting the injection.

“I started to have a fever while drawing so I had to take a day off. When my fever came down and I regained my composure, I continued to draw,” she said.

COVID-19 Vaccination Diary aims to record a life memory of the painter, but on receiving a vast array of positive comments, she realised that it has done much more.

“My series of paintings has offered a more positive view of the vaccination and answered a few frequently asked questions, so I feel like I have been contributing a small part to the fight against the pandemic,” she said.

The diary is not Lan’s first work related to the pandemic. Previously she created a series of paintings of small children going to quarantine during the pandemic, which attracted over 12,000 likes and hundreds of comments.

A picture within Lan's series of paintings about little children going to quarantine during the pandemic.

On her Facebook page named X.Lan, the illustrator captioned the photo album: "Drawing some cute moments to relieve stress during the pandemic."

Lecturer turns illustrator

Lan currently works as a freelance illustrator. Her work revolves around drawing and illustrating brands, advertising articles, books, teaching drawing for adults and creating graphics.

However, she was not officially trained in the arts and is a graduate of the University of Languages and International Studies at Việt Nam National University where she worked as an English lecturer.

“In 2013, while still an English lecturer, I used to make random drawings or short comics during my free time and uploaded them to my Facebook. Some of them went viral and I started to be noticed, which made me happy to keep drawing for the next few years,” said Lan.

“In 2016, I realised I wanted to take drawing more seriously so I decided to take a year off from teaching. I didn't think I would make a living from drawing. It was just because I liked it enough to spend time being serious about it. I thought that it was just a year and if I didn’t try, I would regret it later. If it didn't work out, it would not be too late to resume teaching. However, I was so satisfied that I never went back to teaching."

Lan’s paintings mostly revolve around her personal life, depicting small but memorable moments that she encounters each day.

“I observe and take notes a lot so there is always an abundance of ideas in my mind waiting to be drawn,” she said.

On her personal page, Lan describes herself simply: “I'm not good with words, so I draw to tell my stories.”

Since embarking on her new path, Lan cannot remember how many art projects she has been involved in. Some highlights include drawing illustrations for a book, entitled 199 mấy Hồi Ấy Làm Gì (What Were You Doing in the 1990s), a series of pictures on the issue of gender violence for CARE Vietnam, and the cartoon Kindness is Contagious for UNICEF.

The contents of Lan’s paintings mostly revolve around her personal life, depicting small but memorable moments that she encounters every day.

One of her most unforgettable memories as a freelance illustrator was receiving a request to draw the steps for wearing personal protective equipment. The pictures were to be presented to medical workers at Bạch Mai Hospital, and the client seemed to be the owner of a printing shop for hospitals.

“I drew the pictures very quickly so that he could present them to the doctors in time. The drawing process helped me to understand how hard it was for the medical staff, as using a protective suit involves dozens of steps, each of which demands proper disinfection, Lan said.

“The complete suit is enough to keep them safe from the virus and consists of many layers, but the doctors have to suffer from great heat and exhaustion.

"Sadly, the pictures still have not been presented to the doctors because the client contracted the virus and been taken to hospital for treatment."

Lan revealed that she would continue to draw and share any interesting experiences she encounters during this unforgettable global health crisis.

“I hope everyone will find moral support and comfort during these difficult days,” she said. VNS

BÌNH DƯƠNG— Bình Dương Emergency Resuscitation Field Hospital, specialising in treating patients with severe COVID-19, has been put into operation on Thursday in the southern province of Bình Dương’s Thuận An District.

The field hospital, with a total of 437 beds, was built inside the Becamex International General Hospital in just six days, to treat COVID-19 patients in the province.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the field hospital on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn said the field hospital was built thanks to the great efforts of local authorities as well as the support of both human resources and medical equipment from the Government and Hà Nội Medical University Hospital.

Sơn also said when the number of COVID-19 patients increased very quickly in the province, with many severe cases, the local authorities proposed the ministry set up the field hospital.

Associate Professor Nguyễn Lân Hiếu, director of Hà Nội Medical University Hospital, who was recently assigned to be the head of the field hospital, said it was implemented very quickly thanks to requisition of the available facilities and modern machinery from Becamex International General Hospital.

We are now focused on upgrading rooms to increase the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and preparing oxygen and compressed air, ventilators and dialysis machines, he added.

The field hospital could conduct ECMO techniques to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, he said.

The field hospital includes medical staff of Hà Nội Medical University Hospital, Becamex International General Hospital, Bình Dương General Hospital and teams of doctors and nurses from many localities, especially from the northern provinces, he said.

Võ Văn Minh, chairman of the People’s Committee of Bình Dương Province, said at the opening ceremony of the field hospital that he thanked the health ministry, Associate Professor Nguyễn Lân Hiếu as well as all medical staff.

Minh also said he hoped all doctors and medical staff of the field hospital would overcome difficulties and improve the efficiency of treatment for COVID-19 patients.

BẾN TRE – The Bến Tre Province People’s Committee plans to build two embankments to prevent river erosion in Bến Tre City and coastal erosion in Thạnh Phú District this year.

The two will cost a total of VNĐ110 billion (US$4.8 million), which will be provided by the Government.

One will be a submerged 688.9-metre dyke to prevent coastal erosion on Cồn Lợi Island and the other a 692-long one along the Bến Tre River in the namesake city’s Nhơn Trạch Commune.

They are meant to protect people’s lives and properties and public infrastructure in the two areas that have already suffered from erosion.

The People’s Committee has tasked the Steering Committee for Managing Agriculture and Rural Development Projects with carrying out the two works.

It has ordered the Bến Tre City and Thạnh Phú District people’s committees to acquire the lands required for the dykes and relocate households affected by the construction.

The Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province has seen around 114.5km of river banks and 19km of coast affected by erosion in the last five years, affecting hundreds of households and resulting in 200ha of coastal land and 54ha of mangrove forests being lost.

In 2019 – 20 the province People’s Committee declared an erosion emergency in Ba Tri, Bình Đại and Thạnh Phú districts and Bến Tre City where a combined length of 6.9 kilometres was affected.

To mitigate further erosion, it will strengthen advocacy to enhance public awareness of the prevention of erosion along rivers and coasts.

Relevant departments and agencies will monitor areas facing high erosion risks to enable timely preventive measures.

They will make plans to dismantle and move houses and other constructions out of eroded and erosion – prone areas and relocate affected households.

The province has 112 eroded spots along rivers and eight along coasts, according to its Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

It is seeking funds from the Government for five erosion-prevention works in Bình Đại, Ba Tri, Mỏ Cày Nam, and Chợ Lách districts. – VNS

PLZEŇ The daily life of Vietnamese families in the Czech Republic is featured at an exhibition in Plzeň City that is located nearly 80km from Prague.

Vietnam Stories, the name of the exhibition, showcases 50 photos by Czech photographer and teacher Jindřich Štreit, who is considered one of the most important exponents of Czech documentary photography.

It is jointly organised by the City Council in collaboration with the Vietnamese association in Plzeň.

Vietnam Stories also features traditional Vietnamese customs and habits that are still preserved and practised in the Czech Republic, such as national holidays, birthdays, weddings and death anniversaries.

Speaking at the opening of the exhibition, Štreit said that he had researched and integrated into the Vietnamese community to capture the most authentic angles of their life for the photo collection.

“I personally have a very good relationship with the Vietnamese community in North Morava and they themselves, especially young people, have enthusiastically helped me to make this meaningful series of photos,” the 75-year-old photographer said.

According to Eliška Bartáková, Deputy Mayor of Plzeň City, the Vietnamese community has been in the Czech Republic for three generations and is integrating very well into Czech society.

“Vietnamese people obey the law, study hard, run businesses and make many positive contributions to society. It is perfectly fine and normal for two peoples of the Czech Republic and Việt Nam to harmoniously live and develop together in the country.”

Dr Nguyễn Duy Nhiên, Chairman of the Vietnamese Association in the Czech Republic, said the association greatly appreciates the photos capturing the life of the Vietnamese community by photographer Štreit.

He added that Vietnam Stories would help to enhance the friendship and relations between the two nations.

A visitor to the exhibition and photography enthusiast, Vojtěch Štajek, recalled that the number of Vietnamese people coming to the Czech Republic has increased significantly since the 1990s.

There used to be many differences in lifestyle and perception between the Czech and Vietnamese communities. At first, Czech people were amazed at the Vietnamese unyielding struggle and hard-working manner, he said.

“However, over time, it was that strong will of the Vietnamese people and their positive contributions to society that have convinced the Czech people, so today the Vietnamese community has truly integrated and lives in harmony with all other ethnic groups in the Czech Republic.

“We really consider the Vietnamese as our people. The photos displayed at this exhibition have accurately reflected their life that I witness every day,” he added.

According to Nguyễn Hoài Thanh, Chairman of the Vietnamese Association in Plzeň, the community of over 6,000 Vietnamese living in this city wholeheartedly supports the exhibition, expecting that Vietnam Stories will help Czech people better understand the customs and habits of Vietnamese people.

Vietnam Stories will last until August 27.

Jindřich Štreit, born September 5, 1946 in Vsetín, is a Czech photographer and teacher known for his documentary photography. He concentrates on documenting the rural life and people of Czech villages.

The photographer began taking photographs in 1964, during his studies at the Pedagogical Faculty of Palacký University in Olomouc. VNS

NINH THUẬN – The south-central province of Ninh Thuận is taking measures to increase the number of its products made under the country’s ‘one commune – one product’ programme.

OCOP includes commercial products and services like food, beverages, handicrafts, and rural tourism services, which are rated up to a highest of five stars.

Lê Huyền, deputy chairman of the province People’s Committee, said to develop OCOP products, Ninh Thuận was enabling co-operatives and production establishments to participate in the programme.

It was providing them with machinery and facilities, helping develop production linkages between stakeholders and raw material growing areas, training human resources, and carrying out trade promotion activities for OCOP products, he said.

It would promote the sales of these products through modern distribution channels like supermarkets and e-commerce platforms, he said.

Producers would get help in using advanced technologies to improve quality and value, with competent agencies overseeing quality from production to sales, he said.

The province has had 69 OCOP products, including 10 four – star and 51 three - star products as of last year including honeydew melon, jujube, grapefruit, Cà Ná fish sauce, aloe vera products, garlic, and red onion.

These have not only helped improve the value of the province’s agriculture production and rural economy but also promoted its brands, according to the People’s Committee.

The products are in high demand both inside and outside the province.

The Thái Thuận – Ninh Thuận Manufacture and Trading Agricultural Company Limited in Ninh Sơn District’s Nhơn Sơn Commune produces 10 OCOP products, including grape and jujube.

Nguyễn Đình Quang, its director, said through local and central government support policies, the company had developed production linkages for its grape and jujube products.

In early July it began selling its four-star green grapes on e-commerce platform sendo.vn, he said.

“The company will also sell grapes and jujube products on other e-commerce platforms. This will help sell them more conveniently and maintain the production and value of agricultural products during the COVID – 19 pandemic.”

The province is spending more than VNĐ6.1 billion (US$266,000) this year to develop 20 – 30 new OCOP products.

Đặng Kim Cương, director of its Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said this year the province would also upgrade the quality levels of its existing products.

The province has 38 products, including specifically identified ones, that can be developed into OCOP items, according to a steering board tasked with developing them.

Ninh Thuận, which has the lowest rainfall in the country, has 12 specifically identified products, including asparagus, sheep, goat, Mỹ Nghiệp brocade, and Bàu Trúc pottery.

Its asparagus, for instance, enjoys great demand and stable prices even amid the pandemic.

The province has more than 200ha under asparagus, mostly in Ninh Phước, Ninh Hải, Thuận Bắc, and Ninh Sơn districts and Phan Rang – Tháp Chàm City.

Ninh Thuận is the country’s largest producer of asparagus, grape, jujube, sheep, and goat as its weather and soil are ideal for them.

Along with tourism

The province is promoting OCOP products together with tourism.

Its Department of Industry and Trade is showcasing the province’s OCOP products at six popular tourism destinations including the Vĩnh Hy and Hang Rái tourism areas and the tourism night market.

Last year it organised two fairs to introduce the products and two conferences to discuss linking up with buyers in Bình Thuận and Lâm Đồng provinces and HCM City.

The province also subsidised 50 companies that participated in eight trade fairs held locally and in other provinces and cities last year. – VNS

HCM CITY — HCM City is set to extend lockdown measures until September 15, the date set by the Government for the southern city to have its severe COVID-19 outbreaks under control, the city's officials have said.

“The situation is complicated and can last for a long time, the number of cases tends to decrease but the number of deaths is still high,” Vice Chairman of HCM City People’s Committee Dương Anh Đức said on Friday at the daily press briefing.

From August 5, on average, the city recorded 3,687 cases a day, of which 78.6 per cent were in locked down areas, 2.3 per cent in quarantined areas, 17.7 per cent via screening tests at hospitals.

The city currently has 1,558 critical patients, and 16 on ECMO. As many as 10,421 are asymptomatic and being treated at home. More than 12,000 patients have been treated for more than seven days and are recovering.

“The most worrying problem is the high death rate, at about 241 deaths a day.”

Thus, the city now focuses on improving treatment efficacy, with the highest goal being reducing the number of deaths in 22 localities in the city.

It is forecast that after August 15, the number of cases will still be around 3,000 a day.

“Therefore, if we do not drastically implement strong anti-pandemic measures, it will be difficult to maintain the results, and the situation may even get worse,” Đức said.

Phan Văn Mãi, deputy secretary of the city Party Committee, said the city would strengthen measures from August 15 to September 15, divided into two phases - from August 15 to August 31 and from August 31 to September 15. Specific measures have been determined for each phase.

It is expected that on August 15, the city will announce the details of the plan, with strict social distancing measures according to the Government’s Directive 16 continuing.

Sinopharm vaccine

Vice Chairman Đức said that the city’s Department of Health on Friday started to administer the batch of one million doses of Sinopharm's Vero Cell COVID-19 vaccine to its residents.

This batch of vaccines had undergone quality controls and approved by the Ministry of Health, Đức said at a press conference providing updates about anti-pandemic activities in HCM City Friday morning.

Đức said currently the supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to Việt Nam remained very limited. In August and September, about three million doses were expected to be delivered, among which the allocation to HCM City would not be sufficient since many provinces and cities were also facing similar scarcity.

Therefore, in August, in HCM City, "the best is what we have at the moment”, he said.

The city would administer vaccinations, ensuring all vaccines are qualified and licensed by WHO and the Ministry of Health. People must be aware of their own health and act together with the community to contribute to improving the city's anti-pandemic efforts, he said.

With current resources, HCM City can inject 350,000 shots per day or more.

Currently, HCM City has five million doses of Sinopharm's Vero Cell vaccine, and is trying to bring five more million doses of Moderna by the end of this year.

Regarding the five million Moderna vaccine doses, Đức said the vaccination was completely non-profit, coming from the donations of businesses, who wanted to ensure vaccine coverage for its employees, then support the city in injections for priority groups.

Đức emphasised that the city organised vaccination for all people, and treated all qualified vaccines equally. — VNS

HCM CITY — A total of 85,608 people in HCM City were vaccinated with Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) on Saturday, the municipal Department of Health announced on Sunday.

The doses used are part of the first shipment of 1 million doses of the Chinese vaccine that were imported by HCM City-based Sapharco under the sponsorship of the private group Vạn Thịnh Phát and delivered to the southern city last month.

Another one million doses of the 5-million-doses contract arrived at Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport on Saturday, pending quality controls before being administered.

The department also said that two districts including Phú Nhuận and Cần Giờ had completed the first dose vaccination for people over 18 years old. Specifically, Phú Nhuận District has a vaccination rate of 152,387 out of 163,961 people, reaching 92.94 per cent of the population. Cần Giờ District has vaccinated 54,130 people, reaching 97.3 per cent. The district has more than 71,000 people, of which those over 18 years old number more than 59,000.

Trần Thị Xuân Hải and her son had the vaccination at the An Hội Primary School in Gò Vấp District in an excited mood.

"Before getting the injection, I was told that I was to be vaccinated with Vero Cell vaccine, but I was not worried. I think any type of vaccine is fine as long as the disease could be prevented, and the sooner is the better. The doctor here enthusiastically consulted us about the vaccination and I felt even more reassured. After the injection, I feel that I am still healthy," said Hải.

People fill in their personal information and sign to agree to receive the vaccine.

Nguyễn Công Sơn, 55, in Gò Vấp District, said he was advised by the medical staff about the type of vaccine being injected. Believing in the State, he did not hesitate and signed to agree to receive the Vero Cell vaccine.

Nguyễn Hồng Lâm, deputy chairman of the Ward 12 People’s Committee in Gò Vấp District, said the ward had given clear information about the vaccine and injection work to local residents.

All of the injection sites were organised well to ensure security and preventive measures.

HCM City's officials have said that the injection of the vaccines are voluntary and all vaccination sites communicate clearly with the people about the vaccine being offered, amid some hesitancy against the Chinese vaccine, despite it having been approved by WHO and the Vietnamese health ministry.

On Friday, for example, a video clip circulating online showed people leaving a vaccination site on Huyền Trân Công Chúa Street, District 1, HCM City, after being told by health workers that AstraZeneca vaccines had run out and only Sinopharm vaccines were left, on the first day of the 1 million shipment being rolled out. HCM City's representative said they are aware of the incident but the administration of Chinese vaccine still continued at the site throughout the day.

17,916 doses of Sinopharm's vaccine were administered on Friday, according to the city's health authorities.

To date, Việt Nam has received 2.5 million doses of Sinopharm vaccines, with the 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government in June reserved for people in border areas neighbouring China, Chinese nationals in Việt Nam, and people who wish to go to China for trade, studying or work, as well as those who have the need for the vaccine.

HCM City is currently the biggest COVID-19 hot spots with healthcare system straining to deal with the large caseload, and amid global shortage, the city is quickly running out of vaccines to give to its residents.

Việt Nam currently relies mostly on Western vaccines, primarily AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, in its mass vaccination drive. — VNS

There is a significant increase in plastic and medical wastes in the city amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which is piling pressure on its ability to handle them. Photo: nld.com.vn

HCM CITY - The surge in plastic and coronavirus-related wastes in HCM City is creating huge pressure on its waste treatment system.

The HCM City Urban Environment Company Limited (CITENCO) collects and treats all wastes from hospitals and quarantine facilities.

Cao Văn Tuấn, head of its environmental technology and quality control department, said the daily medical waste output had increased to nearly 40 tonnes a day, including 12 tonnes from quarantine zones, since the outbreak, and the treatment capacity is 42 tonnes.

If coronavirus-related waste continues to grow, it would lead to an overload at the treatment plant, according to Tuấn.

Besides having equipment prescribed for handling hazardous wastes, they also need to safeguard people handling the wastes.

Wastes from locked-down areas are mainly collected by local authorities who spray them with disinfectants before sending to trash dumps.

With social distancing in place the volume of goods packaged and delivered to consumers’ homes and the use of plastic bags have increased exponentially.

According to Nguyễn Gia Thanh, an online seller in Tân Bình District, he has to use six kilogrammes of plastic bags a month for packaging now, twice the usual rate.

Customers want goods to be covered with more plastic bags as a virus prevention measure.

“Plastic is the most economical solution for a hard situation despite its negative impact on the environment,” he said.

Nguyễn Văn Tốt, a garbage collector in Hóc Môn District, said while normally plastic accounted for 50 per cent of the garbage, it had now increased to 60-65 per cent.

Wastes are now mainly in landfills and plastic wastes, though increasing, are not being sorted, and this portends serious harm to the environment.

More companies needed to treat COVID-related waste

The HCM City Department of Natural Resources and Environment is seeking approval from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to add more companies capable of receiving and treating COVID-19-related waste.

Nguyễn Thị Thanh Mỹ, deputy director of the city department, said the list of added businesses included Việt Úc Environment JSC, Mộc An Châu Company, Saigon Green Biotechnology Company and Tâm Sinh Nghĩa Investment Development JSC.

These companies had invested in industrial waste and hazardous-waste incinerators, but they were still in the testing phase. But due to the growing coronavirus-related waste in the city, the department asked the ministry to approve the use of these companies' waste incinerators to treat waste related to Covid-19.

CITENCO is currently the only company that receives and treats Covid-19 related waste in HCM City.

According to CITENCO, the amount of garbage in quarantine areas and field hospitals is nearly 100 tonnes per day, exceeding its processing capacity.

Huỳnh Minh Nhựt, director of CITENCO, said the process of collecting and treating medical waste and waste from isolation areas was being carried out under strict safety standards, and garbage collection workers all wear protective gear.

Medical waste is taken to Đông Thạnh waste treatment zone in Hóc Môn District where it undergoes chemical and thermal disinfection. After the trash is burned, the ash is solidified and buried in a location reserved for hazardous waste.

Other waste, such as face masks and protective clothing, is treated separately according to regulations, while the rest can be sent to landfills to be treated by incineration and burial. VNS

Doctor Trần Danh Cường, director of the National Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology talked to Sức khỏe & Đời sống (Health & Life) newspaper about COVID-19 vaccinations for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

Is COVID-19 dangerous to pregnant women? Do they face more risk of catching it than others?

Studies conducted all over the world show that pregnant women face the same risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 as other people.

However, once catching the virus, pregnant women are vulnerable because, during pregnancy, a woman's immune system can be weakened.

During pregnancy the pregnant woman's uterus will be larger, pushing the diaphragm up and making the lung capacity low, which obstructs their breathing. So, the oxygen demand of pregnant women is higher than that of normal people.

As pregnancy progresses, fluid may accumulate in tissues, usually in the feet, ankles, and legs, causing them to swell and appear puffy. This condition is called edema. The edema is also seen in the upper respiratory tract mucosa, which easily causes damage to the upper respiratory tract. If infected with COVID-19, the pregnant women are more at risk.

Underlying health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, chronic lung disease will also cause complications during pregnancy.

Together with the above factors, if pregnant women get COVID-19, they will face a high risk of serious complications which require intensive care, ventilators and ECMO.

Vaccinating pregnant women against COVID-19 is very important.

Is the COVID-19 vaccination safe for pregnant women?

When a pregnant woman catches SARS-CoV-2, two of the most common issues are if the virus goes to the fetus and if the unborn child catches COVID-19.

When we tested amniotic fluid samples from pregnant women after giving birth, blood samples from the umbilical vein and throat fluid samples from the mother and the pathology of the placenta, scientists did not detect any SARS-CoV-2 virus in the samples.

This confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not enter the amniotic cavity where the baby grows.

Normally, in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the exchange between the mother and the fetus is modest, so the risk of transmitting of SARS-CoV-2 virus from mother to child is very low.

However, if an infection occurs at this stage, the risk to the baby is great and can potentially cause abnormalities in the fetus because this is the period of formation and development of the important organs of the fetus.

In the next stage, the possibility of infection between mother and child is very strong, but the risk of causing birth defects is lower because important organs of the fetus have already formed.

According to the latest COVID-19 vaccination guidelines of Việt Nam’s health ministry, pregnant women at 13 weeks and more can get COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccination for the mothers will help produce antibodies against the COVID-19, their babies may benefit from vaccine antibodies that pass through the placenta.

I think that the ministry’s guideline is reasonable using scientific proof ensuring safety for both mothers and their children. The benefits of the vaccination are much more when compared with the risks it might bring.

If the COVID-19 vaccination is taken by breastfeeding mothers, will it affect their babies?

Studies show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not spread through breastfeeding. So, if having the COVID-19, breastfeeding mothers still can breastfeed their babies as long as they strictly take anti-infection measures.

What should pregnant or breastfeeding women do before and after they get COVID-19 vaccines?

The COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women is necessary to protect them from the SARS-CoV-2.

Before getting a COVID-19 vaccine shot, pregnant women need a medical check to identify the health conditions of them and their babies.

Pregnant women with underlying health conditions need more careful medical checks. I think that only those with risks of preeclampsia, placental abruption and other serious obstetric complications should delay the COVID-19 vaccination.

As a medical facility assigned by the Ministry of Health to take care of and protect the health of pregnant and postpartum women, my hospital has prepared all necessary elements to vaccinate pregnant women after 13 weeks and breastfeeding mothers. VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@IT applications, including portals and apps, help speed up the nationwide vaccination campaign, increase its transparency and supporting the management of COVID-19 vaccinations in Việt Nam. — VNA/VNS Photo Minh Sơn

HCM CITY — The Ministry of Information and Communications and Ministry of Health has called on localities to take full advantage of information and technology to administer vaccinations rapidly and effectively.

Speaking at an online conference on IT applications in COVID-19 prevention and control, Đỗ Công Anh, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Information and Communications Department of Informatisation emphasised that utilising IT in the vaccination campaign would ensure the campaign’s transparency.

Four vaccination management platforms have been built by the military-run telecom group Viettel under the guidelines of the two ministries, including the electronic health record app, a portal for COVID immunisation information at tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn/portal, a system supporting national vaccination at tiemchungcovid19.moh.gov.vn, and an MCC Centre, with its database to be managed centrally and transparently.

The databases of these platforms are strictly managed, ensuring transparency of information for both people and State management agencies. The vaccination management system has been implemented in five steps from vaccination registration to post-vaccination monitoring.

People can register to get a COVID-19 vaccine via the e-health record application and immunisation information portal. After receiving the information, departments of health in specific areas will guide people to vaccination sites.

The health departments will be in charge of allocating vaccines to vaccination sites. After being vaccinated, people can track their vaccination records via the two platforms.

The data will be centrally managed on the national COVID-19 vaccination management platform and will support the National Immunisation Steering Committee to monitor vaccination results and manage the entire nationwide vaccination campaign.

Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Huy Dũng said the vaccination management platform was capable of managing vaccines from their arrival in Việt Nam, to their storage, distribution, and shipping to vaccination sites and to the point of injection. Each dose, each batch, each type of vaccine has been tightly managed at each vaccination site.

"The IT application will help us deploy the vaccination campaign more rapidly and conveniently,” he said.

Võ Thị Trung Trinh, Deputy Director of the HCM City’s Department of Information and Communications said the application of the national vaccination management platform in the fifth phase of the city-wide vaccination campaign has increased the number of vaccinated people to 930,230 after 10 days.

"In the fifth phase, the vaccination programme has accelerated very quickly. In the first days there were only a few thousand injections per day. But the number has reached over 100,000 per day in recent days,” she said.

Trinh also said the department had suggested measures to deal with unexpected situations that arise in different localities.

In addition, the city also recommended the department send IT staff to standardise vaccination registration data and ensure the apps were being used effectively.

The department will make a list of people that need to be vaccinated on the national immunisation portal and e-health book app and use pandemic data to point out the hot spots where rapid vaccination is needed.

Anh confirmed the practice of using the IT applications in HCM City was a valuable test case for expanding the technology nationwide.

He has asked the departments of health and information and communications to register for vaccination via the e-health record application or immunisation information portal tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn.

All vaccination sites, including mobile ones, must be connected to the internet. Technological systems and platforms related to COVID-19 vaccination would be further upgraded, he said. — VNS

HCM CITY Two Vietnamese films by Marcus Mạnh Cường Vũ and Nguyễn Phan Linh Đan have been included at the Busan Film Festival, while the new horror movie by Lê Bình Giang has been introduced at the Locarno Film Festival.

The Asian Project Market (APM) at the Busan Film Festival, which recently announced 26 films participating this year, will take place from October 12-14 within the framework of the Busan International Film Festival 2021 in South Korea.

Among 26 films participating in APM, two are Vietnamese movies, including Memento Mori: Water from director Vũ and producers Nguyễn Hoàng Điệp and Nguyễn Trinh Hoan, and the film If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood from director Đan and producer Ngô Thị Bích Hạnh.

Memento Mori: Water is the second movie in the Memento Mori the Movie trilogy, written and directed by Vũ since 2019. The series is inspired by a true story in the book Điểm đến cuộc đời (Destination of Life) by author Đặng Hoàng Giang.

The film tells the story of Hà, a mother who has a son with bone cancer. The main event offers Hà an opportunity to experience sympathy and enlightenment, among other insights.

The movie is currently in pre-production, and is scheduled to start filming in 2022 and be released in 2023.

The first movie of the series, Memento Mori: Land, is seeking community funds to complete its post-production.

Director Vũ told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper that it was a great honour to be included in the Busan Film Festival.

“This is the first crucial recognition for the project. Every filmmaker in Asia looks forward to APM during his or her first steps,” he said, adding that this "relay station" is especially meaningful as the film industry is facing difficulties due to the pandemic.

Little information is currently available for the movie If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood. Its director Đan took part in the 2019 Busan Film Festival in his role as cinematography director for the movie Bí mật của gió (The Secret of the Wind) directed by Nguyễn Phan Quang Bình, who is Đan’s father.

Đan plans to return to the festival this year as a film director. This is Đan’s first time as a director for a movie, after making a number of music videos, commercials and short film projects.

APM is rated as the best "filter" of Asian art film projects, and 26 selected movies this year are from 15 countries.

Giang’s horror movie

Variety magazine on August 7 reported that director Lê Bình Giang’s horror movie Who Created Human Beings is part of the Open Doors programme at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland between August 4 and 14.

The film is about a policeman named Sinh and his girlfriend Linh who are both Catholic. The characters and plot are inspired by real people whom Giang knows.

The film explores the differences between the older generation and their adult children, as well as certain religious and social norms.

Shooting for the film starts in a mountain village during the rainy season in 2022. VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@While the shift to online learning amid COVID-19 prompted discussions around how to ensure quality quickly, the conversation is now evolving into how to look more into students’ needs and use student feedback to improve quality.

This trend was discussed among nearly 800 leaders, experts, and academics at the recent workshop on Quality Assurance for Online and Digitally Enhanced Learning, the biggest industry-facing event co-hosted by RMIT Vietnam since the pandemic started.

Nearly 800 leaders, experts, and academics at the recent workshop on Quality Assurance for Online and Digitally Enhanced Learning, the biggest industry-facing event co-hosted by RMIT University and the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training

Drawing experience from universities and tertiary education authorities in both Australia and Viet nam, the experts shared some lessons learned from the recent period of online and hybrid learning.

A holistic approach

Representatives from RMIT University, Deakin University and the Australian Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) all highlighted that the online student experience is more than just about learning. As such, a high-quality education needs to cater for the holistic student experience regardless of the delivery mode.

Professor Shona Leitch, Associate Deputy Vice-Chancellor Education at RMIT University, commented: “All considerations should be student-centric, from designing online course contents and learning environments, to setting learning outcomes and the actual teaching and assessment.”

Beyond that, student support mechanisms should be available on virtual platforms as well. At RMIT, student services like the library, recreation centre, student advice, academic support, wellbeing, and career advice are now all accessible online with some being accessible by students 24/7.

“We also conduct student surveys throughout the semester and quality confirmation checks on all courses, which enable us to adapt to our students’ expectations and ensure that our staff have the capability and support they need to make continuous improvement,” Professor Leitch added.

Digital is the new norm

Experts agreed on the need to think of online learning not as a second choice, but a current necessity and constant element of modern education going forward. Such a mindset would help steer actions that improve the quality of online teaching and learning.

According to quality assurance specialist Dr Nguyen Huu Cuong, educational institutions need to prioritise equipping their faculty with the capacity to teach online and their students with the skills to learn online.

“Online education requires specific online teaching materials as well. Though a challenge for many Vietnamese institutions, the way forward for them is to upgrade their digital libraries so that both academics and students can access high-quality online resources,” Dr Cuong said.

Online delivery also urges academics to think about assessment more creatively. Authentic assessment (rather than traditional exams) has been adopted by many Australian universities including RMIT, and such experience was shared with their Vietnamese counterparts at the workshop.

Quality assurance framework

In a move to support online education, the Vietnamese Prime Minister has approved several plans to develop distance learning. Moreover, Viet Nam's Ministry of Education and Training has issued distance learning frameworks, regulations allowing a 30% online component in undergraduate and doctorate programs, criteria for assessing the quality of distance education programs, as well as research projects and directives for implementation.

According to Associate Professor Pham Van Tuan from the University of Da Nang, AUN-QA Lead Assessor, “constitutes of quality in online learning include the institutional strategy, teaching and learning methodology, online-appropriate student assessment methods, course development, professional development for online teaching staff, IT skills development for tech support staff, and more.”

“Institutions need to build an online learning quality assurance framework covering the constituent elements of quality identified, and comply with the regulations that govern online learning,” he emphasised.

Overall, the Australian and Vietnamese experts at the workshop agreed that online and digitally enhanced learning is an exciting area to collaborate in. They expect to use the lessons learned from the past 18 months to give students a much deeper and richer experience in the future.

HCM CITY — The HCM City People’s Committee plans to establish technical standards to develop a single smart card that could be used for all types of public transport.

The city aims to create inter-linkages between automatic fare collection (AFC) systems as well as convenience for card users.

If metro lines, rapid buses and water buses have many kinds of AFC systems, the cost to interlink these systems would be too high, according to city officials.

The committee has sought clearance from the Ministry of Transport to give the city the authority to decide on the technical standards for all AFC systems in public passenger transport on waterways and roads.

An AFC system is in line with the city’s smart-city project which promotes the use of cashless payments.

In a related issue, the city’s Transport Department is considering investment in an automatic payment system that could be used for all types of public transport.

The city launched a one-year pilot project on the use of cashless payment for public buses in March 2019, and later extended it to the end of this year.

The pilot is expected to encourage more residents to use the bus system. Passengers need to register to get a bus card, which is similar to a bank card.

The cashless payment was first used on bus route No 86 from Bến Thành Market in District 1 to Tôn Đức Thắng University in District 7.

The project is being piloted on a total of eight bus routes instead of 18 bus routes as previously planned. More than 10,300 smart bus cards were issued to passengers by the end of last year.

After preliminary review and evaluation, the city will decide on how to proceed with the project.

The pilot scheme will also be applied to metro lines, rapid buses and boats in the future.

The Việt Nam Thương Tín Commercial Joint Stock Bank (VietBank) and Zion Company received approval to carry out the pilot project, which uses capital from enterprises instead of funds from the city or state budget. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Governor of the State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV) Nguyễn Thị Hồng has directed commercial banks in the Mekong Delta region to support rice producers and traders to overcome difficulties amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The latest outbreak of the pandemic has negatively affected the paddy and rice supply chain, from production and distribution to consumption and export, especially in the Mekong Delta region.

Under Document No 5747/NHNN-TD issued earlier this week, commercial banks must ensure they fully and promptly meet capital needs and expand credit limits for rice traders so they have enough capital to purchase more paddy and rice, and increase their storage, preservation and processing establishments.

Banks also need to step up reforms and simplify their internal procedures to shorten the loan approval time besides diversifying appropriate credit products and working directly with rice traders and businesses to have effective solutions to overcome difficulties.

However, the SBV noted, the lending must still meet the Government’s current credit rules to ensure legal cash flow management and debt recovery.

It is necessary to continually promote the implementation of credit policies for agricultural and rural development, of which focus is placed on lending to models of chains from paddy and rice production to purchasing, processing, preservation and consumption, according to the SBV.

Banks need to continually implement solutions, such as restructuring repayment terms, keeping the debt group unchanged, exempting and reducing interest and fees for loans, to remove difficulties for COVID-19-affected customers, including rice producers and traders, to help them restore production and business.

They must follow closely the rice market’s developments and lending to purchase and temporarily store paddy and rice in the area to promptly report and propose solutions to the provincial and municipal People's committees during the implementation.

According to Đỗ Hoài Nam, Chairman and General Director of Intimex Group, complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it difficult for rice trading. Rice traders are facing obstacles due to social distancing measures, especially in the stage of loading and unloading, causing big problems for exporters.

Nam underlined the significance of promptly controlling COVID-19 as well as faster vaccinations for workers in food producing and processing companies.

The Việt Nam Food Association also said due to pandemic prevention and control regulations, it is difficult for domestic companies to buy, process and export rice. Meanwhile, the opportunity is high for Việt Nam to increase exports as global demand is rising and supplies are falling, especially from big exporters like India and Thailand.

Rice supply chain faces risk of disruption

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said more than 1.5 million hectares of rice in the Mekong Delta with eight million tonnes are ready for harvest, but there are no traders to buy the grain.

Farmers in the south are unable to sell their produce while consumers are struggling to buy food, a frustrating paradox created by COVID-19 travel restrictions and the closure of both wholesale and retail markets.

The threat of disruption in the supply means prices have fallen by 10-25 per cent from a month ago, or VNĐ500-800 per kilogramme.

However, farmers still cannot sell their rice.

Trần Văn Nam of Cần Thơ City said he has just harvested around 20 tonnes of high-quality rice. Two months before the harvest, a trader came and deposited VNĐ9 million for his rice and agreed to buy at VNĐ6,000 a kilogramme, but since social distancing began and transportation has become very difficult, the trader has opted to forfeit deposit and prices have started to fall relentlessly.

Nguyễn Văn Kiên, a large rice trader in Cần Thơ, said many traders have chosen to forego deposit rather than buy the rice at the committed prices since that would increase their losses.

"In previous years in the summer-autumn rice crop I used to buy 50,000-60,000 tonnes of rice from farmers in Hậu Giang, An Giang, Bạc Liêu, and Kiên Giang provinces, but this year I bought only 5,000 tonnes because I cannot transport it to large markets like HCM City."

He has 100 employees buying rice from throughout the delta, and they all have to carry COVID-19 negative test results that are only valid for three days while the procurement takes them one to two weeks, he said.

The Việt Nam Food Association said since social distancing began, half of the 120 rice enterprises in the delta have suspended operations and the rest have reduced their capacity by half.

To resolve these problems, the Vietnam Food Association calls for the Ministry of Industry and Trade and other related ministries to create favourable conditions for traders to buy and distribute rice by prioritising for vehicles rice transporting the grain and vaccinating workers in the rice and food supply chains.

HÀ NỘI — The Hà Nội People's Committee has issued a plan to provide enough medical oxygen for a scenario in which the number of COVID-19 patients in the city reaches 40,000.

The move aims at ensuring adequate medical oxygen for hospitals and medical facilities under the management of the city's Department of Health (DoH) and using resources in the treatment of patients reasonably, economically, and effectively.

The plan is implemented in three phases, responding to scenarios in which the number of COVID-19 patients hits 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000, respectively.

The patients are classified in line with the severity of the disease based on the Ministry of Health's guidance. They are asymptomatic patients with mild (83.6 per cent) and moderate levels (7 per cent), severe patients needing oxygen (3.8 per cent) and very severe patients needing invasive and non-invasive ventilation (3.6 per cent), and critical patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) intervention (2 per cent).

Therefore, there will be 3,120 patients requiring medical oxygen (9.4 per cent) if the number of coronavirus infections is up to 40,000.

The treatment facilities will be divided in accordance with the disease severity. There will be establishments that care for moderate patients, severe and critical patients requiring intensive care treatment as well as those that treat mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.

To carry out the plan effectively, it is necessary to involve the entire political system, relevant departments, agencies, and units. There should be close coordination between forces to assure the capacity to store medical oxygen, supply and transport of the oxygen to the hospitals and medical facilities under the management of the DoH. — VNS

All of the 2,000 native timber trees belong to seven species, including Chiêu Liêu (Chebulic myrobalan), Giáng Hương (Pterocarpus macrocarpus), Ươi (Scaphium macropodum), Dầu (Dipterocarpus alatus), Gõ đỏ (Afzelia xylocarpa), Gõ mật (Sindora siamensis) and Bằng lăng (Lagerstroemia speciosa).

They were planted by staff at the Đồng Nai Culture and Nature Reserve and local residents, with supervision from the Gaia team.

Despite the pandemic, Gaia and its partners proceeded with afforestation plans and ensured compliance with the Government’s COVID-19 prevention regulations, said Đỗ Thị Thanh Huyền, founder and director of the Gaia Nature Conservation.

Gaia has planted forests in Đồng Nai Culture and Nature Reserve since 2018.

In the past few weeks, Gaia conducted online meetings and calls with donors and local partners to prepare for afforestation in the Đồng Nai Cultural Nature Reserve, a major part of the Đồng Nai World Biosphere Reserve.

The effort is part of the campaign “Afforestation to prevent the next pandemic” launched by Gaia in June which includes not only afforestation activities but also communications campaigns to raise public awareness about the importance of forest planting.

The campaign also includes the planting of 10,000 trees in the northern province of Thanh Hóa.

Afforestation increases biodiversity, which helps to create a healthy home for wildlife and enhances disease resistance. Afforestation in Đồng Nai Culture and Nature Reserve strengthens the forest's ecological value, protects water resources, responds to climate change, and protects one of the last populations of elephants in Việt Nam, according to Huyền.

The forest will continue to be taken care of and monitored online by Gaia in collaboration with the Đồng Nai Culture and Nature Reserve for the next four years to ensure the highest survival rate. —VNS

The Director of the Center for Energy and Green Growth Research Hà Đăng Sơn talks to Vietnam News Agency about green growth in Việt Nam, emphasising the role of the private sector.

What is the role of green growth in Việt Nam’s economy?

When Việt Nam launched its first national green growth strategy nearly a decade ago, it put a big emphasis on balancing economic outputs and environmental protection as well as joining international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

For a long time, economic growth was very important and urgent for developing countries like Việt Nam.

However, there are always trade-offs between economic output and environmental protection, and cultural and social issues. Balancing all those factors is both a big challenge and an urgent task for Việt Nam.

In your opinion, what are the major achievements that Việt Nam has made in the implementation of its national green growth strategy from 2012 to 2020?

In 2012, the Government of Việt Nam launched its national strategy on green growth development with the desire to balance the three pillars of economic and social development, and environmental protection.

At that time, the country faced a shortage of legal frameworks to support the strategy. In 2014, Việt Nam developed a detailed roadmap for green growth.

Under the strategy implemented from 2012 to 2020, Việt Nam mostly completed the legal framework necessary and prepared for activities related to green growth on a larger scale.

I think that during this period, Việt Nam reviewed and improved the legal framework and policies for green growth development as well as evaluated the feasibility of different approaches to green growth.

What has Việt Nam done to boost green growth?

After approving the national green growth strategy, Việt Nam had a detailed plan for green growth. Under the plan, it pointed out 12 groups of issues and 66 actions to be taken for ministries, agencies, localities and political/social organisations. It has sped up studies and mechanisms related to green growth. For example, approving the Law on Planning, Law on Public Investment and the amended Law on Environmental Protection.

Ministries and agencies actively issued and exercised policies advocating green growth such as those on green energy or the Government’s incentives for solar/wind power.

Do you have any recommendations on financing green growth development, especially when public investment is limited?

International experiences show that public investment is not a major financial source in responding to climate change or green growth.

The Republic of Korea only uses public funding to build up confidence for private investors to invest in a project.

I think that in the past, Việt Nam struggled to attract funding from the private sector due to the lack of coordination mechanisms among the central government and relevant parties.

As Việt Nam is restructuring its economy with a thriving private sector, private investment is needed.

According to studies by the World Bank Group and United Nations Environment Programme, Việt Nam spent only 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product on climate change responses and green growth.

To further attract private investors, the Government should have a long-term vision with long-term policies to gain the confidence of private investors. At the moment, many private investments are for four or five years only and then the investors change to other areas because they are afraid of policy risks.

Việt Nam is developing a national green growth strategy during the period 2021-2030 with a vision toward 2045-2050. What do you expect most from the new strategy?

In my opinion, the strategy needs to concentrate on improving the legal framework. In particular, it needs a mechanism to manage coordination between the central government and local governments.

Clear policies, especially financial mechanisms are needed to further attract private investment. The participation of the private sector is important when Việt Nam wants to implement the strategy widely. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s NanoDragon satellite was delivered to Japan on August 11 ahead of its planned launch into space, according to the Việt Nam National Space Centre (VNSC) under the Việt Nam Academy of Science and Technology.

The centre said the satellite would be transferred to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The NanoDragon satellite (NDG), a nano-layer CubeSat satellite which weighs 3.8kg, was developed by the VNSC. It is expected to be launched into orbit from the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture in the fiscal year 2021 (to March 2022) of Japan.

The satellite is the product of a project to design, manufacture, launch and test operation of a nano-sized microsatellite under the national space science and technology programme in the 2016-2020 period.

The process of researching, designing, integrating, and testing the satellite's functions was carried out completely in Việt Nam by VNSC researchers.

The satellite was developed with the purpose of demonstrating it could use micro-satellite beam technology to receive the Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal to track and monitor activities at sea.

The centre said after the manufacturing, integration and functional testing were conducted in Việt Nam between March 9-April 9, the satellite has passed pre-launch environmental testing at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan.

Along with the satellite development process, a ground station to operate the satellite after its launch has been installed and is ready for operation at the VNSC in the Hoà Lạc Hi-Tech Park in Hà Nội.

Previously, the VNSC also successfully developed the 1kg microsatellite PicoDragon, and the 50-kg satellite MicroDragon, which were launched into orbit in 2013 and 2019, respectively. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Exports of Vietnamese agricultural products via border gates to China are facing numerous difficulties. Ministries, localities and branches from the two countries are urged to make greater efforts in facilitating the clearance of these products, senior officials have said.

Online newspaper congthuong.vn cited Lương Trọng Quỳnh, vice chairman of the Lạng Sơn People's Committee, as saying that China examined all of Viet Nam's fruit shipments to the country. That would result in longer customs clearance time for Vietnamese fruit than those of other countries.

China had also strengthened the application of standards on origin and label quarantine while strictly controlling quality standards and food hygiene and safety for farm produce and fresh fruit and vegetables imported from Việt Nam. Meanwhile, many fruits of Việt Nam such as passion fruit, durian and custard apple were yet to be permitted for export to China, Quỳnh said.

Most businesses had failed to learn the latest information on Chinese export conditions such as those in quarantine and traceability, so they had encountered numerous difficulties in customs clearance. Therefore, localities that shared border gates with China petitioned ministries and branches to offer local businesses effective guidance in production so that their goods would meet requirements from the neighbouring country and customs clearance for these products would be faster, he said.

According to Đỗ Văn Duy, Director of Lào Cai Province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the province exported 760,000 tonnes of agricultural products via border gates to China for US$690 million over the past seven months of 2021. In which, dragon fruit saw the highest export value with $444 million, followed by mango with $120 million and watermelon with $28 million.

Despite these encouraging figures, import-export activities with China through the province’s border gates faced certain difficulties. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only Chinese drivers were allowed by the Chinese side to transport goods. That caused difficulties in trade activities via the province’s two international border gates, resulting in modest transport productivity and slow clearance of goods, Duy told a virtual conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) this week.

In order to better facilitate exports of agricultural products, the province had arranged officers responsible for issuing certificates of origin for export enterprises at the two border gates, Duy said, adding that it had also contacted the authorities of some Chinese localities to inform them about the pandemic situation in Việt Nam and disease prevention measures that Việt Nam had implemented. Meanwhile, it also suggested the Chinese localities remove difficulties for the clearance of fruit, including dragon fruit, through the Lào Cai-Hà Khẩu International Border Gate.

Duy also petitioned MARD to regularly update and notify local businesses of China's regulations on labels, traceability, planting area instructions, quarantine and testing, as well as embracing and building trademarks for Vietnamese agricultural products thus facilitating the long-term and stable exports of goods to foreign countries.

The ministry should also set up an agency that would be responsible for regulating local agricultural products, because, during the harvest season, agricultural products were transported in large amounts to border gates. If not regulated, they would suffer congestion. The establishment of the agency would help prevent agricultural products from damage or price pressure from Chinese traders, he said.

Trần Quốc Toản, Deputy Director of the Import-Export Department under Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) agreed. He urged MARD to closely monitor major growing areas and promptly coordinate with relevant agencies to regulate the volume of agricultural products transported to border gates in accordance with conditions and capacity in goods clearance of each border gate.

Also, the ministry should ask relevant agencies to guide farmers, traders and businesses on how to classify, pack and preserve farm produce appropriately to meet requests from Chinese traders, Toản said.

In his speech at the event, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phùng Đức Tiến called on closer co-ordination among relevant Chinese agencies with localities sharing border gates with China, ministries and sectors of Việt Nam in removing difficulties and facilitating the clearance of Vietnamese goods to China amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

China had issued a lot of new regulations on food safety, traceability, plant quarantine and animal quarantine. Thus, provinces that had good relations with Chinese localities should team up with the MoIT and MARD to disseminate these regulations to provinces, cities, businesses, associations, and farmers in a timely manner so that goods transported to border gates could enjoy smooth customs clearance, Tiến noted.

According to MARD, the country's export of agro-forestry-fisheries products increased by 26.7 per cent year-on-year in the seven-month period, topping $28.6 billion. During the period, China was the second-largest importer of Việt Nam's agricultural goods with a growth rate of about 36.5 per cent over the same period last year.— VNS

KABUL — The Taliban were on the brink of total victory in Afghanistan on Sunday, with their fighters ordered to wait on the outskirts of the capital and the government conceding it was preparing for a "transfer of power".

Militants surrounded Kabul following an astonishingly quick rout of government forces in recent days, with troops incapable of holding onto territory without US military support.

The fall of Kabul will see the hardline Islamic group take back power two decades after US-led forces toppled it in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

"The Islamic Emirate instructs all its forces to stand at the gates of Kabul, not to try to enter the city," a spokesman for the Taliban tweeted as residents reported insurgents on the outskirts of the city.

"Until the completion of the transition process, the responsibility for the security of Kabul is with the other side (the Afghan government)".

The United States began moving its citizens and Afghan staff to Kabul airport, with the help of thousands of troops deployed to the capital to assist with the evacuation.

The Taliban's imminent takeover triggered fear and panic in Kabul among residents fearful of the group's hardline brand of Islam.

The Afghan government signalled earlier there were negotiations underway to avoid bloodshed in Kabul, and to hand power to the Taliban.

"The Afghan people should not worry... there will be no attack on the city and there will be a peaceful transfer of power to the transitional government," Interior Minister Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal said in a recorded speech.

Afghan President left the country

President Ashraf Ghani -- who is widely expected to resign – is said to have left the country on Sunday, hours after the Taliban ordered its fighters to wait on the outskirts of the capital following an astonishing rout of government forces.

"The former Afghan president has left the nation," Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the peace process, said in a video on his Facebook page.

Earlier Ghani in a video message released to media urged what remains of his security forces to maintain law and order.

There are fears of a security vacuum in the capital as thousands of police and other armed services members have abandoned their posts, uniforms and even weapons.

"It is our responsibility and we will do it in the best possible manner," Ghani said, hours after the Taliban seized two nearby prisons and released thousands of inmates.

Suhail Shaheen, based in Qatar as part of the Taliban's negotiating team, said the group wants a swift takeover.

"In next few days, we want a peaceful transfer," he told the BBC.

Evacuations

The scale and speed of the insurgents' advance have shocked Afghans and the US-led alliance that poured billions into the country over the past two decades.

President Joe Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 1,000 US troops to help secure the emergency evacuation from Kabul of embassy employees and thousands of Afghans who worked for American forces and now fear Taliban reprisals.

That was on top of the 3,000 American soldiers deployed in recent days, and 1,000 left in-country after Biden announced in May that the final withdrawal of the US military presence in Afghanistan would be completed by September 11.

That decision has come under increased scrutiny given the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, but he insisted Saturday there was no choice.

"I was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan -- two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth," Biden said.

Ghani's government was left completely isolated on Sunday after the insurgents overran the anti-Taliban northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif and the eastern city of Jalalabad.

Like with most of the other captured cities, the seizure of power came after government forces surrendered or retreated.

Videos posted on pro-Taliban social media accounts showed the group's heavily armed fighters in cities across the country, waving white flags and greeting locals.

Most of the fighters appeared young, suggesting they were most likely infants or unborn when the Taliban was toppled from power in 2001. AFP
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Being locked at home due to COVID-19, more young people are investing in the local stock market. A 58 per cent increase in new accounts in the first half of 2021 has been recorded. — Photo cafef.vn

By Minh Hương

HÀ NỘI — Social distancing due to COVID-19 has created more local stock investors in Việt Nam, especially among internet-savvy young people.

According to data, there were 619,911 new accounts opened in the first six months of the year, an increase of 58 per cent compared to the first six months of 2020, which also registered a record number of new accounts.

As a freelance photographer, Nguyễn Quang Anh, 24, in Liễu Giai Street, Hà Nội did not have a lot of work even before the social distancing orders were put in place.

Anh said the boredom of having to stay at home because of the social distancing order and fewer working opportunities led him to invest in the stock market with some investment-friendly and user-friendly applications.

Anh told Việt Nam News: "Being hit by the fourth wave of COVID-19 and with everything digitised, it is a good time to focus on investing. It is one of the few activities we can do when we must stay at home.”

With more money, Lê Tuấn Phong, 28, in Láng Hạ Street chooses to invest in stocks and ETFs listed on the HCM City Stock Exchange (HoSE) via a prestige open fund.

Phong said a good fund would help him make bigger profits, however, he also wanted to invest by himself.

Phong told Việt Nam News: "It is not difficult to find information on social networks through financial investment groups and securities and digital currencies," adding the majority of investors were his age.

There are groups with hundreds of thousands of people, who update content and operate live streaming investment channels, sharing financial knowledge, and attracting a lot of followers.

Since last year, the number of investors on mobile apps has increased sharply. Local investment apps specializing in investments and stocks like Finhay and Infina are attractive to young investors.

Recently, Infina, announced an oversubscribed US$2 million seed round from Saison Capital, Venturra Discovery, 1982 Ventures, 500 Startups, Nextrans, and angel investors like executives at Google and Netflix.

Launched in January 2021, the app serves the investment demands of users between the ages of 25 and 40 with a minimum contribution of $25. Those investors can choose from assets including savings accounts, term deposits, fractionalized real estate and mutual funds.

At the launch of the app, the firm said only about 3.2 per cent of people in Vietnam had invested in stocks. That rate had increased thanks to a high internet penetration rate of more than 70 per cent.

Experts in the market said that the growth was largely contributed to the technology which allows investors to open an account online.

According to Dragon Capital Vietnam, a number of open-ended fund investors under the age of 35 on digital channels account for approximately 60 per cent of the total number of investors in Viet Nam.

The fund calculated that their average investment amount was surprisingly high compared to the average income in Việt Nam, at VNĐ18 million ($782) per month.

They said the trend of investing through mobile technology will play a more dominant role in the market moving forward.

As a long-standing fund management company in Việt Nam with more than $5 billion in assets under its management, Dragon Capital Vietnam sees the future for investors in technology platforms.

On July 26 it introduced the DragonX investment application to the market, which is seen as a breakthrough for investment fund management in Vietnam. Together with the launch of DragonX, the fund also adjusted the minimum investment required to only VNĐ100,000 while completely waiving the purchase fee to attract more investors.

DragonX provides users with investment knowledge in an easy to understand way through posts, daily newsletters and investment videos from the firm’s team of experts.

Trần Thanh Tân, vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dragon Capital Vietnam told local media: "I believe that a country's financial market can only develop strongly if there are a large number of local investors. DragonX is our way to bring people closer to good investment opportunities in the Vietnamese financial market.

Beware of tricks

Nguyễn Thế Truyền, director of Thiên Thanh Law Partnership, the City Bar Association, Hà Nôị said with the internet environment, people can transact easily and some of them were too eager to pour their money into apps with the dream of "becoming a billionaire".

In April more than 1,800 people in HCM City were cheated of millions of US dollars by an investment platform app called Coolcat, which announced itself as an insurance investment firm with more than five years of experience headquartered in the UK. It then vanished taking with it all of the money of the app users in the city.

Truyền said being at home for long periods of time, people often find new things to try however investment is not easy. A 'quick money' mindset could lead them to be drawn into using fraudulent apps.

In early July, the leader of the State Securities Commission of Vietnam (SSC) announced despite COVID-19's complicated development, the local indexes continued to set new records, helping the stock market enjoy the second fastest growth rate in the world. — VNS

QUẢNG NINH – Hạ Long City, a popular tourist destination in the northern coastal province of Quảng Ninh, will implement a series of measures to classify, collect, transport and treat domestic and construction waste from early next year.

Secretary of the city’s Party Committee Vũ Văn Diện said the plans would be a long-term solution to improve urban environment and tackle the garbage crisis in the city in the past four months.

The city has asked local authorities of 12 wards and communes to allocate an area for treating domestic waste as microbiological fertilizer to serve agricultural production.

In the early days of this month, Hạ Long City was flooded with garbage. The garbage was dumped in large piles along roads and covered with canvas as garbage truck did not come to collect.

A disagreement on the financial settlement between local authorities and environmental enterprises kickstarted the crisis.

Indevco, the company in charge of collecting and treating waste in Hạ Long City has invested in a solid waste treatment centre with incinerator technology. The centre was expected to treat about 900 tonnes of solid waste per day from Hạ Long and Cẩm Phả cities.

However, due to problems in investment policy and planning adjustment, the project was behind schedule and the centre has not opened.

In the document sent to the provincial People’s Committee on May 26, Indevco admitted the domestic solid waste incinerator system, which was built by the domestic team, could not meet requirements. As a result, the company sought foreign corporations to get more modern and advanced technology, and access to the funding.

But the company could not find partners due to the complex legality of the project. It considered a plan to transfer the entire project, which failed because the offered transfer price was up to VNĐ300 billion (US$13 million).

On June 30, the company proposed a plan to donate the provincial People's Committee the entire value of land use rights, infrastructure and assets associated with the project. It also proposed the committee consider and introduce an investor to the company to transfer the project.

The company asked the committee to come up with policies to support the company with the cost invested to build and operate solid waste pits from November 2016 to April 2021. The amount was about VNĐ115 billion.

The provincial’s People’s Committee rejected the proposal, saying it was not in accordance with the provisions of current law.

In early May, the company stopped receiving garbage. The committee had an urgent plan to store domestic waste and assigned Judenco, another environmental enterprise, to build a temporary garbage pit.

In order to transport garbage to the temporary garbage pit, Judenco had to use the facilities at the solid waste treatment center managed by Indevco.

Early this month, Indevco did not allow Judenco to transport waste through its land, causing garbage to pile up across the city.

About 300 tonnes of waste is estimated to be discharged to the city every day.

On August 3, the city’s Department of Natural Resources and Environment decided to transport waste to Khe Giang Waste Treatment Plant managed by Việt Long Investment and Construction Joint Stock Company.

The plant located in the west of the city has capacity for treating 100 tonnes of garbage per day. Two more new furnaces with a capacity of 400 tonnes per day are being invested in, raising the total capacity of the plant to 600 tonnes per day.

According to the assessment of specialised agencies, Khe Giang Waste Treatment Plant is capable of treating a large amount of domestic waste in the city.

In addition, the city has completed the planning of a dumping site of ​​about 28,500sq.m in Hòa Bình Commune. The dumping site can receive 200 tonnes of waste per day.

The city said it would work with local authorities on a roadmap for the pilot of collecting, classifying, transporting and treating domestic waste.

The provincial committee has asked agencies and the city’s committee to revise and work with representatives of Indevco to solve problems with the solid waste treatment centre construction project. VNS
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ambassador Denny Abdi writes to Việt Nam News on the 76th anniversary of the Independence Day of Indonesia (August 17).

On August 17, 1945, Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta, the founding fathers of Indonesia, proclaimed Indonesia's independence on behalf of all Indonesian people. The determination for independence among Indonesians was a result of hundred years of colonisation.

Nonetheless, the proclamation of independence was only a start for building a nation. The struggle continues as Indonesia develops its more than 17,000 islands with diverse ethnic groups. The country has endured political turmoil and economic downturn tests and is now the third-largest democracy with prospective economic growth.

The journey is never easy, but we are thankful that Indonesia can achieve its position and prestige in the global arena today.

This year marks the 76th anniversary of hard-earned independence. The theme for the celebration is "Indonesia Tangguh, Indonesia Tumbuh" (A Resilient Indonesia; A Growing Indonesia).

Before the pandemic, August used to be all about carnival and popular games like balap karung (sack race) or makan kerupuk (eating crackers). During these festivities, people get together in a patriotic spirit and rejoice in happiness.

The celebrations now move to the digital platform through the Indonesian Digital House. Furthermore, the flag-hoisting ceremony will be conducted with limited attendance and participated by the public virtually.

As 2020 was a challenging year, the pandemic has also offered valuable lessons on the importance of global cooperation to promote health infrastructure and governance, economic resilience, multilateralism, and setting aside rivalries.

Now is the time to promote unity and cooperation. No one, no country should be left behind. Because during this global pandemic, no one is safe until everyone is safe.

That is why Indonesia is keen on conducting vaccine diplomacy. Our vaccine diplomacy is not only aimed at securing vaccine provision for domestic use but also paving the way for equal access to vaccines for all nations.

Overview of Indonesia – Việt Nam Relations

The traditional relations between Indonesia and Việt Nam were built on shared feelings and determination to fight colonisation for independence. The historic reciprocal visits of the renowned leaders, President Hồ Chí Minh and President Soekarno, in 1959 were a testament to the closeness of both countries.

Ambassador Denny Abdi meets with Minister of Industry and Trade, June 22, 2021. Courtesy Photo of the embassy

Nowadays, our friendly ties are positively manifested in the closeness of our leaders. For example, President Joko Widodo hosted Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính at the Bogor Palace in April 2021. Later, in July, President Widodo held a telephone conversation with President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc affirming both leaders' commitment to strengthen relations further.

Indonesia and Việt Nam are among the strongest and fastest-growing economies in the region. Both countries' economy represents 45 per cent of the ASEAN economy. Moreover, Indonesia and Việt Nam are home to around 60 per cent of people in ASEAN. With the increasing purchasing power in both countries, we can imagine the future of these two countries as the engine of growth of our region.

With this potential, Việt Nam and Indonesia carry a promising future for cooperation that can bring more benefit. Việt Nam is Indonesia's fourth largest economic partner in ASEAN and ranked ninth as Indonesia's biggest export destination globally.

In terms of investment, Indonesia was among the first countries to invest in Việt Nam after the Đổi Mới policy in 1986. Despite the pandemic, the total bilateral trade in 2020 was US$8.2 billion. To achieve the targeted bilateral trade of US$10 billion, we need to boost potential cooperation, such as strengthening industrialization based on research and innovation, developing our digital economy, and enhancing fisheries cooperation.

I am impressed by how Việt Nam is determined to build its automotive industry. The birth of VinFast as the first "Made in Việt Nam" car is the nation's pride. It is also important to note that the company focused on acquiring the technology from other countries and building its cars with a Vietnamese touch.

In Indonesia, the digital economy is the fastest growing industry. Google, Temasek, Bain & Company has projected the value of Indonesia's digital economy transactions to reach US$124 billion by 2025. Bukalapak, an Indonesian tech-unicorn, recently recorded the country's biggest initial public offering ever. The company helps millions of Indonesia's mom-and-pop kiosks ("warung") to get online.

I believe that collaboration in developing the digital economy ecosystem will benefit both Indonesia and Việt Nam.

Indonesia and Việt Nam also hold great potential in fisheries cooperation as both are blessed with rich marine resources. The two nations shall promote collaboration in producing key seafood products to become ASEAN contributors to the world's food supply. Moreover, stakeholders from both countries can also learn from each other to enhance their capability in developing sustainable aquaculture and seafood processing industries.

In facing the pandemic and future challenges, Indonesia and Việt Nam must continue working closely together. With deepened collaboration, I am confident that the two countries will reach their utmost potentials and become the drivers of growth in ASEAN. VNS

HÒA BÌNH — Hunting earthworms on a large scale may severely damage the ecosystem and decrease agricultural soil quality, said environment experts.

There have been reports on how locals in a number of northern mountainous communities in northern Hoà Bình Province, including Kim Bôi, Tân Lạc, Cao Phong and Đà Bắc use electrical probes to catch earthworms and sell them for profit.

The probes, powered by household electricity at line voltage, go into the ground and shock the worms to the soil's surface. The invertebrates are later gathered, cleaned and dried using large industrial food dryers, which produce an noxious odour. The worm's intestines, often discarded in the process, are dumped directly in streams and rivers polluting the local water sources.

Dried worms fetch around US$30 per kilo. A worm hunter typically catches from 5 to 7 kilos of live worms a night using this method.

Bạch Công Dương, vice chairman of Tú Sơn District in Hòa Bình Province, said there were as many as seven worm factories in the district. Despite numerous warnings issued by local authorities to their owners, they have not been shut down.

Bùi Văn Trọng from the district's police said it's extremely difficult to catch the worm hunters in the act as they only go out at night and often to remote places.

Triệu Văn Hồng, a local representative, said worm hunting using electrical probes has been going on for years. Warnings by local community leaders about the adverse effects it has on the environment have fallen on deaf ears.

"Earthworms are natural tillers. They play in modifying the physical structure of soils by producing new aggregates and pores, which improves soil tilth, aeration, infiltration and drainage. They also increase soil organic matter dynamics, nutrient cycles and promote plant growth," said Nguyễn Hồng Yến from the Hòa Bình Plant Protection Department.

"Hunting earthworms on a large scale may severely hurt soil quality, local agriculture and the ecosystem in the long-term," he said.

Local authorities said as of now there is no ban on worm hunting using electrical probes. Worm hunters often just walk away with small fines or at times just a citation. VNS

ĐÀ NẴNG – A group of bio-researchers at Đà Nẵng’s technology and education university have started a bio-based waste treatment project using water released from fishing boats at Thọ Quang Dock, promising 98 per cent of pollutants will be purified for releasing qualified waste water under Việt Nam standards.

Head of the team, Trần Minh Thảo said the group began the environment-friendly non-chemical treatment from early this year for official operation in October.

He said it was the first time ever the bio treatment was used at the decade-long hotspot pollution site in the tourism hub.

The team said at least 200cu.m of waste water from fishing vessels docking at the port will be collected for cleaning by biological treatment each day.

Thảo said waste water from fishing boats, which contained much organic waste from cold storage mixed with fuel tank oil, used to discharge directly to the dock after sea trips, but the poor waste water activities will end with the introduction of the treatment system.

He said the biological treatment solution was part of the city’s upgraded fishing port project in 2020-25.

Deputy head of the port's management board, Phạm Thành Trung, said the port, which was designed for 400 boats, had been overloaded with more than 2,000 boats, and was heavily polluted from untreated waste water and garbage dumped from boats after fishing trips.

He said 70 per cent of vessels docking at the port were from neighbouring provinces, and at least 1,700 tonnes of solid waste was cleaned by the port’s staff each year, not including waste water and pollutant dumping from boatmen and shipping yards in the port.

Meanwhile, the dock became more polluted by sediment in the untreated waste water, he added.

Director of the city’s nature resources and environment department Tô Văn Hùng said a total VNĐ27 billion (US$1.17 million) had been allocated for upgrading the port in 2020-25.

The project will include dredging 350,000cu.m of sludge and sediment from the port for discharging into the sea of Đà Nẵng.

Waste water is processed at a biological treatment system at a laboratory in Đà Nẵng.

According to the port’s managing board, Thọ Quang fishing port, which opened 13 years ago, was downgraded and overloaded with more boats arriving from the central region and other provinces.

The 58ha port – the biggest fishing dock in the central region – can handle more than 17,000 fishing trawlers and 130,000 tonnes of fish and seafood worth VNĐ6 trillion ($261 million) per year.

It shelters 2,000 fishing boats, three times more than its capacity, and even 4,000 boats dock during storm season.

The port is visited by 3,000 fishermen and traders each day, while 23 seafood processing plants and 11 shipyards are located there.

Despite spending VNĐ600 million cleaning rubbish at the port, solid waste have still polluted the land and water for years. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Chinese swimming coach, Huang Guohui, of the Vietnamese national swimming team died in quarantine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics.

“Coach Huang passed away on August 11. We are in isolation, so we don’t know the situation yet and we are waiting for the result of the police investigation," Trần Đức Phấn, head of the Vietnamese delegation to the Tokyo Olympics and deputy director of the Việt Nam Sport Administration, confirmed.

According to Phấn, the coach received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Huang and members of the Vietnamese delegation returned home from Japan on August 4, after completing the competition at the Tokyo Olympics. After returning to Hà Nội, the team are in isolation for 14 days at a hospital in the capital.

Phấn said the death of coach Huang is a great loss for Vietnamese swimming.

At the Tokyo Olympics 2020, the Chinese expert was the only professional coach for swimmers Nguyễn Huy Hoàng and Nguyễn Thị Ánh Viên. He rarely appeared in front of cameras, but has been with the Vietnamese swimming team for many years.

Under his guidance, Vietnamese swimmers won the 800m bronze medal and 1,500m silver medal at the Asian Games (ASIAD) 2008 alongside many gold medals at the 23rd, 26th, 29th and 30th SEA Games. At the last SEA Games in 2019 in the Philippines, Huang’s swimmers contributed a total of five gold medals.

Huang also directly trained No 1 swimmer of the country Hoàng for the past five years at the Cần Thơ National Sports Training Centre. He helped Hoàng improve and gain achievements, notably the 2018 Youth Olympic gold medal, the 2019 SEA Games gold medal and the 2018 ASIAD silver medal.

Huang brought his family to live in Việt Nam in 2015.

On his Facebook page, Hoàng posted a status with a photo of coach Huang teaching young swimmers.

"May you rest in peace. We will always be grateful and remember you forever. You will always be in my heart," said Hoàng. VNS

HÀ NỘI — The economy was basically stabilised in the first seven months of this year, with remarkable achievements recorded in many spheres, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính said on Wednesday.

Speaking at the Government's regular meeting, held via teleconference, the PM said attention has been paid to cultural and social affairs, while social security had been ensured.

“This is also the common assessment of international organisations and institutions,” he said.

Chính said the pandemic was still under control, adding that major pandemic clusters had been contained.

Some localities have effectively implemented the Government’s Resolution No. 68, providing timely support for employees and employers affected by the pandemic, he added.

He asked agencies and localities to raise public awareness and responsibility, and encouraged residents to seriously observe COVID-19 prevention and control regulations.

All-level Party Committees and the entire political system should carry forward their role to strictly implement relevant directives, the government leader said.

“Each agency, enterprise, commune and ward must be a fortress to fight the pandemic, and each citizen must be a soldier in combat,” he said.

The PM affirmed Việt Nam’s sound vaccine strategy, explaining that apart from imports, the Government and agencies WERE working hard to accelerate the transfer and research of vaccine production technology to produce vaccines domestically.

Although work is going smoothly, domestic vaccine production and recognition requires more time and must follow strict scientific and legal procedures, he said.

The PM stressed the need to avoid any disruptions in supply chains while regulations on goods circulation are strictly observed.

He said it was time to focus on combating the pandemic because a successful fight against COVID-19 would promote socio-economic development and facilitate socio-economic recovery.

However, he said, economic development should be maintained for resources to prevent and control the pandemic.

He asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote vaccine diplomacy and the Ministry of National Defence to support pandemic prevention and control.

The Ministry of Public Security was assigned to assist frontline forces and ensure security and order for people while the Ministry of Information and Communications was directed to strengthen dissemination campaigns and counter false allegations.

The PM noted that ministries, agencies, and localities must step up the fight against corruption, refrain from acts causing trouble for the people, and prepare documents for submission to the upcoming second session of the 15th National Assembly.

Vaccination will be sped up once more vaccines available

The Ministry of Health will cooperate with the Ministry of National Defence and the Ministry of Public Security to speed up the inoculation with up to 2 million shots of vaccines a day, said Deputy Minister of Health Trần Văn Thuấn.

Speaking at a monthly government press conference on Wednesday, he said the MoH would accelerate the vaccination when more vaccines arrive in the country.

As many as 11 million out of 18 million allocated doses of vaccines have been administered to people, accounting for 65 per cent, Thuấn said.

Hồ Chí Minh City, the country's current largest pandemic hotspot, is leading the inoculation campaign with over 3.5 million doses administered out of more than 4 million doses received. The capital of Hà Nội has injected about 1.5 million out of 3 million doses the city has been allocated.

Thuấn said the vaccination rate will be accelerated in HCM City and other provinces in the coming days.

The deputy minister said the viewpoint of the MoH was to inject the vaccines quickly but safely. Emergency resuscitation is helpful for the vaccination when needed.

The MoH has also transferred 10,000 doses of imported drugs from India to provide for the treatment of patients in southern provinces, he said.

More than 11,000 medical workers and students have been mobilised to support HCM City and southern provinces.

Thuấn said he hoped that with the drastic participation of the entire political system, the MoH and the Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, the situation would soon be stabilised and the pandemic would be put under control in the next month. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The stormy season is starting in Hà Nội and residents are increasingly concerned about flooding during heavy rain.

In the last few decades, floods have become more frequent in the capital city.

Climate change is said to be one of the causes of heavy rain and flooding, however, many experts believe natural factors are only part of the issue, with poor urban planning, construction and management also to blame, according to Kinh tế & Đô thị (Economic & Urban Affairs) newspaper.

Dr. Vũ Hoài Đức, architect and lecturer of Vietnam National University, Hà Nội, said that many urban projects in Hà Nội have taken into account natural disasters and climate change.

However, there was a lack of participation from experts in irrigation science and environmental resources in the planning process, Đức told the newspaper.

Therefore, responding to extreme weather such as heavy rain and floods is a problem for Hà Nội, especially in the western region where there are many rural areas located by rivers' banks.

For example, floods in 2017 and 2018 broke dykes along the Tích and Bùi rivers in Chương Mỹ District, submerging thousands of houses.

In the past, Hà Nội saw flooding in the inner city because this area has poor drainage infrastructure and is densely populated. But now, flooding has spread to the suburbs and newly-built urban areas.

The master plan for Hà Nội’s development to 2030 approved by the then Prime Minister in 2011 raised two important issues of urban economic development and environmental protection.

These issues have been realised in zoning plans and projects on technical infrastructure including drainage, green areas, parks and lakes.

However, after implementation, many targets set out in these plans and projects were not met.

This is because the urbanisation rate is still low while population growth exceeds the overall planning target, leading to overloaded infrastructure. The slow construction of satellite towns and eco-towns results in a lack of green space for the city.

In the inner city area, the relocation of the headquarters of ministries, branches, higher education institutions and industrial production facilities to save land for public spaces has not been carried out effectively. Due to shortcomings in the implementation of the master plan, the city is facing environmental problems such as air pollution, garbage, wastewater, and flooding.

Việt Nam is one of the countries heavily affected by climate change, and the impacts of climate change are presenting themselves even faster than expected.

Hà Nội is also suffering due to shortcomings in urban planning.

Although the master plan took into account drainage issues including surface water, wastewater and rain water, the rapid population growth has led to an increase in domestic wastewater.

Moreover, in recent years, there are incidences of heavy rainfall of up to 300-400mm, which has surpassed the calculated threshold of the drainage that is for 200-250mm.

The drainage system now is overloaded, causing heavy flooding, even in areas that have never been flooded before such as around Hoàn Kiếm Lake and the Old Quarter.

Many urban planning experts believe that, along with the overall adjustment of the Hà Nội Development Master Plan towards environmental protection, plans on technical infrastructure need further research in order to overcome the shortcomings and build urban areas that adapt to climate change.

Architect Đào Ngọc Nghiêm, former director of the Hà Nội Planning and Architecture Department, said: “In order to prepare for climate change, Hà Nội has not only to deal with local flooded spots but also evaluate the whole city's drainage system so as to combine drainage requirements with urban development demands as well as combine drainage treatment with building of green spaces.”

“With the rapid urbanisation rate, the city needs to approve the adjustment of the infrastructure plan to improve drainage capacity for both the inner city and the suburbs," Nghiêm said.

Meanwhile, Đức said that Hà Nội could learn from developed countries to have technical solutions to cope with extreme weather phenomena causing flooding in urban areas.

For areas along Hồng (Red) and Đuống rivers, planning projects should involve experts in environmental resources, hydrometeorology and irrigation.

“With the advancement of science and technology, there is nothing that cannot be solved. The problem is how to find a solution to work together among related sectors,” said Đức. VNS

Nguyễn Hoàng Bảo Đại, 27, is the third Vietnamese to be honoured as a Google Developer Expert in the field of Machine Learning. He is also the initiator of an AI model that can generate ten melodies in one second. Đại talks with Lương Hương about the project.

Inner Sanctum: Please introduce yourself?

My name is Nguyễn Hoàng Bảo Đại. I’m working as a natural language processing research scientist and attending a graduate programme at the National University of Singapore.

I was introduced to music at a very young age but only took it seriously at the age of 12 when I started taking piano lessons. At first, I didn’t want to take up music because I always thought that it was not a subject for boys but I kept learning the piano to satisfy my father’s wishes. However, after a long time being exposed to music and experiencing many things, I started to unconsciously fall for it. Music has now become an integral part of my life, making me happy and inspiring me to do anything.

After finishing high school, I wanted to apply for the composition department of HCM City Conservatory of Music but my family did not encourage me to follow this path. My teachers also advised me to pursue maths or any other natural science subjects, of which I was pretty good at school.

In the end, I decided to apply for Information Technology like my best friend. I was really disoriented at that time and just wanted to go to university to have a friend whom I could talk to and sing to. Unfortunately, we couldn’t make it because I passed the entrance exam but my friend didn’t so I had to study by myself, however, it was also the beginning of my career with Information Technology as well as in Artificial Intelligence.

Inner Sanctum: How did the idea of music-writing AI, still a new concept in Việt Nam, come to you?

The idea originated from my habit of writing music. I have always spent a lot of time writing melodies because I think that only good melodies make beautiful songs. Sometimes, I finish writing a melody but then leave it because I’m not totally satisfied. I thought that if I could shorten the time for writing melodies, the whole process would become faster and the songwriters could release their works sooner.

On the other hand, AI has also been applied in various fields so I started thinking about applying AI in the fields of artistic creation, and assisting Vietnamese songwriters specifically.

After two years, my current AI model can write a piece of music that lasts for 10 seconds, 5 minutes, or even longer. It will take in a prime melody, which is a short piece of music as input to capture the stylistic intent, then create the melodies exactly as I want.

For example, if I provide it with a gentle, mellow melody, I will have 10 soft, mellow songs with lyrical ballads. If I provide a piece of music that has a slightly faster tempo, I will get 10 songs with a dynamic vibe. Moreover, when I lack ideas, I can ask the AI model to generate songs on its own without any prime melody.

Inner Sanctum: What were your difficulties as a pioneer in the field in Việt Nam and how have you overcome them?

The first difficulty in building this AI model was a shortage of data, which I believe that all other AI engineers will face. As I want to build a model that can generate music in the Vietnamese pop ballad style, I chose a training method based on supervised learning that requires a lot of data. However, I cannot use the available music of Vietnamese artists because it is not my desired input. I can find and collect the proper data online but it is insufficient and difficult to standardise as I wish as each source has its own format.

The second difficulty I encountered was the problem of human resources. The whole project has been implemented by myself as I consider it as a personal project and have managed it with my own limited budget. I often hesitate to invite others to help on complicated issues as we have no guarantee of results or finance to support.

Therefore, I decided to solve the problems myself. To get the file in the desired format, I have to sit on a midi keyboard every day and save each one. Many a little makes a mickle, and over a year I think I have accumulated enough data to train the AI model.

Inner Sanctum: Are you now satisfied with the melodies generated by your AI model?

It has achieved about 80 per cent of my expectation. The composing speed is also impressive as it only needs one second to generate 10 different melodies. Such capacity has saved me much time in composing and finalising the music.

I have written a lot of songs with the help of AI, but it takes many stages thereafter to introduce one to the market, such as writing the lyrics, writing the mix, finding the singer, doing the mixing, mastering and even PR/marketing, so they are mainly serving my personal demands.

Inner Sanctum: What do you think of the possibility that music-writing AI will become increasingly popular and replace songwriters in the future?

I highly appreciate the potential application of AI in the music industry. Music marketing is currently a hot field. All brands want to have catchy music for their promotions and advertisements.

The production of promotional music includes a time-consuming phase, similarly to my composing stage: the client listens to the demo and chooses the best version. I believe this process is time-consuming for the composer because they have to create music to meet the customer's request. I think that using AI to write music and make proposals is the fastest and most effective approach because it will save labour and time for both sides.

In addition, music writing AI will also be applied to shorten the production time of a music project. Currently, my AI model supports the process of composing pop tunes so that the producers can spend more time on the rest of the project and create better final products.

However, I don't think it's possible for AI to replace musicians, or it will take a long time to happen. Each songwriter has his/her own musical style. As long as the audience still has the demand for that style, AI will not yet replace their roles. Moreover, the training data is still human-generated so it still needs to depend on people. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Shares extended last week's gains, propped up by strong money flows in banks and securities companies, but foreign traders continued to sell, posing risks to the market in the short term.

On the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange, the VN-Index closed Monday up 1.03 per cent at 1,370.96 points. The southern market's index increased 1.2 per cent last week.

Liquidity continued to improve with nearly 828 million shares worth VNĐ27.5 trillion (US$1.2 billion) traded, up 12 per cent in volume and 15 per cent in value compared to last week's figures.

In the afternoon trade, money was poured into banking and securities stocks, supporting the market's rally. These two sectors gained an average of 2.1 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively, according to data on vietstock.vn.

Six of the top 10 biggest contributors to the VN-Index on Monday were banks. They are Techcombank (TCB), Military Bank (MBB), VPBank (VPB), Vietcombank (VCB), Vietinbank (CTG) and BIDV (BID) with growth of between 1 per cent and 4.7 per cent each.

Securities firms also climbed strongly. The biggest listed brokerage house Saigon Securities Inc (SSI) soared 5.3 per cent; Hồ Chí Minh Securities Corp (HCM) also grew 5.3 per cent, and VNDirect Securities (VND) increased 3.3 per cent.

However, slumps of Vinhomes (VHM) and Vingroup (VIC) were the main drag, restraining the market growth.

Vingroup has registered to sell nearly 100.5 million shares of Vinhomes, equivalent to 3 per cent of Vinhomes' charter capital, after VHM hit a record high of VNĐ120,000 ($5.22) a share on Friday, becoming Việt Nam's biggest listed company with a market capitalisation of VNĐ402 trillion ($17.5 billion).

VHM slipped 3.3 per cent and VIC decreased 0.3 per cent on Monday.

The transaction will be carried out between August 19 and September 17 through order matching or put-through transactions. According to Vingroup's statement, the sale is aimed at increasing working capital and investment in subsidiaries.

On the Hà Nội Stock Exchange, the HNX-Index increased 1.95 per cent to close the day at 343.53 points with nearly 194 million shares worth VNĐ4.9 trillion traded.

However, contrasting to domestic traders, foreign investors continued to offload Vietnamese shares. They were responsible for net sell value of VNĐ956 billion on the HCM City's bourse, the highest value in the last five sessions. They offloaded shares worth VNĐ40 billion in Hà Nội's market.

Many securities companies are still issuing buy-in recommendations on the prediction the market would continue its rally, but analysts on cafef.vn have warned investors that the stock market has experienced a fairly long bull cycle and they should be wary of the chasing-price strategy. — VNS

HDI has sold a 6.29 per cent stake in PVI Holdings to IFC.

Together, they own more than 51 per cent, and own more than 54 per cent of voting rights.

IFC joins PVI Holdings as an additional long-term anchor investor alongside HDI Global and Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PVN), who remain major shareholders.

HDI Global and IFC, including two investment funds managed by the IFC Asset Management Company – IFC Emerging Asia Fund and IFC Financial Institutions Growth Fund -- intend to join forces and improve PVI Group's corporate governance, risk management and compliance policies, aligning them with international best practices.

They also intend to consolidate PVI's position as the leading provider of insurance solutions in Vietnam’s commercial and industrial sectors and drive its expansion into Southeast Asia.

Besides, they seek to expand its status as a leading provider of non-life insurance products.

Long-term commitment

Following the sale of the shares to IFC, HDI Global will continue to remain the biggest shareholder in PVI Holdings with 45.9 per cent of the charter capital and 48.1 per cent of voting rights.

It intends to retain the investment and achieve majority shareholding over the long term.

Việt Nam is part of the emerging economic regions in Southeast Asia.

Through its shareholding in PVI Holdings, HDI Global is one of the leading property insurers in the region, and hopes to expand its dominance.

Since its purchase of stakes in PVI Holdings, HDI Global has played a significant role in supporting the regional expansion of the company with management know-how.

As a result, the insurer has created a large number of jobs for highly qualified people in Việt Nam.

IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in developing countries.

IFC Asset Management Company, one of its divisions, mobilises and manages capital for investment in businesses in developing and frontier markets.

As an industrial lines insurer, HDI Global SE meets the needs of SMEs, industrial companies and corporate customers with insurance solutions that are specifically tailored to their requirements.

In addition to its prominent position in the German and European markets, the company also has operations in more than 150 countries through foreign branch offices, subsidiary and peer companies and network partners.

HÀ NỘI — The electronics industry is forecast to have a robust year, driven by the increase in demand for communication's products due to demand caused by social distancing measures implemented to tackled rising cases of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade said that as the COVID-19 pandemic has developed exports of many products saw significant drops although some key industrial products saw considerable increases in the first seven months of this year.

Statistics showed that the export of phones and components brought in $29.35 billion from January – July, up 11.9 per cent against the same period last year. More than 128 mobile phones were produced in the period, up by 14.1 per cent.

That Việt Nam’s phones and components exports kept growing was a good sign, signalling a year of strong growth for the electronics industry, which would contribute significantly to the country’s economic recovery and to achieving growth targets, the ministry said.

Phones and components were the top export products of Việt Nam, which account for 15.8 per cent of the country’s total export revenue in the first seven months of this year, followed by electronic products, computers, and components with an export value of $27.4 billion.

The ministry said that the electronics industry would continue to grow in the remaining months of this year, driven by the increase in demand for communication products. A number of companies that produce computer and electronics products in other countries had been forced to close down due to the impacts of the virus.

The ministry predicted that the export value of computers, electronic components and other products of Việt Nam would hit US$50 billion this year, representing a rise of 13.5 per cent against 2020.

Nguyễn Thị Thu Thủy, Deputy Director of the Trade Promotion Agency’s Export Promotion Centre, said that the Vietnamese economy continued to see significant changes in the structure of export products. From a country with agricultural products and labour-intensive products being the main exports, Việt Nam was gradually transitioning to producing more high-tech export products with higher added value such as electronics and electronic components.

The ministry said that Việt Nam's electronics products were exported to more than 100 countries including China, ASEAN, Japan and the Republic of Korea and were expanding their presence in EU markets.

In the first quarter of this year, Việt Nam granted licences for capital increases for a number of electronic products, including Korea's LG Display Hải Phòng and Singapore's Fukang Technology. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — Registration fees for new electric cars are to be cut by half compared to those with internal combustion engines, following recommendations by the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

It is hoped the reduced fee will encourage more consumers to go electric, a growing trend around the world, as part of the country's effort to combat pollution and be more environmentally friendly.

The registration reductions mean that owners of, for example, VinFast's new model VF e34 with a retail price tag of VNĐ690 million (US$30,000) will pay VNĐ35-40 million (depending on where they register the vehicle) instead of VNĐ70-80 million.

The fee reduction will be in effect for five years.

The drop in fees will see a reduction in government coffers of around VNĐ5 trillion as car registration fees make up a significant portion of income for provinces and cities. Registration fees for cars accounted for 69 per cent of the total registration fee for all vehicles in 2017, 70 per cent in 2018, 74.6 per cent in 2019 and 79 per cent in 2020.

The fee reduction will not apply to owners of used electric cars, who will have to pay around 2 per cent of the vehicle's price tag, minus depreciation.

The country's largest conglomerate and sole electric vehicle maker VinGroup has asked the Government to grant special consumption tax cuts and registration fee reductions for electric cars. The group also produces cars with internal combustion engines and electric bikes.

Multiple ministries have voiced support for the proposal.

Deputy minister of transport Lê Đình Thọ said the switch to electric vehicles would help reduce the country's carbon emissions in line with international environment and climate change agreements.

Regarding the cuts in special consumption tax, also for a period of five years, the Ministry of Finance said this matter must be decided by the National Assembly. For the cuts to be even considered, the National Assembly must be willing to make modifications to the country's Laws on Special Consumption Tax, which unlike registration fees do not fall under the Government's discretion.

Right now, the special consumption tax for electric cars is at 15 per cent for vehicles with nine seats or fewer, 10 per cent for 10-16 seaters and 5 per cent for 16-25 seaters.

During the first seven months of 2021, more than 185,000 cars were produced or assembled in Việt Nam, a 40 per cent increase from the same period last year. On average, 838 new cars are sold every day nationwide. — VNS

BÌNH THUẬN — About 650 fishing ships have resumed operations at La Gi Fishing Port in Bình Thuận Province after being suspended for nearly three weeks due to the latest COVID-19 outbreak.

The port in the south-central province’s La Gi Town suspended operation from July 24 under the Prime Minister's Directive No.16 on COVID-19 prevention and control measures.

The town’s People’s Committee on August 12 issued a document to better manage fishing activities under social distancing. The fishing ships will be licensed to operate if crew members have negative COVID-19 test results within 72 hours prior to departure, and the ships install monitoring devices on board.

All ship owners and crew must fully comply with regulations and guidance on pandemic prevention and control measures of the government, local pandemic checkpoint and border guard stations, and inter-sectoral COVID-19 prevention and control stations.

Before leaving the port, the ship captain must have a departure card issued by the local pandemic checkpoint and border guard station.

The ship owner can ask the port management board to prepare food, fuel and other necessities for offshore fishing trips.

After boarding the ship, the crew must stay on board until the ship leaves the port to minimise the risk of infections.

The ship captain must inform the port’s management board about the ship’s registration number and the amount of caught seafood at least three hours in advance before entering the port.

The caught seafood must be unloaded and transported out of the port under the guidance of the port management board.

La Gi Town is one of several COVID-19 hotspots in the province with more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases recorded.

La Gi Fishing Port has the highest density of ships entering and leaving the province and a large-scale anchorage for more than 2,000 ships to avoid storms.

Bình Thuận is one of the four largest fishing grounds in Việt Nam. The province’s fishing industry has gained positive achievements due to COVID-19 prevention and control measures, favourable weather, and cooperation among business firms. — VNS

From a distance, they look just like any other group of kittens, play fighting among themselves without a care in the world.

But closer inspection reveals these are not your average, run-of-the-mill baby cats.

They are seven, two-month old tiger cubs, rescued from the clutches of poachers who tried to illegally traffic them into Việt Nam.

Tiger trafficking is a lucrative business. In the past week alone, 24 tigers have been recovered by the authorities in Việt Nam. Sadly eight didn’t make it.

The population of the world’s largest cat has declined by 93 per cent in the last century and it is estimated that only less than 4,000 remain in the wild, making the tiger one of the world’s most endangered species.

Poaching is blamed as the main reason for the fall in numbers.

Thankfully for these seven cubs, the authorities in Việt Nam managed to rescue them from an uncertain future, but only after a high-speed car chase that ended when the suspect’s vehicle crashed into a police car in the early hours of August 1 in Nghệ An Province.

“After receiving information from Nghệ An Environment Police about seven baby tigers seized from illegal transportation, we immediately went to the police station to collect them,” Lưu Trung Kiên, Deputy Director of Pù Mát National Park, told Việt Nam News.

“When we arrived, the cubs were in a bad condition, because they hadn’t been fed for a long time. The cubs were really young, so we prepared milk to feed them right there at the police station. We waited for them to get better and took them to Pù Mát National Park.”

Although their origin for now is still unknown, with investigations still taking place, the cubs are suspected to have been smuggled into the country from Laos.

A spokesman for the Public Security Office of Nghệ An Police, said: “Most of these tiger cubs are smuggled from illegal tiger farms.

“They are sold to different places for illegal breeding. As in most cases of illegal wildlife trafficking from Hà Tĩnh to Nghệ An and to the North, it is more than likely that these tigers had come across the border from Laos.”

Now the baby tigers are being nursed back to health by the organisation Save Vietnam’s Wildlife. And that doesn’t come cheap.

Director Nguyễn Văn Thái said food alone for these hungry cubs can cost in the region of VNĐ100 million each month.

“The bigger the tigers are, the more it costs,” said Thái.

“Taking care of tiger cubs is like taking care of children. Milk must be given every four hours, and we have to give them plenty of time to exercise to ensure they develop both their bones and muscles and supplement nutrients such as calcium.”

Safe for now, the next step of the journey for the rescued cubs is challenging. Their current habitat at the rescue centre is only a stop-gap solution.

Thái added: “There is nowhere in the world where tigers are born and raised in captivity and then released into the wild because in captivity, they lose many of their wild, predatory instincts.

“In addition, because tigers have been cared for by humans, they are familiar with humans. If released back into the wild, they may approach villages around the forest, posing a danger to local people.

“Therefore, finding a long-term solution, both to care for those tigers, and for educational purposes, or to build controlled, semi-wild areas to care for and restore the natural behaviour of these creatures and making long-term programmes later is one of the major challenges.”

In another development, on August 4, the Economic Police Division and the Environmental Police Department, in collaboration with the Yên Thành District Police, raided two illegal tiger breeding facilities in the Đô Thành Commune, Yên Thành District in Nghệ An Province.

Police seized 17 live adult tigers, some weighing more than 200kg. They were transported to the Mường Thanh Ecological Area in Diễn Châu District while further investigations are carried out.

Eight of the big cats have since died.

According to the WWF, there are only about five tigers left in the wild in Việt Nam. Their decline leads to ecological disruption.

Thái said: “This illegal trade has led to the loss of natural tiger populations in Việt Nam and many Southeast Asian countries, leading to an ecological imbalance, because tigers control the populations of many other mammals in nature.

“They are an important part of the food chain. Losing tigers in the wild will disrupt the ecological balance, affecting biodiversity.” — VNS

CENTRAL REGION — Doctors from Đà Nẵng’s Centre for Disease Control (CDC) have warned of an increase in COVID-19 infections in lockdown zones as the daily average has remained around 63 cases since lockdown began on August 3.

The CDC said 19 out of 56 people – 34 per cent – at five locked-down wards in the district tested positive for SARS-COV-2 on Wednesday.

Testing has been sped up, while everyone is required to stay at home.

Travel among residents would spark increasing numbers of coronavirus infections in Sơn Trà District, and a travel ban must be strictly controlled by local authorities.

The district has allocated mobile food vans to locked-down areas, while home delivery services by community volunteers has been in place since August 5.

Up to 30 tonnes of vegetables have been taken to locked down residential areas on Tuesday, while the district received a donation of 15 tonnes of farm produce from Quảng Nam Province.

The CDC also said the city is treating 43 severe cases of COVID-19 out of 1,067 patients at hospitals since July 10.

The city’s People’s Committee has been discussing banning all travel throughout the city for a week.

Meanwhile, coronavirus infections have been controlled in Quảng Nam Province, as shopping, outdoor sporting activities and take-away food courts were resumed in Tam Kỳ city from Tuesday.

Mass gatherings at public sites are still restricted in the city.

The province reported that half of infection cases (100 out of 231) had been quarantined, while 7,600 were isolated at home since July 18.

The Islands’ district of Lý Sơn, off the coast of QUảng Ngãi Province, has asked for a ban on all travel from the mainland.

The islands have not recorded any cases since the pandemic hit the region from 2020.

The provincial health department reported that seriously-ill COVID-19 patients only accounted for 4.2 per cent of current 190 patients receiving treatment.

It said 207 COVID-19 patients had been released after treatment at hospitals since June 26. VNS

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nguyễn Quốc Hùng, general secretary of the Việt Nam Banking Association

Outbreaks of COVID-19, especially in the first half of 2021, are negatively affecting the repayment of debt. This increases the pressure of bad debt on the banking system.

Nguyễn Quốc Hùng, general secretary of the Việt Nam Banking Association, spoke to Vietnam News Agency about this issue.

What do you think about the banks' process of restructuring bad debt?

The implementation of Resolution No. 42/2017/QH14 on the settlement of bad debts of credit institutions has recorded many positive results. Specifically, the resolution has created a legal corridor for credit institutions to recover debts.

Agencies have also actively supported banks in debt recovery and handling of collateral. Moreover, customers' awareness of debt repayment is much higher than before.

The credit institutions have been restructuring bad debts to reduce the bad debt ratio to a safe level.

At the same time, the professional level in analysis, appraisal and evaluation of new loans of bank employees has also been improved, thus restricting bad debts.

However, the development of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting production and business activities and the whole economy.

The State Bank of Việt Nam has issued Circular 03/2021/TT-NHNN on amending and supplementing a number of articles of Circular No. 01/2020/TT-NHNN on credit institutions and foreign bank branches carrying out debt rescheduling and giving exemption from or reduction of loan interest and charges to help their clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Debt recovery at present is very difficult for credit institutions due to regulations on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it relies mainly on the customer's sense of debt repayment.

An important job for the banks is to urge their customers to concentrate on the payment of old debts. Then, they propose plans on paying new debts to stabilise business in the post-pandemic period.

At this moment, I think that banks have built their own scenarios. Besides reducing interest rates to support people, the banks have also actively improved their financial capacity to ensure good operations in the future.

Many banks have gained large profits in the context of businesses and the economy facing difficulties. What do you think about this?

Bank profits need to be viewed comprehensively and objectively. This profit is the result of a long restructuring process in the past five years. The banks have spent all resources to raise their charter capital and capital adequacy ratio (CAR). There are banks that have not paid dividends for many years to reserve capital for risk.

On the other hand, the banks are implementing debt restructuring according to the State Bank's regulations, so they do not have to make provision for risks. Therefore, profits tend to increase.

Another factor is that the application of digital banking has created favourable conditions for customers and also brought benefits to the banks. Because when the customers do not use cash, the amount of money in their accounts will increase. This is the demand deposit with a very low-interest rate so there is a big gap between the interest of the demand deposit and lending interest rates.

What is the credit growth outlook in the last six months of the banking system? What solution is there to achieve the growth target but still ensure credit quality?

The State Bank has recently adjusted credit targets. This is a very appropriate step at present. The pandemic is very complicated, but I hope that with strong solutions from the Government, it will soon be controlled.

Then business will return to stability and continue production. The businesses whose production was interrupted due to the pandemic will resume operation with higher working intensity and greater capital needs. Therefore, the banks also need to create favourable conditions to give financial supports to those businesses.

In addition, enterprises producing essential goods for domestic use and export also need capital. The banks need to evaluate the efficiency of the enterprises' business plans to provide capital in a timely manner. This is an opportunity for production recovery.

Meanwhile, the State Bank of Việt Nam recently approved credit room extensions for several banks, signalling that priority would be given to credit institutions that reduced lending rates to support businesses and people to overcome the impact of the pandemic by year-end. — VNS

HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Health has allowed HCM City to use one million doses of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine Vero Cell.

The shipment of the vaccine, imported by the State-owned Saigon Pharmaceutical Group (Sapharco) in HCM City, arrived at the city’s Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport on July 31.

Early in July, the health ministry gave permission for Sapharco to import Vero Cell with the sponsorship of Vạn Thịnh Phát Holdings Group, a private conglomerate founded by a Vietnamese national of Chinese origin in HCM City.

The vaccines are being preserved at the company’s cold storage and have not yet used pending quality controls.

The Ministry of Health said the vaccines meet requirements for administration after being examined by the National Institute for Control of Vaccine and Biologicals.

Vero Cell was approved for emergency use by the WHO in May, and given conditional approval for use in Việt Nam on June 4. The first 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government to Việt Nam have been used for Chinese nationals living and working in the country, Vietnamese residents in border areas with China and people who engage in trade and service exchanges with Việt Nam's northern neighbour. — VNS

QUẢNG NGÃI — A pregnant woman who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 successfully gave birth to a boy at the Quảng Ngãi Provincial Obstetrics and Pediatrics hospital on Thursday.

The baby, weighing 2.8kg, is being looked after at the hospital, while the mother has been sent to quarantine at the lung hospital for COVID-19 patients.

She was rescued by local traffic police when her family was driving a motorbike back to their hometown in Nghệ An Province from southern Bình Dương Province on Thursday.

The 26-year-old woman needed help when the family, including a two-year old boy, took a break at Phổ Cường Commune of the province. The traffic police then took her to the hospital just hours before she gave birth.

Two traffic police officers who escorted the pregnant woman to the hospital were quarantined as soon as the woman, her husband and two-year-old son tested positive for coronavirus at the hospital.

This is the second time a woman with COVID-19 has given birth successfully in the province after a similar case on June 30.

Doctors said the baby boy has been receiving special care at the hospital, and tests for COVID-19 will be given later. VNS

QUẢNG TRỊ ­— A man in the central province of Quảng Trị has successfully developed an organic farming model in combination with online trading of safe food.

Nguyễn Đăng Vương, a 37-year-old farmer in Vĩnh Chấp Commune of Vĩnh Linh District, has contributed to protecting consumer health and increased his income.

Vương had long-held the desire to build his own brand of safe organic food to the market.

So in 2015, when he had the opportunity to visit Japan, he went to study organic fertiliser production, microbial feed and organic farming.

By visiting and studying domestic and foreign organic models for a long time, he was able to build his own business.

In 2019, Vương decided to use his modest savings to set up a farm on his family’s 4 hectares of agricultural land.

By early last year, he had invested more than VNĐ1 billion (US$43,600) in setting up nine separate and closed breeding areas.

His farm is currently raising more than 3,000 chickens, 1,000 ducks and more than 30 pigs, including domestic pigs and wild boar hybrids.

He faced many difficulties and failures, which initially discouraged him.

“The first days were the most difficult time. After many times of failing to incubate probiotics for animal feed, I wanted to give up,” said Vương. “But I thought ‘no pain, no gain’ and I was determined to keep going. If one batch was spoiled, I made another one. After many failures, I finally found the right formula and ratio.”

His animals were fed organic foods made by himself as he absolutely refused to use weight gaining substances and antibiotics.

A highlight of Vương’s organic farming model is the use of spoiled and leftover fruit and vegetables from markets, households, schools and restaurants to process animal feed.

He collects the fruit and vegetables, then purees and brews them using micro-fermentation with garlic yeast and other substances.

To increase protein for animal feed, he raises black fly larvae and uses by-products such as fish heads, intestines, beer and bean residue.

The animal feed is only fed to livestock and poultry after being processed in accordance with the accurate procedures.

He takes a month longer than conventional breeding farms to sell his animals because they do not use stimulants and weight gaining substances.

However, he says that his animals are less susceptible to diseases, and as the meat and eggs have no antibiotics or chemical residues they are more delicious.

Vương’s meat and eggs are favoured by the market and sold at 30-35 per cent higher than other produce.

Online trading

To find stable buyers for his products, Vương uses social networks and apps such as Facebook, YouTube and Zalo for marketing and sales.

Through these channels, he has uploaded hundreds of videos sharing his experience organically raising chickens, pigs and ducks as well as promoting his produce to consumers.

He has made video clips about the process of producing animal feed, raising animals, butchering, meat processing and product packaging.

Gradually, his produce has gained a foothold in the market.

To meet the needs of consumers, besides wholesale, he also directly delivers goods to households.

Every year, Vương makes VNĐ180-200 million (US$4,200-4,500) in profit.

Vương’s farm has also created regular jobs for five local labourers with an average monthly income of VNĐ5-6 million per person.

From the initial success, Vương is investing in building a brand of Vĩnh Chấp Organic Chicken and establishing Vương Tây Sơn Clean Agriculture Cooperative with the aim of helping other farmers in his hometown.

Lê Đức Quang Huy, chairman of Farmers' Association of Vĩnh Chấp Commune said: “Vương’s model of organic farming and clean food production is a new and successful direction in the locality. The model has not only brought high economic values to his family but also created jobs for local labourers in the commune.”

In the near future, the association plans to expand Vương’s model in the commune and establish an organic livestock cooperative in order to develop agricultural production. – VNS

HÀ NỘI — Hà Nội plans to test a total of 1.3 million people for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between August 9 and 17.

This is believed to be the largest sample collection ever in the city.

High-risk groups would be prioritised for testing.

The first priority is the red group. The group includes people who live in wards and communes at very high risk of infection and people who have to travel and meet people for work.

The second priority is the orange group. The group includes people working in factories, enterprises, production facilities, traditional markets, supermarkets, hospitals and medical centres and people in risk areas according to regulations of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control.

The last priority is the green group. The group consists of people who live in “green zones”, which means pandemic-free areas in the city, who do not have to travel or come into contact with other people.

The testing drive is part of the local health sector’s efforts to detect cases, curb the outbreak and separate COVID-19 patients from the community in order to gradually control the pandemic as per the direction of the Government and the city’s Party Committee.

The funding for the tests will be drawn from the city's budget; sources of aid; support from domestic and foreign organisations and individuals and other lawful sources.

The city’s Party Committee ordered relevant agencies to urgently improve testing capacity to reach over 200,000 samples per day and return the test results as soon as possible.

The committee also tasked agencies to mobilise medical forces of the police, army and private sector to participate in taking samples, ensuring speed, accuracy, efficiency and safety.

To reach the target, chairman of the People’s Committee Chu Ngọc Anh assigned responsibility to the Health Department in testing while the city’s Centre for Disease Control was told to conduct epidemiological investigations as well as identify risk areas and the number of samples needed to be tested.

The city’s districts and towns were asked to co-ordinate in making lists, taking samples, mobilising local forces to ensure a smooth collection of samples and avoid cross infection during the collection of samples, he said. — VNS

It is 4am. Millions of people are sleeping in HCM City.

But on one side of the city, coaches and athletes of HCM City's Sport Training Centre are perspiring from hard work, with their T-shirts covered in dust. They are busy with activities such as preparing vegetables and fruit to support people in need in quarantine.

HCM City has been a national hotspot of the coronavirus for weeks. Currently thousands of positive cases are announced every day, and the city has been under lockdown since July 9.

"Dozens of tonnes of vegetables are coming here from cities and provinces. They are a gift of sponsors to us during these difficult days," said Đoàn Công Tuấn, coach for the tug of war. He is certainly in a war at the moment.

"We are here to help receive the food, divide them into portions and deliver to privileged and poor people. We have to work early in the morning to bring these fresh and green gifts to them in time," he said.

After receiving 18 tonnes of vegetables from Đà Lạt, they continue packing more than 30 tonnes of squash, marrow and peanuts, which travelled through the night to the city.

After the vegetable deliveries, they all move to the Minh Đức Secondary School in District 1 to clean the campus, which is a quarantine area for F0 patients.

"Sometime we are really exhausted but encourage each other to try harder for the day that our city clears of COVID-19. That dream helps us to continue with his meaningful work," Tuấn said.

A little way from Tuấn's place, his athlete Trần Gia Luật also has no time to rest. He is busy all the time, receiving and guiding people in District 7's Tân Quy and Tân Thuận Đông communes who are coming to have tests.

While many people help by staying and training at home under the social distancing rule, Luật converts his unexpected rest into volunteering

The three-time national champion is also student of the Phạm Ngọc Thạch University of Medicine. Following a call of the university's directorate, Luật registered to join the city campaign to resist the deadly disease outbreak.

Together with classmates, he takes part in importing data and taking samples for testing.

He also helps people to check their temperatures, declare their health status online and reminds them to follow the healthcare regulations.

"It is hot today and will heavily rain tomorrow but it cannot stop us from working. We have to use all of our ability to complete work here on time. People in other quarantine areas are waiting for us," said Luật.

"It is really meaningful work. I am happy contributing my energy to the campaign when the country needs me. We are working with a joyful mind and positive spirit. Sometimes, we are nervous when waiting for results, and then it is great to know they are okay. They are like our family members and we all yell 'negativeee!' and laugh out loud."

Support whatever and whenever

It is 11.30am. Under the strong heat of the sun, taekwondo martial artist Châu Tuyết Vân keeps working hard as a medical assistant.

In the outbreak period, all sport activities have been paused. Vân, apart from training herself, has taken part in a programme that provides taekwondo training and English courses. In her rest time, she takes off her uniform to join the COVID fight.

In Gò Vấp District, Vân puts on a protective gown, face mask and shield, gloves, shoes and head covers. She helps answer people's inquiry and instructs them in steps to be tested. She supports medical people to check temperatures, take samples, and clean the area when needed.

After Gò Vấp, she rushes to Thạnh Lộc Commune in District 12 for the same job before going to wholesale markets to deliver fresh produce to people in need.

"Sometime, people do not understand our job. They refused to do the health declaration and shout at us. We have to persuade them a lot and even force them to declare,” said Vân

"But it is just several cases. Otherwise, people love us for what we are doing. They share food and drink with us, so sweet! Their love releases our tiredness and readiness to work harder."

Due the pandemic, volunteering activities can be held anytime. Vân and her team must be ready even if it is early morning or midnight.

"It is a pandemic which is happening through the nation. Volunteers are really important to help the task force. We are athletes but also members of the community. We not only focus on training but also participate in social activities. It is a good way to perfect my personality,” said Vân.

"I know that it is not easy job, and it could put me in dangerous situation but I really want to help. Supporting people brings happiness for me and people who we help. It is my way to strengthen my country."

Recognising the importance of volunteering, former national team goalkeeper Bùi Tiến Dũng also wants to help.

The 2018 Asian U23 championship silver holder supports doctors at Thủ Đức City Hospital.

“The more I go through the more I see people's love and care for each other. Medical workers, police and many others are working hard to fight COVID-19. I believe that to live is to share. You can share whatever you have -- money, energy, love, sympathy and understanding," said Dũng.

"I want to quietly support them, heroes in the frontline against this pandemic. I wish all of them strong and good health."

HCM City FC's Dũng is currently resting as the national football premier league can only return next February.

He is member of the 'We Love Sài Gòn' charity group. With about 100 members including many footballers such as defender Đoàn Văn Hậu and striker Hà Đức Chinh, the group has given away 1,000 meals to poor people, doctors and nurse every day since it started months ago.

Earlier, Dũng and his agent Nguyễn Đắc Văn presented microwaves, high flow nasal devices, protective kits and food to field hospitals around the city.

Dũng lost his place in HCM City FC's first team because of his poor performance, but has set a target of taking his place back when the national leagues come back, and to wins head coach Park Hang-seo's belief in him for a slot in a national team that will have many international challenges in 2022.

He is one of the football stars, such as Trần Hữu Đông Triều and Nguyễn Trọng Hoàng, among many athletes supporting the country with whatever they have and whenever they can. VNS

HCM CITY – Many universities have added another admission method for candidates who are under special consideration for high school graduation this year.

The HCM City University of Economics, for example, has announced the results for students using admission methods that are independent from high school graduation 2021 exam scores.

The school added an admission method for candidates under special consideration for high school graduation in 2021. The new method is based on candidates’ 10th, 11th and 12th grade results and a number of other optional criteria such as international English certificates and prizes from provincial and city competitions, among others.

The HCM City University of Economics has reserved 200 slots for this admission method, 150 of which are for the HCM City campus and 50 for the Vĩnh Long Province branch.

The head of the training department of HCM City University of Economics, Nguyễn Khắc Quốc Bảo, said this was the university’s effort to support students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not affect the criteria of other admission methods based on high school graduation exam scores announced earlier.

The HCM City University of Medicine and Pharmacy has added another full-time university entrance method for students eligible for special consideration for high school graduation in 2021 as well.

Specifically, the school will select students based on their results of the Competency Assessment Exam of Vietnam National University, Hà Nội and Vietnam National University, HCM City in 2021, together with their high school results.

The additional enrollment quota under this method will not exceed three per cent of the target for each faculty that was previously allocated by the school.

To create favorable conditions for 12th graders under special consideration for high school graduation this year, Phạm Ngọc Thạch Medical University also added a method based on candidates’ high school results in five semesters.

Each faculty is expected to add no more than 4 per cent of the target. The admission score is the total results of Math, Chemistry and Biology, plus bonus points.

If many candidates have the same total points for admission, the school will consider the average score for Foreign Language in five semesters, the average score in the 12th grade and the average score in Literature in five semesters.

Candidates applying under this new admission method must meet certain conditions, including good “moral score", and average scores of Math, Chemistry and Biology in five semesters of 6.5 and higher. Other rules are applied for Medicine, Pharmacy and Odonto-Stomatology majors.

International University, under the Vietnam National University, HCM City, has allocated 5 to 10 per cent of the school’s target for the new admission method, while the HCM City University of Agriculture and Forestry has set aside 150 slots.

The additional admission method aims to support new candidates without affecting the interest of candidates who participated in the previous admission methods, according to many schools. – VNS

Hồng Vân & Nguyễn Thu Hà

Six decades since August 10, 1961, the day the first flight carrying Agent Orange/dioxin sprayed the chemical over southern Việt Nam as a defoliant, millions of Vietnamese people are still feeling the losses and pain caused.

Now one young Vietnamese artist born in France has created graphic designs to help people, especially the younger generation, understand more about the history and consequences of the deadly chemical.

Võ Trâm Anh's work features 10 panels about the history of Agent Orange, its consequences on humans and the environment, and a micro-credit project set up to help disabled people in the areas affected by Agent Orange in central province of Quảng Bình.

“Today images, videos, all the visual media are predominant. When you see a big bold image, it always catches your attention,” Anh told Việt Nam News in an online interview.

“To me making a big block of text into something colourful and attractive would draw people's attention even when it’s not a topic that they would have wanted to learn about in the first place.”

The exhibition will be on display at General Union of Vietnamese in France (​UGVF) in Paris until September 18.

Anh first learned about Agent Orange when she was a small child and her interest was inspired by her father.

She added: “I learned about the chemical at primary school age, like seven or eight years old. My dad is a photo journalist and he made a photo report about Agent Orange. He showed me the pictures of people who were exposed to it, consequences of people who were ill or malformed.

“I was young and shocked by these pictures. It stayed in the back of my mind somehow.”

Though six decades have passed, millions of people still bear mental and physical scars of Agent Orange.

Among 4.8 million people who were exposed to it in Việt Nam, hundreds of thousands have already died and millions of others are now suffering serious illnesses, deformities and disabilities.

A Vietnamese French woman Trần Tố Nga filed a claim in 2014 against the multinational corporations that manufactured and sold the toxin which was used by American troops during the war in Việt Nam.

Her claims were refused by France's Evry Court in May this year yet the 79-year-old former war correspondent was successful in bringing the AO issue to international public debate.

Anh, 22, is among hundreds of thousands of people across France who have voiced their support for Nga with movements and a range of advocacy activities.

She said: “The media began to talk about it [the trial] more. I remembered this and with my dad, we went to support events and followed the news.

“I want to share the fight of this woman. If people are aware of this topic, we can spread to the world, create a movement and make the world a better place if possible.”

Anh said the graphic elements would make her work more appealing.

She said: “In March this year I decided to make comic blog posts about it to make this topic more accessible and more widely known for the population.

“I think my audience is quite young so it’s the perfect way to portray the topic that is quite complex at first sight. It has a childish and colourful style, is easy to read and understand so it can make difficult topic more understandable.”

Anh said she hoped to bring her exhibition to the world.

She and the exhibition’s organisers have planned to translate her work into English, Vietnamese and German.

They are also trying to get a room at the city hall of the 13th arrondissement, home to Paris' principal Asian community.

Visitors gather at the exhibition at the General Union of Vietnamese in France.

Võ Định Kim, a representative of Collectif Vietnam Dioxine, an organiser of the exhibition, said the display is one of a series of activities to mark the 60th anniversary since Agent Orange was first used in Việt Nam.

He said this is also a way for them to tell Agent Orange stories and the suffering of the victims, so they can raise their voice against Agent Orange and fight for justice.

Though Anh was not born in Việt Nam, she has felt an urge to learn about her country of origin.

“A lot of people like me who are Vietnamese but born in France don’t really know about the topic because it’s not something you learn at school. It’s always good to have a grasp of what happened in your country of origin especially this kind of topic which I think is upsetting. It’s also very unfair,” she said. VNS

HÀ NỘI — Many Hanoians still remember back about 10 years ago when there were many ponds and lakes in Hà Nội’s inner districts of Cầu Giấy, Nam Từ Liêm, Bắc Từ Liêm, Tây Hồ and Long Biên.

Rapid urbanisation has led to increasing demand for housing and infrastructure. Consequently, ponds and lakes across the city were filled to make room for housing and other construction.

The decrease and disappearance of ponds and lakes in the city has been blamed for serious flooding, environmental pollution and poor living conditions in affected areas.

According to the city’s construction department, there are 125 lakes in Hà Nội’s downtown and some 1,000 lakes in the city’s outskirts.

Đống Đa District used to have up to 30 ponds and lakes. However, over the last 10 years, three ponds around Láng Pagoda and Ba Giang Lake with a total area of nearly 15,000sq.m disappeared.

In Cầu Giấy District, the expanded Nguyễn Văn Huyên Street project killed almost all ponds and lakes in its path. West Lake – the biggest natural lake in Hà Nội’s urban area – has been narrowed from about 550 to 527ha in the last decade alone.

According to a study by the Centre for Environmental and Community Research, until 2015, there were 112 ponds and lakes with a total area of nearly 7 million square metres in Hà Nội’s inner districts.

The lakes are important for air flows and the water cycle, preventing floods and creating the typical urban landscape for Hà Nội.

However, after taking water samples from 30 major lakes in the city, scientists found that six of the lakes were very heavily polluted, eight other lakes were heavily polluted and 11 had signs of pollution due to human activity like directly discharging untreated daily wastewater into lakes, throwing rubbish into the lake and illegally raising fish in the lakes.

Architect Trần Huy Ánh from Hà Nội Architects’ Association said that because ponds and lakes belonged to no individuals, it was easier to fill a pond or part of a lake to serve a construction project rather than land acquisition on residential land or other kinds of land, at least in terms of land clearance and compensation.

“That’s the main reason why so many ponds and lakes in Hà Nội have disappeared,” he said.

Professor Trần Đức Hạ, president of Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association, said that the preservation of ponds and lakes needed a management mechanism and technological solutions.

First of all, Hà Nội needs separate sewage for wastewater and rainwater so that only rainwater can flow into lakes.

There needs to be a quality monitoring system to oversee the quality of lake water regularly.

Only environment-friendly biological products were used to treat lake water and grassroots governments were assigned to take care of the lakes, Hạ said.

Nguyễn Ngọc Lý, founder of the Centre for Environmental and Community Research, said that now, three agencies were usually responsible for caring for a lake.

A water supply and drainage company managed the lake water and the lake bed; a parks and trees management company cared about the trees around the lake; an urban environment and hygiene company dealt with cleanliness around lake banks.

Lý said that the three companies signed contracts with the city’s construction department or People’s Committees of districts or wards where the lakes are located.

The three companies worked separately, and the environmental conditions of the lakes heavily depended on the care and awareness of residents, Lý said, adding that clearer sanctions and co-ordinations in managing the lakes were necessary to preserve the lakes.

Former president of the Institute of Water Engineering and Environmental Technology Trần Hiếu Nhuệ said that Hà Nội could learn from Japan’s experience in which ponds and lakes were managed by the local community.

With national standards and regulations, authorities instructed the community to manage the ponds/lakes and the authorities supervised the lake management. Nhuệ said that Japan’s approach engaged the whole community in caring for lakes and ponds.

Architect and lecturer Nguyễn Nam from the National University of Civil Engineering said that in urban areas, people could easily access lakes as part of public space.

Lakes should be at the centre of any residential areas, he said, adding that the height of buildings near lakes should be limited to creating an open space around the lakes.

“Lakes totally can become typical tourist attractions in Hà Nội,” he said.

Revitalised lakes

In 2017, Hà Nội’s Party Committee issued a resolution on strengthening environmental protection, aiming to improve public awareness and promote environmental activities.

Thanks to the determination from the highest level of the city’s authorities, practical activities have been taken to restore and protects ponds and lakes in the city.

Most recently, at the 17th congress of the city’s Party Committee last October, Hà Nội authorities also affirmed a determination to turn Hà Nội into a sustainable urban area, as well as a smart and modern city with further improved living conditions for people.

Keeping the city green, clean and beautiful is now the determination and responsibility of all agencies and people.

Lâm Du lake in Bồ Đề Ward of Long Biên District is one of the lakes that has seen many differences in the last three years thanks to joint efforts by local authorities and the community.

The lakeshore was embanked, and the pedestrian road was opened around the lake. Residents also grew flowers around the lake and aquatic plants on the water surface.

Bồ Đề Ward People’s Committee chairman Nguyễn Văn Luyện said that together with authorities, residents have kept the lake clean.

“People understand that protecting the lake from environmental pollution is to protect themselves from pollution,” he said.

In public events, people joined decorating the lake with lights and flowers, he said.

As people were not allowed to do outdoor physical activity during social distancing, the lake has become quiet these days. However, for the last few years, it was a popular destination for local people to relax and exercise.

In Ba Đình District’s Trúc Bạch Ward, the 200-metre-long canal from Ngũ Xã 1 Bridge to Ngũ Xã 2 Bridge used to be seriously polluted with stink and blackened water.

However, after the ward raised funds to dredge and embank the canal, it is now a check-in place with murals featuring environmental protection activities.

In Thanh Trì District, a “green weekends” campaign was launched about three years ago, calling on people to clean up the environment every weekend.

Chairman of the district People’s Committee Nguyễn Tiến Cường said that the district paid much attention to clean-up canals, ponds and lakes.

He said that they collected nearly 2,000cu.m of waste around Tô Lịch River running through the district.

Tô Lịch River was once called “a dead river” due to the severe pollution. Now, it has been revitalised.

In the city, many lakeshores have been upgraded to become beautiful landscapes. Many lakes have become ideal places for residents to use as a playground for children and do exercise.

In Dương Liễu Commune of Hoài Đức District, people revitalised a “dying pond,” making it a popular swimming pool for local children.

In 2016, they started dredging the pond, replacing the polluted water with water from drilled wells. They even established a pond management team and set rules to preserve the pond.

Nguyễn Phi Hậu, head of Dương Liễu Commune Swimming Club, said that thanks to the clean pond, they could now teach many children to swim.

The commune is planning to restore two other ponds, so the swimming club can offer swimming classes for more children, Hậu said. VNS

By Nguyễn Mỹ Hà

So we all had high hopes for our beloved Hồ Chí Minh City, often still referred to as Sài Gòn, its former name. But, well, you know what I'm trying to say. Times are tough. Just looking at all the devastation around the southern metropolis is enough to break the will of any man or woman.

COVID, this most vicious of airborne diseases, is reducing humans to that most basic but pivotal function of human life: breathing.

Everyone comes to life at birth with a breath, and then they exhale. If they are not able to breathe again then that is it, life is over. Your heart may still be beating, but once the lungs are not able to take in any fresh air, then it is no use even if other organs are still functioning well.

This deadly disease is an invisible enemy. It gets into your system and your cells and multiplies fast to destroy your respiratory organs. It reduces the oxygen in your blood and makes you gasp for air.

Doctors throughout the world are telling us how to combat the virus: be cautious with your breath, use facemasks as a guard, keep your distance.

In the mid-seventies Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Nhật Ánh wrote a popular poem Thành phố tình yêu và nỗi nhớ (The City of Love and Nostalgia); though it does not mention Sài Gòn directly, everyone knows what it is about. It contains the poignant lyrics, "Darling, listen, can you hear the city breathe?"

In March 1976, the writer had left Sài Gòn with thousands of other young men and women to venture further into distant lands, clearing landmines, reclaiming land, and helping to rebuild the nation. Away from the hustle and the bustle of the city, he was full of its memories: the age-old green foliage of the tamarind trees, familiar winding roads, the wharf along Sài Gòn River, images he soon set to poetry.

Composer Phạm Minh Tuấn was so moved by the words he even put them to music. As an activist, Tuấn had spent many years living in the jungle and like Ánh was also nostalgic for the great southern city. The song was eventually sung by Cẩm Vân and became an instant hit. Today, the notion of listening to the city breathing feels like a more powerful metaphor than ever before.

In 1976, reunified Việt Nam's National Assembly voted to change the name of Sài Gòn to Hồ Chí Minh City, to commemorate the founder of contemporary Việt Nam, but many in the city still refer to it by its old name, or simply as The City. The city's breath can be heard in the rhythm of its early birds, or in its workers from around the country who went there to find an opportunity, a raise or a better living.

But these days, the city is gasping for breath. Respiratory machines are needed, quite literally.

A new community Facebook group called, Nhóm cứu trợ oxy, giúp nhau mùa dịch (Oxygen Relief Group, Pandemic Help) was put together on August 5, with 850 signed up members with an active list of oxygen cylinder providers and transportation for coronavirus patients that need treatment in their homes.

The sudden surge in oxygen cylinder demand has pushed the cost up to VNĐ4 to 5 million each, though it is recommended people only buy them with a doctor’s prescription.

Patients can order oxygen as doctors prescribe, but with a daily increase in the city of around 3,000 to 4,000 patients, it is hard for a people to present their prescriptions to oxygen providers.

Since the group has been set up, many urgent calls for cylinders have been posted in the group and charitable donors have also provided oxygen cylinders free of charge, if you tell them your doctor prescribed its use.

On one hand, it is a relief to see people get what they need as fast as possible, but on the other these cylinders pose a risk insofar as they could explode if not managed well according to instructions.

Watch our video on the oxygen delivery service in HCM City

Last week, a 40-year-old father had to violate the city's curfew to venture out for an oxygen cylinder for his son, who was fighting another disease. He was arrested for his violation, but his story moved many people, including Hoàng Tuấn Anh, the creator of the country’s now famous 'Rice ATMs', which provided rice to thousands in need during the three previous coronavirus waves.

Ever the practical sort, he soon came up with an oxygen ATM machine network, teaming up with Việt Nam's Young Entrepreneurs Association and HCM City's youth union organisation to make his idea a reality.

He reportedly said that after sharing his Oxygen ATM on social media, he received an urgent call from someone who asked for help with oxygen to save their father's life.

As part of the network, volunteer delivery teams using protective gear set up oxygen cylinders near the homes of patients. Teams will set up oxygen ATM stations free of charge in all districts of Thủ Đức City. The Young Entrepreneurs Association shall provide 900 8-litre cylinders to be used at the stations

Patients who need a refill can call a hotline and volunteers will deliver to their homes. Those who need a new cylinder can borrow them free of charge.

Everyone is working their best to help the city regain its normal breath, so that it can get back to being strong and helping others again.

The city has been locked down for a long time but things can and will return to normal. For now, all we can do is stay calm, take a deep breath and keep up the fight. We are all with you. VNS
