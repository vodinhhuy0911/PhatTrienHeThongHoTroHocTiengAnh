A Chinese court has sentenced Canadian Michael Spavor to 11 years on spying charges in a case linked to Huawei.

Spavor was detained in 2018 after his government arrested an executive of the Chinese tech giant.

The verdict Wednesday is the latest indication of how Beijing is stepping up pressure on Canada ahead of a court ruling on whether to hand over the executive, Meng Wanzhou, to face U.S. criminal charges.

Spavor and another Canadian were detained in China in what critics labeled “hostage politics” after the executive’s 2018 arrest in connection with possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.

Canadian Ambassador Dominic Barton was present at the hearing in the city of Dandong, on the North Korean border. No word has been given about a trial date for former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, who was also detained in December 2018 and charged with spying.

Diplomats from the United States, Japan, Britain, Australia, Germany, other European countries and the European Union gathered at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing in a show of support. They also have issued separate appeals for Spavor and Kovrig to receive fair trials or to be released.

“These proceedings are a blatant attempt to use human beings as bargaining leverage,” the top U.S. diplomat in China, David Meale, said in a statement. “Human beings should never be used as bargaining chips.”

On Tuesday, another Chinese court rejected the appeal of a third Canadian whose prison term in a drug case was abruptly increased to death following the executive’s arrest.

The court sent the case to China’s supreme court for review, a required step before a death sentence can be carried out.

The Canadian government criticized the ruling as arbitrary and the penalty as “cruel and inhumane.”

“We condemn the verdict in the strongest possible terms and call on China to grant Robert clemency,” Ambassador Barton told reporters by phone after attending the appeals hearing in Shenyang, about 12 miles west of Dandong.

Schellenberg was convicted of smuggling nearly 450 pounds of methamphetamine, according to the court.

Asked whether the three cases were linked to Meng’s, Barton said, “I don’t think it’s a coincidence these are happening right now while events are going on in Vancouver.” He said the case was “part of the geopolitical process.”

The ambassador said Canadian diplomats talked with Schellenberg after the ruling but declined to give details.

“He is remarkably composed,” Barton said. “We had a good conversation.”

Two other Canadians, Fan Wei and Xu Weihong, also were sentenced to death on drug charges in separate cases in 2019 as relations between Beijing and Ottawa deteriorated.

Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies and daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested Dec. 1, 2018, in Vancouver on U.S. charges of lying to the Hong Kong arm of the British bank HSBC about possible dealings with Iran in violation of trade sanctions.

A judge in Vancouver is due to hear final arguments in the next few weeks about whether Meng should be extradited to the United States. Her lawyers argue that the case is politically motivated and what she is accused of isn’t a crime in Canada.

China’s government has denounced the arrest as part of U.S. efforts to hamper its technology development and demanded Meng’s immediate release.

Canada and other governments including Australia and the Philippines face growing Chinese pressure including trade boycotts in disputes over human rights, the coronavirus and territorial claims. Washington has warned Americans that they face “a heightened risk of arbitrary detention” in China for reasons other than to enforce the law.

The Huawei case is one of a series of conflicts between Beijing and other governments over China’s technology ambitions, the coronavirus, human rights, Hong Kong and claims to control over the South China and East China Seas.

China has tried to pressure Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government by imposing restrictions on imports of canola seed oil and other products from Canada.

Meanwhile, Beijing is blocking imports of Australian wheat, wine and other products after the government in Canberra called for an investigation into the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@U.S. health officials are investigating the latest fatal case of a rare tropical disease typically found in South Asia.

An unidentified person who died last month in Georgia was the fourth U.S. case this year of melioidosis, which is caused by a bacterium that lives in soil and water, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.

None of the cases from Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota or Texas were in people who had traveled internationally, puzzling experts. The CDC said two of the four people died.

Federal health officials sent an alert about the latest case to doctors, asking them to consider melioidosis if they come across a bacterial infection that doesn’t respond to antibiotics — even if the patient has not traveled outside the country. The CDC said the infection is treatable if caught early and treated correctly.

Though the illnesses were found in different states at different times, the agency said lab analyses showed the infections were closely related.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A fund set up to provide money to victims of financier Jeffrey Epstein announced Monday that it has largely completed its work after agreeing to disburse nearly $125 million to more than 135 people.

The announcement came from Jordana Feldman, the administrator of the Epstein Victims Compensation Program, which since late June of last year has operated independently of Epstein’s estate.

Epstein, 66, killed himself in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail a month after his arrest on sex-trafficking charges. Dozens of women have alleged that Epstein for decades sexually abused teenage girls and women, often by turning mansion massages into sexual assaults.

Feldman said 92% of 150 eligible applicants accepted what was offered by the fund, which received 225 claims, far more than the roughly 100 or so claims that were expected based on the number of women who had sued and spoken to lawyers.

Payouts were generally processed and paid within two to three months after claimants shared their experiences in confidential meetings, according to a release from the fund.

Feldman, who declined to provide details about the claimants, said she met individually with more than 200 fund applicants and tried to put them at ease at the outset by saying nothing would be recorded, leading them to “kind of relax their shoulders a little bit.”

“I do think that there was a sense of comfort knowing that this was a safe space to share their stories. And I think that the process was exhausting but empowering for many of these victims — empowerment in having come forward and reclaiming a sense of control and ownership in their own narrative,” she said.

Feldman said she also did not record the meetings because she didn’t want to create an extra record of the meetings, which occurred as criminal probes continue into Epstein and those who might have aided in his sex crimes since the 1990s. His ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges and awaits a November trial in Manhattan federal court.

Though the meetings were scheduled for one hour, some went much longer, Feldman said.

“It was for many of the victims the first time they told their stories from the beginning,” she said.

The fund was designed as an alternative to lawsuits, which can take years to proceed to a payout.

Awards were not by formula but instead were calculated after a study of numerous factors, including the victim’s age, severity of abuse, frequency and impact of abuse, the extent of collaboration and the general credibility of the claim, Feldman said.

Brad Edwards, a Florida attorney who had several dozens clients participate in the process, called the claim program “largely successful.”

“The majority of victims accepted the determination of the administrators, settled their cases, and were happy to get through this process and resume healing,” Edwards said in an email.

He said some victims, though, “felt the determination from the program was inadequate and will be litigating their claims.”

The fund was established with help from Kenneth Feinberg, who oversaw compensation funds for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and of clerical sex abuse within New York’s Roman Catholic archdiocese. Feldman said she worked for a decade on the Sept. 11 compensation fund.

The payouts were financed with money from Epstein’s estate, including expenses of $8 million to $9 million, Feldman said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime accusers sued Britain’s Prince Andrew on Monday, taking to a formal venue her repeated accusations that he sexually assaulted her when she was 17.

Lawyers for Virginia Giuffre filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court, where Epstein was charged criminally with sex-trafficking a month before he killed himself in August 2019 in an adjacent federal jail where he was ordered to await trial.

Giuffre has repeatedly made her allegations against Epstein, his onetime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew, but the lawsuit represents the first time she has directly confronted the prince in such a formal setting. It steps up public relations pressure on the prince, even if he remains beyond the reach of the courts.

In a statement, Giuffre said she was “holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me.”

“The powerful and rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions. I hope that other victims will see that it is possible not to live in silence and fear, but to reclaim one’s life by speaking out and demanding justice,” Giuffre said.

“I did not come to this decision lightly,” she added. “As a mother and a wife, my family comes first — and I know that this action will subject me to further attacks by Prince Andrew and his surrogates. But I knew if I did not pursue this action, I would be letting them and victims everywhere down.”

In late 2019, Prince Andrew told the BBC’s Newsnight program that he never had sex with Giuffre, saying, “It didn’t happen.”

He said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting her and told an interviewer that there were “a number of things that are wrong” about Giuffre’s account, which alleges that the encounter occurred in 2001.

“I can absolutely, categorically tell you it never happened,” the prince said.

The interview was widely panned by critics who said Andrew seemed insensitive to Epstein’s victims. Afterward, the prince quit royal duties.

Giuffre has long said Maxwell recruited her when she was 17 to be sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell from 1999 to 2002.

The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, alleges that the prince abused Giuffre on multiple occasions when she was under 18. “Express or implied threats” were made to Giuffre by Epstein, Maxwell and/or Andrew to persuade her to engage in sexual acts with the prince, the lawsuit said.

It said that she “feared death or physical injury to herself or another and other repercussions for disobeying” the trio because of their “powerful connections, wealth and authority.”

It said that on one occasion, Prince Andrew sexually abused her in Maxwell’s London home when Epstein, Maxwell and the prince forced her to have sex with the prince against her will.

Advertisement

On another occasion, the prince sexually abused Giuffre in Epstein’s New York mansion when Maxwell forced Giuffre and another victim to sit on Andrew’s lap as he touched her, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit also alleged that Andrew sexually abused Giuffre on Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Andrew knew her age at the time based on communications with Epstein and Maxwell, the lawsuit added. It said he went ahead anyway “for the purpose of gratifying his sexual desires.”

The lawsuit was brought under the Child Victims Act, a 2019 New York state law that allows victims to temporarily make legal claims of abuse that occurred when they were children regardless of when or how long ago the alleged abuse occurred.

Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges in Manhattan federal court, where she faces trial in November. She is being held without bail. Her lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.

As part of a continuing probe into Epstein and his encounters with women and teenage girls, Manhattan federal prosecutors last year formally requested to speak with Prince Andrew, who is Queen Elizabeth II’s second son.

Advertisement

The request, similar to issuing a subpoena, was made under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, an agreement between the U.S. and Britain to share evidence and information in criminal cases. U.S. prosecutors reportedly made a formal request through the British government to interview Andrew.

Brad Edwards, a lawyer who represents dozens of Epstein victims, has said that the prince has failed to answer questions for civil lawsuits before.

“I’ve always been given the impression that, whether he has immunity or not, he certainly behaves like he does,” Edwards said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The superintendent of the school district in Florida’s capital said Monday that he will require students to wear masks amid an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations fueled by the Delta variant, defying the governor’s attempts to block schools from imposing such a mandate.

Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office responded by saying the state’s Board of Education could move to withhold salaries from the superintendent or school board members. Though the Leon County mandate allows exemptions for students with a physician’s or psychologist’s note, it doesn’t give parents the authority to opt out, as DeSantis wanted.

Leon County Schools Supt. Rocky Hanna said in a livestreamed announcement that children from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade will be required to wear masks when classes resume in Tallahassee on Wednesday.

“I did a lot of soul searching, a lot of thinking,” Hanna said. “If, heaven forbid, we lost a child to this virus, I can’t just simply blame the governor of the state of Florida. I can’t.”

Ordered by DeSantis, the Florida Department of Health issued an emergency rule last week saying districts must allow parents to decide whether their children will wear masks. DeSantis’ office said in a statement that the Leon County district’s new policy “blatantly violates the spirit of the executive order and the rules.”

The superintendent said he had sent a letter to DeSantis asking for permission to enforce a temporary mask mandate, but received no response.

The Republican governor issued an executive order in late July for the education and health departments to come up with ways of punishing school districts that mandate mask wearing in classrooms. DeSantis maintains that enforcing masks violates parental rights. He cites Florida’s new Parents Bill of Rights law that says parents have the freedom to make decisions about their children’s health and education.

Two Florida school districts first stepped up last week to announce that they would follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and require masks when they restart classes later this week. Four others have adopted mask policies since then, and more are having discussions this week. But most have clarified that parents can opt out.

On Monday, more than 13,600 people in Florida were hospitalized with COVID-19, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and more than 2,800 of them required intensive care.

State Sen. Lauren Book, the Democratic leader, sent a letter to the 67 superintendents asking them to implement mask rules due to the rise in cases and hospitalizations.

“We understand that public schools, school districts, and school boards are facing unprecedented pressure to bow to the wishes of a Governor and administration adamantly opposed to any measure that might be perceived as counter to future political ambitions,” Book wrote. “But we believe in and support local rule.”

On Friday, Florida’s Board of Education approved an emergency rule granting private school vouchers for children who feel they are being harassed by a district’s COVID-19 safety policies, including mask requirements. Traditionally, vouchers have been awarded to children who are being bullied.

The board of one of the largest school districts in Broward County will be discussing the mask mandate on Tuesday.

Jennifer Ellis, a mother of two sons from that district, said many parents are scared about their children getting infected and are now struggling with what to do. She said she worries about her unvaccinated 11-year-old boy, who is severely autistic but able to wear masks.

“If you don’t feel comfortable sending your kid back, there are no options,” Ellis said. “I wasn’t worried until the Delta [variant] came along. If the kids get infected, that’s going to throw us into quarantine and close schools. That is what is harmful for the children. I just want the kids to be healthy.”

In Orange County, home to Orlando, school officials changed their policy to require masks while making it very easy for students to opt out. All employees and visitors will be required to wear masks, but they don’t get to opt out.

“Parents, just send a note, a one-liner, saying, ‘I’ve decided to opt out.’ It’s as simple as that,” said Barbara Jenkins, superintendent for Orange County Public Schools. “We respect parents’ decisions.”

Both policies will last for the first month of in-person classes and then be reevaluated.

Officials in Orlando said Monday that they would be offering vaccines at Camping World Stadium near downtown starting Tuesday to accommodate increasing demand. Last week, twice as many people got vaccinated in Orange County as during a similar time frame in early July.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Brown University has systematically and repeatedly failed to protect women from rape and other sexual misconduct, according to a federal class-action lawsuit filed recently by four current and former female students.

The suit, which was filed last Friday in federal court in Providence, alleges the Ivy League school in Rhode Island actively prevented the reporting of incidents of sexual violence and perpetuated a culture of silence on campus.

One of the women said she was advised against making a formal complaint after being sexually assaulted at a party hosted by rugby team members because it happened off campus, where officials said it would be more difficult to hold someone accountable.

Another said the university found her alleged assailant responsible for her sexual assault, but then named him a speaker at the school’s commencement ceremony while he was appealing the case. The woman said the university overturned his assault finding and sanctioned her after she went public with her concerns about his role in commencement. The male student ultimately didn’t speak at graduation.

Kim Evans, one of the lawyers representing the women, said Monday that the women’s experiences dealing with university administrators are particularly shocking given they come years after the #MeToo movement sparked a global reckoning on sexual misconduct.

“It’s hard enough for a survivor of abuse to come forward with their truth, even under the best circumstances,” she said. “But here we have Brown survivors who are met with apathy and indifference, which makes a really hard situation even more traumatic.”

Cass Cliatt, the university’s senior vice president for communications, said Monday that the university is aware of the lawsuit but has not been formally served.

She said in an email that Brown has taken a “strategic and sustained approach” to confronting sexual misconduct on campus, including recommendations from the university’s sexual assault task force released in 2015.

“Brown has made it an institutional priority to create an environment in which no incident of sexual violence is tolerated, and the experiences and perspective of students and others impacted by sexual violence have been instrumental in informing the actions we’ve taken,” she said.

In a joint statement, the four women named in the suit dismissed the school’s recent efforts as “begrudging, minor changes to policy and procedure” that have “failed to ameliorate the rampant public health crisis of sexual violence” on campus.

“The so-called systems of justice and support at Brown, as well as the faculty, staff and administrators who implement them, actively perpetuate and exacerbate the injustices and harm they claim to remedy,” the women said. “Survivors at Brown are silenced, harmed, dismissed and discouraged from seeking justice by the university.”

They say in their suit that Brown’s poor response to sexual misconduct allegations violates numerous provisions of Title IX, the federal law barring gender-based discrimination, resulting in negligence, breach of contract, and “intentional infliction of emotional distress.”

Advertisement

They also say that the university’s Title IX office is woefully undersized and that its training on sexual misconduct policies and procedures does not meet federal standards.

The women named in the litigation are Chloe Burns, a 2019 graduate; Taja Hirata-Epstein, a 2020 graduate; Katiana Soenen, a rising sophomore; and Carter Woodruff, who matriculated in 2016 but went on medical leave and is seeking reinstatement. The Associated Press does not generally identify alleged victims of sexual misconduct unless they decide to speak out publicly.

If granted by a judge, their class-action suit would cover all women who attended Brown starting in 2018 and were survivors of sexual violence.

Evans said the women want a court order compelling the university to comply with federal Title IX requirements, as well as any damages allowable under law.

The lawsuit follows protests this spring led by a student group critical of the university’s handling of sexual assault claims, said Elizabeth Bailey, another lawyer representing the women. But the problems at the university stretch back to the 1980s, when survivors began a campaign of writing the names of their perpetrators on the library bathroom walls, she said.

Other prominent colleges have recently settled lawsuits dealing with widespread sexual assault on campus.

In March, the University of Southern California agreed to an $852-million settlement with more than 700 women who have accused the college’s longtime campus gynecologist of sexual abuse.

In 2019, Dartmouth College settled a federal lawsuit with nine women who sued the Ivy League institution in New Hampshire over allegations that it ignored years of harassment and assault by former psychology department professors. That settlement included some $14 million in compensation for current and former students.

Meanwhile Brown, which was founded in 1764 and has more than 10,000 students, settled a federal lawsuit in September challenging its decision to reduce several women’s varsity sports teams, including fencing, golf and skiing, to club status.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mexico will ask the United States to send at least 3.5 million more doses of COVID-19 vaccine as the country faces a third wave of infections, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Monday.

The president said he planned to discuss a transfer of vaccine with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris.

López Obrador said the U.S. government had initially offered the Moderna vaccine, but Mexican health authorities could not get the necessary approvals in time, so now they are considering Pfizer or another approved vaccine.

Mexico has vaccinated more than 50 million people with at least one dose, representing about 56% of the adult population. It has received 91.1 million doses of five vaccines.

In June, the U.S. donated 1.3 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

López Obrador said he would also talk about immigration and the need to reopen the shared border to nonessential traffic.

“I am going to propose today that it can be shown to not pose any risk to the population,” López Obrador said.

Last month, authorities in the U.S. and Mexico decided to extend the closure to at least Aug. 21. Caseloads in both countries of the fast-spreading Delta variant have only increased since.

Mexico is seeing more than 20,000 reported infections per day.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The European Union’s foreign policy chief said Monday that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has crushed any prospect of free and fair elections in November by arresting dozens of opposition figures.

“The opposition has been eliminated. Nicaraguans are being deprived of the basic human and civil right to vote in a credible, inclusive and transparent election,” Josep Borrell said in a statement.

Nicaragua is scheduled to hold national elections Nov. 7. and Ortega is seeking a fourth consecutive term. He placed an opposition vice presidential candidate under house arrest last week, yet another sign of increasing repression.

Borrell also criticized last Friday’s decision to strip the last opposition party of its legal status.

He said that “President Ortega and [Vice President and first lady Rosario] Murillo must stop this autocratic spiral.”

Last week, the EU slapped sanctions on Murillo and seven other senior officials accused of serious human rights violations or undermining democracy. The sanctions include asset freezes and bans on travel in Europe.

Also last week, the United States slapped visa restrictions on 50 immediate family members of Nicaraguan officials who have been involved in or benefited from Ortega’s growing repression. The U.S. State Department said Friday the officials include lawmakers, prosecutors and judges.

Over the last two months, Ortega’s government has arrested nearly three dozen opposition figures, including seven potential challengers for the presidency.

On Monday in Managua, the National Coalition opposition alliance said in a statement that it did not recognize the current electoral process as a way out of Nicaragua’s political crisis and urged Nicaraguans to not recognize it either.

“From the National Coalition we do not support nor promote the citizens’ participation in the electoral farce that will only result in the perpetuation of Ortega and Murillo in power,” the statement said. The process “does not meet any of the requirements established by the national and international community to be considered legitimate and transparent.”

Later Monday, Murillo announced that the government had recalled its ambassadors from Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Costa Rica “in reciprocity” for steps taken by those governments. She declared recent criticism from those governments as “interfering and interventionist.”

Argentina and Mexico had offered to try to mediate negotiations between the government and opposition, but that offer was rejected by Ortega. Costa Rica and Colombia had strongly condemned Ortega’s government for recent actions against the opposition.

“They have assumed function that no one has given them, in open violation of international law, human rights and the shameful following along of the colonialist, imperialist and destructive powers,” Murillo said.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Firefighters and residents battled into the night Monday for a seventh day against a massive fire on Greece’s second-largest island as the nation endured what the prime minister described as “a natural disaster of unprecedented proportions.”

Smoke and ash from Evia, a rugged island of forests and coves close to the Greek mainland, blocked out the sun and turned the sky orange. The fire, which began Aug. 3, is the most severe of hundreds in the past week across Greece, gobbling up pristine pine forests as well as homes and businesses and forcing hundreds to quickly evacuate by sea to save their lives.

Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, which sent temperatures up to 113 Fahrenheit and turned its prized pine forests into bone-dry tinderboxes.

In a televised nationwide address, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the destruction in Evia and elsewhere “blackens everyone’s hearts” and pledged compensation for all affected, as well as a huge reforestation and regeneration effort. He also apologized for “any weaknesses” shown in addressing the emergency, a nod to criticism from some residents and officials who said Greece’s firefighting efforts and equipment were woefully inadequate.

“These last few days have been among the hardest for our country in decades,” Mitsotakis said. “We are dealing with a natural disaster of unprecedented dimensions.”

With roads on the island cut off by the flames, residents and tourists fled to Evia’s beaches and jetties to be ferried to safety by a flotilla of ferries and boats.

“We were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!” David Angelou, who had been in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving by ferry to the mainland.

“You could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,” he said.

Mitsotakis said Monday he “fully understands” the pain of those who lost homes or property, and the anger of those seeking airborne assistance “without knowing whether the firefighting aircraft were operating elsewhere or whether conditions made it impossible for them to fly.”

But he urged Greeks to reflect “not only on what was lost but also on what was saved in such an unprecedented natural disaster.”

Other big wildfires were still burning Monday in Greece’s southern Peloponnese region. Over the past week, hundreds of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, and nearly 100,000 acres have been burned. Power cuts on Monday affected at least 17,000 households.

The causes of the blazes are as yet undetermined, though several people have been arrested for alleged arson. Greece’s top prosecutor has ordered an investigation into whether the high number of fires could be linked to criminal activity.

More than 20 countries in Europe and the Mideast have responded to Greece’s call for help, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.

On Monday, Greece’s Foreign Ministry tweeted that neighboring Turkey — Greece’s historic regional rival — will be sending two firefighting planes because a top envoy said Turkey’s wildfires “are now under control.” The ministry also said Russia would be sending two firefighting planes and two helicopters.

Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have emphasized saving lives, issuing dozens of evacuation orders. The coast guard said 2,770 people had been evacuated by sea across the country between July 31 and Aug. 8.

Some residents ignored the orders to try to save their villages, spraying homes with garden hoses and digging mini firebreaks.

“The villagers themselves, with the firefighters, are doing what they can to save their own and neighboring villages,” said Yiannis Katsikoyiannis, a volunteer from Crete who came to Evia to help his father save his horse farm near Avgaria.

“If they had evacuated their villages, as the civil protection told them to, everything would have been burnt down – perhaps even two days sooner,” he said. “Of course, they never saw any water-dropping aircraft. And of course now the conditions are wrong for them to fly, due to the smoke.”

On Monday, the flames raced across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages even as 600 firefighters struggled to tame the inferno, aided by emergency teams from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia, 5 helicopters and 5 water-dropping planes.

One Greek volunteer firefighter died near Athens last week while four more were in the hospital Monday, two in critical condition with extensive burns.

Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica was coming close to houses on Monday.

In Italy, authorities urged the public to be careful with fire amid a heat wave forecast for this week, when many Italians take summer vacations. Firefighters for weeks have been battling blazes in Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria, and two have died.

“We have faced very difficult and dramatic days fighting fires, and the temperatures that are forecast require the utmost attention,’’ said Fabrizio Curcio, head of Italy’s Civil Protection agency. “We are asking the maximum collaboration and caution from citizens ... to avoid any behavior that can set off a fire and report immediately the smallest blaze.”

In North Macedonia, dozens of wildfires followed the worst heat wave in decades. At least eight were still burning Monday, mostly in remote areas where only helicopters and planes could be deployed. Thousands of acres of forest have been destroyed and authorities have arrested five suspected arsonists.

Associated Press journalists Nicolae Dumitrache in Pefki, Greece, Nicholas Paphitis in Kontias, Greece, Suzan Frazer in Ankara, Turkey, Konstantin Testorides in Skopje, North Macedonia, Colleen Barry in Milan, Italy, and Predrag Milic in Podgorica, Montenegro, contributed to this report.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the Delta variant of the coronavirus sweeps across the United States, a growing number of colleges and universities are requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for students to attend in-person classes. But the mandate has opened the door for those opposed to getting the vaccine to cheat the system, according to interviews with students, education and law enforcement officials.

Across the internet, a cottage industry has sprung up to accommodate people who say they won’t get vaccinated for either personal or religious reasons.

An Instagram account with the username “vaccinationcards” sells laminated COVID-19 vaccination cards for $25 each.

A user on the encrypted messaging app Telegram offers “COVID-19 Vaccine Cards Certificates” for as much as $200 apiece. “This is our own way of saving as many people as we possibly can from the poisonous vaccine,” reads the seller’s message, viewed by at least 11,000 app users.

An increasing number of inquiries to these sites and similar ones appear to be from those who are trying to get fake vaccination cards for college.

A Reddit user commented on a thread about falsifying COVID-19 vaccination cards, saying, in part, “I need one, too, for college. I refuse to be a guinea pig.”

On Twitter, one user with more than 70,000 followers tweeted, “My daughter bought 2 fake ID’s online for $50 while in college. Shipped from China. Anyone have the link for vaccine cards?”

According to a tally by the Chronicle of Higher Education, at least 664 colleges and universities now require proof of COVID-19 inoculations. The process to confirm vaccination at many schools can be as simple as uploading a picture of the vaccine card to the student’s portal.

In Nashville, Vanderbilt University places a hold on a student’s course registration until a vaccine record has been verified unless he or she has an approved medical accommodation or religious exemption.

The University of Michigan says it has checks in place to confirm employee and student vaccinations. A spokesman for the college told the Associated Press the school has not encountered any problems so far with students forging COVID-19 vaccination record cards.

But Benjamin Mason Meier, a global health policy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, questions how institutions can verify those records.

“The United States, unlike most countries which have electronic systems in place, is basing its vaccination on a flimsy paper card,” he said.

“There needs to be policies in place for accountability to make sure that every student is operating in the collective interest of the entire campus.”

In a statement to AP, UNC said the institution conducts periodic verification of documents and that lying about vaccination status or falsifying documents is a violation of the university’s standards and may result in disciplinary action. The school said it had not found any instances of a student uploading a fake vaccine card.

But other university staff and faculty have expressed concern. Rebecca Williams, a research associate at UNC’s Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, said while she is concerned by these claims, she isn’t surprised.

“This is why I think the development of a reliable national digital vaccine passport app is very important for the sake of all the organizations and businesses that want to require proof of vaccination for employees, students or business patrons,” Williams said.

The AP spoke with students across the country who did not want to be identified but said they were aware of attempts to obtain fake cards.

Some school officials acknowledge it’s impossible to have a foolproof system.

“As with anything that potentially requires a certification, there is the possibility for an individual to falsify documentation,” said Michael Uhlenkamp, a spokesman for the chancellor’s office at California State University. The school system, the largest in the nation, oversees about 486,000 students on 23 campuses.

In March, the concern over fake COVID-19 vaccination cards prompted the FBI to issue a joint statement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services urging people not to buy, create or sell fabricated vaccine cards.

In April, a bipartisan coalition of 47 state attorneys general sent a letter to the CEOs of Twitter, Shopify and eBay to take down ads or links selling the bogus cards.

Many of the sites have blacklisted keywords related to fake cards, but places to buy the documents are still popping up on messaging apps, chat forums and the dark web.

Sellers on websites such as Counterfeit Center, Jimmy Black Market and Buy Express Documents list COVID-19 vaccine cards, certificates and passports for sale, some costing 400 euros or about $473.49 U.S. dollars.

An advertisement on the website Buy Real Fake Passport indicates that vendors can produce fake vaccination cards by the thousands, if not tens of thousands, based on demand.

“It is hiding under our noses. If you want it, you can find it out,” said Saoud Khalifah, founder and chief executive of scam-detecting software Fakespot. “If we are seeing signs where things like Lollapalooza and other festivals are getting fake cards to gain entrance, the trend is just going to continue into these universities.”

In July, the U.S. Department of Justice announced its first federal criminal fraud prosecution involving a fake COVID-19 immunization and vaccination card scheme. Juli A. Mazi, 41, a naturopathic physician in Napa, Calif., was arrested and charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of false statements related to healthcare matters.

Court documents allege she sold fake vaccination cards to customers that appeared to show that they had received Moderna vaccines. In some cases, the documents show Mazi herself filled out the cards, writing her own name and purported Moderna “lot numbers” for a vaccine she had not in fact administered. For other customers, she provided blank CDC COVID-19 vaccination record cards and told each customer to write that she had administered a Moderna vaccine with a specified lot number.

Requiring vaccinations to attend class at colleges and universities has become a contentious political issue in some states. Public colleges in at least 13 states including Ohio, Utah, Tennessee and Florida cannot legally require COVID-19 vaccinations due to state legislation, but private institutions in those same states can.

Some college students have taken to social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok to voice their outrage over other students possessing fraudulent vaccine cards.

Maliha Reza, an electrical engineering student at Pennsylvania State University, said it is mind-boggling that students would pay for fake vaccination cards when they could get the COVID-19 vaccine at no cost.

“I’m angry about that like there is more anger than I could describe right now,” Reza said. “It’s dumb considering the vaccine is free and it is accessible across the country.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Pentagon will require members of the U.S. military to get the COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 15, according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press. That deadline may be pushed up if the vaccine receives final FDA approval or infection rates continue to rise.

“I will seek the president’s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon” licensure by the Food and Drug Administration “whichever comes first,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says in the memo to troops, warning them to prepare for the requirement. “I will not hesitate to act sooner or recommend a different course to the President if I feel the need to do so.”

The memo is expected to go out Monday.

Austin’s decision comes a bit more than a week after President Biden told Defense officials to develop a plan requiring troops to get shots as part of a broader campaign to increase vaccinations in the federal workforce. It reflects similar decisions by governments and companies around the world, as nations struggle with the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus that has sent new U.S. cases, hospitalizations and deaths surging to heights not see since peaks last winter.

Austin said in his memo that the military services would have the next few weeks to prepare, determine how many vaccines they needed, and how this mandate would be implemented. The additional time, however, also is a nod to the bitter political divisiveness over the vaccine and the knowledge that making it mandatory will likely trigger opposition from vaccine opponents across the state and federal governments, Congress and the American population.

It also provides time for the FDA to give final approval to the Pfizer vaccine, which is expected early next month. Without that formal approval, Austin would need a waiver from Biden to make the shots mandatory.

Troops often live and work closely together in barracks and on ships, increasing the risk of rapid spread of the virus. And any large outbreak of the coronavirus in the military could affect America’s ability to defend itself in a national security crisis.

The decision will add the COVID-19 vaccine to a list of other inoculations that service members are already required to get. Depending on their location around the world, service members can get as many as 17 different vaccines.

Austin’s memo also said that, in the meantime, the Pentagon would comply with Biden’s order for additional restrictions on any federal personnel who have not been vaccinated. Those restrictions will include wearing masks, social distancing and travel limits.

According to the Pentagon, more than 1 million troops are fully vaccinated and another 237,000 have received one shot. But the military services vary widely in their vaccination rates.

The Navy said that more than 74% of all active duty and reserve sailors had been vaccinated with at least one shot. The Air Force, meanwhile, said that more than 65% of its active duty members and 60% in its reserve forces were at least partially vaccinated, and the number for the Army — by far the largest service — appears to be closer to 50%.

Military officials have said the pace of vaccines has been growing across the force, with some units — such as sailors deploying on a warship — seeing nearly 100% of their members get shots. But the totals drop off dramatically, including among the National Guard and Reserve, who are much more difficult to track.

Some unvaccinated service members have suggested they’ll get the shot once it’s required, but others are flatly opposed. Military officials have said that once the vaccine is mandated, a refusal could constitute failure to obey an order, and may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Army guidance, for example, includes counseling soldiers to ensure they understand the purpose of the vaccine and the threat the disease poses. The Army also notes that if a soldier “fails to comply with a lawful order to receive a mandatory vaccine, and does not have an approved exemption, a commander may take appropriate disciplinary action.”

Advertisement

Military service officials have said they don’t collect data on the number of troops who have refused other mandated vaccines, such as anthrax, hepatitis, chicken pox or flu shots over the last decade or more. And they weren’t able to provide details on the punishments any service members had received as a result of a refusal.

Officials said they believed the number of troops refusing other mandated vaccines was small. And the discipline could vary.

Also, service members can seek an exemption from any vaccine — either temporary or permanent — for a variety of reasons including health issues or religious beliefs. Regulations involving the other mandatory vaccines say, for example, that anyone who has had a severe adverse reaction to the vaccine can be exempt, and those who are pregnant or have other conditions can postpone a shot.

Advertisement

Some have argued that those who have already had the virus — and have antibodies — are immune and thus should not have to get the shot. It’s not clear how the military will act on those types of assertions.

According to Defense officials, some senior military leaders have expressed support for making the vaccine mandatory, believing it will help keep the force healthy. Military commanders also have struggled to separate vaccinated recruits from unvaccinated recruits during early portions of basic training across the services to prevent infections. So, for some, a mandate could make training and housing less complicated.

Navy officials said this week that there had been only one case of COVID-19 hospitalization among sailors and Marines who were fully vaccinated. In comparison, the Navy said there had been more than 123 hospitalizations “in a similarly sized group of unvaccinated sailors and Marines.” It said fewer than 3% of its immunized troops had tested positive for the coronavirus.

The other military services did not provide similar data.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Time’s Up leader Roberta Kaplan resigned Monday over fallout from her work advising Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration when the first allegations of sexual harassment were made against him last year.

Kaplan cited her work counseling the administration last winter and her more recent legal work representing Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Cuomo who resigned Sunday, nearly a week after a report by the state attorney general concluded that the governor had sexually harassed 11 women.

“I therefore have reluctantly come to the conclusion that an active law practice is no longer compatible with serving on the Board at Time’s Up at this time and I hereby resign,” Kaplan wrote in her resignation letter, according to the New York Times.

Messages went sent to Kaplan requesting comment on her resignation.

Kaplan was the chair of the Board of Directors of Time’s Up and cofounder of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which aids women who have experienced sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.

Meanwhile, the Human Rights Campaign said Monday it’s launching an internal investigation over the advocacy organization’s leader Alphonso David being included in the attorney general’s report.

“Over the past several days, HRC’s employees, supporters, board members and partners have raised questions about the appropriateness of Alphonso David’s actions and whether they align with HRC’s decades’ long mission of fighting for equality and justice for all.”

Both Kaplan and David, a former legal counsel for the governor, were consulted by the Cuomo administration when he was first accused of harassment by a former economic development advisor, Lindsey Boylan.

At the time, Boylan was alone in accusing Cuomo of misconduct and the governor and his administration had drafted a letter attacking her credibility and motives, with the intent of circulating it publicly. Kaplan and David both agreed to review the letter.

A report by New York’s attorney general, released last week, said Kaplan told the administration that with some adjustments, it would be fine to send out. David declined to sign the letter, but agreed to contact other people to see if they would.

Other advisors, though, said that it was a bad idea and the letter was never widely disseminated.

Kaplan and Tina Tchen founded the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund in 2018 to provide legal defense for sexual violence victims.

She successfully represented marriage equality pioneer Edith Windsor before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013, winning the case that struck down laws against same-sex marriage across the United States. She later published a book about the case titled “Then Comes Marriage.”

Kaplan also represents writer E. Jean Carroll, who filed a defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump in 2019 related to her claim that the former president raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.

Kaplan is an adjunct professor at Columbia University Law School and was a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison before starting her own firm in 2017.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@France took a big step Monday into a post-pandemic future by requiring people to show a QR code proving they have a special health pass before they can enjoy restaurants and cafes or travel across the country.

The measure is part of a government plan to encourage more people to get a COVID-19 vaccination and slow down a surge in infections, as the highly contagious Delta variant now accounts for most cases in France. More than 36 million people in France, or more than 54% of the population, are fully vaccinated.

The special pass is issued to people who are vaccinated against COVID-19, or have proof of a recent recovery from the disease or who have a recent negative test. The measure also applies to tourists visiting the country.

In hospitals, visitors and patients who have appointments are required to have the pass. Exceptions are made for people needing urgent care at the emergency ward.

Advertisement

The pass is now required on high-speed, intercity and night trains, which carry over 400,000 passengers per day in France, Transport Ministry chief Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said Monday. It is also required for long-distance travels by plane or bus.

“We’re going to enforce massive controls,” Djebbari said.

Paper or digital documents are accepted.

Meanwhile, the Paris St.-Germain soccer club will be allowed a capacity crowd for its first home game of the season against Strasbourg in the French league Saturday. PSG said the Paris prefecture has approved 49,700 fans at Parc des Princes stadium, with spectators expected to show their virus passes.

Polls show that most French support the health pass. But the measure has prompted strong opposition from some people who say it compromises their freedoms by limiting movements and daily activities outside the home.

On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators marched in Paris and other French cities for a fourth consecutive week of protests against the measure.

The virus pass has already been in place since last month at cultural and recreational venues, including cinemas, concert halls, sports arenas and theme parks.

The law also requires French healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 15.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An executive assistant who accused New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of groping her detailed Monday why she felt empowered to go public with her allegations, as a key legislative committee is set to discuss possible impeachment hearings.

Brittany Commisso, one of nearly a dozen women whose accounts of sexual harassment by Cuomo were outlined in a report by the state’s attorney general, told her story for the first time on camera in an interview that aired Monday. She became the first woman to file a criminal complaint against Cuomo, giving a report to the county sheriff last week.

She said she waited to have her name publicly attached to the allegations because she was fearful of retaliation.

“I was afraid that if I had to come forward and revealed my name, that the governor and his enablers, I like to call them, would viciously attack me, would smear my name, as I had seen and heard them do before to people,” Commisso, now 32, said in a joint interview with CBS and the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union.

She said she also wanted to protect her daughter, but now feels speaking out shows her that “she has a voice.”

“I never want her to be afraid to speak,” Commisso said. “I never want her to be afraid of any person in power, a man or a woman.”

Commisso said the Democratic governor groped her for the first time Dec. 31, 2019. According to Commisso, Cuomo suggested the two of them take a selfie together.

“He was to my left. I was on the right. With my right hand, I took the selfie. I then felt, while taking the selfie, his hand go down my back onto my butt, and he started rubbing it. Not sliding it. Not, you know, quickly brushing over it — rubbing my butt.”

Commisso, who began working as an executive assistant in the governor’s office in 2017, said this made her so nervous that her hands began to shake, making it difficult for her even to take the picture.

“I was embarrassed,” she said.

Commisso said Cuomo groped her a second time at the governor’s mansion in November 2020.

After shutting the door, “he came back to me and that’s when he put his hand up my blouse and cupped my breast over my bra,” she said. “I exactly remember looking down, seeing his hand, which is a large hand, thinking to myself, ‘Oh, my God. This is happening.’”

Asked about the allegation that he had grabbed Commisso’s breast, Cuomo responded, according to a report from the state attorney general: “I would have to lose my mind to do such a thing” to a woman he hardly knew, with multiple staff members around.

Cuomo has denied touching any women inappropriately and said the alleged groping encounter never happened.

The interview aired as Cuomo faces another day under fire.

Scores of Democrats, including President Biden, have urged Cuomo to leave office. About two-thirds of state Assembly members have already said they favor an impeachment trial if he refuses to resign. Only a simple majority vote is needed to begin an impeachment trial.

Cuomo will be going into the fight without his former top aide, Melissa DeRosa, who resigned late Sunday, saying the last two years had been “emotionally and mentally trying.”

Advertisement

The Cuomo administration has been in crisis since last week, when a report made public by state Atty. Gen. Letitia James concluded that the governor sexually harassed 11 women.

Cuomo’s lawyers have attacked the attorney general’s investigation as biased in favor of his accusers.

At least five district attorneys have asked for materials from the attorney general’s inquiry to see if any of the allegations could result in criminal charges. Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said Saturday that Cuomo could face misdemeanor charges if investigators substantiate Commisso’s complaint.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Canada on Monday partially lifted its ban on Americans crossing the border to shop, vacation or visit, but the United States is keeping similar COVID-19 travel restrictions in place for Canadians.

U.S. citizens and permanent residents must be both fully vaccinated and test negative for COVID-19 in the three days before crossing one of the world’s longest and busiest land borders. Travelers also must fill out a detailed application on the arriveCAN app before crossing.

Even though travelers have to register, the Canada Border Services Agency won’t say how many people they are expecting to enter Canada for the reopening. But travelers should plan for the possibility of additional processing time at the border.

“CBSA will not compromise the health and safety of Canadians for the sake of border wait times,” agency spokeswoman Rebecca Purdy said in a statement.

Advertisement

Garnet Health, an Essex, Vt.-based company that offers same-day COVID-19 testing, has seen the number of tests it performs more than triple in recent weeks. The increase coincides with Canada’s decision last month to drop a two-week quarantine requirement for its citizens when they return home from the U.S.

“I imagine once that border opens, we are going to see lots of people,” said Chelsea Sweeney, the company’s director of business development.

The U.S.-Canada border has been closed to nonessential travel since March 2020 to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The U.S. has said it will extend its ban on Canadians making nonessential trips until at least Aug. 21, which also applies to the Mexican border. But the Biden administration is beginning to make plans for a phased reopening. The main requirement would be that nearly all foreign visitors to the U.S. will have to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Canadians aren’t waiting for reciprocal rules.

Joel Villanueva, owner of Primo’s Mexican Grill in White Rock, British Columbia, about 2.5 miles north of the border, is more than ready for Americans to return.

“Let’s get this thing going,” he said. “A lot of our customers are from the United States, and we are literally minutes from across the border. We welcome our Americans, and we depend on their foot traffic.”

Villanueva said he supports people coming who are fully vaccinated and doesn’t think there will be a rush of Americans initially. But if his restaurant and dozens of others along the waterfront could fill some tables with U.S. visitors every day for the rest of the summer, it would be a big financial boost, he said.

Near the border in Washington state, Blaine Chamber of Commerce board member Carroll Solomon called the reopening a step in the right direction for businesses. But she also said it was somewhat concerning because of an increase in COVID-19 cases nationwide as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads.

“For people who need to get up there [to Canada] for family reasons, it’s wonderful,” said Solomon, who also volunteers at the Blaine Visitor Information Center.

Advertisement

With all the hoops people need to jump through — being fully vaccinated, getting tested for COVID-19 and uploading information to the arriveCAN app — she doesn’t think that people will be going to Canada for many day trips.

“I have a lot of friends on the Canadian side and would love to go have lunch with somebody, but you can’t just do that — you have to plan days in advance to make sure you can get through,” Solomon said.

It’s going to be an event for the Blaine area when Canadians can come down on a regular basis, she said.

As far as returning to the United States from Canada, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Jason Givens said there’s no requirement to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.

“CBP officers have been processing essential travel throughout the pandemic and remain ready and able to process American citizens and permanent residents returning from Canada,” Givens said by email.

Steve Blake, who lives in Stanstead, Quebec, just across the border from Derby Line, Vermont, is hoping that his siblings living in the U.S. will be able to visit Canada soon so they can hold a memorial service for their mother, who died in early 2020, just before the pandemic closed the border. But given the requirements, he doesn’t know how quickly that will happen.

“I’d like it to be sooner rather than later,” he said.

Residents displaced by LAPD fireworks explosion

More than a month after the LAPD blew up the 700 block of East 27th Street while trying to safely detonate a cache of illegal fireworks, displaced families who have remained in less damaged homes on the street say they are struggling to piece their lives back together.

Some complain of injuries suffered in the blast. Others have lost work. Some say they will never regain what they lost.

Advertisement

LAPD Chief Michel Moore said the police are committed to getting to the bottom of what happened and helping those families affected by the explosion, including keeping a patrol vehicle on the block 24 hours a day to keep them and their property safe.

However, during a recent Police Commission meeting, Moore denied responsibility for two recent deaths, saying his understanding is that both men had “underlying health conditions” and that their deaths were not a result of the explosion.

A preliminary review indicated that the explosion was probably caused after officials confiscating the fireworks miscalculated the explosive power of homemade devices they had placed into a “total containment unit” to be detonated at the scene.

The containment unit was meant to absorb whatever blast ensued. In the moments before the detonation, police told some residents to evacuate or remain inside and others that they would hear a loud bang and shouldn’t worry.

Instead, the June 30 explosion ripped through the neighborhood — blasting out windows and badly damaging homes and businesses. Those in the immediate blast zone fared the worst, but damage stretched for blocks.

Tokyo Olympics were an attempt at normalcy

Before dawn, a tropical storm swept into the city with gusts of wind bringing heavy clouds and drenching rain — as if the Tokyo Olympics didn’t have enough problems.

Advertisement

The COVID-19 pandemic had forced a year’s postponement and, with much of Japan still in a state of emergency, cancellation remained possible to the last moment. Even as the massive sporting event lurched ahead, spectators were banned, leaving athletes to compete in eerily quiet stadiums and arenas.

“Some were already speaking of a ghost Games,” International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said.

With inclement weather threatening to ruin Sunday’s closing ceremony, the sky lifted and brightened by late afternoon. After 17 rocky days, these Summer Games had once again found a way to get by.

As 100-meter champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy said: “Finally we’ve managed to do it, so that’s a positive way to look at it.”

Advertisement

Local organizers transformed Olympic Stadium into one of Tokyo’s well-known city parks for their goodbye show, covering the field with swaths of real grass and pathways. Kids skateboarded, people did yoga and bicycle riders whizzed past.

If the scene attempted to evoke a sense of normalcy, it also reinforced the Tokyo Games’ extraordinary and often contradictory nature.

Politics govern vaccination rate

The Los Angeles Times set out to understand how politics play out at the local level and affect vaccine efforts. We looked at the percentage of fully vaccinated people in each U.S. county with a population of at least 20,000 and for every state identified the county with the lowest rate (except Hawaii, for which no county-level data were available).

Advertisement

We asked the mayors of the county seats why their counties had fallen behind and whether they were vaccinated. In the four places without mayors, we asked town managers.

Of the 26 officials who responded, 17 were vaccinated, three were not, and six declined to say. The majority expressed deep frustration at the way politics had infected the campaign to inoculate enough Americans to wipe out the virus.

Most of the places with the lowest rates were overwhelmingly Republican, often among the reddest counties in their states when supporting Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. In several, Trump — who was vaccinated in January — won by more than 50 percentage points.

“It’s a hard sell here,” said David Trujillo, the Democratic mayor of Lovington, N.M., county seat of rural Lea County, where the former president won by 60 percentage points.

Advertisement

Trujillo was among the first locals to be vaccinated in mid-winter; he secured a spot because vials were going to waste for lack of sign-ups. The rate for the county is now 20% — about a third of the rate statewide.

Well aware that promoting vaccination could hurt his reelection campaign in April, the mayor rarely mentions it anymore, he said.

Perhaps because of the political perils of discussing vaccination, many Republican mayors either failed to respond to The Times’ inquiry or — in six cases — responded but said they would not answer any questions.

FROM THE ARCHIVES

In 1984, Mary Decker and Zola Budd got their feet tangled during the women’s 3,000-meter race at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The incident knocked Decker into the Coliseum’s infield and out of the race.

Budd, a South African who was running for Great Britain, stumbled but regained her balance. Decker tumbled to the ground, tearing the number off Budd’s back as she fell. Maricica Puica of Romania won the race and Budd finished seventh.

Twenty-five years later, Budd told The Times’ Bill Dwyre about being whisked away to her mother’s hotel, where she stayed in semi-hiding. For two days, she watched TV and waited for her flight back to England.

“I ate a lot of Haagen Dazs ice cream,” she said.

ONLY IN L.A.

According to Times data, Los Angeles County is reporting an average of more than 2,800 new coronavirus cases per day, six times the rate of infections reported a month ago. The vast majority of new cases are among unvaccinated people. As legislators struggle to reach consensus on mask and vaccine mandates, venues in Los Angeles County are gearing up for battle once more.

In L.A. County, masks are again required in all indoor public spaces; health officials recommend but do not mandate vaccination. Yet a growing number of local venues, including the Troubadour, are requiring patrons to show proof of inoculation or a negative test within the past 48 hours to enter the premises. For Jef Soubiran, co-owner of Frogtown live venue and restaurant Zebulon, it’s a matter of survival.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@With a sixth provincial capital in its hands Monday and attacks pounding a seventh, the Taliban has stunned observers with its lightning takeover of large swaths of Afghanistan in recent days — raising uncomfortable questions for Washington as the Biden administration forges ahead with its rapid withdrawal of troops from the war-torn country.

Monday saw the Taliban advance on Gardez, the capital of Paktia province in Afghanistan’s east. Officials also confirmed to local media outlets that the radical Islamic group had taken Aybak, the capital of northern Samangan province, as fighters pressed ahead with a countrywide offensive that has seen a crushing rout of Afghan government forces in many places.

As part of the 2020 peace deal between the Taliban and the Trump administration, the insurgents, who control much of the Afghan countryside, had pledged to avoid attacking the country’s 34 provincial capitals, which have remained — with U.S. and NATO assistance — bastions of government control.

But the last week has seen no fewer than five provincial centers fall to the Taliban, some without a fight. On Friday, the group seized the southwestern city of Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province, forcing Afghan government fighters to flee across the border to Iran. The following day, the Taliban captured Sheberghan, the capital of Jowzjan province and home to Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Afghan warlord whose fighters proved no match for the attackers.

By Sunday, the insurgents had blitzed through wide swaths of the country’s north — which in the 1990s mounted the strongest resistance to the Taliban — and taken three more provincial capitals: Sar-e-Pul, Taloqan and Kunduz, a long-sought-after prize that the group had briefly seized in 2015 and 2016.

Its stunning string of battlefield successes has given the Taliban control of the north, the southwest and parts of the east, setting up the group to make an eventual bid for the biggest prize of all: the national capital, Kabul. It also marks a “new, deadlier and more destructive phase” of the Afghan war, Deborah Lyons, the United Nations’ special representative for Afghanistan, told the United Nations Security Council in a briefing Friday.

“This is a clear attempt by the Taliban to seize urban centers with the force of arms. The human toll of this strategy is extremely distressing — and the political message is even more deeply disturbing,” she said.

The swift advance has escalated pressure on the Biden administration, which has pledged to maintain its support of the Afghan government even as U.S. troops prepare to quit the country completely by Aug. 31, ending 20 years of direct combat. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has blamed the pullout for the worsening violence, and some observers warn that the country could become a terrorist haven once again.

But Washington appears determined not to change the withdrawal timetable.

“President Biden has made that clear. We’re going out and … are staying out,” Ryan Crocker, who served briefly as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan under President Obama, said in an interview Sunday with ABC’s “This Week.”

“We knew from the beginning — and the president would be the first to say this — that there are difficult choices a commander in chief needs to make on behalf of the American people,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday, adding: “The Afghan government and the Afghan National Defense Forces have the training, equipment, and numbers to prevail, and now is the moment for the leadership and the will in the face of the Taliban’s aggression and violence.”

The Taliban’s advance has also underscored the vulnerability of the Afghan security forces, who have faced a grueling trial by fire since insurgents stepped up their offensive in May as American troops began their withdrawal.

Afghan troops have long relied on airpower for a crucial advantage over their Taliban adversaries and to resupply far-flung outposts across the country. With American support dwindling, and the Afghan air force unable to maintain the operational tempo, Afghan soldiers have been forced to retrench their defense posture, ceding territory with little or no fighting while they focus on strategic areas such as Herat in the west and Lashkar Gah and Kandahar in the south.

Yet that retrenchment may not be enough, said one high-ranking Afghan defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to comment freely. He predicted that the wave of provincial capitals falling to the Taliban would continue until mid-September.

“I don’t think we can hold Kandahar,” he said, adding that Kabul, the seat of the government’s power and the city with the best defenses, was likely to come under attack by the Taliban sometime next month.

Although the government insists the Taliban’s victories are more on social media than on the battlefield, the group now holds more than a third — some estimates say more than half — of Afghanistan’s districts. It also controls most of the land-locked nation’s border crossings, and has solidified its grip over much of the country’s highways, leaving the islands of government-held territory all but besieged.

That sense of government isolation has only increased in recent days in some of Afghanistan’s largest cities, including Kandahar and Herat, where Taliban fighters briefly disrupted air travel at those cities’ airports.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a tweet Monday that the group was now attacking Mazar-e-Sharif and had taken the main defensive base in Gardez.

“Fighting is currently raging on the city’s outskirts,” he tweeted.

Although the Taliban has yet to mount a military offensive against Kabul, the capital has already seen increasingly brazen attacks that seem designed to demonstrate the government’s inability to counter the insurgents.

On Tuesday, a team of insurgents stormed the home of acting Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi in an attack that killed eight people. On Saturday, gunmen killed Dawa Khan Menapal, who headed the Afghan government’s media and information center. That same day, assassins attached a bomb to the car of an Afghan Blackhawk pilot, killing him and wounding his children.

Attempts to forge a negotiated peace in the meantime have all but foundered despite continued talks between Afghan officials and Taliban leaders in the Qatari capital of Doha. On Monday, Abdullah Abdullah, Kabul’s top negotiator, traveled to Doha for three days of meetings with representatives of various countries and the U.N. aimed at stopping attacks on Afghan cities and accelerating the peace process. Taliban co-founder and political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is also set to attend.

But the momentum at present belongs to armed combat, Lyons told the U.N.

“There is a striking contrast between the activity on the battlefield and the quiet stalemate at the negotiation table in Doha,” she said, “where we should be seeing the opposite: quiet on the battlefield and engagement around the negotiating table.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An elephant herd that fascinated local residents and people around the world by making a yearlong journey into urbanized southwest China, raiding farms and even a retirement home for food, appears finally to be headed home.

Local authorities have deployed trucks, workers and drones to monitor the elephants, evacuated roads for them to pass safely and used food to steer them away from populated areas. Despite their entrance into villages and a close approach to the Yunnan provincial capital of Kunming, no animals or humans have been injured.

The 14 Asian elephants of various sizes and ages were guided across the Yuanjiang river in Yunnan on Sunday night, and a path is being opened for them to return to the nature reserve where they lived in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.

The elephants left the reserve more than a year ago for unknown reasons and roamed more than 300 miles north. After reaching the outskirts of Kunming, a center for business and tourism, they turned south again, but still are far from the reserve.

One male that separated from the herd was subsequently tranquilized and returned to the reserve.

Asian elephants are among the most highly protected animals in China, and their population has grown to around 300, even while their habitat has shrunk because of expanded farming and urban growth.

As of Sunday night, the herd was still in Yuanjiang County, approximately 125 miles from the reserve.

However, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration said the animals were in a “suitable habitat” after crossing the river.

A notice issued by the provincial government said that the herd’s progress was significant and that officials would continue to work on getting the elephants back in their natural habitat soon.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For more than a year, Steve Allender, the Republican mayor of Rapid City, S.D., took a public stand in favor of COVID-19 safety measures, urging people to wear masks, avoid large gatherings and — following his example — get vaccinated.

Constituents responded by heckling him at City Council meetings and staking out his house in a campaign to intimidate him and portray vaccination as an assault on their personal freedom.

By early summer, Allender had quit trying. The highly infectious Delta variant was surging, but with so many people refusing to get shots, he concluded there was nothing that he or other local officials could do to stop it.

“Our role is just to sit back and let it happen,” he said in an interview. “I feel like a bit of a coward.”

His experience with the toxic politics of vaccination is far from unique.

The Los Angeles Times set out to understand how such politics play out at the local level. We looked at the percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in each U.S. county with a population of at least 20,000 and for every state except Hawaii — for which no county-level data were available — identified the county with the lowest rate.

Pennington County, where Rapid City is located, had the lowest rate in South Dakota at 34% — compared with 47% for the state and 50% nationally.

Then we asked the mayors of the county seats why their counties had fallen behind and whether they were vaccinated. In the four places without mayors, we asked town managers.

Of the 26 officials who responded, 17 were vaccinated, three were not, and six declined to say. The majority expressed deep frustration at the way politics had infected the campaign to inoculate enough Americans to wipe out the virus.

Most of the places with the lowest rates were overwhelmingly Republican, often among the reddest counties in their respective states when it came to support for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. In several, Trump — who was vaccinated in January — won by more than 50 percentage points.

World & Nation With Delta surging, America is dangerously divided over vaccines The national project to stem the spread of COVID-19 has stalled as it meets resistance to vaccinations in large parts of the conservative South and Midwest.

“It’s a hard sell here,” said David Trujillo, the Democratic mayor of Lovington, N.M., the county seat of rural Lea County, where the former president won by 60 percentage points.

Trujillo was among the first locals to be vaccinated in midwinter, when he secured a spot because vials were going to waste for lack of sign-ups. The rate for the county is now 20% — about a third of the rate statewide.

Well aware that promoting vaccination could hurt his campaign for reelection in April, the mayor said he rarely mentions it anymore.

“You could lose votes for pushing the vaccine too much,” he said.

It is perhaps because of the political perils of discussing vaccination that so many Republican mayors either failed to respond to The Times inquiry or — in six cases — responded but said they would not answer any questions.

Ralph Lane Jr., the Republican mayor of Colville, Wash., the largest city in Stevens County, where the vaccination rate is 30%, kept it brief. “I have to tell you that my opinion about vaccines (or the lack of them) means very little in the grand scheme of things,” he texted.

Research suggests otherwise.

A study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that unvaccinated Republicans were more likely to change their minds after watching Republican politicians endorse inoculation. They were less likely to do so when those endorsements came from Democrats.

Several mayors blamed their low rates on misinformation about vaccines.

In Pawhuska, Okla., Mayor Roger Taylor had heard it all. His rural county, Osage, which is about an hour northwest of Tulsa, has a vaccination rate of 22%, about half the statewide rate.

“Rumors go around that they’re putting something in [the vaccines] to track you,” said Taylor, a 65-year-old Democrat. “Some people say they have never taken a flu shot in their lives and they’re healthy.”

Advertisement

The county of 47,000 has been reporting well over a dozen new cases a day — a big uptick — prompting commissioners to consider limiting access to government buildings and other restrictions.

Taylor, who had gotten a mild case of COVID-19 in December, said he believes the dangers are real. Still, while his wife, who has asthma, had already received her shots, he remained unvaccinated.

“I’m pretty sure I’ll get it,” he said of the vaccine. “This new strain may be different.... I’m being stubborn, I suppose.”

Some mayors also held on to inaccurate information.

In Sioux County, Iowa, where 34% of residents are inoculated, Orange City Mayor Deb De Haan said many of the unvaccinated had already been infected and therefore were safe.

“Their natural immunity is protecting them,” she said.

Scientists say it is unclear how long or to what degree naturally produced antibodies provide protection against further sickness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged those who have recovered to still get the vaccine.

De Haan, a Republican, said she was among those who had been sick with COVID-19. Still, she decided to get vaccinated — a decision she did not explain.

Several mayors suggested that deep distrust of the federal government was driving their numbers — and some stood proudly with the doubters.

“I’ll take my chances,” said Adam Stockford, the mayor of Hillsdale, Mich., explaining why he was not among the 30% of Hillsdale County residents who are vaccinated.

A Republican, Stockford said his city of 8,000 near the Indiana and Ohio borders was filled with “trailblazers” with “very independent” streaks.

Advertisement

Overall, 49% of Michiganders are vaccinated. Rates have risen in the last month amid growing numbers of new infections. Stockford did not anticipate numbers going up in his largely rural county, where Trump beat Joe Biden by 48 percentage points.

Research backs up his thinking.

In a recent survey of 1,517 adults across the country, nearly half of those who were not vaccinated told the Kaiser Family Foundation that they would “definitely” not change their minds. About a third were still waiting to decide. Smaller numbers said they would get their shots as soon as possible or only if forced.

The biggest unvaccinated groups included Republicans, rural residents, the uninsured and people younger than 30. Many told the researchers they viewed the danger of the pandemic as “generally exaggerated.”

Advertisement

Reece Keener, the Republican mayor of Elko, Nev., said he shared that view, arguing that the Delta strain was not any more dangerous than others. Scientists say the variant is much more contagious.

The Nevada mayor said he was sick of “an overabundance of ‘fear porn’ that’s being broadcasted everywhere” and blamed low vaccination rates — 29% in Elko County and 45% statewide — on “contradictions and confusing messaging from the CDC.”

Keener said he told the elderly and those with preexisting conditions to get vaccinated but would wait for more research on vaccines before he did it himself.

Science CDC document paints more dire picture of threat posed by Delta variant The Delta variant is more formidable than previously believed, due to its ability to infect and be spread by people who are vaccinated, a CDC document says.

Among the mayors who supported vaccination, the dominant sentiment was that they had done all they could to raise the rates and were never going to succeed.

“It’s disappointing,” said Mayor Allen Brown, an independent who leads Texarkana, Ark. He lives in Miller County, where 9% of people are vaccinated, well below the statewide rate of 37%.

Brown, whose wife works in marketing for Wadley Regional Medical Center, was well aware that hospitals were struggling once again as the Delta variant filled them with new patients. Statewide, only 25 intensive care unit beds were available last week, the lowest number since the beginning of the pandemic.

“When you don’t have the ability to take care of everyone, we have a serious issue,” said Brown, who lamented that local opposition to masking and safety measures only seemed to be growing.

While politics appears to be the biggest force stalling vaccination, experts say that socioeconomic factors also play a role, as evidenced by lower rates among Latinos and Black people, who on the whole have lower income levels and less access to healthcare.

Tom DeVivo, the Democratic mayor of Windham, Conn., said he regretted the showing in Windham County, where the rate was 51%, still above the national average but below the state total of 64%.

DeVivo said the number “should be higher.” He attributed it in part to Windham being the poorest county in the state.

In Strafford County, N.H., Robert Carrier said he was perplexed as to why the vaccination rate was still lagging by 7 percentage points behind the state average of 59%. The Democratic mayor of Dover who didn’t hesitate to get his shots questioned whether residents understood what was at stake.

“People think, ‘Well, I got by, and I don’t think I need it,’ because they haven’t been sick and they think the risk has lifted,” he said. “And obviously it hasn’t.”

After months of retreat, the coronavirus now infects an additional 100,000 Americans each day, most with the Delta variant. The CDC says that 90 million people in the U.S. who are eligible for shots have not received them. They make up the bulk of those infected, hospitalized and dying as wards again fill up and cities reinstate mask mandates.

Among the worst-hit states is Alabama, where the vaccination rate is 35%. In Winston County, that figure is just under 15%.

Advertisement

Those vaccinated include Elmo Robinson, the mayor of Double Springs, who describes himself as a “centrist, conservative Democrat” in a sea of Republicans. Trump won the county by 82 percentage points.

Still, Robinson, who regularly wears a mask to remind people that the pandemic isn’t over, said he hasn’t given up hope.

He pointed to some recent good news: The CDC said the number of people in the county who had received at least one shot had tripled since mid-July.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a new report Monday summarizing the latest authoritative scientific information about global warming. Here are five important takeaways.

Blaming humans

The report says almost all of the warming that has occurred since pre-industrial times was caused by the release of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Much of that is the result of humans burning fossil fuels — coal, oil, wood and natural gas.

Scientists say that only a fraction of the temperature rise recorded since the 19th century can have come from natural forces.

Paris goals

Almost all countries have signed up to the 2015 Paris climate accord that aims to limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) — and ideally no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) — by the year 2100, compared with the late 19th century.

Advertisement

The report’s 200-plus authors looked at five scenarios, all of which will see the world cross the 2.7-degree threshold in the 2030s — sooner than in previous predictions. Three of those scenarios will also see temperatures rise 3.6 degrees above the pre-industrial average.

Dire consequences

The 3,000-plus-page report concludes that ice melt and sea-level rise are already accelerating. Wild weather events — from storms to heat waves — are also expected to worsen and become more frequent.

Because further warming is “locked in” from the greenhouse gases humans have already released into the atmosphere, some changes will be “irreversible” for centuries even if emissions are drastically cut, the report said.

Some hope

While many of the report’s predictions paint a grim picture of humans’ impact on the planet and its looming consequences, the IPCC also found that so-called tipping points, such as catastrophic ice-sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents, are “low likelihood,” though they cannot be ruled out.

Big catch

Meeting the most ambitious goal of the Paris accord — keeping temperature increases to 2.7 degrees by the end of the century — will only be possible through what are known as “negative emissions.” That means sucking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than is added, something the report suggests could be done after 2050. The panel doesn’t explain how this can be done, though, and many scientists are skeptical that it’s possible.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The global youth are inheriting a planet of multiplying dangers. Young people are more connected than any generation in history, linked at light speed across continents and cultures. Yet they are threatened by ingrained, stubborn ways of power. Can they bring about change?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Benja Apan hoped to study engineering in the United States and get a job with Elon Musk. She’s now facing six decades in prison for insulting the king of Thailand.

Ei Thinzar Maung had dreams of winning a seat in Myanmar’s parliament and championing the rights of women and ethnic minorities. She was beaten and arrested four years ago, and is now hiding in the jungle from a military junta that’s killed and imprisoned thousands of her peers.

Ivan Choi was studying chemistry in Hong Kong when he joined a protest movement calling for more freedom from China. He’s since fled to Taiwan where he lives in exile and is not likely to ever see his family or home again.

The three activists — all in their 20s — once seemed destined for promising lives. But they dared to challenge some of the most entrenched powers in Asia, becoming fugitives with shattered career ambitions and persistent traumas. Their stories reflect the seismic changes sweeping Asia, where voices for democracy have been suppressed by corruption, growing inequality and the widening influence of the so-called China model and its blend of repression and prosperity.

Much of Asia’s youth is coming of age at a time when civil liberties are in retreat. Many are jailed, tortured, killed and disappeared. In Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, opposition parties are no longer tolerated, open dissent has been outlawed and protests violently put down. Cambodia’s long-standing dictator Hun Sen abolished his political rivals, Laos remains a one-party communist state and Vietnam, despite all its economic advancements, has stifled freedoms.

The World They Inherit This is the third in a series of occasional stories about the challenges young people face in an increasingly perilous world. Reporting was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.

“Everything is going backward,” said Ei Thinzar Maung, 27, who spoke over video from an undisclosed location in a bare room with plain white walls. “I just want to live a normal life, but I can’t. For our future — for our independence — we have to fight.”

Even the region’s democracies are under threat. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has incited ethno-nationalistic fervor. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has assailed independent media and presided over thousands of extrajudicial killings. Malaysia has degenerated into a political morass after a landmark election in 2018 raised hopes of a progressive future. Singapore constrains opposition parties. And Indonesia, the world’s third-largest democracy, has failed to rein in endemic corruption and religious polarization.

It is a bleak, and some say, futile outlook for a generation of idealistic and liberal-minded young people living in the shadow of an authoritarian China with an assertive regional reach. Yet hope persists. Armed with technology and the warp-speed language of pop culture, the protest generation has galvanized support across borders with indelible gestures like the defiant three-finger salute borrowed from the dystopian “Hunger Games” films.

They’ve coalesced online through the Milk Tea Alliance, a grass-roots social media campaign that brings together a shared love for the pan-Asian beverage and an enmity for autocratic regimes. The campaign — with its own Twitter emoji — is a mostly symbolic reincarnation of global youth movements including those that arose around the Arab Spring. But it has united and mobilized the young in ways that would have been impossible for their parents and grandparents in capitals stretching from Bangkok to Manila.

Unlike older generations, many of today’s young people have experienced free elections, upward mobility and access to the internet and the outside world. Preserving and advancing freedoms will become a lifelong battle on a continent that’s home to 60% of the world’s population and is poised to shape global affairs — wars, climate change, economies — for decades to come.

“Democracy is in decline across the region, but the young generation provides a silver lining for democratic renewal,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University. “Young people fundamentally need a more open environment for the lifestyle they intend to lead. That’s why, 10 years from now or 20 years from now, we may see a democratic resurgence. It’s taking a beating now, but it’s not out.”

Benja Apan was 15 when the commander of the Thai army, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, appeared on television and declared the nation under military control.

The 2014 takeover marked the 13th coup in Thailand since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, yet it barely registered in Benja’s home in Nakhon Ratchasima, a rural city 130 miles from Bangkok surrounded by sugar and tapioca fields.

Despite hailing from a hotbed of political opposition, Benja’s family members were royalists. They viewed the military as guardians of the sacred monarchy. Benja never imagined thinking differently. She was a diligent student focused on earning an engineering degree. Nothing interested her more than space exploration. She admired Musk and often stayed awake in the middle of the night to watch the latest launch of his SpaceX rockets.

It wasn’t until Benja moved to Bangkok for her studies and befriended student activists that she began questioning why Thailand had no aerospace industry of its own or why it was trapped in a cycle of political instability.

She learned about disappeared human rights workers and was stunned when King Maha Vajiralongkorn ascended to the throne in 2016 and enriched himself overnight by seizing control of the Crown Property Bureau, a state fund that’s conservatively valued at $70 billion.

Her political awakening accelerated in 2019 when Prayuth, who had already grabbed power in a coup, extended his role as prime minister after the general election. The military had amended the constitution to ensure his victory. The following year, a court dissolved a new opposition party called Future Forward that had energized Benja and the country’s young people by advocating an end to the dominance of the monarchy, the military and the business elite.

Benja and thousands of other students swarmed the streets of the nation’s capital demanding a new constitution and parliament. Then the unthinkable happened: the protesters aimed their scorn at the king, an eccentric figure who seemingly spent more time at his redoubt in the Bavarian Alps than his home country.

Benja attended a rally where demonstrators wore crop tops to poke fun at the sexagenarian monarch, who was famously photographed once baring his midriff in a skimpy shirt while roaming a German mall. Others began dressing as Harry Potter characters, likening the king, protected by a lese-majeste law that imposes a 15-year prison term on anyone who disparages him, to Lord Voldemort.

The three-finger salute swept Bangkok. Benja felt emboldened enough to hold a rally last October outside the German Embassy calling for an investigation of the king. She gained more attention in January when a security guard slapped her as she livestreamed a protest at an upscale mall.

“Thailand is not a healthy country,” said Benja, 22, speaking from her dormitory at Thammasat University, a school remembered for a student massacre in 1976 that still haunts the pro-democracy movement.

“They launched the coup to seize power,” said Benja, who speaks with an impish grin and wears oversized glasses and a childish fringe that belie a ferocious determination. “They changed the constitution to make the rules benefit them and make [Prayuth] prime minister.”

The demonstrations, the most spirited Thailand has seen in decades, eventually went silent with the spread of COVID-19, the fracturing of protest groups and the arrest of organizers. Benja says she has no regrets. Her generation challenged the king in a way that can’t be undone.

“Young people cannot tolerate this same old society,” said Benja. “In the past, we were not taught to have critical thinking. We have been blocked from information.... The world has changed now and younger people start to question things more. Sooner or later, they will grow up. And the country has to move forward.”

But that passion has come at a price.

“I think I have to face jail for a maximum of 60 years,” she said, counting off on her fingers the lese-majeste, sedition and unlawful assembly charges mounted against her. She remains in school and is fighting the charges with the help of a human rights lawyer. “If I confess, it could go down to 30 years.”

During the early months of the Thailand protests, Benja and other students poured over online video of demonstrations in Hong Kong. They were inspired by the ability of protesters there to scatter at the sight of police and then emerge somewhere else unscathed — a tactic defined by the creed to “be like water.”

Ivan Choi, 22, was part of that water. He was in his second year at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University studying chemistry when the protests erupted in spring 2019 over a proposed extradition bill that many feared would give mainland China another way to impose its authority over the semiautonomous city and its democratic ambitions.

(Choi previously spoke to The Times for a podcast using the pseudonym Daniel to avoid drawing attention from authorities in Hong Kong. He says he no longer fears reprisals.)

Choi had designs of entering the middle class, improving on his upbringing as the son of a single mother who worked her way up from housecleaner to hotel manager. But the more China tried to impose its will on Hong Kong, the less Choi believed he had a future in the city of 7 million.

The cost of living was soaring, propelled in part by the steady arrival of new residents from the mainland. Affordable housing was scarce and the Cantonese culture he grew up with was being overshadowed by calls to be more patriotic and loyal to Beijing. A way of life was unraveling.

Choi has been suspicious of China since he was a teenager learning about the June 4, 1989, massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. He was reminded of the crackdown each year at vigils held in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, one of the clearest signs that the city was different from China, where discussion of June 4 is forbidden.

By summer 2019, Hong Kong’s demonstrations grew more violent as police began deploying tear gas. Middle-aged professionals began to fade from the rallies, replaced by high school and college students clad in black wearing hard hats, goggles and gas masks. They were called “front-liners” and Choi fit right in.

On the night of July 1, his life would change forever. Choi was among dozens of frustrated front-line demonstrators who felt peaceful protest had failed. The group stormed Hong Kong’s Legislative Council and ransacked the building, smashing portraits of pro-Beijing politicians and spray-painting slogans on the walls like “Hong Kong is not China.”

Police drove them out, and in the chaos, Choi’s leg was injured by a bean bag projectile. He was dragged away. His appearance in news reports meant police would be able to identify him. With an arrest imminent, his friends urged him to pack his bags and flee.

Within days Choi had booked a flight to Taiwan, a self-governing island at odds with China that was granting refuge to protesters. His mom saw him off at the airport, but he never told her the real reason he was leaving, just that he was going for his studies. Choi looked out the window of the plane as it took off. He told himself it was probably the last time he would see Hong Kong.

“All I remember is crying from my home to the airport. As long as the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] exists, I can’t go back,” said Choi, who learned police had come to his home in search of him weeks after he left the city.

Those early months in Taiwan were the hardest. He was racked with guilt watching livestreams of protesters clashing with riot police. The trauma from weeks on the front line triggered recurring nightmares of his friends being corralled and beaten by officers. After a while, it was easier to just stay awake. He developed insomnia and his health deteriorated.

His condition has improved with the help of medication. But Hong Kong has become unrecognizable. The national security law imposed by Beijing last year has all but extinguished dissent in the Asian financial center. Journalists have been silenced, critics jailed and peaceful demonstrations — including the annual June 4 vigil — effectively banned. More than 10,000 people have been arrested in connection with the unrest.

Choi has embraced his new home, an island 100 miles off the coast of China where the former Chinese Nationalist government fled in 1949 after being defeated by the communists. He’s studying the territory’s history and earning a degree in political science so he can advocate for democracy in the region. Taiwan’s pro-rights activists form an instrumental part of the Milk Tea Alliance — not the least because the island is the origin of boba milk tea.

But Taiwan’s future is fraught. Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary, risking a conflict that could draw in the U.S. If that happens, Choi says he can’t bear running again.

“I escaped once,” he said. “I went away from my war and I won’t go away for the second time. So if that moment comes, I will stand up and fight.”

Students at Ei Thinzar Maung’s high school in Mandalay called her “rebel” when she first arrived from Kachin state, a border region where war between Myanmar’s army and ethnic insurgents has raged for years.

She had no intention of living up to her nickname. Ei Thinzar Maung felt fortunate to be growing up at a time of unprecedented change in Myanmar. A military dictatorship was loosening its grip on power for the first time in 50 years. Political prisoners like the Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi were being released. Internet censorship was relaxed. There were suddenly freedoms she had never known.

Ei Thinzar Maung, the first in her family to graduate from university, decided to seize the opportunity by standing up for Myanmar’s marginalized ethnic minorities. She led a 400-mile march from Mandalay to Yangon in 2015 to protest a national education law that excluded ethnic languages and restricted student unions. When it ended, she was beaten by police and thrown in jail for more than a year.

It was a hint of what was to come. Myanmar’s brutal military, known as the Tatmadaw, had agreed to share power, but it had never truly surrendered control. It commanded the nation’s security apparatus and could block changes to Myanmar’s constitution.

When the Tatmadaw began claiming fraud this year after another humiliating defeat in the general election, Ei Thinzar Maung sensed the generals would lash out. Her fears were realized in the predawn hours of Feb. 1. Soldiers fanned out across the country arresting members of the civilian government led by Suu Kyi. The Tatmadaw upended 10 years of fragile democratic reforms and restored military rule.

Ei Thinzar Maung still feels the collective fury that rang out each night in towns and cities across Myanmar as citizens banged pots and pans to protest the coup.

Thousands of young people, unburdened by the traumas of crushed uprisings in 1988 and 2007, took to the streets. They held flash mobs blocking traffic. They marched with signs in English designed to go viral, including one that read: “I want a relationship not a dictatorship.” They took cues from Thailand by flashing the three-finger salute and they adopted Hong Kong’s leaderless protest strategy to ensure the army couldn’t blunt their momentum with key arrests. Attention was sustained overseas with the help of the Milk Tea Alliance hashtag.

Slowly at first, and then with horrifying speed, the Tatmadaw showed how little it had changed. Young protesters were gunned down indiscriminately. Detainees were raped, tortured and beaten to death. By early August, more than 7,000 civilians had been arrested and more than 940 killed, according to the Myanmar-based Assistance Assn. for Political Prisoners.

A warrant was issued for Ei Thinzar Maung’s arrest. She had led a massive protest of female garment workers in Yangon and urged civil servants to go on strike. Like other wanted activists, she fled for the Thai border to seek refuge in rebel-held territory.

“They’d kill me if I were ever captured,” said Ei Thinzar Maung, whose life of activism began when she was named the first female president of her high school student union.

As the child of merchants, Ei Thinzar Maung says she grew up comfortably in Mogaung, a northern city near the border of China key for its rail link. Yet she’s always been troubled by injustice. Her father’s pursuit of a university degree was upended by a crackdown on students in 1988. She saw how her childhood friends had no career prospects and fell into drugs because they were shunned as ethnic minorities.

That worldview has led Ei Thinzar Maung to take unpopular stands. She’s one of the few activists in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, to speak out against Suu Kyi and her government’s complicity in the Tatmadaw’s slaughter and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Muslim minority Rohingya starting in 2015.

Her life is now a blur of mountain hide-outs and grizzled rebel soldiers — at least until peace is restored. That could be years away, if ever. Fighting between the Tatmadaw and ethnic insurgents and militias is flaring. Thousands have been displaced. Western sanctions have had little effect. China’s tacit recognition of the junta has proved to matter more.

If Myanmar gets another chance at democracy, Ei Thinzar Maung says she’s prepared. She belongs to a new civilian government formed in exile in April that seeks to break the country of 54 million people out of its cycle of violence and despair. Her generation will never accept the junta, she said, because of their brief, if flawed, taste of freedom.

“Our generation grew up under democracy and this is our strength,” Ei Thinzar Maung said. “We have felt freedom. We were able to communicate with the outside world. We had so many hopes and dreams. We don’t want to go back to a military dictatorship.”

She moves from place to place, an unrepentant fugitive, a young woman with a future unknown.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When the pandemic began to ravage this jungle city, Marlon Ashanga loaded his wife, two kids and virus-stricken father into a canoe and guided them three days upriver, deep into the Amazon rainforest.

“People were getting sick everywhere, and we were scared,” recalled Ashanga, a boatman in Belen, a port district of bustling street stalls and homes on stilts. “In the forest, we could rely on natural remedies. And I knew we wouldn’t starve.”

Felipe Solomón Valles fled in the opposite direction: He was with his wife teaching in a remote village when the radio carried word of a spiraling contagion and nationwide lockdown that was threatening to trap the young couple and their infant far from their families. The three slipped out in a banana boat and later trekked through the bush lugging their belongings to elude stay-at-home orders enforced by police.

More than a year after their respective getaways, the two young men — who both say they survived debilitating bouts with COVID-19 — now face the daunting challenge of how to support their families in this pandemic-battered nation, where copper mines rip through mountains and the Pacific rolls along 1,500 miles of coast. Valles and his wife are unemployed. Ashanga barely scrapes out a living.

The coronavirus has plunged millions of Latin Americans into poverty and reversed halting regional progress toward equality — dealing an especially callous blow to young people facing the twin barriers of surging unemployment and diminished opportunities.

The World They Inherit This is the second in a series of occasional stories about the challenges young people face in an increasingly perilous world. Reporting was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.

“We have a great need now, but there is also a lot of competition for jobs,” said Valles, 27. “It’s a bit depressing to not be working. But at least I have my family.”

While the poor got poorer, the region’s middle classes, toward which the young were aspiring, faced their own reckoning as their advances of recent years were stymied, their savings exhausted. A sense of desperation now reigns from tropical outposts to Andean villages to urban barrios and shantytowns, igniting a rejection of old-guard leadership manifest in Peru’s election in June of a leftist populist school teacher as president and mass protests that have shaken Colombia since spring.

Latin America and the Caribbean, home to 8.4% of the world’s population, have recorded almost one-third of COVID-19 fatalities. But the young of Latin America are not only inheriting the lasting consequences of a pandemic. They also face a widening wealth gap and a disquieting legacy of violence, political turmoil and social strife. Their voices veer from rebellion to resignation about how to navigate everything from cartels to corruption to climate change.

Despite an early quarantine, Peru has experienced the world’s highest COVID-19 fatality rate, about 600 deaths per 100,000 population, more than three times that of the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. Livelihoods have been shattered throughout Latin American and the Caribbean, where 26 million jobs were lost and the collective economy shrank 7.4% in 2020 — the largest drop on record, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.

“The pandemic has exposed and accentuated the region’s Achilles’ heel — extremely high levels of income equality,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington study group. “Latin America’s youth crisis — it is not hyperbolic to refer to a possibly ‘lost generation’ — is a powder keg for the region.”

That smoldering discontent exploded in street uprisings across Colombia, including in Bogota, the capital, where demonstrators occupied the Las Americas mass-transit esplanade and renamed the plaza “La Resistencia.”

Amid continuing high levels of COVID-19 infections, hundreds of thousands of Colombians have taken to the streets since April demanding social and economic transformation. At the forefront of el paro nacional, the national strike, have been diverse legions of youths rejecting a system they say has robbed them of opportunity and hope. The pandemic has forced many to drop their studies and take minimum-wage jobs.

“Why are we here? Because we have nothing more to lose,” said Juliett Murillo, 19, an engineering student who was among hundreds gathered last month in a protest rally at Resistance plaza. “We finish the university and what kind of jobs can we find? Working in a call center or in a restaurant. And with COVID, everything has gotten worse.”

Accompanying her at the rally were her sister, Nesly Murillo, 17, also an engineering student, and their parents.

“In my generation we couldn’t fight back — the government imposed taxes, took away our labor rights, and we had to accept it,” said the father, Fernando Murillo, 43, a cattle broker. “I’m here to support the young people fighting for their rights — and for the rights of future generations, my grandchildren.”

A few days later, hundreds set off from the national university campus amid chants of “Viva el paro!” (Long live the strike) and the accompaniment of drumbeats, the ubiquitous soundtrack of the protests.

“To be young in Colombia today is to have no future,” said Stephanny Avedaño, 20, a third-year student in literature and political science who hoisted the banner of her university as she marched in the intermittent rain. “We are fighting for a life of dignity.”

Job prospects are grim for the young in a region where almost half (48.5%) of the population is under 30 — compared to 38.7% in the United States, per the United Nations — and the per capita income of $7,404, is one-eighth of that in the United States, according to the World Bank.

Like others, Avedaño is worried about the accumulating debt from her studies at a private university. An older brother graduated in 2014 and is still paying off the costs. “Today, for Colombians, to study is practically a privilege,” Avedaño said. “Really, just to survive is a privilege.”

A group of marchers outfitted in suits to mock Colombia’s political class rallied outside the attorney general’s office and ripped open bricks of flour — unleashing billowing clouds of white powder symbolizing how the multibillion-dollar cocaine trade has corrupted authority in the world’s largest cocaine producer.

The Colombian government has blamed the unrest on “terrorist” provocateurs, citing attacks on police stations. Human rights groups have documented dozens of protest-related deaths, most at the hands of police and shadowy gunmen. Organizers suspended street actions following two months of turmoil, but vowed to press demands for a more just society — and fresh protests erupted on July 20, Colombia’s independence day.

The lack of any clear resolution dramatizes how grievances continue to fester throughout Latin America, setting the stage for future upheaval. Large-scale street protests have hit both Brazil and Cuba in recent weeks.

“The strike doesn’t end here,” declared Noelia Campo, an Indigenous leader wearing a traditional straw hat and poncho against the backdrop of a burned and toppled toll station along Colombia’s Pan-American Highway. She spoke in a driving rain as demonstrators lifted a roadblock put up more than a month earlier on the stretch of road linking the cities of Cali and Popayan.

Young Indigenous, Afro-Colombian and peasant activists have been in the vanguard of Colombia’s street rebellion. For them it is not only the future that’s imperiled but the essence of their identities and cultures. They target monuments honoring Spanish conquistadors and colonial-era figures — whom they view as symbols of a racist legacy — and champion the cause of long-marginalized communities that have seen their fates worsen in the pandemic era.

“Social inequality is what prompted us to rise up,” said Campo, 29, as she stood along the highway in Colombia’s southwestern Cauca province, a majestic but violence-plagued region of pine-studded mountains, verdant valleys and luminous lakes.

Cauca, where government authority is largely absent, is well-traveled terrain for cocaine traffickers, paramilitary gunmen, wildcat miners and sundry rebel factions that seize land with impunity. Scores of social activists have been assassinated in Cauca and adjacent regions in recent years, human rights groups say, a trend that accelerated during the pandemic.

Among the victims was Yordan Eduardo Guetio, 26, who championed peasant rights in the town of Corinto in Cauca. He was riding his motorcycle on the evening of Feb. 2 with his father when armed assailants forced Guetio to get off the bike, his father subsequently told local radio. Guetio’s body was found an hour later.

“To be a leader here is to run a grave risk,” said Liliana Pechené, 34, a former governor of the Guambia Reserve, an Indigenous community in Cauca. “Here they kill three or five people and in reality those lives have no value because ... the state ignores it,” added Pechené, a mother of two, speaking inside a traditional dirt-floor adobe gathering place at her mountain home.

Daniela Anacona, 24, an organizer with a campesino (peasant) association in Popayan, the provincial capital, is among the millions of Colombia’s “displaced,” those forced to abandon their home regions because of the country’s endemic insecurity. When Anacona was 3 years old, her family fled to Cauca from southern Putumayo province.

“With the violence we suffer, with the pandemic, with the loss of income, we are in a permanent war for the future of our children,” said Anacona, speaking in a cafe in Popayan.

Before the pandemic, Anacona said, she had intended to attend university, but now she sells fruit at a market while pushing for a societal makeover and caring for her 4-year-old daughter.

“There are so many young women here who become prostitutes, and boys who become gunmen or sell drugs because they have no other choice,” said Anacona. “Because of a lack of education and opportunity.”

“If there are no tourists, how do we eat?” asked Maribel Tuyro Curo, 22, her anguish evident. “Will we ever be able to make a living again?”

She and her husband, Gustavo Yapo Pumachara, also 22, are among the multitudes of vendors hawking hand-woven garments of alpaca and sheep wool on the streets of Cuzco, the onetime Inca capital that sits at a cool 11,000 feet in the Peruvian Andes.

COVID-19 has throttled tourism worldwide, with far-reaching economic consequences across Latin America, from Patagonia to Cuba to Mexico. Relatively few visitors have begun trickling back to Cuzco, long a favored destination for backpackers, hipsters, jet-setters, and a jumping off point to visit Machu Picchu.

The young artisan couple’s income, never substantial, was at least sufficient to raise expectations for a better life. Now their earnings have plummeted to close to nothing.

They met while he was serving a two-year army stint, posted to far-flung zones where the military battles narco-traffickers. He has since learned to weave bracelets and helps with social media advertising for the couple’s handiwork, including sweaters, hats and other wares. Both dote over their 20-month-old son, Dorean Taylor, who accompanies the pair as they set up shop alongside an outdoor wall where intricate Inca stone work forms the base.

“I don’t want my son to have to sell on the streets, like his parents,” the father said.

Tuyro’s pregnancy was a difficult one. She said she almost died. Then the pandemic came.

She and her infant son took shelter at her parents’ home in a village outside Cuzco, where the family grows corn and potatoes. Tuyro was reared as one of 12 siblings and learned weaving from her mother, joining her on sales excursions. Her father crafted wool bags.

As a girl, Tuyro recalled, sometimes there wasn’t enough food at home, a memory that haunts her.

“I would love to have my own shop with my own creations, made by hand, everything of high quality,” she said, also expressing a desire to go back to school and study design.

That vision seemed very distant at the close of another shift of futile commerce.

As the sun set on snow-topped peaks, husband and wife packed their unsold items into a blanket and hauled them away, heading up the venerable stone streets, son in tow, their struggles more dire than they had ever imagined.

“There’s a pretty teacher,” Felipe Salomón Valles recalled his father telling him.

The young teacher was invited to Valles’ family home in Nauta, a lively river port in the Peruvian Amazon. He took her for a ride on his scooter. Valles and Consuelo Julca were engaged in 2015.

Valles didn’t have a teaching degree but got a job at a primary school with his wife at a hamlet in the forest. The pay was minimal, but villagers provided a simple home. “It was something very beautiful to live together as a couple and as teachers,” Valles said.

Their daughter, Mia Salomé, was born in June 2018 in Iquitos — a onetime rubber boom town still only reachable from outside by plane or boat, though its streets buzz with scooters and three-wheeled taxis. COVID-19 hit the area with force, providing a dystopian preview of future havoc elsewhere. The sick overwhelmed Iquitos’ feeble healthcare system.

It got so bad that authorities last year secretly buried hundreds of pandemic victims in unmarked graves in a cleared patch of jungle about 12 miles outside Iquitos. The action sparked outrage once it became known. Relatives are demanding that the remains be dug up, identified and properly interred. They placed crosses on plots where they believe their loved ones are buried, and many showed up on Father’s Day to pay respects.

Valles is trying to move beyond such moments. Out of work, he is studying online in hopes of landing another teaching post in an extremely tight market: “When I was younger I had a lot of aspirations, but I had to leave my studies to work and help my family,” said Valles, who did stints as a waiter, mechanic, clothing salesman and in 2012 at a shoe factory in Lima, the Peruvian capital.

“I like to be in my tierra,” said Valles, who did not take to the big city. “I like my forest, the people, their communities and their culture.”

He was content teaching in the hinterlands with his wife, but the spreading pandemic in March 2020 triggered their flight on a banana boat and subsequent slog through the jungle — hauling their daughter, suitcases and chickens, before returning to Nauta. However, the lockdown meant that Valles’ wife, Consuelo, was not with her father when he fell gravely ill and died in Iquitos in May.

She continued teaching remotely, although the lack of internet access complicated matters. She would dispatch lessons in writing via boat upriver; the children sent their homework back on boat as well. Valles fell ill — he was bedridden for two months — and couldn’t teach. The couple exhausted their limited savings. They are jobless, their futures on hold.

“These are hard times for everyone, but I believe that eventually there will be work and opportunities,” Valles said. “I always have hope.”

Marlon Ashanga navigates his canoe, powered with a small outboard motor, along the Itaya River, an Amazon tributary defining his Belen neighborhood.

Many of Belen’s 65,000 residents, including Ashanga, migrated here from distant settlements, seeking something better than the subsistence life of the forest. Denizens of the vast interior arrive daily by boat to deliver fish and jungle produce to markets in the ports of Belen and Nauta.

Marlon Ashanga, 35, his son Taylor Piero, 8, daughter Elma Coral, 4, and wife Alicia Isuiza, 40, fled Belen for the rainforest but returned four months later. (Liliana Nieto del Rio / For The Times)

As the pandemic took hold, Ashanga was felled for 15 days with a high fever. He assumed it was dengue — a not-uncommon ailment in Belen, where mosquito-transmitted and water-borne diseases flourish. His father, 70, then fell ill, apparently with COVID-19. The old man couldn’t get up; he implored his son to leave him to die. The price of oxygen and medicines had soared.

A desperate Ashanga decided to evacuate his family to the relative safety of the forest, where he had been reared and knew how to survive and find medicinal plants and herbs.

“I didn’t have any money,” Ashanga, 35, said. “And to live here in the city you need money.”

In four days, tapping a skill he learned as a boy, he and a nephew crafted a 25-foot canoe fit for the treacherous voyage.

The Ashanga family headed for Manchuria, a settlement of 300 people three days upriver via the mighty Amazon and sundry feeder waterways. While Ashanga has relatives there, the initial welcome was a wary one: The newcomers had to quarantine in the bush for 15 days. They built a makeshift hut and lived off the jungle bounty of fruit, vegetables and fish.

The family returned four months later to Belen and their home on stilts in the Itaya floodplain.

But the pandemic has eliminated a key source of Ashanga’s income — river jaunts for jungle visitors through the malodorous canals of Belen, sometimes called the “Venice of the Amazon,” a dubious analogy. Reports of escalating infections and emerging variants have kept outsiders away.

“After all we have been through, it feels like we still have to work harder and harder just to survive,” said Ashanga. “Right now, we have nothing.”

His canoe passes riverside bars and shops, fellow boatmen hauling loads of bananas, clumps of water lilies entangled with trash and barefoot boys kicking a soccer ball on a muddy pitch. Instincts honed in the forest helped Ashanga get his family out of harm’s way at a perilous moment. Now he and countless other young men and women must find new paths to put shattered lives back together.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He stood in Tiananmen Square, wearing sneakers, track pants and a black T-shirt printed with the date of a massacre.

It was June 4, 2019, the 30th anniversary of the killing of hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. Dong Zehua, then 28, hadn’t even been born when tanks clattered over the square and the world watched. The events on that bloody day in 1989 weren’t taught in school or ever mentioned in Chinese media. But Dong knew what had happened.

Tech-savvy and good at English, Dong had mastered circumventing the Great Firewall. He had learned about the anti-government protests and deaths through foreign websites banned in China. As the anniversary approached, he booked a train ticket and traveled to Beijing, keeping the T-shirt hidden until he was on the square.

Dong was a jiulinghou, as those born after 1990 are called in China. They are a nationalistic generation raised on “patriotic education” and state propaganda in a prosperous, increasingly strong China. Many have little knowledge of the traumas their parents endured or the ongoing suppression of Chinese citizens around them.

The World They Inherit This is the first in a series of stories about global youth. They are inheriting a planet of multiplying dangers. The young are more connected than any generation in history, linked at light-speed across continents and cultures. Yet they are threatened by the old ways of power. Can they change it?

But there are outliers among them. A handful of Chinese youth like Dong have tried to expose and preserve China’s true history and honor those erased from the official story. They do so despite censorship, imprisonment and growing pressure from peers who are encouraged to report on anyone who criticizes the state.

Counter-narratives have been crushed by a Communist Party determined to carefully choreograph its 100th anniversary in July. That means deleting official wrongs, promoting a whitewashed version of party history, punishing those who deviate — and in recent days, expunging the records of that punishment as well.

“What they’re doing is to control every Chinese person’s thinking and erase every person’s history,” Dong said. “They want to write history themselves.”

To Dong’s surprise, two other young people were in the square the morning he arrived: Yuan Shuai, 24, a recent college graduate from Inner Mongolia working at an advertising company in Beijing, and Gao Tianqi, 21, a Beijinger attending university abroad who’d come back for the summer. Gao carried a yellow umbrella — a symbol of Hong Kong’s youth-led democracy movement — with the number “30” written on it in black marker.

They hatched a plan to interview foreigners on the square and post a video of their comments online.

“It was a normal, simple sense of justice in our hearts, thinking: I want to do this, because someone should,” said Dong. “Someone should commemorate. This shouldn’t be forgotten.”

The three were arrested within hours. Yuan and Dong were convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking troubles” and sentenced, respectively, to six and seven months in jail. Gao was let go after 38 days of detention without trial.

Dong was quiet for several months after his release. But on June 4, 2020, he emailed The Times about his experience and provided a link to a judgment issued by the Beijing Dongcheng People’s Court. The Times verified the judgment, which was documented in a public archive of court rulings kept by the Supreme People’s Court online.

Last month, he contacted The Times again: The record of his arrest had vanished.

“In their eyes, it’s as if our detention never happened. It’s as if they never did it to us,” Dong said. “They deleted it … as if they can just delete all Chinese people’s memories.... With one stroke of the arm they can cover the sky.”

It wasn’t just Dong’s case. Thousands of politically sensitive cases disappeared last month from China Judgments Online, the public archive.

The deletions were first noticed by a Chinese activist with the Twitter handle @SpeechFreedomCN, who has been keeping an archive of speech crime cases. He has tracked more than 2,040 cases, dating to 2013, based on official documentation in China Judgments Online or public security bureaus’ reports on the social media apps Weibo and WeChat.

There are more than 600 cases of punishment related to speech about COVID-19. Most are fines, “education and warning,” or detention for up to two weeks for posting online messages about the coronavirus or the government response.

They include the case of Li Wenliang, the young doctor who died of the virus after authorities reprimanded him for warning others about the outbreak, but also hundreds of lesser-known ones: a Qinghai man given 10 months of jail for tweets criticizing China’s COVID response; a Beijinger jailed six months for warning classmates in a WeChat group about a COVID case; a popular Weibo blogger in Hebei province given six months of prison for compiling stories of Wuhan residents’ suffering during lockdown.

Other commonly punished speech “crimes” include insulting the police, petitioning for help from the central government, or trying to expose government corruption. Many cases punish Chinese citizens for activity on Twitter and Facebook, evidence that their behavior beyond the firewall is also under surveillance.

Last month, the activist — who asked not to be identified for his protection — noticed that several of the key searches he conducts on the archive each day were suddenly coming up blank. Terms such as “Weibo + picking quarrels and provoking troubles,” “Twitter + picking quarrels and provoking troubles,” or “national leaders” came back with zero results.

The Times repeated the activist’s search to confirm the cases’ disappearance, reviewed a selection of screenshots in his archive of court cases that used to be online, and called 12 courts across China to inquire about the deleted cases.

Two of the courts, both in Hubei province, did not pick up repeated calls. Employees of the courts in Shanghai and the provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu confirmed that the cases existed and were as described in the screenshots, but did not explain why they’d been taken offline. Others declined to provide information to The Times.

“If we think it can be shown then it is, and if we think it shouldn’t, we take it off,” an employee at a local court in Hunan province told The Times over the phone. “There must be a reason it can’t be shown, but this is a work secret. We don’t need to tell anyone and you don’t need to understand.”

The activist said China’s tolerance for free speech is evaporating: “We thought the people being arrested for speech online were only very extreme cases,” he said. “But when we looked closely, we saw many people are not ‘serious’ at all and yet are detained. Many people without much influence are also arrested. Control is getting stricter and stricter.”

This tightening comes as China is emerging as a global power and the Communist Party prepares for its centennial. President Xi Jinping has launched a nationwide campaign for citizens to study newly revised volumes of Communist Party history and celebrate its achievements. It is a brazen reinvention that will keep younger generations living with an airbrushed past.

All cinemas in China have been ordered to screen at least two nationalistic propaganda films each week. Schools, hospitals, lawyers associations, and Buddhist and Taoist temples have held “Red” singing competitions, patriotic poetry recitations and political study sessions.

The newest edition of official party history no longer criticizes Mao Zedong for chaos and killings in the 1960s and ‘70s, but praises his Cultural Revolution as an anti-corruption measure and blames the upheavals on “insufficient implementation of his correct ideology.”

The party narrative glosses over the failures of the Great Leap Forward, making no mention of the tens of millions who starved to death in the 1950s and ‘60s. It calls the Tiananmen Square protests a “political storm” incited by “anti-communist, anti-socialist foreign enemy forces” backing an “extremely small minority.” It mentions no killing of protesters — some estimates say thousands died — only that authorities took “decisive measures to calm the counterrevolutionary riots.”

More than a quarter of the book, which was published in February, is devoted to China’s “new era” under Xi, in which the “China dream” of great national rejuvenation is fulfilled. Five pages describe the COVID-19 outbreak, praising Xi’s leadership of the response as a demonstration of how the party always puts “the people” first.

Meanwhile, those who deviate from Beijing’s narrative of harmony and prosperity are punished.

Last month, two computer coders went on trial in Beijing for “picking quarrels and provoking troubles,” the same blanket crime applied to Dong for his T-shirt in Tiananmen Square. They were Cai Wei, 27, and Chen Mei, 28, friends who’d created an online archive of articles called Terminus2049, hosted on GitHub, about the COVID-19 outbreak, whistleblower doctors and lockdown in Wuhan.

Many were reports by Chinese journalists who risked their lives covering the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, only to have their articles censored as Xi pushed for “positive energy” propaganda focused on praising heroes, not marking human suffering.

Cai and Chen were detained in April 2020 and had been held for more than a year before they went to trial. Their families were not allowed to see them, hire personal defense lawyers for them or examine the documents explaining charges against them, according to Chen’s older brother Chen Kun, who now lives in France.

“Ten years ago, this wouldn’t be a problem. You wouldn’t be detained for just archiving information. At most they’d threaten you and ‘have tea,’” Chen Kun told The Times in a phone interview, using a common euphemism for disciplinary meetings with authorities. “We didn’t realize that in 2019 and 2020, China’s internet control became much stricter than in the past.”

Chen Kun was born in the ‘80s and had lived in a China with access to Google, Twitter, YouTube — all platforms that are blocked today. Internet access gave him not only understanding of China’s history, but also connection with like-minded friends and the chance to take small actions for social progress.

He had spent years working for Liren, a grass-roots organization that ran rural libraries and summer camps promoting civic engagement among underprivileged Chinese youth. His brother had met Cai at a Liren camp 10 years ago, when they’d been inspired to work on behalf of marginalized groups.

Liren was shut down in 2014. Chen Kun, who was head of the organization at that time, spent several months in detention.

But the brothers kept their ideals. The younger Chen worked for a charity in Beijing that aided people with disabilities. Online, he and Cai created Terminus2049, archiving censored articles about China’s #MeToo movement, labor protests and forced removal of migrant workers from Beijing. They also ran a discussion forum that didn’t require real-name registration, unlike most Chinese social media.

In earlier years, hosting such archives and forums was safe. Those arrested for speech tended to be “long-term rights activists and anti-CCP dissidents,” Chen Kun said. But now, ordinary people are being detained for actions as innocuous as a retweet.

“We are watching China’s speech environment being squeezed bit by bit until you cannot speak,” he said. Even worse, he said, the pressure was coming not only from officials but also from ordinary people — friends, family, neighbors and netizens who are increasingly reporting one another’s speech, especially online.

Official statistics show that mutual tattling has increased. In 2020, China’s Central Cyberspace Administration handled 163 million reports of improper online speech, an increase of 17.4% from 2019. The majority came from Chinese social media platforms including Weibo, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. More than 60% were reports of sexually inappropriate content, while 7.7% (about 12.5 million reports) were political and 1.1% were “rumors.”

In April, China’s Central Cyberspace Administration issued a new request for reports of “hazardous information involving historical nihilism.” It offered phone, app and website options for tattling on anyone caught “twisting” party history, criticizing party leaders, ideology or policy, “smearing” heroes and martyrs, or speaking negatively of China’s traditional, revolutionary or modern culture.

Mutual reporting continued to grow, with nearly 15 million reports that month, an increase of 38.4% from March and a 2.6% increase from April 2020.

“It will be like the Cultural Revolution,” Chen Kun said. “Normal people stand up to struggle against you. This makes you feel really hopeless.”

That sense of nationalistic, voluntary mutual censorship is particularly strong among the young, he said, especially urban youth who grew up in a rising China with no knowledge of their own history — aside from the the triumphalist narratives taught in school — and no experience of open information.

Even Dong, Yuan and Gao, the three who went to Tiananmen Square on the anniversary of the massacre, had believed that the Chinese government today would never use violence against its youth. Born in 1991, 1995 and 1998, respectively, they were highly educated city kids: “Maybe because we are young, we were thinking too well of the government,” said Dong. “We never imagined it would treat its own people this way.”

The day they were arrested in the square, police strip-searched them and made them stand for hours against a wall, then interrogated them overnight in metal “tiger chairs” that bound their wrists and ankles. They refused to believe that the three had not known one another beforehand or received foreign support, Dong said. In their thinking, it made no sense for anyone born after 1989 to care about what happened then.

“They don’t believe that actually, a lot of people in China have conscience,” said Dong. “It has nothing to do with your age, education, or whether your family has been hurt.”

Interrogators told Dong he’d receive a lighter sentence if he confessed to the “picking quarrels” crime. He did, but still spent seven months in Beijing’s Dongcheng district detention center, in a cell of 20 people squeezed into about 430 square feet.

Inside, they were forced to watch “educational videos” praising the government and write self-criticisms and confessions. They were fed mostly water and cabbage. At night, they took two-hour shifts patrolling the cell, where the light was never turned off. In the daytime, aside from the reeducation sessions, they sat on a mat in silence.

Dong fears that his peers and those younger than him still don’t know what lies behind government propaganda.

“Young people these days are completely led by the government narrative. It’s the only information they come into contact with,” he said. Many of the linglinghou and lingwuhou, those born after 2000 and 2005, are the quickest to point fingers at others, he said, accusing anyone who questions the government of backing from “foreign forces.”

It’s a “terrifying” and “very narrow” way of looking at the world, he said, one intentionally constructed by the government.

“Young people across the world should be the most anti-establishment, the most open and alive in their thinking — but not in China. In China, the youth have been shut in the government’s thinking cage for too long and cannot find an exit,” he said.

Police monitored Dong after his release, telling him he could not go to Beijing and threatening him and his parents anytime he made WeChat posts that they deemed sensitive. “I feel that I have just moved from a smaller prison to a bigger one,” he said.

Chen Mei has been detained since April 2020 for archiving stories online about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China. In May 2021, he and a friend went on trial in Beijing for “picking quarrels and provoking troubles.” (Chen Kun)

In the days before June 4 this year, he received multiple warnings to keep quiet. Yet he asked to tell his story with his real name. “We don’t need to use lies. We don’t need to hide. We haven’t done anything wrong,” he said.

The world should know of those being silenced every day in China, he said, even if their records at home are wiped away.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said state and local governments should require teachers to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

As back-to-school season approaches and the Delta variant surges across the U.S., Fauci acknowledged that his position might anger some people who’ve resisted vaccine mandates for teachers.

“Yeah, I’m going to upset some people on this, but I think we should,” he said Tuesday in an interview with MSNBC. “This is very serious business. You would wish that people would see why it’s so important to get vaccinated.”

But Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there wouldn’t be federal mandates for teacher vaccinations. Local mandates “for schools, for teachers, for universities, for colleges” would be appropriate, he said.

“I’m sorry, I mean I know people must like to have their individual freedom and not be told to do something, but I think we’re in such a serious situation now, that under certain circumstances, mandates should be done,” he said.

Full Food and Drug Administration approval could help empower governors and local officials to institute vaccine mandates without fear of legal repercussions, Fauci said.

California L.A. COVID-19 surge slowing, but cases likely to keep rising as school begins Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said she expects recorded infections will increase in part as a byproduct of ramped-up testing when schools, colleges and universities welcome students back for the new term.

“Local enterprises,” he said, also could feel they have more latitude to require vaccines following full FDA approval.

“If you want to work in an organization, you have to be vaccinated: I think we’re going see a lot more of that,” Fauci said.

Fauci’s comments coincide with rising tensions across the country between state governments and school districts over mask and vaccine requirements as schools plan to open.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is threatening to withhold pay from local school officials who defy his executive order banning classroom mask mandates.

The Defense Department has announced that it will make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for members of the military by Sept. 15.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Chinese and Russian troops have engaged in joint exercises in northwestern China in a sign of growing military ties between Moscow and Beijing amid shared concerns over the instability in Afghanistan.

The military exercises involving ground troops and combat aircraft are to continue through Friday in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

The region is located in northwestern China east of Xinjiang, where China has detained more than 1 million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities in what it calls a campaign against terrorism and extremism. Critics say the detentions violate the human rights of a minority group.

Xinjiang shares a narrow frontier with Afghanistan, and Beijing is concerned about violence spilling over its border if the Taliban take control in Afghanistan following the pullout of U.S. troops.

While stopping short of creating a formal alliance, Russia and China have increasingly coordinated their military and foreign policies to oppose what they describe as the perceived U.S. global domination.

The official Xinhua News Agency said the exercises began Monday and were presided over by Li Zuocheng, a member of the ruling Communist Party’s Central Military Commission.

The exercise aims to “deepen the joint anti-terrorism operations between the Chinese and Russian militaries and demonstrate the firm determination and strength of the two countries to jointly safeguard international and regional security and stability,” Xinhua said, citing Chinese and Russian officials.

“It reflects the new height of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era and of the strategic mutual trust, pragmatic exchanges and coordination between the two countries,” Xinhua said.

The Russian military sent several Su-30SM fighters and a motorized infantry unit to take part in the drills.

“The objectives of the combat training event are to strengthen the development of Russian-Chinese relations, comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction, build up the level of military cooperation and friendship between the armed forces of the two countries, demonstrate the determination and ability of Russia and China to fight terrorism, and jointly protect peace and stability in the region,” the Russian Defense Ministry said.

Russia has backed China in its claims in the South China Sea, over which Beijing clashed with common rival the U.S. on Monday at a high-level U.N. Security Council meeting on maritime security.

China, Taiwan and ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have overlapping claims in the disputed waters and have been locked in an increasingly tense territorial standoffs for decades. China has built seven disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases in recent years, ratcheting up tensions with rival claimants, along with the United States and its allies.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded to China’s increasingly assertive claims to the strategic waterway by warning that any conflict there or in any ocean “would have serious global consequences for security and for commerce.”

The area has seen “dangerous encounters between vessels at sea and provocative actions to advance unlawful maritime claims” that seek to “intimidate and bully other states lawfully accessing their maritime resources,” Blinken said.

China’s deputy ambassador, Dai Bing, responded by accusing the U.S. of becoming “the biggest threat to peace and stability in the South China Sea” and calling its “hype” in the Security Council “entirely politically motivated.”

China has refused to recognize an international arbitration ruling in 2016 that invalided most of its claims in the South China Sea.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The German government agreed Tuesday to provide $68 billion to help rebuild regions hit by devastating floods last month.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and the heads of Germany’s 16 states approved the state flood aid package, which still needs parliament’s endorsement.

“This is significantly more than we had for previous floods,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin.

More than 180 people died in Germany and hundreds more were injured in the July 14-15 floods, which also claimed lives in neighboring Belgium. Heavy rainfall turned small streams into raging torrents, sweeping away houses, bridges and cars.

A United Nations science panel released a report this week predicting that such extreme weather events will become more frequent as the planet heats up further.

The cost of the German aid package — agreed just weeks before the country’s national election on Sept. 26 — will be shared evenly by the federal government and states, with the latter’s payments spread over 30 years.

The two sides also agreed to establish a nationwide siren network and introduce a system that will allow authorities to send push messages to people’s cellphones to warn them of possible disasters. Prosecutors are investigating whether officials failed to adequately alert residents on the night of the floods.

The government will also examine the possibility of introducing a compulsory insurance for floods and other weather-related damages.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As a police sergeant in a rural town, Carlos Cornejo isn’t the prototypical social media influencer. But his Spanish-language Facebook page with 650,000 followers was exactly what Colorado leaders were looking for as they recruited residents to try to persuade the most vaccination-averse.

Cornejo, 32, is one of dozens of influencers, ranging from busy moms and fashion bloggers to African refugee advocates and religious leaders, getting paid by the state to post vaccination information on a local level in hopes of stunting a troubling summer surge of COVID-19.

Colorado’s #PowertheComeback target audience is especially tailored to Latino, Black, Native American, Asian and other communities of color that historically have been underserved when it comes to healthcare and are the focus of agencies trying to raise vaccination rates.

It’s part of a growing U.S. state- and city-based movement using local social media influencers to reach the most vaccination-averse at a neighborhood level. Health authorities in San Jose, Chicago, Oklahoma City, New Jersey and elsewhere are running similar campaigns.

Advertisement

The effort comes after Colorado and other states have tried lotteries, college scholarships and other incentives to boost slumping vaccination rates as the highly contagious Delta variant sweeps the nation.

Cornejo’s Facebook page has become a widely trusted source of information about what the police do — and cannot do — for Latinos in the Colorado River Valley.

“It started last year when I saw misinformation that directly affected our department, rumors like police were arresting people without a mask,” said Cornejo, a 10-year veteran with the Rifle Police Department. “Or that people get magnetized when they’re vaccinated. Sometimes people are just plain scared. I give them fact-based information, nothing political about it, so they can make an informed decision.”

Whether the social media push will move the needle with America’s unvaccinated remains to be seen.

The country last week reached the milestone of having at least one dose in 70% of adults. It came a month after President Biden’s target date, even though most can easily get the shots in the U.S. unlike other countries where they’re in short supply.

“I’m highly skeptical you can get enough appeal to the remaining 30% of adults who after all this time have not gotten the vaccination — it’s a lot to ask of an influencer,” said Jeff Niederdeppe, director of Cornell University’s Health Communication Research Initiative and co-director of the Cornell Center for Health Equity.

More likely to tip the scales is an increase in private companies and organizations requiring vaccinations of employees and patrons, he said.

In Colorado, the state pays citizen influencers up to $1,000 a month for their work on Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook and other platforms. The influencers post about their own vaccination experiences, dispel myths and misinformation, alert followers to pop-up vaccination clinics and direct them to information provided by state health authorities.

Abena Antwiwaa, a 29-year-old fashion blogger in Aurora, wrote about her nerve-wracking decision to get vaccinated on Instagram. Born with sickle cell anemia, Antwiwaa needs monthly blood transfusions. She worried about her low immunity and potential side effects.

“I was so nervous about getting vaccinated, and I shared that experience,” said Antwiwaa, who suffered nothing more than a temporarily sore arm. “It resonated with a lot of people.”

Save one: a vaccination skeptic who engaged Antwiwaa on safety concerns. Eventually, after a bit of back-and-forth, he got the shot.

“That made all the difference to me,” Antwiwaa said of agreeing to do the campaign.

This is what marketing firms like Denver-based The Idea Marketing, California-based Xomad and Chicago-based Res Publica Group want to see. They’re hired by health agencies to identify local influencers and coordinate messaging.

Xomad has developed a platform where influencers, content creators and health officials can rapidly fine-tune or change messaging to respond to events such as last spring’s pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson vaccines, new online misinformation or an expansion of age groups eligible for shots.

Rob Perry, Xomad’s CEO and founder, notes that a July study by the Knight Foundation and the city of San Jose found a direct correlation between a flurry of local influencer posts on Instagram and higher daily vaccination rates.

“Even in Silicon Valley they needed help reaching the immigrant, Black, Latino and Vietnamese communities,” Perry said. “No one’s bashing anti-vaxxers over the head. The last thing these trusted messengers want to do is polarize their followers. It’s their followers’ choice.”

Health officials say so-called “nano” and “micro” influencers, with fewer than 10,000 and 100,000 followers, respectively, are well-positioned to reach Generation Z and Millennials who get their news from social media.

The Oklahoma City County Health Department debuted the approach in late 2020, hiring Xomad to recruit local influencers to suggest ways their followers could celebrate stay-at-home holidays, agency spokeswoman Molly Fleming said. The campaign changed with the rollout of vaccinations, and could change again with the advent of booster shots, as well as with non-COVID-19 issues such as a recent uptick in syphilis cases, she said.

One Oklahoma influencer is Pandora Marie, a 40-year-old street dancer and artist of Chicana, Chickasaw and Choctaw descent who has built a 30,000-strong Instagram following. She infuses her messaging with references to Native American culture and dance.

“When I started to share the COVID posts, I had people asking questions, which is always a good sign,” Marie said.

Fleming acknowledged it’s hard to measure how many vaccinations among 18- to 29-year-olds and minorities the strategy delivers.

But officials can see residents’ interactions with posts, “and when you’re spending public health dollars, that’s important,” she said. “If we pay for a billboard, we don’t know if you’ve seen it or if it changed your life at all.”

In Chicago, Cook County Health has worked with influencers such as McKinley Nelson, a young activist who uses basketball and entertainment to protect inner city youth from street violence. Its #MyShot campaign encourages 18- to 34-year-olds in Black and Latino communities to seek out vaccination information.

Soon to be called Life is Better Vaxxed, the campaign is one element in a multilayered communications strategy that includes vaccination information ads at gas stations and barber shops, and on coasters in bars, said Cook County health spokeswoman Caryn Stancik.

“The mission, as it always has been for us, is equity,” Stancik said. “Our digital strategy targets individual neighborhoods and zip codes, and in these communities we layer in as many strategies as we can to help get people vaccinated and address misinformation.”

It appears to be helping, she said.

“I don’t want to say this alone will work,” Stancik said. “But people are coming to hundreds of pop-up local clinics based on digital word of mouth, so the information is resonating.”

Back in Rifle, Sgt. Cornejo built his Facebook following — way above the town’s roughly 9,700 residents — with videos largely centering on police work. He’ll strum his guitar and sing the occasional ballad, all of it endearing him to what he considers an extended family.

“I got COVID last year and shared that experience,” the 32-year-old said. “Is the vaccine going to protect you 100% of the time? No. But I compare it to wearing a seat belt — it doesn’t ensure nothing bad will happen, but your chances of saving your life are a lot higher.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar warned Tuesday of “a full-scale civil war” if the powerful military, supporters of the ousted democracy, ethnic groups and other key parties didn’t hold a successful dialogue on issues including the current coronavirus outbreak as well as the root causes of the country’s crisis.

Christine Schraner Burgener told a news conference that clashes between the military and local defense forces were continuing, people were frightened and suffering, there was no freedom of speech, the World Bank predicted an 18% drop in GDP this year, and the International Labor Organization estimated 2.2 million jobs had been lost since January.

On top of that, she said, Myanmar is currently facing “a severe COVID-19 third wave” with more than 333,000 reported cases, including 3,611 new cases on Monday.

Myanmar for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi’s rise to leadership in 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country. The Feb. 1 coup followed November elections, which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won overwhelmingly and the military contested as fraudulent.

Schraner Burgener said Myanmar’s military leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, wanted to maintain his grip on power, pointing to the recent declaration naming him prime minister, the annulment of November’s election and fears that Suu Kyi’s party would soon be disbanded.

In her wide-ranging discussions with all sides in Myanmar, she said she realized no sides “will give up and are ready to make any compromises.”

So she said she decided not to wait for the 10-member Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations known as ASEAN to appoint a special envoy and moved ahead with her proposal for an all-inclusive dialogue that would also include discussions of humanitarian assistance, the plight of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim minority and “root causes” — the country’s federal system, Constitution, army, election and legal systems, and more.

Over the last two months, Schraner Burgener said, she discussed her proposal with key parties in Myanmar and the international community.

Her proposal also envisions an international observer group including China, India, Japan, Thailand, United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, European Union, United Nations and ASEAN, which includes Myanmar.

During her discussions, she said Myanmar’s ethnic armed organizations “were in the majority very positive of this idea” and members of the National United Government, established by elected legislators who were barred from taking their seats when the military seized power on Feb. 1, were “interested in the idea but clearly would have preconditions to start such a dialogue.”

Schraner Burgener said she had a long conversation with deputy military chief Soe Win on July 16 on many issues including the proposal for a dialogue, but “I didn’t receive an answer,” and since then, “there is no positive feedback from the army on this dialogue, which I really regret.”

Nonetheless, she said, a dialogue will hopefully start through ASEAN and its new special envoy for Myanmar, Brunei’s Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof. She said she had a long videoconference Monday with Yusof, who plans to visit Myanmar after consulting key parties, and told him he could “count on my full support.”

“I also offered to join him, so I hope that the army will be ready also to receive me,” she said, adding that she believes the military keeps saying it’s not ready to meet her not because they don’t want to talk to her but “because people on the ground would be very encouraged by my presence in the country, and that’s probably something which the army doesn’t want to see.”

Schraner Burgener said she remained worried that the country would move in the direction of a civil war if the dialogue, which hopefully will start through ASEAN, “will not be successfully done.”

“We see a lot of violence on the ground,” she said.

Many people are afraid of “the huge violence scale” of the military, she said, but “the people’s defense forces” have also moved from using self-made weapons and “are using now professional weapons.”

“So, I really hope that a dialogue can happen to avoid a breakout of a full-scale civil war,” Schraner Burgener said.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the worst of Greece’s massive wildfires were being tamed Tuesday, the country’s civil protection chief defended the firefighting efforts, saying every resource was thrown into the battle against what he described as the fire service’s biggest-ever challenge.

Nikos Hardalias said authorities “truly did what was humanly possible” against blazes that destroyed tens of thousands of hectares (acres) of forest and hundreds of homes, killed a volunteer firefighter and forced more than 60,000 people to flee. Two other firefighters were in intensive care with severe burns.

“We handled an operationally unique situation, with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather conditions we’ve seen in 40 years,” Hardalias told a news conference. “Never was there such a combination of adverse factors in the history of the fire service.”

Greece had just experienced its worst heat wave since 1987, which left its forests tinder-dry. Other nearby nations such as Turkey and Italy also faced the same searing temperatures and quickly spreading fires.

Worsening drought and heat — both linked to climate change — have also fueled wildfires this summer in the U.S. West and in Siberia in northern Russia.

Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events. Researchers can directly link a single event to climate change only through intensive data analysis, but they say such calamities are expected to happen more frequently.

In Greece, the worst blaze still burning Tuesday was in the northern section of Evia, the country’s second-largest island, which is linked by a bridge to the mainland north of Athens and is a favorite holiday destination for the Greek capital’s residents.

Nearly 900 firefighters, 50 ground teams and more than 200 vehicles were fighting the blaze that broke out Aug. 3, the fire service said. They included crews from Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Poland — part of a huge international response to Greece’s plea for assistance.

Fourteen helicopters provided air support Tuesday on Evia, including three from Serbia, two from Switzerland and two from Egypt. The wildfire on Evia, unlike many in the United States, was burning in an area in which villages and forests are entwined.

Hardalias said all the fire fronts on Evia were waning, but firefighters were guarding the perimeter of the blaze, particularly around a cluster of villages that were among the dozens evacuated on the island in recent days. However, heavy smoke from the fires has often reduced visibility to zero, making it too dangerous for water-dropping aircraft to assist ground forces.

According to EU wildfire data and satellite imagery, more than 121,000 acres have burned up on Evia — by far the worst damage from any of the recent fires in Greece.

Several other wildfires were burning in the country, with the most significant in the southern Peloponnese region, where new evacuations were ordered Tuesday afternoon. About 400 firefighters, including teams from the Czech Republic and Britain, battled that blaze, assisted by five helicopters and 23 water-dropping planes from several countries.

A judicial investigation is under way into the causes of the fires, including any links to criminal activity. Several arson suspects have been arrested.

“I don’t know whether there is any organized arson plan, that’s not my job,” Hardalias told the news conference. But it was his “feeling” that at least with the flames near ancient Olympia, the seven or eight fires that broke out in close succession could be due to arson.

Also on Tuesday, a woman convicted of intentionally starting a fire in an Athens park last week was sentenced to five years in prison.

Residents and local officials on Evia have complained about a lack of water-dropping planes in the early stages that they say left the fire to grow to such proportions that flying became too hazardous.

Hardalias argued that when the Evia blaze broke out, authorities were already facing other enormous challenges. A major forest fire was burning through the northern outskirts of Athens, forcing the evacuation of thousands, and another was coursing through villages towards ancient Olympia — a hugely important archaeological site in the Peloponnese where the ancient Olympic Games were held for more than 1,000 years.

“Every house lost is a tragedy for all of us. It’s a knife in our heart,” he said.

Asked whether he was satisfied with the country’s firefighting response, Hardalias said: “Obviously, there can be no satisfaction after such a catastrophe. But all our available forces, ground and airborne, were sent immediately to the fires.”

“Whether we could have done something different remains to be seen,” he said. “But in any case, we fought a great battle, and the losses were among those fighting it, not among civilians.”

Greek authorities have emphasized saving lives, issuing evacuation alerts for dozens of villages and neighborhoods this summer. In 2018, a deadly fire that engulfed a seaside settlement near Athens killed more than 100 people, including some who drowned trying to escape the flames and smoke by sea.

Critics say the government’s focus on evacuating villages prevented villagers with local knowledge from helping firefighters and led to more property destruction.

Greece’s center-right government has pledged to provide compensation to everyone who suffered loss from the wildfires and to undertake a massive reforestation effort to replace the trees that have burned.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a special Cabinet meeting Tuesday that owners of destroyed or damaged homes would receive up to 150,000 euros ($176,000) in state compensation, with initial payments to begin next week, while businesses and farmers will also get support and tax breaks.

In southwest Turkey, crews battled two fires Tuesday in the coastal province of Mugla, including a brush fire near Bodrum’s Gumusluk resort neighborhood. Bodrum’s mayor said the fire was close to being extinguished and no residential areas were threatened.

Meanwhile, firefighters quickly put out a new blaze in a forest in Istanbul’s Sariyer district.

Paphitis reported from Kontias, Greece.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Just three months after the latest war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, the border town of Sderot appears to be on the road to recovery.

The streets are bustling, and the town is filled with well-kept parks and playgrounds. The local real-estate market is booming.

But underneath the veneer of normality, the scars of years of rocket fire run deep.

Metal rocket fragments are on display outside the main police station, as a museum of sorts. Next to every park and bus stop is a small concrete bomb shelter — often decked out with colorful murals and street art. An Iron Dome rocket defense battery sits on the eastern edge of town, a few hundred yards from a new apartment complex.

Some Sderot residents say they jump at the smallest noise. Parents report children still wetting their beds or being too scared to sleep alone.

Noam Biton says she has enjoyed a normal childhood in Sderot. But the 16-year-old high school student says it hasn’t always been easy. One of her strongest memories was that of an air-raid siren that sounded while she was attending a bar mitzvah celebration on what had been a quiet day.

“We lay on the ground, three of us,” she said. “The only thing protecting us was a car.” The rocket landed nearby, spraying shrapnel in the area.

Outgoing and active in her local scout troop, Noam says she is always careful to sit next to the door when she rides the bus — just in case there is an air-raid siren and she needs to evacuate quickly.

Her mother, Dvora, a lifelong resident, says uncertainty is a constant companion. “It saddens you that at any moment someone controls your life,” she said. “We can’t escape.”

Israel and Hamas, which opposes Israel’s existence, have fought four wars and numerous skirmishes since the militant group seized control of Gaza in 2007, a year after winning a Palestinian election.

It is impossible to compare conditions in Gaza and in southern Israel. Israeli strikes have killed some 4,000 Palestinians, including hundreds of civilians, in the four wars and inflicted heavy damage on Gaza’s infrastructure. Tens of thousands of people, unable to flee the impoverished and blockaded Palestinian territory, suffer from deep psychological wounds.

Israelis are now protected by a missile-defense system, have the option of temporarily escaping rocket range and have access to psychological counseling and government support. Still, more than 100 people have died on the Israeli side in the four wars, while heavy rocket fire has brought life to a standstill for millions of people during times of fighting. Even during times of quiet, rocket fire can erupt at any moment without warning.

No place in Israel has been hit harder by Palestinian rocket fire than Sderot, a working-class community just about a mile from the Gaza border. Yet two decades after the first rudimentary rockets landed in town, experts are still struggling to figure out their long-term effects on a generation of parents and children who have come of age in this traumatic environment.

“People who are living in the south of Israel live with the understanding that it’s just a question of time until the next time,” said Talia Levanon, director of the Israel Trauma Coalition.

“You are literally trying to heal from the last time while preparing for the next time, which makes our job very, very tough,” she said.

Levanon’s nonprofit operates a series of “resilience centers” throughout southern Israel that provide a variety of services, including counseling and workshops for families and communities.

In an indication of how widely people have been affected, she said that during a brief round of violence in 2019, nearly two-thirds of the area’s 60,000 residents received services from a resilience center.

The 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in May was the latest reminder of Sderot’s precarious position. Nearly 300 rockets were fired at Sderot, according to the municipality. Despite the protection of the Iron Dome, 10 rockets scored direct hits on buildings — including a strike that killed a 5-year-old boy.

Sderot residents often use the word “resilience” when describing the community. And in many ways, the town appears to be thriving.

Once known as a dusty backwater in Israel’s Negev desert, it has evolved into a bustling town of about 27,000 people, with new apartment complexes and expensive villas seeming to pop up in any piece of open space. It has a heavily fortified train station linking it to major cities. There are shopping centers, bars and restaurants popular with students from a college in town.

Researchers say that people who grow up here tend to remain in the area as adults, out of pride and a strong connection to its tightknit community.

Yaron Sasson, spokesman for the local government, said veteran residents and newcomers are drawn by special tax breaks and generous services made possible by government support and overseas donors, as well as the small-town feel. At a time when much of the country is now within rocket range, he said that Sderot is even seen as relatively safe, thanks to its many bomb shelters and reinforced schools and kindergartens.

Yet according to the trauma coalition, residents suffer from various symptoms. Teens suffer from higher rates of diabetes, aggression and hypertension than their counterparts in other communities.

Anxiety, depression, sleeping difficulties and general exhaustion are common symptoms among adults, and researchers only now are beginning to study the effects of growing up in Sderot on young parents’ child-rearing skills. Another question is how Sderot’s youths — who are frequently spooked by loud noises — can perform in the military, a compulsory rite of passage for most Jewish Israelis.

Dvora Biton said that whenever she goes out in the car, she plans a route that will take her past any of the dozens of bomb shelters scattered throughout town. The car window is always open, the volume on the radio is kept low and the pantry is filled with canned goods. Any loud sound, even a popping balloon, makes her jump.

“It’s something that you think about 24 hours a day,” she said. “You can’t escape it, even when you are sleeping.”

Fifteen years ago, before there was the Iron Dome, a rocket landed outside the family’s home, leaving a metal fragment embedded in her front door. Biton left the fragment in the door for years, only recently finding the strength to remove it during a home renovation.

“I wanted to leave it there as a reminder that we live in an unhealthy reality,” she said. “But on the other hand, there is a feeling you want to be released from these things.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bangladesh’s government and aid agencies started vaccinating Rohingya refugees Tuesday as a virus surge raised health risks in the sprawling, cramped camps where more than 1 million people who fled Myanmar are sheltering.

The highly transmissible Delta variant is driving an infection surge across Bangladesh, with around 20,000 infections and 200 deaths recorded so far in Cox’s Bazar district, the southern region bordering Myanmar where the refugee camps are located.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said a national positivity rate of around 30% indicates the spread of COVID-19 is much higher, especially with cramped conditions and the risks faced by many people living in the refugee camps.

The government’s Civil Surgeon’s office in Cox’s Bazar and aid agencies began the vaccination campaign across 34 camps alongside Bangladesh’s national vaccination effort.

About 500 Bangladesh Red Crescent staff and volunteers joined the health workers for the campaign in collaboration with the U.N. refugee agency, according to a statement from the international body.

Rohingya community leaders, front-line health care volunteers in the camps, and Rohingya people older than 55 are in the first group to be vaccinated. More than 65,000 of the nearly 900,000 refugees will be vaccinated in the first cohort, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in an email to The Associated Press.

“COVID-19 has spread all over the world. We came here to get vaccinated for our protection so that it does not harm us,” Nurul Islam, 65, said in a camp at Ukhiya in Cox’s Bazar, as he waited for shots alongside hundreds of other refugees.

Bangladesh has reported more than 1.3 million infections, including more than 23,000 deaths due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began.

Experts say the full toll may be underreported because many people don’t go to hospitals and many others died before getting tested. Across the country’s vast border regions with India, infections from the Delta variant have spread amid concern that a lack of awareness about masks and maintaining other health guidelines could lead to a deteriorating COVID-19 situation in the densely populated nation.

Less than 5% of the country’s 160 million people are fully vaccinated. The initial campaign was interrupted in April when India stopped exporting AstraZeneca vaccines to Bangladesh, which had made a purchase agreement for 30 million doses.

The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina bolstered its effort to get vaccines from other sources, particularly China, and began a new round of vaccinations nationwide starting last weekend.

The country now has a good stock of vaccines, mostly China’s Sinopharm. Officials say more than 3 million people received a shot in the first two days of the new campaign.

More than 700,000 Rohingya fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar in 2017 as a harsh military crackdown was waged against the ethnic group following an attack by insurgents. Other Rohingya have lived in refugee camps in Bangladesh following earlier waves of persecution.

The 2017 crackdown included rapes, killings and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the United Nations. While Bangladesh and Myanmar have sought to arrange repatriations, the Rohingya are too fearful to return home.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Zuleydis Elledias has gotten up each morning for the last two months hoping for a phone call, a message — any news on the fate of her husband and nephew, who disappeared at sea after the boat they were in capsized as they tried to reach Florida.

Another half-dozen families in the small town of Orlando Nodarse, 35 miles west of Havana and near the port of Mariel, are living with the same uncertainty.

“Due to the pandemic, my husband lost his job. Many places closed, and he had been home for more than a year. Every time he went to his workplace, they told him to wait. And that made him desperate because we have a 2-year-old son,” Elledias, a 38-year-old homemaker, told the Associated Press through tears.

Cuba is seeing an increase in unauthorized migration to the United States, fueled by an economic crisis exacerbated by the pandemic, increased U.S. sanctions and cutbacks in aid from Venezuela. That has led to shortages in many goods and protests that shook the island July 11.

And legal ways to leave have been strained by the Trump administration’s near-closure of the U.S. Consulate in 2017 following a series of mysterious illnesses among diplomatic personnel that some said may have resulted from an attack — allegations Cuba denies.

Most Cubans who want to try for a U.S. visa now have to go to embassies in other countries — and getting there is almost impossible due to sharp cuts in air traffic during the pandemic. Most can’t afford tickets anyway unless relatives can front them the money.

That has pushed many Cubans to launch themselves into the sea on small boats or rafts to attempt the dangerous crossing of the Florida Strait.

The U.S. Coast Guard said recently it has intercepted 595 Cubans at sea since the current fiscal year started Oct. 1. That’s larger than any full fiscal year since 2017 — during which the U.S. announced that even Cubans reaching U.S. shores were likely to be expelled, ending a long-standing policy of granting asylum to those who reached dry land.

It’s still small in comparison with the nearly 5,400 halted at sea in 2016 or the dramatic crises of 1994-95 and 1980, when Cuba’s government temporarily stopped trying to block departures and tens of thousands set out en masse. Thousands died at sea.

It’s also still far smaller than the current flow of those who have somehow made their way to the continent and worked their way north. The U.S. Border Patrol had recorded 26,196 Cubans trying to enter the U.S. illegally between Oct. 1 and June 30, most by land.

As well as her husband — 45-year-old driver Fernando Quiñones — Elledias is also awaiting word on her nephew Ismel Reyes, 22, who worked on a farm.

They were among a group of 18 men and two women who left Cuba for Florida on May 25. The boat sank the following night and survivors were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard about 18 miles southwest of Key West, Fla. The search by sea, land and air lasted for days.

“Something happened, I don’t know, the currents, the boat flipped. The United States Coast Guard rescued eight people alive, found two bodies, and there are 10 people missing,” Elledias said.

Among the survivors were four cousins of Elledias, some of whom have already been repatriated to Cuba.

Elledias, her sister Sudenis — Reyes’ mother — and other Orlando Nodarse residents who spoke with the AP all agreed that the risky decision to head for the United States was triggered by the economic crisis and the difficulties in obtaining a visa.

Cuban historian Alina Bárbara López noted that two earlier mass exoduses by sea were spawned by crises, and Cuban authorities opened the borders as a kind of release valve in the face of social pressure.

In 1980, with unhappy Cubans pouring into foreign embassy compounds seeking visas, Fidel Castro opened the port at Mariel for people who wanted to leave and 125,000 Cubans rushed north, setting off a political crisis for the Carter administration.

The economic tailspin of the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union — and its aid to Cuba — led tens of thousands to put to sea in inner tubes, makeshift rafts and hijacked boats. Then too, many died.

But now Havana is “trapped” because it cannot open its borders due to migration agreements signed with Washington in the wake of that crisis, she said.

Meanwhile, Cuba’s economic reforms have been only superficial, López said. The economy remains stagnant.

“All this makes the underlying political foundation of this crisis much stronger than in the previous” crises, she said.

Cuban authorities acknowledge there are “symptoms” of a possible migratory crisis but say it could be deactivated if President Biden fulfills a campaign promise to jettison Trump’s tighter sanctions, which were aimed at trying to drive the Communist Party from power, and resumes the dialogue launched by former President Obama.

“The situation we have now is the result of a number of negative factors,” said Jesús Perz Calderón of the United States department at Cuba’s Foreign Ministry. “In the first place, the deterioration of the economy as a result of COVID-19 ... but at the same time the resurgence of an economic war of blockade against Cuba by the United States.”

José Ramón Cabañas, a former Cuban ambassador to the U.S. and current director of the Center for International Policy Research, said both nations have instruments in place to prevent an exodus to Florida.

Advertisement

“There are agreements in force, but they are not being fully applied,” Cabañas said.

The U.S. had provided 22,000 visas a year to Cuba for two decades until 2017, when Trump froze relations. The consulate shutdown made applying for a visa almost moot for most Cubans.

In addition, at the beginning of 2017, Obama eliminated the policy known as “wet foot-dry foot,” which let Cubans who reached U.S. shores remain, usually as refugees, while those caught at sea were sent back.

Back in Orlando Nodarse, Elledias hopes a miracle will bring home her loved ones.

“I would tell people who are thinking about this option not to do it, that it is not a safe route. There is no money in the world that can pay for this suffering we are going through,” she said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Good evening. I’m Karen Kaplan, back from a week away, and it’s Tuesday, Aug. 10. Here’s the latest on what’s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.

Newsletter Get our free Coronavirus Today newsletter Sign up for the latest news, best stories and what they mean for you, plus answers to your questions. Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.

In a few days, my kids will be starting a new school year. It’ll be their first time back in classrooms since things shut down abruptly 17 months ago. It’s a huge milestone on the road back to normal life, and I’d like to be more excited about it. But there’s one thing getting in the way — the Delta variant.

This was not what I expected when school ended in June. At the time, coronavirus infections were plummeting, COVID-19 vaccinations were rising, and the state was on the verge of reopening the economy. The end of the pandemic seemed to be in sight.

No longer.

California is averaging 11,211 new coronavirus cases per day over the past week, a figure that’s almost twice as high as it was two weeks ago. And the number of coronavirus-infected people in California hospitals doubled in just two weeks, rising from 2,981 on July 25 to 5,973 on Sunday.

This new wave includes outbreaks among school-age children. Seven of them occurred in Los Angeles County in the last week of July — the most since December, when we were in the midst of a devastating surge. County officials say most of these recent outbreaks were associated with youth sports, especially in situations where safety precautions like mask-wearing and physical distancing weren’t taken seriously.

Barbara Ferrer, the county’s public health director, said that there were 319 confirmed coronavirus cases among kids 11 and under in the two weeks ending July 24, up from just 47 in the two-week period ending June 26. Among adolescents ages 12 to 17, cases rose from 34 to 211.

Though these numbers are still small compared to the worst days of fall-and-winter surge, they’re hardly reassuring.

“We recognize that, given our recent increases in cases, there is anxiety around school reopening,” Ferrer said.

If you are feeling some of that anxiety, know that you’re not alone. My colleague Howard Blume found plenty of parents who are right there with you.

“I wanted to be excited about a new school year, but now I am having to think: ‘Am I putting our health at risk by going to school in person?’” said Irma Villalpando, a mother of two students at the Maywood Center for Enriched Studies. “I am feeling very sad because I think that it is going to be another very difficult year.”

Part of what makes things difficult is the all-or-nothing approach school districts are taking. Hybrid learning was far from perfect, but without it, the choices boil down to two unappealing options: Full-time, on campus-instruction with face masks but no requirements for physical distancing, or an online option that’s essentially an independent-study program.

As Blume points out, health officials argue that schools can operate safely at their usual capacity as long as they take other preventive measures, such as stepping up their cleaning and hygiene practices, installing better air filters and making sure students, teachers and staff members stay home if they are sick.

If it’s discovered that an infected person has been on campus, L.A. County officials will engage in aggressive contact tracing. Those with infections will be required to isolate themselves, and close contacts will need to quarantine for up to 10 days unless they are vaccinated. In some cases, groups of students or even an entire class could be asked to remain at home, but wholesale closures of schools are unlikely, Ferrer said.

Even so, many parents are bracing for a choppy year ahead.

“I thought I would be sending my children back,” said DeAnne Ozaki, whose children are in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. “My daughter is vaccinated, and I was hoping that the number of COVID cases would be low and it would be safe for my son. Unfortunately, the Delta variant has changed everything.”

By the numbers

Track California’s coronavirus spread and vaccination efforts — including the latest numbers and how they break down — with our graphics.

How partisan politics is literally killing us

I don’t envy Steve Allender. He’s the Republican mayor of Rapid City, S.D., and he spent more than a year urging people to protect themselves against COVID-19. That includes wearing masks, avoiding crowds and getting vaccinated.

How were his efforts to keep his constituents safe rewarded? With people harassing him at public meetings and staking out his home.

The intimidation campaign worked. By early summer, he had given up. Only 34.7% of residents in Pennington County, where Rapid City is located, are vaccinated, and coronavirus activity there is classified as “high” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“Our role is just to sit back and let it happen,” he told my colleagues in an interview. “I feel like a bit of a coward.”

He’s not the only one.

David Trujillo, the mayor of Lovington, N.M., was one of the first residents of Lea County to get vaccinated. He’s a Democrat in a rural county that Donald Trump won in November by 60 percentage points. With only 21% of the county fully vaccinated, he said he’s got little to gain — and much to lose — by talking up the shots.

“It’s a hard sell here,” said Trujillo, who is up for reelection in April. “You could lose votes for pushing the vaccine too much.”

My colleagues reached out to the mayors or town managers of the counties with the lowest vaccination rate in each state. Twenty-six officials were willing to talk with them, and they found that “the majority expressed deep frustration at the way politics had infected the campaign to inoculate enough Americans to wipe out the virus.”

Another theme: The mayors who supported vaccination felt they’d done everything they could and there was nothing left for them to try that might persuade people to get the shots.

“It’s disappointing,” said Mayor Allen Brown, an independent who leads Texarkana, Ark. Only 9.3% of residents in surrounding Miller County are fully vaccinated.

Trump won Miller County by more than 46 percentage points, and that fits a trend: In most cases, the counties with the lowest vaccination rates were among the most ardent supporters of the former president (who, it should be noted, accelerated the development of COVID-19 vaccines through Operation Warp Speed and got the shots himself).

Several of the mayors my colleagues talked to said vaccine misinformation was to blame for their low vaccination rates.

“Rumors go around that they’re putting something in [the vaccines] to track you,” said Roger Taylor, the Democratic mayor of Pawhuska, Okla.

Some mayors also pointed to a deep distrust of scientists, public health experts and the federal government.

Reece Keener, the unvaccinated Republican mayor of Elko, Nev., is partial to the view that the dangers of the pandemic have been exaggerated. He told my colleagues he was sick of “an overabundance of ‘fear porn’ that’s being broadcasted everywhere” and blamed “contradictions and confusing messaging from the CDC” for keeping Elko County’s vaccination rate at 29.6%.

The irony is that people like Keener are in the best position to change people’s minds.

A poll last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that only 54% of Republicans surveyed had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, compared with 86% of Democrats. And according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, unvaccinated Republicans were more likely to roll up their sleeves in response to an appeal from a Republican politician than one from a Democrat.

Trump won Winston County, Ala., by 82 percentage points. Only 14.9% of residents there are fully vaccinated. But Elmo Robinson, the vaccinated Democratic mayor of Double Springs, still hopes that number will rise.

Looking on the bright side, Robinson said the number of people in his county who had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine had tripled since mid-July.

Here’s a rare bit of good news: The coronavirus surge is showing signs of slowing in L.A. County.

A total of 20,979 new cases were reported in the county during the week that ended Sunday. That was higher than the 19,704 new cases reported in the previous week, but the rate of growth was lower — 6.5%, compared with 22% a week earlier.

What’s more, the test positivity rate for the county was 4.4% on Tuesday, down from 6.6% a week ago.

The county’s universal indoor mask mandate — the first in the state — is surely contributing to the slowdown, Ferrer told the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. Weekly coronavirus cases in California’s other 57 counties increased by 20% during the period that ended Sunday.

Unfortunately, Ferrer is already bracing for these numbers to go up as schools reopen. Once students — from kindergarten to college — return to campus, there’ll be more testing that turns up more infections.

“It does mean for the months of August and September we’re likely to see our case numbers climb,” she said.

In Florida, a school district in Tallahassee is hoping to limit new infections by requiring students to wear masks when they return to campus on Wednesday. The mask mandate will apply to pupils from kindergarten up through eighth grade.

Advertisement

But Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state Board of Education could punish the district if it follows through with its mask mandate. That’s because the Florida Department of Health has issued an emergency rule saying school districts must allow parents to decide whether their children should wear masks on campus.

Leon County Schools Superintendent Rocky Hanna said he asked DeSantis for permission to enforce a temporary mask mandate. The governor did not respond, Hanna said, but he proceeded anyway.

“I did a lot of soul searching, a lot of thinking,” the superintendent said. “If, heaven forbid, we lost a child to this virus, I can’t just simply blame the governor of the state of Florida. I can’t.”

The Leon County mandate allows students to be exempted from the mask mandate if they have a note from a doctor or psychologist. That’s not good enough for DeSantis, who said the state could move to withhold salaries from Hanna or the members of the school board.

A growing number of colleges and universities are requiring students to provide proof of vaccination to attend in-person classes. And as anyone who’s taken Economics 101 can tell you, a rule like that will create a market for fake COVID-19 vaccine cards.

Students, education officials and law enforcement officers all say that a cottage industry has emerged to cater to those who don’t want to get vaccinated for personal or religious reasons. For example, one Instagram account is offering laminated vaccination cards for $25 apiece. Elsewhere on the Internet, cards and certificates are on offer for as much as $200.

“This is our own way of saving as many people as we possibly can from the poisonous vaccine,” one seller wrote on the encrypted messaging app Telegram.

The shenanigans come at a dicey time for the United States. Thanks in large part to the Delta variant, daily new infections across the country exceeded 100,000 on Saturday. It was the first time that threshold had been crossed since the winter surge.

Advertisement

It took about nine months for the U.S. to hit 100,000 average daily coronavirus cases the first time, back in November. Daily new cases peaked at about 250,000 in early January, then bottomed out in June, averaging about 11,000 per day. This time, it only took six weeks to climb back up to the 100,000 mark.

Hospitalizations and deaths are also increasing, though all are still below the peaks seen early this year before vaccines became widely available.

Health officials fear that cases, hospitalizations and deaths will keep soaring if the U.S. vaccination campaign doesn’t pick up steam soon. Nationwide, 50% of residents are fully vaccinated and nearly 59% have received at least one dose.

The slowdown has allowed the European Union to surpass the U.S., according to Our World in Data, an online science publication connected to the University of Oxford.

Advertisement

In mid-February, fewer than 4% of EU residents were at least partially vaccinated against COVID-19, compared with nearly 12% in the U.S. Now, some 60% of the bloc’s residents have received at least one dose of vaccine.

And when it comes to those who are fully immunized, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and France are all doing better than the U.S. Poland isn’t far behind.

The world leader is Canada, with 72% of the population at least partially vaccinated 62% fully vaccinated.

Your questions answered

Today’s question comes from readers who want to know: When will a COVID-19 vaccine receive full FDA approval?

If we’ve learned anything about the pandemic, it’s that it’s foolish to make predictions about the future. So when Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked this question over the weekend, he answered like this:

“I hope — I don’t predict — I hope that it will be within the next few weeks,” Fauci said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I hope it’s within the month of August.”

It’s certainly possible. Pfizer and BioNTech filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration to formally approve their COVID-19 vaccine in May. Moderna followed suit in June. Both companies’ vaccines have been authorized for emergency use since December.

Although Fauci wouldn’t get specific about the timing of an FDA approval, he said was willing to make a forecast about what would happen next — a slew of vaccine mandates.

“That could be colleges, universities, places of business, a whole variety, and I strongly support that,” he said. “We’ve got to go the extra step to get people vaccinated.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Some of the foreign contractors who powered the logistics of America’s “forever war” in Afghanistan now find themselves stranded on an unending layover in Dubai without a way to get home.

After nearly two decades, the rapid U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has upended the lives of thousands of private security contractors from some of the world’s poorest countries — not the hired guns but the hired hands who serviced the American war effort. For years, they toiled in the shadows as cleaners, cooks, construction workers, servers and technicians on sprawling American bases.

In the rushed evacuation, scores of these foreign workers trying to get home to the Philippines and other countries that restricted international travel because of the pandemic have become stuck in limbo at hotels across Dubai.

As the U.S. brings home its remaining troops and abandons its bases, experts say the chaotic departure of the Pentagon’s logistics army lays bare an uncomfortable truth about a privatized system long susceptible to mismanagement — one largely funded by American taxpayers but outside the purview of American law.

“It’s the same situation that affects foreign contractors all over the world, people who have little understanding of where they’re going and very uncertain relationships once they arrive determining their legal status and movements,” said Anthony Cordesman, a national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

“The terms of contracts in war can really absolve the employer of major responsibility. ... Even the right of return can be uncertain,” he added.

While it’s unclear just how many remain stuck abroad after the evacuation, an Associated Press journalist saw at least a dozen Filipino contractors for engineering and construction company Fluor stranded at the Movenpick hotel in Bur Dubai, an older neighborhood of the city-state along the Dubai Creek.

The hotel management declined to comment, saying it “has no authority to disclose presence and information of any hotel guests nor hotel corporate partners details due to privacy reasons.”

The U.S. military’s Central Command declined to comment on private security contractors, referring all questions to their companies. The U.S. military’s contracting office and the Philippines Consulate in Dubai did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the stranded Filipino contractors.

As of early June, 2,491 foreign contract workers remained on U.S. bases across Afghanistan, down from 6,399 in April, according to the latest figures from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

With the U.S. set to formally end its military mission at the end of August, most of these workers have since made it home on flights arranged by their employers — the private military behemoths that over years of war won Pentagon logistics contracts in Afghanistan worth billions of dollars.

But other employees, brought first to Dubai on their way home after an abrupt departure on June 15, weren’t so lucky. The Philippines, along with Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, halted flights to the United Arab Emirates in mid-May over fears of the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus and repeatedly renewed the travel ban.

Thus began a seemingly interminable layover that some Filipino workers described to the AP as one of anxiety and unrelenting boredom. The contractors spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the precariousness of their situation.

Drawn to Afghanistan by the promise of steady employment and wages far higher than in the Philippines, several of the stranded Fluor contractors spent years working in construction, equipment transport, visa processing and other military logistics. Some worked at Bagram Air Base, the largest military compound in the country, and at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan. They had nothing to do with combat operations but described nonetheless facing rocket attacks and other risks of war on base.

Those who spoke to AP said they knew of scores more contractors from the Philippines and other countries including Nepal stuck in Dubai, but couldn’t provide more specific information.

With their cash dwindling over the two-month layover, most said they couldn’t afford to do anything but wait. They while away their time watching TV and video-calling with family in the Philippines from the hotel, where Fluor provides daily meals.

Construction giant Fluor, the Irving, Texas-based firm that was the biggest defense contractor in Afghanistan, did not respond to repeated requests for comment before this story was published. After publication, the company released a statement saying, “We continue to do everything we can to repatriate all employees required to leave Afghanistan.” Fluor blamed virus-related travel restrictions for the troubles, said it was caring for everyone affected and promised to “continue to work closely with the U.S. government to remove these barriers as quickly as possible.”

The Defense Department has spent $3.8 billion for Fluor’s work in Afghanistan since 2015, federal records show, most of it for logistics services.

With little publicly known about the evacuation process for the war’s contractors, it has become increasingly apparent that the Pentagon’s long-invisible foreign fleet may remain so.

“Everyone has been so focused on the U.S. troops, and also the Afghans, interpreters and others” who could face revenge killings by a resurgent Taliban, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “About the stranded foreign workers, the Biden administration can say, well, their companies and their governments should have moved heaven and earth to get them home.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For more than a century, one of Mississippi’s most elaborate Confederate monuments has looked out over the lawn at the courthouse in the center of Greenwood, a Black-majority city with a history of civil rights protests and clashes. Protesters have demonstrated at the base of the towering pillar with six Confederate figures — some residents demanding removal amid a racial reckoning across the country, others advocating for the statue’s protection as a piece of history.

Now, after years of debate, a new statue will be erected in Greenwood — one of Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old brutally beaten and shot in 1955 by white men 10 miles from the city. The likeness of Till, whose death is still under federal investigation, will be one of only a handful of statues of African Americans in Mississippi, where dozens of Confederate monuments dot the landscape at courthouses, town squares and other prominent locations.

Greenwood is one of hundreds of cities and towns nationwide grappling with painful, expensive questions: What should be done with these tributes to the Civil War and the Confederate soldiers who fought in it? And what monuments should go up in their place to represent the community?

Across Mississippi, multiple places have voted to remove monuments; the few that have followed through found it costly, with a $1-million bill at the University of Mississippi. In Charlottesville, Va., a Gen. Robert E. Lee figure was recently carted away — nearly four years after a deadly, racist rally there. Dozens of Confederate statues fell nationwide during the 2020 protests sparked by George Floyd’s death — many in liberal-leaning urban centers.

Advertisement

But far fewer cities have solidified plans for new tributes or monuments in their place.

In Greenwood, as in many places, change has come slowly.

The Leflore County Board of Supervisors voted in June 2020 to remove the statue, erected in 1913 by the Varina Jefferson Davis Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The board — where four of five members are Black — stipulated that the monument not be replaced by any piece honoring the civil rights movement.

The vote followed a yearslong debate about what to do with the monument, after a Black public schoolteacher and his father, Troy Brown Jr. and Troy Brown Sr., began petitioning for removal in 2017. The county initially considered leaving the Confederate statue and building a civil rights monument on the lawn for “balance.”

But community members pushed for removal. The Black board members voted 4-0 to remove the statue. The lone white member didn’t attend the meeting. He told the local newspaper he’d have voted to keep the statue.

Member Robert Collins said the statue didn’t bother him, but that if it caused pain for others, it should go. He was vocal in his opinion that another monument shouldn’t replace it, regardless of meaning or intent.

“The courthouse belongs to the people of Leflore County,” he said. “If we’re going to remove that monument, we shouldn’t put no monument on the property.”

Still, the statue stands, the process slowed by bureaucracy with no concrete plan for removal.

Board members didn’t return Associated Press calls inquiring about an update. A Mississippi Department of Archives and History spokesperson said the county attorney reached out for a consultation in November, but said the agency hasn’t heard from her since.

In April, Democratic state Sen. David Jordan of Greenwood reignited a conversation about a Till statue in the city of 13,500. He’s one of the last people alive locally who attended the trial for Till’s killers.

Till was visiting Mississippi relatives from Chicago. He was accused of whistling at and making sexual advances on 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant at a grocery store. Her husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother J.W. Milam abducted Till from his great-uncle’s home at gunpoint.

Till’s brutalized body was later pulled from the Tallahatchie River — the same river that claimed the Union merchant ship the Star of the West during the Civil War 90 years earlier. The ship is memorialized on Greenwood’s monument, its pilot wheel etched into one side.

Jordan said it’d be poetic justice to erect the Till statue in front of the courthouse — where dogs were set on Black residents trying to register to vote, in a city where racist Citizens’ Councils maintained regional headquarters.

“If we can show that change can happen here, it can happen anywhere,” Jordan said.

But the board wouldn’t budge. Collins said in April that allowing the Till statue at the courthouse would be a “double standard.”

“To move one statue and put another statue up, I wouldn’t be representing all the people I’m supposed to be representing,” Collins, who’s Black, said during a meeting.

Jordan was hurt, given that the Confederate statue also hadn’t budged.

“Let the Emmett Till statue be there for 100 years,” he said. “Then, it would be balanced.”

Ultimately, late last month, the council voted unanimously in favor of erecting the Till statue, just not at the courthouse. Instead, the statue will go up in a park a half-mile away.

Jordan decided to be optimistic about the location. The park is by railroad tracks that once separated where Black and white residents lived and worked in racially segregated Greenwood. He hopes the statue unites the community.

For now, residents on both sides of the issue are frustrated with progress.

Larry McCluney said he considers the statue a tribute to Confederate soldiers who died in battle. He’s also in favor of the Till statue — even at the courthouse — as long as the Confederate statue stands.

“It’s the same thing if I went out to the graveyard and knocked over one of your family members’ headstones,” said McCluney, commander-in-chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an organization for male descendants of Confederate veterans that spans 30,000 members. “That’s how people feel about these things: You are removing the only thing I have that I can go to as a family member and remember my ancestors.”

Brown Sr., who petitioned for removal, said Greenwood needs to show what it stands for.

“I’m not saying we shouldn’t talk about the Confederacy, but we definitely should not celebrate it in a sense that we have that statue looking over the town,” Brown said. “That young boy’s life — that’s a story worth being told.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Turkey’s wildfires have left little behind, turning green forests into ashen, barren hills. The destruction is being intensely felt by Turkey’s beekeepers, who have lost thousands of hives as well as the pine trees and the insects their bees depend on.

Twelve days of deadly wildfires have dealt a major blow to Turkey’s honey industry and even its longer term prospects appear bleak.

Nearly all of the residents of Osmaniye, a neighborhood in Turkey’s southwestern Mediterranean resort of Marmaris, are beekeepers. Their beehives once looked out to the green hills of Mugla province, where Marmaris is located, and provided the main income for many families.

Ali Kaya, 33, is second-generation beekeeper. After his father’s death, he took over the honey business his father had set up in 1979. Yet this week Kaya lost 250 hives in Osmaniye to the wildfires, as well as the entire ecosystem upon which his bees depend, so just buying new hives will not solve his economic woes.

He says the entire region is in shock.

“There is nothing left here, no trees left. Animals burned. Some people’s homes and roofs burned,” he said. “I have no idea what we’ll do. Our heads are all messed up, our mental outlook destroyed. We can’t think clearly here in Osmaniye.”

The red pine trees endemic to Anatolia span the Taurus mountain system. They can be seen along Turkey’s coast from the eastern Mediterranean all the way to the northern Aegean Sea, including a great number around Mugla. The pines provide a welcoming habitat for scores of shrubs and make an ideal environment for bees.

Bees in Mugla produce a special pine-based honey. Unlike most of the honey in the world, which is created from the nectars of flowers, bees in Mugla collect the secretions of Marchalina hellenica, a scale insect that lives on pine trees and feeds on their sap. What they leave behind, the bees take to make a nutritious honey.

Wildfires in Turkey started on July 28 amid a ferocious heat wave and raged on for days across more than half of Turkey’s provinces. As of Sunday, some wildfires were still burning in the provinces of Mugla, Aydin and Isparta. At least eight people and countless animals have been killed. Villages and resorts had to be evacuated, with some people fleeing to beaches to be rescued by sea. The wildfires also threatened two coal-burning power plants.

The Turkish government has promised to rebuild the many burned homes and compensate villagers for their animals, along with providing other aid. But it has also been criticized for its lack of firefighting planes, poor planning and overall inability to stop the fires.

Samil Tuncay Bestoy, who heads the Environmental and Bee Protection Assn., said hundreds of thousands of hives were saved purely by an accident of timing. Many nomadic beekeepers, including some from Mugla, each year move their hives to Turkey’s inland upper plains in the spring and come to Mugla from mid-August on for the pine trees. Those beehives were spared from burning, but their whole production cycle has been shattered.

“Now they don’t have anywhere to come back to, there are no forests left,” said Bestoy, a beekeeper himself. “The bees and the beekeepers are waiting at the plains with no idea of what to do.”

Since they cannot remain on the plains for long because of their feeding needs, the association was working to find healthy, temporary forest locations in Mugla, which is already highly populated with hives.

It’s a short-term solution to save the bees but points to the need for the close coordination between the government, bee-keeping associations and beekeepers to chart the way forward. Workers may have to find new beekeeping routes or even jobs in other industries.

Even before the wildfires, Turkey’s beekeepers were already suffering from climate change, with droughts and high temperatures reducing the pine trees’ sap and killing the bugs.

“Beekeeping is a fundamental culture of Anatolia, and we were already warning that we may lose it to the climate crisis. These fires have added fuel to that fire,” Bestoy said.

Further to the east, forests in Antalya’s Manavgat district were also incinerated. Beekeeper Guven Karagol had to leave his hives behind once those flames grew near.

“The fires came quickly and my beehives were burning, I could only watch. Six years of my work, this year’s labor, burned,” he told Turkish IHA news agency.

When he returned at daybreak after the fires, he saw some bees emerging and realized that 20 out of 100 hives had somehow survived.

“I thought I can’t do this in a completely blackened nature, my hopes were shattered.” he said. “These 20 hives gave me hope.”

The Turkish government has said that the burned forests would be reforested and groups have launched campaigns for saplings, but many experts say the forests need to be left alone to regenerate.

Medine Yilmaz, another second-generation beekeeper in Osmaniye, also lost her hives and had spoken to Turkish officials who visited the area. She wanted the remaining trees to be allowed to stay upright to see if they could regenerate, but she said authorities were planning on tearing down everything.

“We rose up as younger people and stopped the bulldozers. If they come again, I will lay down in front of them and not let them cut the trees,” she said.

Her husband, Yusuf, was devastated.

“I don’t care about the houses that burned. Our only sadness is that nature has disappeared, our only livelihood were these pines,” he said. “Homes will be rebuilt, wounds bandaged, but nature will not heal for 70-80 years.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Texas governor appealed for out-of-state medical help as COVID-19 hospitalizations soared, but he stopped short of reversing his ban on mask mandates even as leaders of the state’s largest cities and school systems imposed them.

Gov. Greg Abbott directed the state health department to use staffing agencies to find additional medical staff as the Delta variant overwhelmed hospitals statewide. Abbott also has sent a letter to the Texas Hospital Assn. requesting that hospitals postpone elective medical procedures.

President Biden recently called out Abbott and other Republican governors for blocking efforts to fight the pandemic.

“I say to these governors: Please help. But if you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way,” Biden said.

But Abbott this week refused to reverse his executive order banning local officials from requiring masks or vaccines even as he faced challenges from Democrats leading the state’s largest cities and counties.

“The assertion that the governor of the state of Texas doesn’t have the authority to protect the rights and freedoms of Texans is just plain misguided,” Renae Eze, the governor’s spokeswoman, said in a statement Tuesday. “Texans have learned and mastered over the past year the safe practices to protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID, and do not need the government to tell them how to do so.”

Eze added that “removing government mandates, however, does not end personal responsibility or the importance of caring for family members, friends, and your community. Vaccines are the most effective defense against contracting COVID and becoming seriously ill, and we continue to urge all eligible Texans to get the vaccine. The COVID vaccine will always remain voluntary and never forced in Texas.”

On Tuesday, officials in San Antonio and surrounding Bexar County filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order so they can require masks in public schools and quarantine for unvaccinated students exposed to the coronavirus.

“The health of our students, especially those under 12 who are not eligible to be vaccinated, are being put at risk,” Nelson Wolff, Bexar County’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We need to continue to utilize every tool we have to combat the very contagious delta variant.”

In Texas, where about 45% have been vaccinated against the virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 10,000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 this week as some students returned to schools where masks and contact tracing were not required. The U.S. has been averaging more than 110,000 new infections a day, and 56,000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 Tuesday, levels not experienced since the waning days of the winter surge.

Florida and Louisiana reported all-time record hospitalizations this week, while Arkansas registered its largest single-day increase in hospitalizations.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler, a Democrat, called the Texas governor’s refusal to respond to the crisis by imposing a statewide mask mandate “unfortunate.”

“We’ve nearly run out of staffed ICU beds,” Adler said. “This is not a political or partisan issue, or it shouldn’t be. But local governments are going to have to do what they can to protect people.”

Houston Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee visited a hospital there last weekend that had to transfer an 11-month-old COVID patient with unvaccinated parents because the facility ran out of beds. The hospital declared an “internal disaster” and has since erected two 2,000-square-foot tents outside to handle overflow, she said. She also spoke with a doctor who had five patients die of COVID in a day.

Jackson Lee contacted Biden administration emergency managers about assisting in Texas, and she said they were “ready to go.” She also contacted the governor, who had yet to respond Tuesday.

“I’m asking the governor to help his fellow Texans, many of them children,” she said. “He’s blocking wise decisions.”

Austin and Dallas school districts announced Monday that they would require students and staff to wear masks. The Houston school district — the state’s largest — announced a mask mandate its board is set to consider this week. Dallas County’s chief executive, Clay Jenkins, sued Monday to block Abbott’s mask mandate ban after a fellow member of the county commission refused to wear a mask.

“The enemy is not the governor and the enemy is not your unvaccinated neighbor or someone who disagrees with you. The enemy is the virus,” Jenkins said during a Tuesday briefing. “The time to act is now. This is about saving lives.”

Last week, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner mandated masks for city workers indoors, and the city has been sponsoring Saturday vaccination clinics.

“It’s my hope that these two measures will slow the progression as we ramp up to meet the demand coming into our hospitals,” Turner said Tuesday, noting that the number of city employees with COVID has more than tripled during the last three weeks to 135, plus 93 police officers and 44 firefighters.

Turner said that he and other local officials had to act, that they couldn’t be “bullied” into leaving it up to individuals to take responsibility for protecting public health, as the governor suggested.

“We need our police officers, we need our firefighters and our municipal employees, and I don’t want them to bring this virus home to their kids,” Turner said.

Some Texas doctors also decried the governor’s stance on masks given the state’s unfolding medical crisis. COVID hospitalization figures don’t capture the full challenge, they said, because unlike past surges when the number of non-COVID patients decreased, this time they’re having to treat the influx on top of their full non-COVID workload.

“The governor’s not helping us here,” said Dr. Nicholas Steinour, an Austin-based emergency physician. “This is not the time to let down our guard. With the Delta variant, many of our healthcare providers are now getting infected. Nursing staffing is razor thin. EMS diversion is commonplace…. I don’t see that getting better in the next couple of weeks — I see it potentially getting worse.”

Most of the COVID-19 patients Steinour sees now are unvaccinated, and he said, “That has definitely made it a little harder as we put our personal health at risk to care for these folks.”

“There’s a sense that now this is a somewhat preventable disease and those that weren’t vaccinated really didn’t do their part in making sure we have the resources to care for others,” he said. “We’re having to constantly remind ourselves that we have a duty and an obligation to care for patients when we’re starting to look at them as, ‘This is your fault.’”

Doctors and nurses across Texas said they were running out of staff and space this week, leading to long waits in emergency rooms.

“No ICU beds anywhere. Lots of sick patients boarding in the [emergency room]. Massive nurse shortages. Nightmarish hellscape,” a Texas doctor wrote on a private Facebook group where doctors shared horror stories from the latest COVID surge here and in Florida, Alabama and other states.

Avery Taylor, a nurse manager at Houston Methodist Hospital System, had to nearly double the number of beds in her COVID unit to 44 in recent weeks, hire nearly three dozen additional nurses and a dozen nursing assistants. About 70% are contract staff.

“I’m tired, my nurses are tired,” she said. “We really thought that we were through this.”

Austin health officials issued an emergency alert over the weekend that the COVID situation in the city was “severely worsening.” A north Texas health system temporarily closed one of its emergency medical centers, citing a “critical COVID surge.” Patients were sent from Texas to Colorado and North Dakota.

In suburban Montgomery County north of Houston this week, the chief executive called the situation at local hospitals he’d visited a “crisis,” saying patients were being treated in closets, hallways and waiting rooms. Houston Methodist Hospital System was inundated with requests for patient transfers to its 350 intensive care beds and offering bonuses to retain nurses and lure new hires.

“Can you imagine the largest medical complex in the world and patients are being transferred out? People should pay attention,” Dr. Faisal Masud said from the packed intensive care unit he was managing Tuesday. “It’s really becoming life and death for patients…. Across the city, there’s a huge list of patients waiting for the emergency room, even if you don’t have COVID.”

Masud confers with hundreds of other critical care doctors across Texas on a WhatsApp group. Many are scrambling to transfer increasingly young COVID-19 patients to hospitals like his with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines that take over when their lungs fail, doing more than ventilators but requiring additional staffing. He’s had to turn down many because he doesn’t have enough staff.

Most of the patients he’s seeing are unvaccinated. Some are “family clusters” infected at gatherings. When they ask what they can do, he tells them to get vaccinated, and has staff immediately make arrangements, “otherwise disinformation out there might dissuade them.” So far, he said, none has refused.

But doctors elsewhere in Texas said they have treated COVID-19 patients who refused to get vaccinated afterward, along with their relatives.

“We provide the information, but some patients are still resistant to it,” said Dr. Ralph Riviello, chair of emergency medicine at UT Health San Antonio and University Health San Antonio, where most of those being treated — some repeatedly — were unvaccinated.

“Some say the disease will protect my body and some don’t even believe us when we test them and say they have COVID,” he said. “We’re seeing a lot of suffering and dying, people of all ages.”

Advertisement

But Riviello said the hospital has also seen an increase in those seeking COVID-19 vaccines who had postponed them or were waiting for them to be fully authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.

“Those are the people who we need to get to,” he said, to “try to dispel those vaccine myths.”

In the Austin area, Dr. Nathaniel “Than” Greenwood recently treated a friend’s unvaccinated father in his 60s who caught COVID-19 while traveling with his vaccinated wife on vacation in Missouri.

“She proceeded to get better and he proceeded to get worse,” Greenwood said this week. “He’s in the ICU and they’re now discussing withdrawing care.”

But that wasn’t enough to persuade Greenwood’s friend, a retired military service member, to get vaccinated. “I needed to convince him,” he said. “After we spoke about it, he said, ‘You convinced me,’ and he got it.”

Greenwood, chief medical officer for Austin-based Family Hospital Systems, described himself as “a staunch Republican” frustrated by Texas leaders’ political infighting. This week, he had 15 patients he would normally transfer that he hadn’t been able to move.

“Everybody’s full,” he said, and with students returning to schools and universities this fall, “the numbers are still going to go up and people are going to suffer. This should not be a political issue. It’s a public health issue. People need to wear the masks and we need to work together and think of the whole, not just the individual.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday that he was resigning from office, following a blistering report by the New York attorney general that concluded he had sexually harassed multiple women — a move that staved off likely impeachment by state legislators in Albany.

The investigation released Aug. 3 left Cuomo increasingly isolated even from his own party as top Democrats including President Biden called for him to step aside. Cuomo said his resignation would become effective in 14 days.

“The best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,” Cuomo said in a video announcement. “And therefore, that’s what I’ll do.”

Democratic Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will succeed him, becoming New York’s first female governor.

Cuomo’s downfall was a remarkable reversal of fortune for a man who is part of a political dynasty and who a year ago was considered a likely future White House contender.

California Newsom wants voters to ignore the recall ballot’s second question. They don’t have to Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats are singularly focused on Californians casting a “no” vote on the first part of the recall ballot. That may leave some voters unaware they can also choose a replacement in the event Newsom loses.

But he had become a political pariah by the time he announced Tuesday that he would not finish his third term as New York governor. Scores of Democratic elected officials had been pressuring him to vacate the office even before state Atty. Gen. Letitia James began an investigation that found credible the allegations of 11 women accusing Cuomo of sexual misconduct.

The accusers’ reports of unwanted advances from the governor, including groping, kissing and lewd comments, were detailed in the 165-page findings of the investigation. At least two accounts had not previously been disclosed publicly. One of the women was a state trooper Cuomo had assigned to his detail.

The report also found that Cuomo had retaliated against another of his accusers. It concluded that Cuomo and his staff had violated multiple state and federal laws and created a toxic and hostile workplace.

Cuomo forcefully denied the report’s conclusions and issued an 85-page rebuttal that addressed each claim of sexual misconduct.

“I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances,” he said in a video released soon after James’ findings became public. “I am 63 years old. I have lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am, and that’s not who I have ever been.”

On Tuesday, Cuomo continued to insist his tactile behavior did not have any abusive intent, but he struck a more contrite tone.

“In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” he said, “but I didn’t realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn.”

Atty. Gen. James, who is widely seen as a potential contender for governor, said Tuesday that Cuomo’s resignation closed “a sad chapter for all of New York,” adding: “But it’s an important step toward justice.”

She thanked Cuomo for his contributions to the state and said the ascension of Hochul as chief executive would “help New York enter a new day.”

Hochul, a 62-year-old Buffalo native, has served as Cuomo’s lieutenant governor for the last seven years. Before that her career was mostly in local politics, though in 2011 she briefly served in the U.S. House after winning a special election in a district that had been considered safe for Republicans. The election drew national headlines, but the GOP took back the seat the next year.

Before Cuomo’s resignation, Hochul had been out front in condemning his behavior. She said she agreed with his decision to step down, writing on Twitter the move was “the right thing to do and in the best interest of New Yorkers.”

“As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State’s 57th Governor,” she tweeted.

As harassment accusations began to surface against Cuomo over the winter, he originally backed an independent review into the claims. But he later complained that the investigation was tainted by political bias. He initially dug in against calls for him to step aside, and as recently as Tuesday morning, before the governor’s resignation, his personal attorney contested the accuracy of the review.

Cuomo’s denials did little to muffle the drumbeat of Democrats who urged him to step down in response to James’ findings, including Biden, who called on his longtime friend to resign just hours after the review was made public.

Asked on Tuesday to assess Cuomo’s tenure overall, Biden said the governor had done “a hell of a job ... on everything from access to voting to infrastructure to a whole range of things. That’s why it’s so sad.” The president clarified he was speaking about Cuomo’s job performance, not his personal behavior.

Cuomo had already lost the support of many New York Democrats, including Sens. Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who had urged the governor to step aside in the spring after several women went public with accusations. The release of the investigative report compounded Cuomo’s woes in Albany, where lawmakers had already initiated an impeachment investigation, after state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said the governor had “lost the confidence of the Assembly Democratic majority and ... can no longer remain in office.”

Cuomo’s hopes of outlasting the scandal dimmed further as he continued to lose key allies, including the state Democratic Party chair and major labor unions. Melissa DeRosa, who the report said had led efforts to retaliate against one of Cuomo’s accusers, quit Monday as his top aide.

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that 7 in 10 New Yorkers, including 57% of Democrats, wanted the governor to step down. Impeachment proceedings in the statehouse accelerated, and prosecutors in three New York counties initiated investigations into potential criminal violations.

New York officials across the political spectrum described Cuomo’s decision to step aside as necessary.

Senate Majority Leader Schumer thanked “the brave women who stepped forward and courageously told their stories,” and voiced his confidence in Hochul.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, who represents part of upstate New York as the third-ranking Republican in the U.S. House, said Cuomo’s resignation was “long past overdue” and called for the governor “to be arrested and prosecuted for sexual harassment, sexual assault, and sexual abuse.”

It’s a stunning collapse for Cuomo, son of the late Gov. Mario Cuomo, who was serving his third term as governor of New York.

A year ago, when the pandemic broke out, the younger Cuomo helped fill the void created by the lack of leadership from the Trump White House. New York was hard hit by COVID-19, but Cuomo’s daily briefings that mixed pandemic data, pleas to New Yorkers to take precautions and snapshots of his personal life became must-see-TV for viewers across the country. His popularity drove some Democrats to hope Biden would pick Cuomo as his running mate.

Cuomo had already had a productive tenure in the governor’s office, helping to bring fiscal discipline to the state, to push through the legalization of gay marriage and to impose a fracking ban.

But in January, James found that the state had undercounted the number of deaths in nursing homes by thousands since the pandemic had started. Cuomo ultimately released new data, saying he had been trying to avoid a biased inquiry by the Trump administration. But his critics also pointed to his decision in spring 2020 to force nursing homes to accept people who had the coronavirus.

Cuomo is also facing allegations that he, his family and powerful backers received special access to virus testing.

The nursing home controversy touched off Cuomo’s rapid descent, which initially echoed a pattern familiar to other governors who rose to prominence and soaring popularity amid a crisis. Former GOP Gov. Chris Christie, for example, had seemed politically invincible after steering New Jersey through the devastation of 2012’s Hurricane Sandy. But voters turned on the Republican amid a bruising state government shutdown in 2017, when Christie was photographed relaxing with his family on a beach after he had ordered that all state beaches remain closed to the public.

And the sky-high approval ratings that California Gov. Gavin Newsom enjoyed in the early days of the pandemic were supplanted with widespread public disappointment in the Democrat’s job performance as the state botched the distribution of unemployment checks and struggled with the vaccine rollout. Now, he faces a September recall vote.

But Cuomo’s problems would quickly dwarf those of the other governors, as accusations surfaced about outrageous and potentially criminal conduct.

Along with the misconduct allegations came reports of a toxic work environment in his office, in which colleagues were pitted against one another, cursing and yelling were the norm, and young, thin, blond women who wore tight dresses and high heels were routinely hired.

But even before the recent salacious allegations, Cuomo’s tenure was far from blemish-free. He was known as a bully who ruled through intimidation. And he’d survived controversies — notably, ethics investigations that resulted in allies going to prison.

But in the #MeToo era and with few allies willing to stay by his side after years of his heavy-handed rule, Cuomo was no longer able to save himself.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Residents of an eight-story condo building in Miami were ordered to evacuate after the building was deemed unsafe by city officials.

On Monday night, six weeks after 98 people died in the collapse of the Champlain Towers South in nearby Surfside, residents of the 138-unit building lugged belongings out to their vehicles, news outlets reported. They were ordered to vacate the building by Tuesday morning.

“My grandfather just comes in the house screaming that we have to leave immediately,” one resident told television station WSVN. “If this building is demolished, there goes our property ... and all our memories from growing up here.”

The building was put on notice July 7 for several violations, including failure to obtain its 40-year recertification as safe to occupy.

“We felt the building occupants were not safe,” Miami Building Director Asael “Ace” Marrero told the Miami Herald.

On July 26, city officials met with residents who were concerned about the condition of the building, the Herald reported.

City staff inspected the building the following day and determined that the detached elevated garage had to be closed because of structural concerns, according to the newspaper.

Officials also told the building’s property manager that the damaged columns in the main building’s first floor “required emergency shoring.”

The city ordered the building’s officials to submit a plan to fix the issue immediately but never received one, officials said. The building also did not apply for any permits to make repairs.

On Thursday, city officials received a letter from an engineer saying the “building was safe for current occupancy while the emergency repair work continued,” the Herald reported.

The next day, an inspector from Miami saw work being done without a permit, and a stop-work order was issued.

On Monday, officials from Miami’s Building Department met with the condo association and the engineer. They found the columns to be “structurally insufficient.” That’s when the evacuation order was issued.

City officials told the Herald that they were working with residents to find temporary housing.

Since the tower collapse in Surfside on June 24, residents from several south Florida buildings have been evacuated because of structural concerns.

On Tuesday morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was in Surfside to hand out $1,000 checks to first responders who helped in the search-and-rescue mission after the collapse. The money was provided through a bill approved by the state Legislature earlier this year as a “thank you” to first responders for all they’ve done throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Senate on Tuesday approved an expansive bill to rebuild the nation’s aging roads and bridges, with $8.3 billion specifically targeted to water infrastructure projects in the West and billions more to fund national projects to mitigate the impact of wildfires.

After months of negotiation among President Biden, Democrats and a group of moderate Republicans to forge a compromise, the Senate voted 69 to 30 in favor of the legislation. In the end, it had support from 19 Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

The plan, which is the first portion of Biden’s “Build Back Better” program, will next go to the House, where it faces challenges from progressives.

Ten centrist senators who worked on the bill, including lead negotiators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), said it would “create jobs, increase productivity and pave the way for decades of economic growth and prosperity — all without raising taxes on everyday Americans or increasing inflation.”

Biden similarly framed the accomplishment as proof he has delivered on his campaign promise to govern from the political center.

“This is about us doing the real hard work of governing,” Biden said. “This is about democracy delivering for the people. This is about winning the future.”

The comity was short-lived. Just moments after the bipartisan vote on the bill, the Senate turned to the second portion of Biden’s infrastructure plan, an ambitious effort to reshape the nation’s social programs.

It could accomplish many of progressives’ top policy priorities, such as implementing paid family leave and a universal prekindergarten program, expanding Medicare and enacting a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants.

Because the proposal is sharply opposed by Republicans who say it is too expensive, Democrats hope to enact it through a legislative procedure that doesn’t allow for a GOP filibuster. But significant hurdles remain: All of the legislation has to be deemed to meet a narrow set of rules for how the procedure can be used and Democrats have to remain politically united.

The Senate voted 50 to 49 along party lines to start work on that plan. The framework is expected to be approved in the early hours of Wednesday after an hours-long series of amendment votes. A detailed plan is not expected to pass until after the August recess.

The approximately $1-trillion bill approved Tuesday would address a wide range of infrastructure deficiencies and expand the availability of broadband internet throughout the country.

About $110 billion would go to roads, bridges and other major surface transportation projects. Passenger rail gets $66 billion, public transit gets $39 billion, and safety programs for highways and pedestrian walkways get $11 billion. About $55 billion would go to expanding access to clean drinking water.

Congress didn’t choose which specific projects would be funded. Those decisions will be made later by government agencies.

There could be big winners in California. For instance, the California High-Speed Rail Authority is already eyeing pockets of money it can apply for to fund its rail project between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Authority spokeswoman Melissa Figueroa said the agency sees about $20 billion to $40 billion in the bill that it could be eligible to compete for and, pending finality of the legislation, plans to apply.

“The message that we’re getting out of the federal government is that they want to invest in clean, green electrified rail and high-speed rail, and that’s what we’re under construction on here in California,” she said. “That’s the direction we think they want to go, and that makes us very competitive.”

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg declined to predict which projects might be selected for funding.

In an interview, he called California’s project “a major high-speed rail vision. It’s well underway, and I imagine that there will be multiple opportunities to seek support that will be helped by the funding we are hopefully about to get.”

A handful of other provisions could have an outsize benefit to California in particular.

More than $3.3 billion would fund wildfire risk reduction, such as mechanical thinning and controlled burns. Billions more would pay for infrastructure projects that could mitigate the impact of wildfires and other natural disasters, such as rehabilitating burned lands, burying power lines and fireproofing homes. It would also boost the pay of federal wildland firefighters to bring them to parity with state firefighters.

The most sizable fund that will directly affect the state is the more than $8 billion for water initiatives in the West. That includes $1 billion for water recycling systems and more than $1 billion for water storage and groundwater storage projects to take advantage of wet years.

“It’s welcome money that’s going to bring benefits for years,” said Felicia Marcus, a fellow at Stanford University’s Water in the West Program and former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board. “The modern configuration of the Western United States is impossible without massive infrastructure improvement.”

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), whose office worked with that of Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) on several water provisions, says much of the funding will go to California projects.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees water management in the West, will ultimately decide what projects get funded. But there is a relatively small universe of water projects that will be eligible, and many of them are in California, giving the state a leg up.

Old dams, canals and other infrastructure will be upgraded with $3.2 billion over five years. Although that’s short of the $4.6 billion the bureau identified as needed over the next five years, it’s significantly more than its annual budget.

Congress is using the money to move the bureau to more forward-looking water policy, particularly on water recycling and employing nature-based solutions, such as using tools that mimic nature to conserve water.

“They had a lot of experience and history in building the hard traditional infrastructure [such as] dams and canals. So as we looked to the future, we were thinking about what does a 21st century water agency look like?” said an aide involved in the bill who was not authorized to be identified.

To that end, there is $100 million for natural infrastructure projects, such as using nature or tools that mimic nature to conserve water, and another $100 million to improve overall watershed health. The bureau will also have new funding for aquatic ecosystem restoration projects that are designed to improve wildlife habitat.

The new funding for groundwater storage comes amid a shift for the federal government, which provided no sizable amount of money for such efforts before 2016, according to water policy experts.

“Water recycling and desalination programs in particular will help California stretch supplies without diverting water from rivers and the delta or harming the environment,” Feinstein said. “Ecosystem restoration, water conservation and water-use-efficiency funds will help us more wisely use what water we do have.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, is taking his first solo trip abroad and will lead a delegation to the Paralympic Games in Tokyo this month.

President Biden made the announcement Tuesday.

Emhoff will lead a small delegation of himself and one other person to the Games that, like the Olympics, were delayed a year because of the coronavirus and also will be held as Tokyo sees a surge in infections fueled by the more contagious Delta variant of the virus.

He’ll attend the Aug. 24 opening ceremony with Raymond Greene, the U.S. official in charge of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo until an ambassador is sworn in.

About 4,400 athletes with physical disabilities from 160 countries will compete in more than 20 sporting events under strict public health measures, much like the Olympics, through Sept. 5.

Japan has tallied 1 million infections and more than 15,700 deaths from COVID-19, faring better than many countries, but the Delta variant has caused many of the newest cases and is quickening the spread of the virus.

Tokyo’s new daily cases more than doubled during the Olympic Games, which ended Sunday, with 2,884 cases recorded Monday.

Biden tapped his wife, First Lady Jill Biden, to attend the Olympics opening ceremony July 23. She also met with the Japanese prime minister and the emperor, and attended several Olympic competitions before returning to Washington.

Emhoff, a former entertainment lawyer, has traveled to more than 20 states since Biden and Harris took office in January. He mostly has toured COVID-19 clinics and encouraged people to get inoculated against the disease.

Why McConnell and the GOP are giving Biden a bipartisan win

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he is “100%” focused on stopping President Biden’s agenda — and yet he voted with every Senate Democrat on Sunday to set the stage for passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill that would be a major political win for the White House.

He wasn’t alone. Seventeen other Republicans opted to wrap up debate on the legislation — in the face of multiple missives from former President Trump urging them to block it.

At a moment of such intense partisanship, this momentary alignment of incentives for Democrats and Republicans, set to vote Tuesday to pass the approximately $1-trillion package out of the Senate, is the Washington equivalent of a total eclipse. However rare and fleeting, Republicans and Democrats believe they are serving their own self-interests, not just the president’s, in voting to pass a bipartisan bill to improve roads, bridges, rail lines, water pipes and broadband networks.

“Every incumbent benefits from the sense that the Congress can figure out how to get important things done,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).

Unsurprisingly, lawmakers don’t expect the conviviality to last long.

Upon passing the bipartisan plan, Democrats hope to soon approve the framework for a second bill, a sweeping Democratic proposal that includes massive subsidies and tax breaks for working families, free preschool and community college, a large expansion of Medicare and other tax cuts. Knowing no Republicans will support that measure, Democrats plan to utilize a process known as reconciliation, which requires just 50 votes for passage plus the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris.

Climate change reaching a dangerous level, U.N. report says

President Biden’s climate envoy John Kerry on Monday warned that climate change is transforming the planet and said a new United Nations report describing how temperatures will rise for decades, if not centuries, should be a call to action for world leaders gathering at the U.N. climate summit in Scotland this November.

“These extreme events will only become more drastic in the future — this is why we cannot wait,” he tweeted, urging other world leaders to make the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow this November. “This is why we cannot wait.”

Earth’s climate is getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade will probably blow past a level of warming that world leaders have sought to prevent, according to a report released Monday that the United Nations calls a “code red for humanity.”

“It’s just guaranteed that it’s going to get worse,” said report co-author Linda Mearns, a senior climate scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “I don’t see any area that is safe. ... Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.”

The 3,000-plus-page report from 234 scientists said warming is already accelerating sea-level rise, shrinking ice and worsening extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. Tropical cyclones are getting stronger and wetter, while Arctic sea ice is dwindling in the summer and permafrost is thawing. All of these trends will get worse, the report said.

Newsom wants voters to ignore the recall ballot’s second question

Advertisement

For Gov. Gavin Newsom, the only thing that matters in the recall election he faces is how California voters fill out the part of the ballot that can keep him in office. It isn’t part of his equation that they understand that they also have the right to select a potential replacement.

While some voters in Los Angeles County will begin receiving ballots this week, most counties will begin distribution a week from Monday. State and local elections officials say they have plans to communicate to voters that the two questions — whether Newsom should be removed and who should take his place in the event that happens — are distinct from one another and can both be answered. But Newsom’s campaign is largely pretending the second question doesn’t exist.

“I think it’s unfortunate that the Democratic Party is not giving voters any guidance on what to do on the second question,” said Kim Alexander, president of the nonpartisan California Voter Foundation. “It’s going to leave a lot of people confused.”

And should most voters cast ballots to expel Newsom, it could produce a new governor chosen by only a small fraction of the electorate.

Confusion over the recall’s rules is understandable. It’s been almost 18 years since California’s first statewide recall election, when most voters ousted then-Gov. Gray Davis and a sizable plurality chose Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger as his successor from a list of 135 contenders.

In 1973, novelist Truman Capote played Lord Nelson in a comedy sketch with Sonny and Cher.

Los Angeles Times columnist Cecil Smith reported in the Aug. 22, 1973, edition:

“Novelist Truman Capote has been in Hollywood playing (of all things) comedy sketches at CBS on the “Sonny & Cher Show.” ...

Capote was called onstage to play the British admiral doing battle with the French. In his most piping screech, he yelled: “Where’s the mizzen mast?” To which a sailor shrugged: “I don’t know. How long has it been mizzen?”

I was curious as to what motivates a writer of the stature of Capote, certainly one of the most important literary figures of the century, to play the fool for the glory of toilet bowl and armpits and other objects sacred to television.

“I’ve always liked Sonny and Cher,” said Capote over some dry Manhattans at the Hotel Bel-Air. “I’ve never done anything like this and I thought it might be fun. I suppose I did it because I was asked.”

Annie Korzen is a judicious dropper of the F-bomb on her TikTok channel, which in less than four months has claimed more than 223,000 followers and 2.2 million likes.

The 82-year-old professional storyteller and television actress favors colorful language as much as colorful clothing, accessories, artwork, furniture and friends. Her personal flair and contrarian bent help explain her popularity, but her secret weapon, she says, is her 30-year-old bestie, Mackenzie Morrison, who serves as the producer, editor and music supervisor for her pithy videos.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A U.S. peace envoy brought a warning to the Taliban on Tuesday that any government that comes to power through force in Afghanistan won’t be recognized internationally, after a series of cities fell to the insurgent group in stunningly quick succession.

Zalmay Khalilzad traveled to Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban maintains a political office, to tell the group that there was no point in pursuing victory on the battlefield because a military takeover of Kabul would guarantee they would be global pariahs. He and others hope to persuade Taliban leaders to return to peace talks with the Afghan government as American and NATO forces finish their pullout from the country.

The insurgents have captured as many as six out of 34 provincial capitals in the country in less than a week, including Kunduz in Kunduz province — one of the country’s largest cities. On Sunday, they planted their flag in the main square, but government forces still controlled the strategic airport and an army base on the city’s outskirts.

They are now battling the Western-backed government for control of several others. Late on Tuesday, Taliban forces entered Farah and were seen in front to the provincial governor’s office.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed tweeted the insurgents had taken the city, which is the capital of a province with the same name. But Abdul Naser Farahi — a lawmaker from the area who is in Kabul — said the government still retained control of the intelligence department and a military base.

After a 20-year Western military mission and billions of dollars spent training and shoring up Afghan forces, many officials and observers are at a loss to explain why the government forces have collapsed, fleeing the battle sometimes by the hundreds. The fighting has fallen largely to small groups of elite forces and the Afghan air force.

The success of the Taliban blitz has added urgency to the need to restart the long-stalled talks that could end the fighting and move Afghanistan toward an inclusive interim administration. The insurgents have so far refused to return to the negotiating table.

Khalilzad’s mission in Qatar is to “help formulate a joint international response to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,” according to the U.S. State Department.

He plans to “press the Taliban to stop their military offensive and to negotiate a political settlement, which is the only path to stability and development in Afghanistan,” the State Department said.

Meanwhile, the Taliban military chief released an audio message to his fighters Tuesday ordering them not to harm Afghan forces and government officials in the territories they conquer. The recording was shared on Twitter by the Taliban spokesman in Doha, Mohammad Naim.

In the nearly five-minute audio, Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, also told the insurgents to stay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who have fled, to leave marketplaces open and to protect places of business, including banks.

It was not immediately clear if Taliban fighters on the ground would heed Yaqoob’s instructions. There have been reports by civilians who have fled Taliban advances of heavy-handed treatment by the insurgents — schools being burned down and repressive restrictions imposed on women. The office of the United Nations human rights chief said it has received reports of summary executions and military use and destruction of homes, schools and clinics in captured areas.

There have also been reports of revenge killings in areas where the Taliban has gained control. The insurgents claimed responsibility for killing a comedian in southern Kandahar, assassinating the government’s media chief in Kabul and a bombing that targeted acting Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, an attack that killed eight people. The minister was not harmed in the attack.

The intensifying war has driven thousands of people to Kabul, and many are living in parks without adequate access to water and other necessities in the summer heat. The fighting has also increased the number of civilian casualties.

The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said Tuesday that her office had counted at least 183 deaths and hundreds of injuries among civilians in a handful of cities in recent weeks. She cautioned that “the real figures will be much higher.”

Advertisement

The International Committee of the Red Cross said that its staff had treated more than 4,000 Afghans this month in its 15 facilities across the country, including in Helmand and Kandahar, where Afghan and U.S. airstrikes are trying to blunt the Taliban onslaught.

“We are seeing homes destroyed, medical staff and patients put at tremendous risk, and hospitals, electricity and water infrastructure damaged,” Eloi Fillion, ICRC’s head of delegation in Afghanistan, said in a statement.

“The use of explosive weaponry in cities is having an indiscriminate impact on the population,” Fillion added. “Many families have no option but to flee in search of a safer place. This must stop.”

The lightning speed at which the Taliban has made battlefield gains has lent urgency to the need to restart talks. The surge began in April, when the U.S. and NATO announced that they would end their military presence and bring the last of their troops home. The final date of the withdrawal is Aug. 31, but the U.S. Central Command has said the pullout is already 95% complete.

On Monday, the U.S. emphasized that the Biden administration now sees the fight as one for Afghan political and military leaders to win or lose.

“When we look back, it’s going to come down to leadership and what leadership was demonstrated, or not” by Afghans, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a Pentagon news conference. “It’s their country to defend now. It’s their struggle.”

Khalilzad, the architect of the peace deal the Trump administration brokered with the Taliban, was expected to hold talks with key players as well as with “multilateral organizations” to see how to restart talks and halt the Taliban onslaught.

The U.S. envoy will also probably seek a commitment from Afghanistan’s neighbors and the region not to recognize a Taliban government that comes to power by force. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, only three countries recognized its rule: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Senior Afghan officials may travel to Doha in the coming days, including Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the government’s reconciliation council. Pakistan’s national security advisor, Moeed Yusuf, called Monday for “reinvigorated” efforts to get all sides in the conflict back to talks, describing a protracted war in Afghanistan as a “nightmare scenario” for Pakistan.

Yusuf, speaking to foreign journalists in Islamabad, refused to say categorically whether Pakistan, which holds considerable sway over the Taliban, would recognize a Taliban government installed by force, saying instead that Pakistan wants to see an “inclusive” government in Kabul.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dozens of women have described shocking sexual assaults by Ethiopian soldiers and allied forces in the country’s Tigray conflict, says an Amnesty International report published Wednesday, and its researcher calls it striking how the perpetrators appeared to act without fear of punishment from their commanders.

“All of these forces from the very beginning, everywhere, and for a long period of time felt it was perfectly OK with them to perpetrate these crimes because they clearly felt they could do so with impunity, nothing holding them back,” senior researcher Donatella Rovera told the Associated Press.

She would not speculate on whether any leader gave the signal to rape, which the report says was intended to humiliate the women and their Tigrayan ethnic group. In her years of work investigating atrocities around the world, these are some of the worst, Rovera said.

More than 1,200 cases of sexual violence were documented by health centers in Tigray between February and April alone, Amnesty said. No one knows the real toll during the nine-month conflict, as most of the health facilities across the region of 6 million people were vandalized or destroyed.

Advertisement

These numbers are probably a “small fraction” of the reality, Amnesty said. It interviewed 63 women, along with health workers.

A dozen women described being held for days or weeks while being raped multiple times, usually by several men. And 12 other women said they were raped in front of family members. Five women said they were pregnant at the time they were assaulted. Two said they had nails, gravel and shrapnel shoved into their vaginas.

“I don’t know if they realized I was a person,” one woman told Amnesty, describing how she was attacked in her home by three men. She was four months pregnant at the time.

The AP separately has spoken with women who described being gang-raped by combatants allied with the Ethiopian military, notably soldiers from neighboring Eritrea but also fighters with the neighboring Amhara region.

Amnesty has not received allegations against Tigray forces, who regained control of much of the Tigray region in late June and have since crossed into the Amhara and Afar regions in what they call an attempt to break the blockade on their land and pressure Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to step down.

While Ethiopian and allied forces retreated from much of Tigray in June, some remain in western Tigray, and Ethiopia’s government on Tuesday essentially abandoned its unilateral cease-fire as Abiy called all able citizens to fight.

The Amnesty report calls for accountability for the sexual violence during the conflict, noting that rape and sexual slavery constitute war crimes. Many women in Tigray now live with the physical and mental effects of the assaults including HIV infections and continued bleeding, it said.

Advertisement

In a statement responding to the Amnesty report, Ethiopia’s government said it had previously acknowledged that “some members of the armed forces have engaged in conduct that is contrary to the clear rules of engagement and direction they have been given.”

Ethiopia’s statement also accused the human rights group of “sensationalized attacks and smear campaigns” against the government, while Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel in a tweet accused Amnesty of having a “hostile agenda” against his country, which borders the Tigray region to the north.

Earlier this year, Ethiopia’s government said three soldiers had been convicted and 25 others indicted for rape and other acts of sexual violence. But Amnesty said no information has been made available about those trials or other measures to bring perpetrators to justice.

A spokesman for the attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for an update Wednesday on any investigations.

Ethiopia’s government has not allowed human rights researchers into the Tigray region, though a joint investigation into alleged atrocities is underway by the United Nations human rights office and the government-created Ethiopian Human Rights Commission.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Suddenly propelled to lead New York, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul vowed Wednesday to set a better tone in state government after the sexual harassment scandal that spurred Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation.

“Nobody will ever describe my administration as a toxic work environment,” Hochul said in her first news briefing after Cuomo announced his resignation.

She said there would be no place in her administration for any Cuomo aides who were implicated in unethical behavior by the state attorney general’s investigation of his behavior toward women.

Hochul, a 62-year-old Democrat from western New York, is set to become the state’s first female governor in two weeks, following a remarkable transition period in which Cuomo has said he will work to ease her into a job that he dominated during his three terms in office.

Advertisement

Hochul has had a political career spanning from a town board to Congress, and as lieutenant governor she has spent much of her time crisscrossing the state for ribbon-cuttings, announcements and other events. Still, she is unfamiliar to many New Yorkers, and she took the opportunity Wednesday to reintroduce herself and assure them: “I’m ready for this.”

“I’m more prepared than anyone could possibly be for this position,” Hochul said.

While championing such Cuomo-era accomplishments as laws raising the minimum wage and requiring paid family leave for millions of private-sector workers, Hochul strove to put distance between herself and the outgoing governor. She said she didn’t spend much time with him and hadn’t been aware of any of the alleged improprieties described in state Atty. Gen. Letitia James’ report.

Cuomo announced Tuesday that he would step down rather than face a likely impeachment trial in the state Assembly after James, a fellow Democrat, released a report concluding he sexually harassed 11 women. One woman accused him of groping her breast.

Cuomo, 63, denies that he touched anyone inappropriately and said his instinct was to fight back against claims he believes are unfair or fabricated. But he said that with the state still in a pandemic crisis, it was best for him to step aside so the state’s leaders could “get back to governing.”

Hochul purposely kept a modest profile as lieutenant governor in a state where Cuomo commanded — and demanded — the spotlight.

Hochul shares some of Cuomo’s centrist politics but is a stylistic contrast with a governor known for steamrolling opponents and holding grudges. She’s well-liked by colleagues, who say voters shouldn’t confuse her quiet approach under Cuomo with a lack of confidence or competence.

“People will soon learn that my style is to listen first, then take decisive action,” she said.

Advertisement

Before sharing a ticket with Cuomo, she was a county clerk who opposed the idea of allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver’s licenses — an idea that would become law during Cuomo’s administration. Asked Wednesday about what is known as the Green Light Law, Hochul said her position “has now evolved, and that evolution coincides with the evolution of many people” in New York.

“I’m proud of supporting that law,” she said.

It remains to be seen how involved Cuomo will be in state government over the next two weeks, or how he’ll manage handing over authority — something he has rarely ceded during his time in office.

His circle of advisors has shrunk, but his closest aide and policymaking partner, Melissa DeRosa — a familiar face at Cuomo’s side during his televised coronavirus briefings — will remain until his departure, after having announced her resignation from the administration Sunday.

Advertisement

For days after James’ report came out last week, Cuomo insisted to those close to him that he could weather the storm, but even his closest outside advisors told him it would be impossible.

Cuomo was privately frustrated that few people were willing to defend him publicly and pressed his attorney and remaining advisors to question his accusers’ credibility, according to a person with direct knowledge of the governor’s final days in office. The person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the private, sensitive conversations.

Cuomo decided he would resign after DeRosa quit, the person said.

By late Monday night, Cuomo told a small number of his closest advisors that he was planning to resign, the person said. But Cuomo had kept the announcement very close, opting not even to tell other senior Democrats in New York.

Leaders in the state Legislature have yet to say whether they plan on dropping an impeachment investigation that has been ongoing since March, and which had been expected to conclude in the coming weeks.

In addition to examining his conduct with women, lawyers hired by the state Assembly had been investigating whether the administration manipulated data on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and whether Cuomo improperly got help from his staff writing a book about the pandemic.

Republicans have urged the Democratic-controlled Legislature to go ahead with impeachment, possibly to prevent Cuomo from running for office again.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@U.S. drug regulators are set to clear a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines for people with weak immune systems as a new study showed the benefits of an extra shot in transplant patients.

A third dose of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine significantly raised antibody levels against the coronavirus in transplant patients, according a comparison of an extra shot to a placebo in people with weak immune systems. The Food and Drug Administration is set to amend clearances as soon as Thursday for vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer Inc. to allow extra doses for people with compromised immune systems, according a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Transplant patients and others with weak immune systems often don’t get adequate responses to their first vaccine course and are at the top of the list for getting potential COVID-19 boosters. An advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to discuss booster shots for immune-compromised people Friday.

The FDA is closely monitoring data on studies of additional doses in immunocompromised people, according to an email from the agency that said it would share more information in the near future.

The new study of 120 transplant patients looked at the effects of a third dose that was given two months after the second. A month after the third shot, 55% of those who got it developed antibody levels likely to provide significant protection.

Among patients who got a placebo shot, rather than the third dose, just 18% showed the desired antibody levels, researchers at University Health Network in Toronto found. The findings from the Ajmera Transplant Centre at the network in Toronto were released Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“I am pretty excited about the results,” said Atul Humar, a study author and chief of transplant medicine at Toronto General Hospital, one of several University of Toronto-affiliated hospitals in the network. “It is a slam dunk.”

The results have been shared with Canadian regulars and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he said. Moderna had no role in the study.

The Toronto researchers began the study after noticing that transplant patients who had gotten two vaccine doses still kept getting sick with COVID-19, according to Humar. They picked the Moderna vaccine for the three-dose study because it uses a higher quantity of messenger RNA than a similar mRNA shot from Pfizer and BioNTech.

Counts of protective T-cells, another key immune fighter, were also higher in patients who got the the real third dose rather than a placebo. The extra shot wasn’t associated with any cases of organ rejection, and typical side effects from COVID-19 shots were only slightly more common after the third dose versus placebo. The study was too small to assess whether the third shot prevented people from becoming ill with COVID-19.

“At this juncture, the benefit of third-dose vaccination, at least with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, appears to outweigh the risks,” two editors of the New England Journal concluded in an editorial accompanying the study.

Bone marrow transplant patients and cancer patients on chemotherapy are also considered to have highly suppressed immune systems, Humar said.

NBC News reported the news of the FDA’s plan to clear the shots earlier Wednesday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Belarus on Wednesday rescinded its permission for the U.S. ambassador’s appointment and told the U.S. to cut its embassy staff in retaliation for Washington’s sanctions.

President Biden’s administration slapped Belarus with new sanctions Monday, the anniversary of last year’s election in Belarus that was denounced by the opposition as rigged. Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko responded to protests against his reelection to a sixth term with a sweeping crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police.

The new U.S. sanctions target Belarus’ giant potash producer that has been a top revenue earner for the country, the Belarusian National Olympic Committee and 15 private companies with ties to Belarusian authorities.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Anatoly Glaz on Wednesday denounced the U.S. action as “blatant and openly hostile” and announced the decision to rescind an earlier agreement for the appointment of Julie Fisher as the U.S. ambassador to the country.

He said Belarus also told the U.S. to cut its embassy staff in Minsk to five diplomats until Sept. 1.

“In view of Washington’s actions to halt cooperation in all spheres and strangle our country economically, we see no reason in the presence of a significant number of diplomats at the U.S. diplomatic mission,” Glaz said in a statement.

While Belarus agreed to Fisher’s appointment in December as the first U.S. ambassador to Belarus since 2008, it never issued her an entry visa. Fisher has remained in neighboring Lithuania where she maintains contacts with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger in the Aug. 9, 2020, election who was forced to leave Belarus under pressure from authorities.

Commenting on Belarus’ moves, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said that “Belarussian authorities are responsible for the deterioration in U.S.-Belarus relations through relentless repression against their citizens,” noting they have targeted civic groups, media, athletes, students, legal professions and others.

“The United States government, Ambassador Fisher, personnel at our embassy in Minsk will continue to support the democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus,” Price said. “U.S. diplomats will continue to engage with Belarusians, including leaders of the pro-democracy movement, media professionals, students and other elements of civil society wherever they are.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Defiance of Gov. Greg Abbott’s ban on mask mandates continued Wednesday as more Texas school districts and communities announced plans to require students to wear face coverings and another county scored a legal victory in its effort to issue such a mandate amid a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations throughout the state.

In the Houston suburb of Spring, the school district’s 33,000 students, along with faculty, staff and visitors, will be required to wear masks starting Monday.

The Spring Independent School District joins those in Austin, Dallas, San Antonio and Fort Worth in requiring students and staff to wear masks on campuses and other district buildings. The mandates go against an executive order Abbott repeated last month banning mask mandates by any state, county or local government entity.

“I don’t want to focus so much on defying the governor. We are ensuring that our kids our safe. We’re ensuring that our teachers are safe and we’re ensuring that the learning needs for each student are met,” Spring district Supt. Rodney Watson told reporters Wednesday.

Late Wednesday, officials in Fort Bend County, just southwest of Houston, announced they had filed a lawsuit seeking to override Abbott’s ban on mask mandates and had also reinstated an order requiring that masks be worn inside all public school buildings and county facilities. A judge later Wednesday granted the county a temporary restraining order against Abbott’s ban on mask mandates.

Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said in a statement that violating the governor’s executive order “and violating parental rights — is not the way to do it.”

World & Nation Texas seeks out-of-state medical help amid COVID-19 crisis Gov. Greg Abbott directs agencies to find additional medical staff and he requests that hospitals postpone elective procedures as the Delta variant overwhelms hospitals statewide. But his ban on mask mandates remains in place.

The dispute over mask mandates in Texas comes as COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to rise, increasing to 10,463 statewide on Wednesday, the most since Feb. 3. In the last two weeks, hospitalizations have increased by 85%. State health officials reported 112 deaths on Wednesday, the first time the total surpassed 100 since March 10. Hospitals around the state are overrun with COVID-19 patients, and many don’t have enough ICU beds or nurses and other personnel to adequately staff intensive care units.

“If this continues, and I have no reason to believe that it will not, there is no way my hospital is going to be able to handle this. There is no way the region is going to be able to handle this. I don’t want to be an alarmist. ... But I am frightened by what is coming,” Esmaeil Porsa, president and CEO of Harris Health System, which runs the Houston area’s public hospitals, told lawmakers Tuesday during a meeting of the Texas Senate Health and Human Services Committee.

Abbott on Wednesday announced the state has arranged for the deployment of more than 2,500 medical personnel to help hospitals care for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients across Texas.

Outside the Houston school district’s headquarters on Wednesday, a group of teachers unions along with parents and students asked area districts to defy Abbott’s order and issue their own mask mandates.

“A mask mandate is not a risk to anyone. Not requiring masks puts children and their families at risk,” said Aly Fitzpatrick, whose twin sons are set to start second grade at Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District, northwest of Houston.

The superintendent of Houston’s school district, the state’s largest, planned to ask his school board to approve a mask mandate during a Thursday meeting.

On Wednesday, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins signed an executive order requiring that masks be worn inside schools, county buildings and businesses. This was issued after a state district judge on Tuesday granted a temporary restraining order against Abbott’s executive order, allowing Jenkins to issue the mask mandate

The legal ruling from Dallas County follows one from earlier Tuesday when another judge issued a different temporary restraining order, allowing officials in San Antonio and surrounding Bexar County to mandate masks in public schools.

Late Wednesday afternoon, Abbott and Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton announced the state had filed a petition with the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to strike down Dallas County’s mask mandate.

“The path forward relies on personal responsibility — not government mandates. The state of Texas will continue to vigorously fight the temporary restraining order to protect the rights and freedoms of all Texans,” Abbott said.

Paxton’s office on Wednesday issued an opinion suggesting the federal government might have lacked the authority to issue its order requiring people to wear masks on all forms of public transportation.

Earlier Wednesday, Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston became the latest hospital system in the country to require its employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In April, Houston Methodist became the first major U.S. healthcare system to require vaccinations for its employees. A group of employees sued Houston Methodist over the vaccine mandate, but a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tropical Storm Fred made landfall in the Dominican Republic on Wednesday, with forecasters warning that heavy rains could cause dangerous flooding and mudslides there and in neighboring Haiti.

After a quiet month of no named storms in the region, Fred became the sixth of the Atlantic hurricane season late Tuesday as it moved past the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on a forecast track that would carry it toward Florida over the weekend.

Government crews with megaphones walked through impoverished neighborhoods in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo ahead of the storm urging those in low-lying areas to evacuate. Hours later, the government reported flooding in one courthouse.

Tropical storm warnings were discontinued in the U.S. territories after pelting the islands with rain, leaving some 13,000 customers without power in Puerto Rico.

Fred was centered 75 miles west-northwest of Santo Domingo on Wednesday morning and moving west-northwest at 16 mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.

The Dominican Republic, Haiti and central and eastern Cuba could get hit Wednesday, and people in Florida were urged to monitor updates. Forecasters said the center of Fred was expected to move near the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday, and move north of the northern coast of central Cuba on Friday.

Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi closed government agencies at noon Tuesday, and officials noted that some gas stations had shut down after running out of fuel.

More than a month had passed since the last Atlantic storm, Hurricane Elsa, but this time of summer usually marks the start of the peak of hurricane season.

The hurricane center issued warnings for the Dominican Republic on the south coast from Punta Palenque eastward and on the north coast from the Dominican Republic/Haiti border eastward. A watch was in effect for Haiti from the northern border with the Dominican Republic to Gonaives and for the Cuban provinces of Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, Las Tunas, Holguin, Granma, Santiago and Guantanamo. Also included in the watch were the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas.

The storm was expected to produce rainfall of 2 to 4 inches over Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic with up to 6 inches in some areas.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As U.S. and NATO troops withdraw from war-torn Afghanistan, the Taliban is advancing and claiming more territory.

The radical Islamist group controlled about two-thirds of the country as of Wednesday — including a number of provincial capitals seized in recent days — and it appeared that at some point its fighters would go for control of the national capital, Kabul.

Many Afghans who worked for or alongside the U.S. government during 20 years of war face the danger of reprisal attacks in the nation of more than 39 million people. And the urgency for finding safety is increasingly evident as the U.S. plans for the troop withdrawal to be complete by the end of August, sooner than the former deadline of Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States.

“Millions of Afghans are living in terror to see what comes next,” Shaharzad Akbar, the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, said in a recent U.N. Security Council meeting.

The State Department announced last week that the U.S. was expanding its refugee program to include Afghans who worked for U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations, aid programs and media outlets during the war. Members of Congress, human rights groups and news organizations had pressed for the protection of tens of thousands of Afghans, though Biden administration officials could not estimate how many would qualify for refugee visas.

Ordinary Afghans with no connection to the U.S. military or American-based media or aid organizations have small prospects of making it out of the country.

Here are some things to know about the new Afghan refugee visa program, Afghan refugees in general and the Taliban.

Why was the refugee visas program expanded for Afghans and how is it different now?

Before the U.S. expansion of the refugee program, many Afghans seeking to flee to the United States had a couple of possible options. Some could apply for refugee status as an individual and show proof of a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. And some could apply for the special immigrant visa program for Afghans who worked for the U.S. government or assisted the military, commonly as interpreters or translators, for at least two years.

But many Afghans who helped U.S. organizations and whose lives were at risk did not qualify for the existing special immigrant visa program, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said recently.

In response, the State Department created a path for Afghans who assisted U.S.-based organizations during the war but didn’t work directly under the government or military for at least two years. Under the new program, Afghans who worked for U.S. nongovernmental organizations, aid programs and media are among those eligible for this refugee status, designated as “special groups of concern.”

But even the new program does not mean it’ll be easy for Afghans to reach the United States. It requires those who are eligible to get out of Afghanistan before their cases are processed, a condition that may be impossible for many.

Also, under the new program, a U.S. employer must contact the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to refer an Afghan to the program. Usually, individuals apply for refugee status by contacting the U.N. refugee agency themselves.

What’s likely to happen to refugees as they make their way through the process?

Refugees often spend years, or even decades, in refugee camps, the largest of which are located in Africa and Southeast Asia, while waiting for their cases to proceed. And while special immigrant visas are supposed to be processed within nine months, the average processing time is almost two years, according to the think tank Migration Policy Institute.

Under the new program, it would take 12 to 14 months for refugees to be processed and arrive in the U.S., a senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in keeping with government protocols, said in a recent press briefing.

It calls for eligible people to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible for safety reasons and other factors and to go to a third country before processing of their applications begins. This can be difficult as obtaining visas to surrounding countries can be challenging.

European consulates in Afghanistan have been closed for years. Those who leave through neighboring Iran take the risk of being deported or shot by border guards, then would have to venture through the Zagros Mountains to reach the eastern border of Turkey, from which they would also risk being sent back. Dozens of bodies of Afghans who didn’t survive the journey are found in the mountains every year.

Despite the hurdles, many Afghans still try to leave the country. Some hire smugglers to attempt the daunting journey. An estimated 270,000 Afghans have been displaced since January, the U.N. reported. It’s unclear how many have fled the country — the departures of those who escape with smugglers are not well documented, Bill Frelick, director of the refugee and migrant rights division at the nonprofit Human Rights Watch, said in a phone interview.

Blinken said in a recent briefing that the government “will do everything we can to help them, including making these different avenues of arrival to the United States for this group of people possible.” He also said the U.S. would dedicate humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and neighboring countries.

Here’s a little more background on the Taliban and the U.S. withdrawal.

The Taliban grew from resistance to a Soviet invasion in the early 1990s and eventually overthrew the government, taking control of most of the country. The group controlled Afghanistan until 2001, when the United States invaded after the country provided sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.

The Taliban and their affiliate groups have launched more than 5,500 attacks in 31 of the country’s 34 provinces since mid-April, and more than 400 Afghans have been slain in targeted killings this year, the U.N. said.

President Biden announced formal plans to withdraw U.S. troops, approximately 3,000 service members, from Afghanistan almost four months ago.

The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan documented 1,659 civilian deaths and 3,254 injuries during the first six months of 2021, a 47% increase in civilian deaths and injuries compared to the same period in 2020.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has pointed to the U.S. withdrawal for the country’s worsening violence, but the U.S. has pushed back.

“Well, there’s one party that is in most cases responsible for the outrageous and atrocious acts of violence that have been perpetrated against the Afghan people,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price, “and that’s the Taliban.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gov. Kate Brown has announced a statewide indoor mask requirement in Oregon as COVID-19 hospitalizations and cases reach record high numbers in the state and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.

Beginning Friday, everyone 5 years or older in Oregon — regardless of vaccination status — will be required to wear masks in indoor public spaces. Brown had urged local officials to implement their own mandates, but almost none did.

The newest coronavirus health and safety measure in Oregon applies to all indoor public spaces, including businesses, grocery stores, indoor entertainment venues and gyms. In addition, people older than 2 years old will be required to wear masks on public transit.

There are some mask exemptions for activities, including eating, drinking, swimming and organized sports.

The mask mandate, announced Tuesday, comes as the state on Wednesday set a second consecutive record of hospitalized COVID-19 patients — 665 people. The previous record of 622 people hospitalized was set during November’s surge, when vaccines were not yet available.

Intensive care unit beds across the state are about 90% full, and some hospital regions have fewer than five ICU beds available, Brown said.

“Oregon is facing a spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations — consisting overwhelmingly of unvaccinated individuals — that is quickly exceeding the darkest days of our winter surge,” Brown said. “When our hospitals are full, there will be no room for additional patients needing care — whether for COVID-19, a heart attack or stroke, a car collision or a variety of other emergency situations.”

The Pacific Northwest state is not alone. In Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana, COVID-19 is clobbering health systems with more people hospitalized with the virus than at any other point in the pandemic — straining and overwhelming the already limited staff.

Health officials in Oregon warned that, without new health and safety interventions in place, coronavirus hospitalizations would far exceed Oregon’s health system capacity in the next several weeks.

Brown described the latest projections as a stark reminder that “the pandemic is far from over” and a “disappointing reminder that we still have dark days ahead.”

“The latest science is clear that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are able to spread the Delta variant,” she said. “Masks are simple, and they are effective.”

Oregon is the third state — joining Hawaii and Louisiana — to require vaccinated and unvaccinated people to wear masks inside public spaces statewide. The mandates emerge amid a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., driven by the highly contagious Delta variant.

Some states are going beyond mask measures, requiring healthcare workers and state employees to be vaccinated. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that California would become the first state in the nation to require all teachers and school staff to get vaccinated or undergo weekly coronavirus testing.

Meanwhile, local officials in several Republican-led states that have banned mask mandates — including Arizona, Texas and Florida — are now defying their state’s prohibitions as school districts require masks ahead of students returning to school.

Throughout the pandemic, health officials have described Oregon as a success story as it has had some of the lowest coronavirus case and death rates nationally — in part because of the state’s strict restrictions, which were lifted at the end of June.

As the Delta variant began rapidly spreading across the state last month, Brown turned to county officials — giving them local control on whether or not to implement mask mandates.

“From the beginning of this pandemic, city and county leaders have asked me for local control and the ability to make local public health decisions when it comes to COVID-19,” Brown said.

Earlier this month, the governor announced that masks would be required in K-12 schools and in any indoor state agency building. In addition, the state health authority made a statewide recommendation that Oregonians, vaccinated or not, wear masks while in indoor public spaces, but again stopped short of reinstating an indoor mask mandate.

As coronavirus cases escalated, there continued to be inaction by nearly all of the state’s counties. A few counties issued mask mandates for county agency buildings. But only one county — Multnomah — announced a mask requirement for all public indoor spaces.

The Associated Press reached out to each of Oregon’s 36 counties this month to ask about plans to implement mask mandates. Out of the 16 counties that responded, nearly all indicated that they were concerned about the rise in coronavirus cases, but only one had issued an indoor mask mandate and most gave a resounding “no” when asked if they had plans to issue one.

“At this point, those who are most likely to adhere to a mask mandate are already vaccinated, so I’m not convinced new mandates will be all that effective in containing the Delta variant,” Gilliam County Judge Elizabeth Farrar Campbell said.

While county officials said they believed the decision to implement mask requirements should be a local decision, some health officials urged the governor to issue a statewide mandate as hospitals became overwhelmed with an influx of COVID-19 patients.

“OHSU believes the entire state should be masking,” Renee Edwards, the chief medical officer at Oregon Health & Science University, said Monday. “I recognize this is being decided at a local level, but every community’s actions will lead to consequences at a state and even a global level.”

In a final call to action, Brown met with county leaders and elected officials last week and urged them to institute mask requirements. The reimplementation of the mask mandate is occurring 44 days after the state lifted restrictions.

“The latest science is clear: Although unvaccinated individuals are more likely to contract the disease, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can spread the Delta variant,” Brown said. “Masks are a simple and effective way to make sure you are not unknowingly infecting your friends, family members, neighbors and colleagues.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday urged all pregnant women to get the COVID-19 vaccine as hospitals in hot spots around the U.S. saw disturbing numbers of unvaccinated mothers-to-be seriously ill with the virus.

Expectant women run a higher risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications from the coronavirus, including perhaps miscarriages and stillbirths. But their vaccination rates are low, with only about 23% having received at least one dose, according to CDC data.

“The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from COVID-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.

The updated guidance came after a CDC analysis of new safety data on 2,500 women showed no increased risks of miscarriage for those who received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The analysis found a miscarriage rate of around 13%, within the normal range.

The CDC’s advice echoes recent recommendations from top obstetrician groups. The agency had previously encouraged pregnant women to consider vaccination but had stopped short of a full recommendation. The new advice also applies to nursing mothers and women planning to get pregnant.

Although pregnant women were not included in studies that led to authorization of COVID-19 vaccines, experts say real-world experience in tens of thousands of women shows that the shots are safe for them and that when given during pregnancy may offer some protection to newborns.

The new guidance comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., driven by the highly contagious Delta variant.

Some health authorities believe the variant may cause more severe disease — in pregnant women and others as well — than earlier versions of the virus, though that is still under investigation.

National figures show the latest surge in cases among pregnant women is lower than it was during the outbreak’s winter peak. But at some hospitals in states with low vaccination rates, the numbers of sick mothers-to-be outpace those during earlier surges, before vaccines were available.

“This is by far the worst we’ve seen in the pandemic,” said Dr. Jane Martin, an obstetrician with Ochsner Baptist Medical Center in New Orleans. She added: “It’s disheartening and it’s exhausting. It feels like it doesn’t have to be like this.”

At the beginning of the pandemic and with each surge, Ochsner had a few pregnant patients very sick with the virus, though the numbers had dwindled in recent months.

“A week or two ago, that pace changed drastically,” Martin said. “We have had multiple critically ill pregnant patients admitted” every day, most requiring intensive care.

Martin said she had taken care of at least 30 pregnant patients hospitalized with COVID-19 over the last two weeks. Most were unvaccinated.

Experts say the lifting of mask rules and other social distancing precautions and the rise of the Delta variant have contributed to the worrisome trend. But, also, vaccinations weren’t made available to women of childbearing age and others younger than 65 until spring.

Early in her pregnancy, Tennessee kindergarten teacher Sara Brown decided she would wait until the baby was born to get the shots. There wasn’t much safety data yet about getting vaccinated during pregnancy, and at 36, she was young, healthy and “figured if I did get it, it would probably just be a bad cold.”

But what seemed like a sinus infection in June turned into severe COVID-19, landing her in a Nashville intensive care unit for five days, on oxygen and struggling to breathe.

Her daughter Suzie was born healthy on Aug. 2. But it was a harrowing experience.

“Not being able to catch your breath is such a panicky feeling,” she said, “knowing I had life inside me that could be suffering too.”

At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where Brown was treated, there were no infected pregnant patients early in July. Now the hospital is admitting four to five a week, all unvaccinated, said obstetrician Dr. Jennifer Thompson. About 20% of those patients are being treated in the intensive care unit, compared with 11% during previous surges, she said.

For some pregnant patients critically ill with COVID-19, organs begin to fail and doctors induce labor early or deliver babies by cesarean section as a last resort, said Dr. Jeannie Kelly, an obstetrician at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis.

About 20% of all patients admitted for labor and delivery last week at the St. Louis hospital were infected, more than double the rate during the COVID-19 surge in Missouri last year, she said. About one-third of those women were critically ill.

Around 105,000 pregnant U.S. women have been infected with COVID-19, and almost 18,000 have been hospitalized, according to the CDC. About one-fourth of those received intensive care, and 124 died.

Pregnancy-related changes in bodily functions may explain why the virus can be dangerous for mothers-to-be. These include reduced lung capacity and adjustments in the disease-fighting immune system that protect and help the fetus grow.

The risks are disproportionately high for Black and Latino women, who are more likely to face healthcare and economic inequalities that increase their chances of getting sick.

Some studies suggest the virus also may increase the risks of preterm birth and stillbirth, and in rare cases, it appears to have passed from mother to fetus.

Martin, the New Orleans obstetrician, noted that local hospitals were also treating increasing numbers of children and babies sick with COVID-19, some of whom may have been infected after birth by unvaccinated mothers.

Martin was pregnant when she got her own shots last winter. She delivered a healthy baby girl a week after the last shot.

“Vaccinating people is the only way out,” she said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s been a punishing few days for Afghanistan’s U.S.-created and supported army.

Since Friday, the Taliban has overrun bastions of government control, snatching more than a quarter of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals on its way to controlling an estimated 65% of the country. On Wednesday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani raced to the north to rally a defense of besieged Mazar-i-Sharif, the country’s fourth-largest city.

With U.S. forces set to complete their pullout in less than three weeks, the Taliban’s breakneck advance has many observers asking: After two decades and billions of dollars spent by the U.S. and its partners to create effective Afghan fighting forces, what happened? And can they stop the Taliban from taking over the entire country?

Here’s a look at the situation.

‘Ghost’ fighters

On paper, the Taliban should be no match for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, known as the ANDSF. According to the latest report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, a U.S. government watchdog, the ANDSF comprises 300,699 security personnel, including army, police and air force members. Around one-fifth of them are highly trained special forces operatives, then there are undisclosed figures for CIA-trained paramilitary groups as well as militias associated with the country’s warlords.

The Taliban, the SIGAR report estimates, has around 75,000 fighters.

But those figures should be treated with skepticism. Corruption, which pervades the Afghan security forces just as much as it does the government, means there are “ghost” soldiers and police — personnel who either never show up or never existed but are on the books so that officials can pocket their salaries.

It’s difficult to gauge the scale of the problem, but in 2019, a new payroll system purged more than 10% from the rolls. A year later, another SIGAR report found a gap of 58,478 personnel between recorded and actual strength levels.

The problem is worse among the Afghan police, especially in the country’s south. SIGAR reported in 2020 that, in the southern provinces — areas with pro-Taliban sentiment — 50% to 70% of police positions were for personnel who didn’t exist. (That report also found that half of them use drugs.)

“For a long time, people in the U.S. and the NATO advisory mission have known that the Afghan police are notoriously corrupt ,” said Andrew Watkins, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group. He added that although the new payroll system had gone some way toward improving the situation, commanders were now skimming off their subordinates’ salaries.

“Whatever solution there has been for corruption, corruption has found a way,” he said.

Uneven abilities

When asked last month whether he trusted the Taliban, President Biden brushed off the question, saying instead that he trusted “the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better-trained, better-equipped and … more competent in terms of conducting war.”

But only a portion of the military would meet that criteria, chief among them the special forces, which are estimated to include some 56,000 operatives. The performance of other sections of the military has been less encouraging, with many observers complaining of a lack of motivation to fight or of personnel acting as little more than placeholders.

“They’re meant to sit in checkpoints and act as a static representation of government presence,” Watkins said. “It’s understood that they don’t fight effectively — they’re certainly not advancing — and that they’re not an offensive force.”

Advertisement

That has led to an all-too-frequent routine on the battlefield: Special forces dislodge the Taliban from an area, only for it to be lost again a short time later when other security personnel — whether army, police or local militias — come in to secure those gains and flee before a Taliban counterattack.

Overreliance on air power

When these less-trained troops do fight, they’ve often looked to air support for cover. But much of that air power has come from the U.S. and its NATO allies, meaning that, as the U.S. draws down, local troops are having to rely more on the Afghan air force for close support, reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering.

The July SIGAR report says all aircraft types in the Afghan air force are flying “at least 25% over their recommended scheduled maintenance.” Crews, it says, “remain overtaxed” by an increasingly untenable operations tempo.

Just like U.S. and NATO troops, Western contractors who are meant to service the aircraft and repair battle damage are also “going to zero,” meaning they are set to depart the country by Aug. 31, with still no concrete plans as to how the air force will be maintained. That’s especially detrimental to the UH-60 Black Hawks, helicopters that are used for missions including repulsing Taliban onslaught, evacuating casualties and resupplying Afghan forces.

Logistical hurdles

Perhaps the biggest problem facing the ANDSF isn’t training or equipment but logistics. With its takeover of rural areas, the Taliban also gains control over more than 80% of the country’s highways. That figure has only increased in recent days as the group has taken additional territory, such that any attempt to resupply the thousands of army and police bases and checkpoints must be done almost exclusively by air.

In other words, every bullet, every mortar shell, every gallon of fuel and often every carton of eggs has to be brought in by already overstretched air force crews. And the greater the distance from Kabul or primary bases in Kandahar and elsewhere, the more likely the outpost will fall.

That’s why, for several Afghan officials, including one former high-ranking security head who spoke on condition of anonymity, the recent losses have come as no surprise.

“The ANDSF is very scattered, and it can’t choose its own battlefield,” he said. “The Taliban chooses the battlefield. That meant the ANDSF had to shrink its presence.”

Can the government turn things around?

It depends. This month, Ghani, the president, presented a security plan that he vowed would bring the country back under government control within six months. The general outline of the plan has the army defending strategic targets while the Afghan police provide security in major urban areas.

But another, less-discussed aspect of the plan includes empowering former warlords, including figures with a dark record in Afghan’s conflict-filled history. Ghani’s visit to Mazar-i-Sharif on Wednesday was an effort to organize a defense of the city with warlord Atta Mohammad Noor and notorious militia leader Abdul Rashid Dostum. There have been reports that Ghani has promised the two leaders air support as well as assistance from the special forces corps to claw back northern territories.

Could the U.S. get involved again?

Biden has poured cold water on that idea, despite the Afghan army’s staggering pace of losses.

“We trained and equipped with modern equipment over 300,000 Afghan forces. … I’ll insist we continue to keep the commitments we made, providing close air support, making sure that their air force functions and is operable, resupplying their forces with food and equipment and paying all their salaries,” Biden said in a White House briefing Tuesday. “They’ve got to want to fight.”

As for withdrawing U.S. troops within the space of just a few months, “I do not regret my decision,” he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Doctors in Florida say they’re seeing many more coronavirus infections among children just as students begin to return to classrooms.

There has been “an enormous increase” in COVID-19 cases among children in July and August at Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ronald Ford said.

Most of these children have been treated in the emergency room and sent home, but “those that are admitted are sicker than what we’ve seen before, and many of them are requiring care in our intensive care units,” Ford said.

About 20 COVID-positive children sought treatment at the South Florida hospital’s emergency department in June, he said.

“That number went to well over 200 in July and, even at this point in the month of August, we are already up to over 160. So we’re well on the way to breaking July’s record,” Ford said.

On Tuesday, the hospital had nine positive patients admitted, with five in the ICU, Ford said.

Ford’s advice to parents sending their children back to school: Get information from authoritative sources.

“There’s a lot of misinformation out there about COVID-19, about testing, about the vaccine,” Ford said. “The best thing you can do to protect your child is to keep them away from the virus. This virus is extremely infectious. And it doesn’t take much virus to infect and cause symptoms and disease.”

Masking works, reducing the incidence of transmission and the chances of children getting the virus, he said.

“So first and foremost, masking is going to be one of the best defenses we have,” Ford said.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has attempted to block school districts from imposing public health protections on students, saying parents should decide whether their child should wear a mask at school.

At least three school districts — in Alachua, Broward and Leon counties — have appeared to defy the the governor’s order.

Science Coronavirus Today: Back-to-school blues If you are feeling anxiety over schools reopening and the Delta variant, know that you’re not alone.

Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran sent a letter on Monday to the Leon and Alachua school districts saying their adopted policy appeared not to comply with the new rules. He demanded a response and said he may recommend the state’s Board of Education withhold the salaries of the superintendent and school board members.

The Broward school board, after waffling for several weeks, voted Tuesday to require masks for students, teachers and staff when their school year begins on Aug. 18. DeSantis’ spokeswoman Christina Pushaw then said “it’s safe to assume Broward has opened itself up to a similar response.”

Miami-Dade’s superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, said Florida’s largest district will decide what to do after consulting with experts in public health and medicine as the county’s 334,000 students prepare to return to classrooms Aug. 23. He said he won’t be influenced by the governor’s threats.

“At no point shall I allow my decision to be influenced by a threat to my paycheck; a small price to pay considering the gravity of this issue and the potential impact to the health and well-being of our students and dedicated employees,” his statement said.

Ford’s advice for parents with children who are 12 and older is to get them vaccinated.

“This is again another layer of safety that we can offer our children,” he said. “Not only to keep them healthy but to keep them from bringing the virus home and maybe exposing other people in the household or in the community.”

Kevin Cho Tipton, a critical care nurse practitioner for two South Florida hospitals, said teams in the emergency rooms and ICUs are exhausted. He said unvaccinated people often spread the virus among their family members.

“They often tell us someone threw a surprise party for us. Someone said they wanted to come over and have dinner. Or they went out, or went to the movies. Or did something around people that they trusted and wound up getting sick. This is the most common story,” Tipton said.

Senate approves Biden’s infrastructure bill, with funds for California

The Senate on Tuesday approved an expansive bill to rebuild the nation’s aging roads and bridges, with $8.3 billion specifically targeted to water infrastructure projects in the West and billions more to fund national projects to mitigate the impact of wildfires.

After months of negotiation between President Biden, Democrats and a group of moderate Republicans to forge a compromise, the Senate voted 69 to 30 in favor of the legislation. In the end, it had support from 19 Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

The plan, which is the first portion of Biden’s “Build Back Better” program, will next go to the House, where it faces challenges from progressives.

Ten centrist senators who worked on the bill, including lead negotiators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), said it would “create jobs, increase productivity and pave the way for decades of economic growth and prosperity — all without raising taxes on everyday Americans or increasing inflation.”

A handful of other provisions could have an outsized benefit to California in particular.

The most sizable fund that will directly affect the state is the more than $8 billion for water initiatives in the West. That includes $1 billion for water recycling systems and more than $1 billion for water and groundwater storage projects to take advantage of wet years.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees water management in the West, will ultimately decide what projects get funded. But there is a relatively small universe of water projects that will be eligible, and many of them are in California, giving the state a leg up.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigns after report finds credible sexual misconduct claims

Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday that he is resigning from office following a blistering report by the New York attorney general that concluded that Cuomo had sexually harassed multiple women — a move that staved off a likely impeachment by state legislators in Albany.

Advertisement

The investigation released Aug. 3 left Cuomo increasingly isolated from even his own party, as top Democrats, including Biden, called for him to resign. Cuomo said his resignation would become effective in 14 days.

“The best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,” Cuomo said in a video announcement. “And therefore, that’s what I’ll do.”

He will be succeeded by Kathy Hochul, the Democratic lieutenant governor, who will become New York’s first female governor.

Cuomo’s downfall was a remarkable reversal of fortune for a member of a political dynasty who a year ago was considered a likely future White House contender. But he had become a political pariah by the time he declared that he would not finish his third term as New York governor.

Scores of Democratic elected officials had been pressuring him to vacate the office even before New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James began an investigation that found credible the allegations of 11 women accusing Cuomo of sexual misconduct. The report also found that Cuomo had retaliated against another of his accusers. It concluded that Cuomo and his staff had violated multiple state and federal laws and created a toxic and hostile workplace.

The history of air conditioning in Southern California

Cold enough for you …?

… asked no one living in our scorch-and-sizzle places. Not until the 1950s and ’60s, anyway, by which time air conditioning altered our lives and living spaces almost as much as electric light and running water had.

AC is now such a regular part of our living standard that you might not even give it a thought — at least not until the power bill comes.

And yet, where would you be without AC? Maybe not living here at all. Columnist Patt Morrison explains why air conditioning reigns supreme in Southern California.

L.A. COVID-19 surge slowing, but cases likely to rise as school begins

The latest COVID-19 surge is showing some signs of slowing in Los Angeles County. Still, cases are likely to continue rising in the weeks ahead, as the hyper-transmissible Delta variant continues to loom as a major threat, Los Angeles County’s top health official said Tuesday.

Advertisement

Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said she expects recorded infections to increase in part as a byproduct of ramped-up testing when schools, colleges and universities welcome students back for the new term. That likely means people who otherwise wouldn’t have thought to get tested may end up finding out they have an asymptomatic infection — adding to the county’s case count.

“It does mean for the months of August and September, we’re likely to see our case numbers climb,” Ferrer said.

Perhaps a more revealing metric, she said, will be the positivity rate: the proportion of conducted tests that confirm coronavirus infection.

While the raw number of cases can fluctuate significantly based on the amount of testing conducted, a low positivity rate would indicate that transmission may not be accelerating. As of Tuesday, the countywide daily positivity rate was 4.4%. A week ago, the rate was 6.6%.

Advertisement

There are several factors likely contributing to the slowdown, Ferrer said. One is the county’s reinstatement of a requirement in mid-July that all residents wear masks in indoor public places.

When that order went into effect, Ferrer said, cases countywide were doubling roughly every 10 days.

In the early 1940s, there were few places Frank Sinatra could go without drawing attention. He was so popular among teenage girls that there was a term coined for the intense fan reaction: “Sinatramania.” On Aug. 11, 1943, Sinatra arrived in Los Angeles for a performance at the Hollywood Bowl and an appearance in a movie. According to The Times, at least 2,000 fans greeted him at the train station in Pasadena, hoping to catch a glimpse or even get an autograph.

Judging by The Times’ photos, at least a few were successful.

Total attendance this past Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the Los Angeles County Arboretum in Arcadia was about 7,900, compared with 5,200 who visited the Arboretum the previous three-day weekend, said spokeswoman Nancy Yoshihara — proof that succulents were the draw.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Despite a significant surge in both coronavirus cases and hospitalizations this summer, California so far has managed to avoid the sky-high infection rates and increasingly overcrowded hospitals some other states are now experiencing.

California’s coronavirus case rate remains below the national average and significantly less than that of Florida and Texas: two common points of comparison given their population size and distinctly different pandemic responses.

Experts say California’s better-than-average vaccination rates and newly implemented mandatory mask policies in parts of the state have helped prevent a more grim situation.

While governors in Florida, Texas and other states have opposed allowing local governments to mandate the wearing of masks, California has allowed counties to enact such orders in indoor public spaces for everyone age 2 and older, regardless of vaccination status.

“I am hopeful for California and Los Angeles, because of the fact that we have higher levels of vaccination, and we have increased numbers of people stepping up to the plate and getting vaccinated,” said Dr. Robert Kim-Farley, medical epidemiologist and infectious diseases expert at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. “However, we still have a ways to go to achieve a higher level of community immunity, or herd immunity, because of the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant.”

California is reporting 141.1 new coronavirus cases for every 100,000 residents over the last seven days — a rate half that of Texas, 297.8; and less than one-fourth that of Florida’s rate of 653.8, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California’s rate is also less than the national average of 232.1.

The flood of COVID-19 patients newly admitted to Florida hospitals is now far worse than at any point during its winter surge. In early January, Florida was reporting more than 1,150 new COVID-19 patients admitted a day. But over the last week, the state saw an average of 2,071 new COVID-19 hospital admissions daily.

By contrast, California is reporting 772 new COVID-19 hospital admissions daily, just 32% of its winter peak of 2,380. On a per capita basis, Florida’s rate of new daily hospitalizations is five times worse than California’s.

Texas is now reporting 1,403 new COVID-19 hospitalizations daily, 75% of its winter peak of 1,873.

There are also some signs that California’s Delta surge is slowing after public officials in many counties instituted universal masking in indoor public settings. Some businesses have also started demanding proof of vaccination as a condition of employment or entry.

During the week that ended Sunday, L.A. County reported a total of 20,979 new coronavirus cases — a modest 6.5% increase from the previous week, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Tuesday. By comparison, the county saw a 22% increase the week before.

Advertisement

Over the same timeframe, the rest of California reported 55,422 total cases, a 20% increase from the week before. The week before that, the increase was 57%.

L.A. County this summer was one of the first local governments in the nation to recommend, and then require, the wearing of masks in indoor public settings — a move that was soon followed by others including Sacramento and Santa Barbara counties and much of the San Francisco Bay Area.

“Data from around the world and from our county have repeatedly shown that masking is a valuable layer of protection against transmission of respiratory viruses,” Ferrer said.

Officials stressed the Delta variant continues to be a public health threat, and they expect cases to rise further in the coming weeks. Yet they hope the steps already taken will flatten, and eventually reverse, the pandemic’s trajectory without resorting to more stringent measures.

The biggest reason for that optimism is California’s relatively robust level of vaccine coverage. According to the latest CDC figures, 77.5% of eligible Californians — those who are at least 12 years old — have already gotten at least one dose, and about 63% are considered fully vaccinated.

In Florida, roughly 69% of similarly aged residents are at least partially vaccinated, and 57% have completed their inoculation series. The comparable rates in Texas are 64.3% and 53.7%, respectively, federal figures show.

Advertisement

Officials and experts say the overwhelming majority of people currently being hospitalized for COVID-19 in California and across the country have yet to be vaccinated.

Out of 117 people admitted to Los Angeles County’s public hospitals primarily for COVID-19 between June 15 and Aug. 5, 112 were not fully vaccinated and only five were fully vaccinated, according to Dr. Christina Ghaly, the county’s director of health services.

“The vaccine saves lives,” she said Tuesday. “It reduces the risk of infection, it reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others and, critically, in doing so it reduces the risk of those individuals serving as a petri dish, really, in which the virus can continue to mutate into progressively more dangerous forms that put everyone at risk.”

California L.A. COVID-19 surge slowing, but cases likely to keep rising as school begins Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said she expects recorded infections will increase in part as a byproduct of ramped-up testing when schools, colleges and universities welcome students back for the new term.

Aside from vaccines, health officials and experts have long noted that pandemic conditions vary based on a number of factors. Some areas may have stricter coronavirus-related rules in place, or are home to residents who — for whatever reason — are more likely to take individual precautions in their daily lives.

Other areas may largely scoff at any such limitations.

Perhaps nowhere is the gap between California versus Florida and Texas more apparent than when it comes to masks.

Advertisement

California has urged all residents, even those who are fully vaccinated, to wear masks indoors while in public, and is requiring them in K-12 schools.

The governors of Texas and Florida, on the other hand, have largely banned schools and municipal governments from instituting such mandates, though some local leaders have defied those orders.

World & Nation Texas seeks out-of-state medical help amid COVID-19 crisis Gov. Greg Abbott directs agencies to find additional medical staff and he requests that hospitals postpone elective procedures as the Delta variant overwhelms hospitals statewide. But his ban on mask mandates remains in place.

In light of the surge, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has directed the state health department to use staffing agencies to find additional medical staff and also sent a letter to the Texas Hospital Assn. requesting that hospitals postpone elective medical procedures.

Austin, Texas, emergency room doctor Natasha Kathuria — a native of Orlando, Fla. — said she hears from Florida doctors that the situation there is even worse, and worries that’s where Texas is headed. Kathuria, who also serves on the board of directors of Global Outreach Doctors, already had to send patients home because she didn’t have the capacity to treat them.

“This is disaster medicine,” she said. “We’ve never felt this disheartened during the pandemic.”

Though California officials have voiced some concern with rapidly rising hospitalizations, they’ve generally said they believe the state’s healthcare system won’t come under the same sort of stress as during the state’s devastating fall-and-winter wave.

Though the surge of new infections has started to wash over California’s hospitals, the death toll from COVID-19 has remained relatively low at an average of about 32 fatalities per day over the last week. That’s a far cry from the regular triple-digit counts seen during previous surges.

California L.A. COVID-19 surge slowing, but cases likely to keep rising as school begins Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said she expects recorded infections will increase in part as a byproduct of ramped-up testing when schools, colleges and universities welcome students back for the new term.

Though it’s possible death counts may not surge as they have earlier in the pandemic — especially since many of the most vulnerable Californians, namely the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, have gotten vaccinated — Ferrer cautioned that it’s still too soon to say for sure.

In L.A. County, she said, someone who dies from COVID-19 was diagnosed an average of 37 days beforehand.

“With our case increase having begun relatively recently, it’s therefore too early to fully assess the impact of this latest wave of infection,” she said.

Times staff writer Molly Hennessy-Fiske in Houston contributed to this report.

California COVID-19 hospitalizations rise sharply across Southern California as surge continues COVID-19 hospitalizations have essentially doubled across much of California over the past two weeks — a troubling trend officials say illustrates the pandemic’s continued potency amid an ongoing surge in infections.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@People headed to cooling centers Wednesday as the Pacific Northwest began sweltering under another major, multiday heat wave just over a month after record-shattering hot weather killed hundreds of the region’s most vulnerable people.

Temperatures soared to 95 degrees by midafternoon in Portland. In a “worst-case scenario,” the temperature could reach as high as 111 in some parts of western Oregon this week before a weekend cool-down, the National Weather Service said. It’s more likely temperatures will rise to 100 or above for three consecutive days, peaking around 105 on Thursday.

Sizzling weather also was expected in other parts of the country. The weather service said heat advisories and warnings would be in effect from the Midwest to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic through at least Friday.

The high temperatures in Portland, part of a usually temperate region, would break records this week if the late June heat wave had not done so already, meteorologist Tyler Kranz said. Seattle will be cooler than Portland, with temperatures in the mid-90s, but it still has a chance to break records, and many people there, as in Oregon, don’t have air conditioning.

The forecast was hotter than for Phoenix, a desert city notorious for its blistering summertime temperatures.

“We’ll often hear people say, ‘Who cares if it’s 106 or 108? It gets this hot in Arizona all the time.’ Well, people in Arizona have air conditioning, and here in the Pacific Northwest, a lot of people don’t,” Kranz said. “You can’t really compare us to the desert Southwest.”

People began coming into a 24-hour cooling center in North Portland before it opened Wednesday. Volunteers and county employees set up cots and stacked hundreds of bottles of water in the air-conditioned center in a vacant building.

The first few people in were experiencing homelessness, a population vulnerable to extreme heat. Among them was December Snedecor, who slept two nights in the same center in June when temperatures reached 116.

She said she planned to sleep there again this week because the heat in her tent was unbearable.

“I poured water over myself a lot. It was up in the teens, hundred-and-something heat. It made me dizzy. It was not good,” Snedecor said of the June heat. “I’ve just got to stay cool. I don’t want to die.”

Gov. Kate Brown has declared a state of emergency over the heat and activated an emergency operations center, citing the potential for disruptions to the power grid and transportation. Besides opening cooling centers, city and county governments are extending public library hours and waiving bus fare for those headed to cooling centers. A 24-hour statewide help line will direct callers to the nearest cooling shelter and offer safety tips.

Emergency officials have sent alerts to phones, said Dan Douthit, spokesman for the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management.

“We don’t know exactly how hot it will get,” he said, “but we’re planning for a worst-case scenario.”

The back-to-back heat waves, coupled with a summer that’s been exceptionally warm and dry overall, are pummeling a region where summer highs usually drift into the 70s or 80s. Both the heat and a historic drought across the American West reflect climate change that makes weather more extreme in the historically temperate region.

The June heat in Oregon, Washington and Canada’s British Columbia contributed to the deaths of hundreds of people and was a wake-up call for what’s ahead in a warming world. It was virtually impossible without human-caused climate change, a scientific analysis found.

Advertisement

In Oregon, officials have released the names of 96 people who died of heat-related illness, and the hot weather was being investigated as a possible cause in many more deaths. Washington state reported more than 100 heat deaths, and officials in British Columbia said hundreds of “sudden and unexpected deaths” were likely due to the soaring temperatures.

The toll exposed huge blind spots in emergency planning in a region unaccustomed to dealing with such high temperatures, said Vivek Shandas, a professor of climate adaptation at Portland State University.

Most of those who died in Oregon were older, homebound and socially isolated, and many were unable, or unwilling, to get to cooling centers.

Advertisement

The call center designed to provide information about cooling centers was unstaffed during part of the peak heat, and hundreds of callers got stuck in a voicemail menu that didn’t include a prompt for heat-related help. Portland’s famed light-rail train also shut down to reduce strain on the power grid, eliminating a transportation option for low-income residents seeking relief.

This time, local and state officials have added more cooling centers and included a prompt in the call center voicemail.

“We knew a week in advance. What would happen if we knew an earthquake was going to hit us a week in advance?” Shandas said. “That’s the kind of thinking we need to be aligned with.”

Even younger residents struggled with the heat in June and were dreading this week’s sweltering temperatures.

Katherine Morgan, 27, has no air-conditioning in her third-floor apartment and can’t afford a window unit on the money she makes working at a bookstore and as a hostess at a brewery.

She’ll have to walk to work Thursday, the day when temperatures could again soar.

“All my friends and I knew that climate change was real,” Morgan said, “but it’s getting really scary because it was gradually getting hot — and it suddenly got really hot, really fast.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The speaker of the Texas House of Representatives signed civil arrest warrants for 52 absent Democrats late Tuesday, setting in motion the potential roundup of lawmakers who have avoided the Texas Capitol in order to stymie a vote on a GOP elections bill that they say would harm minorities.

The House voted 80 to 12 Tuesday to force the protesting lawmakers to return, just hours after the Texas Supreme Court cleared the way for the House to order them back to the chamber to secure a quorum.

The warrants will be delivered to the House sergeant-at-arms Wednesday morning, according to Enrique Marquez, a spokesman for Speaker Dade Phelan.

The move will likely further inflame partisan tension in the Texas House.

Rep. Chris Turner, who chairs the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said Tuesday that it was “fully within our rights as legislators to break quorum to protect our constituents.”

“Texas House Democrats are committed to fighting with everything we have against Republicans’ attacks on our freedom to vote,” he said in a statement.

World & Nation Explainer: How Texas Republicans aim to make voting harder The Texas Senate has pushed the state one step closer to becoming the largest in the nation where the GOP is making voting harder following the 2020 elections.

One Republican voted against authorizing arrest warrants: state Rep. Lyle Larson of San Antonio, who has been openly critical of the elections bill that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has demanded.

“Civil discourse took a nasty turn today,” Larson tweeted of the arrest warrants.

Fugitive Democrats remain defiant, and an untold number are outside the reach of the House sergeant-at-arms and state troopers.

“I just question whether DPS or anyone can break down my door to come and put me in shackles and drag me there,” state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, an Austin Democrat, told the Dallas Morning News. “I feel certain that I can stay in my home, and stay off the House floor.”

At least two dozen House Democrats have stayed in Washington, where 57 of them camped out for all or most of a month to run out the clock on Abbott’s first special session.

“We broke quorum because anti-voter bills are nefarious attempts to disenfranchise Texans & these authoritarian motions by Republicans just cement that we are on the right side of history,” state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, an Austin Democrat, tweeted. “We must hold the line against these desperate attempts to destroy our democracy.”

Abbott called the Legislature into special session last month to reconsider a measure that House Democrats had blocked with an eleventh-hour walkout in May, at the end of the regular biennial session.

Democrats used the same tactic to stymie action in the special session and claimed victory when that session expired.

But Republicans are determined to wear them down, and Abbott immediately ordered a second special session that began Saturday.

Nineteen of the Democrats who broke quorum last month sought protection in a Travis County court. On Monday, District Judge Brad Urrutia signed an order to prevent arrests for 14 days.

Early Tuesday, Abbott and Phelan asked the Texas Supreme Court to overturn that order, and the justices quickly agreed.

It wouldn’t take many arrests for the House to be back in business. A quorum requires two-thirds of the 150 members on site. Since Monday, 96 House members have checked in as present — just four shy.

During their self-imposed exile in Washington, the Texas Democrats have lobbied the White House and potential swing votes in the U.S. Senate for federal voting rights bills that would supersede anything Republicans can get through the Texas Legislature.

World & Nation Texas seeks out-of-state medical help amid COVID-19 crisis Gov. Greg Abbott directs agencies to find additional medical staff and he requests that hospitals postpone elective procedures as the Delta variant overwhelms hospitals statewide. But his ban on mask mandates remains in place.

Texas Republicans insist that their proposals are meant solely to boost election integrity and avert cheating.

Urrutia’s order prevented House members from being subject to a “call of the House.” GOP leaders claimed they could invoke such a call to order the House sergeant-at-arms to haul wayward lawmakers back to the Capitol from anywhere in Texas.

Under House rules, voting on legislation requires a quorum. But votes to compel attendance of absent members, or to adjourn, do not.

“They just need to put them all in handcuffs, drag them in, throw them in the middle of chambers, lock the doors and unhandcuff ’em. ... A couple of them would go bug-eyed crazy,” state Rep. Cecil Bell, a Republican, said in an interview with the web show “The Undercurrent.”

But the optics of hauling in the lawmakers and locking them on the House floor would be risky for GOP leaders. Democratic Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston, for example, is recovering from the amputation of a foot.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gentry O. Smith was a cop in his hometown of Raleigh, N.C., before joining the State Department nearly 25 years ago. There he has served in numerous security posts in Asia, the Middle East and the U.S.

So his appointment to head the Diplomatic Security Service, which oversees protection of everyone from the secretary of State to U.S. diplomats around the world, would seem to be a natural choice.

Yet his April nomination, like many made by President Biden for the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and elsewhere, sat stalled for months in Senate committees, where a few Republican lawmakers blocked approval.

Although nominations were blocked across the board, the State Department was hardest hit: As of Monday night, more than six months into the Biden administration, only one of the president’s ambassador picks had been approved, leaving nearly 50% of all embassies without their top official, according to the American Foreign Service Assn. Early Wednesday, a second ambassador, Kenneth Salazar for Mexico, was confirmed in a marathon Senate session.

Democrats and administration officials are furious, saying the failure to adequately staff the government has harmed American diplomacy abroad, national security at home and other areas of governance. GOP senators say in some instances they have serious objections to the candidate, but in most cases they are using their power to exact policy concessions.

Foremost among those blocking nominees is Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has held back as many as two dozen State Department appointees, on demands that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken penalize all international firms and individuals involved in the construction of a Russian pipeline to Europe.

Blinken complained last week that 65 nominations were still pending a confirmation vote. Some of those, including Smith’s nomination, this week squeaked through the Senate approval process on the eve of Congress’ August recess after languishing for months.

“These are critical national security positions,” Blinken said, specifically mentioning the assistant secretary of State for diplomatic security, Smith’s designated position.

Others included the top officials in charge of various regions — the assistant secretaries of State for Latin America, Europe and parts of Asia — as well as consular services at a time of a massive backlog in the issuance of U.S. passports and visas because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Since Blinken spoke, the nominee for assistant secretary of State for consular affairs was confirmed Monday night, and at least two regional secretaries and several ambassadors, mostly for African countries, were put onto a crowded Senate agenda for Tuesday night.)

“The American people need these services,” Blinken added. “The American people need these nominees in place.”

Administration-wide as of midnight Monday, according to congressional records, about one-third of Biden’s nominations submitted to Senate committees had been confirmed. At the same point in both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations, at least two-thirds of each president’s nominations had been approved. For the Trump administration, which made far fewer nominations, the confirmations at that point were just under 45%.

Eric Rubin, who heads the American Foreign Service Assn., the union for diplomats, said the overall approval process for numerous agencies had been notoriously slow but was particularly egregious for the State Department.

But he also says there is blame to go around. Senate approval has been riddled with delays, but Biden also had been slow to nominate many people. And it comes at a time of multiple worldwide crises when “we cannot afford to coast,” he said.

“It hurts national security, it hurts national interests,” said Rubin, a former ambassador to Bulgaria. “The world doesn’t understand how we can be the only country in the world that can’t manage to send ambassadors to our embassies overseas.”

Politics Congress to assist brain-injury victims of mysterious ‘Havana syndrome’ Congress is expected to authorize financial aid to dozens of American officials for unpaid medical bills related to the treatment of Havana syndrome.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which receives State Department nominations before sending them to the full Senate floor, said he had “never seen anything like” the recent tempo of holdups.

Advertisement

“This is beyond the pale,” he said last week in yet another business meeting aimed at considering nominations.

In an earlier meeting, Menendez and Cruz got into what was nearly a shouting match over what the Democrat described as the Republican’s delay tactics.

“Sen. Cruz, this committee has had a long history, which you are blackening, by virtue of turning the committee’s business for a political purpose,” Menendez said. “We have had no history of that.”

Cruz responded: “Mr. Chairman, what political purpose is that?”

Advertisement

Menendez shot back: “Maybe it’s your presidential aspirations, I don’t know, but you’re turning to political purposes, you held over every nominee, every nominee. I’ve never seen that.”

Cruz’s main demand is that Blinken issue sanctions against sponsors of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that Russia and Germany are building to transport Russian gas to Germany. The Trump administration sanctioned many of the builders but construction continued.

Biden administration officials say the pipeline was 95% complete by the time they came to office, making sanctions now pointless. In addition, they said, further punishment risked alienating a key ally — Germany — with whom the Biden team wants to repair relations damaged under President Trump. The administration placed waivers on numerous sanctions imposed by Trump, essentially lifting the measures, a step that infuriated Cruz and other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

Cruz defends his decision to block appointments as a way to pressure the administration. In a recent interview with Politico, he compared allowing the construction of Nord Stream 2 to the “historical mistake” of President Carter’s 1977 agreement to relinquish U.S. control of the Panama Canal.

“Sen. Cruz will use all leverage and prerogatives he has as a U.S. senator to get the Biden administration to follow the law and implement congressional mandates to sanction and stop completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” Cruz’s press secretary, Dave Vasquez, told The Times.

Although Cruz is responsible for most of the holdups, he is not the only lawmaker spoiling Biden’s plans. Some held up nominations out of protest on unrelated issues, others over qualms about the nominees’ records.

Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho briefly held up at the committee level the nomination of Christopher Lu, an attorney and former Labor Department official, tapped for ambassador to the United Nations for management and reform, considering him too lenient on the U.N.

Under congressional rules, members of the minority party cannot put permanent or indefinite holds on candidates but can considerably slow the approval process by holding the nominees over to later business meetings or not showing up so that there isn’t a quorum and a vote cannot be held.

Committee chairs can override the holds and push nominees through to the full Senate, which Menendez did last week to move about 20 State Department nominations. At the full Senate, however, any member can demand a 30-hour debate on each nominee.

White House officials say that so far, once the stalled nominations reach the full Senate, most have been approved overwhelmingly, evidence that the blocking is more political than substantive.

It took three months for Jen Easterly, an intelligence official and former lieutenant colonel in the Army, to be approved as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the cybersecurity division of Homeland Security,

Her nomination was held up by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who said he was protesting Biden policies on the U.S. border with Mexico. Ultimately, on July 12, the Senate confirmed her appointment unanimously — after the U.S. suffered a major cyberattack thought to come from Russia.

“These are reasons unrelated to expertise and qualifications,” a person involved in the process said of the holdovers. The official asked not to be identified to discuss internal proceedings. “It’s politics.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro suffered a major defeat in Congress late Tuesday when lawmakers refused to adopt his proposal to require printed receipts from some electronic voting machines.

The defeat came hours after dozens of military vehicles and hundreds of soldiers paraded past Brazil’s presidential palace as Bolsonaro looked on. Brazil’s navy said the convoy had been planned long before the congressional vote, but it was announced only Monday, and critics said it looked like an attempt to intimidate opponents of a president who has often praised the country’s 1964-85 military dictatorship.

Bolsonaro has insisted that printed receipts from ballot machines are needed to avoid fraud, without providing any evidence that Brazil’s all-electronic voting system is prone to cheating. He needed 308 votes to pass the proposed constitutional change, but got only 229 Tuesday night.

The opposition, however, also fell short of its goal of rebuffing the president with an overwhelming majority, receiving only 218 votes.

The military convoy had rumbled past the congressional building and Brazil’s Defense Ministry earlier in the day. The vehicles left the city at night.

Military parades in the capital are usually limited to Brazil’s independence day. Tuesday’s procession was described as a ceremonial invitation for Bolsonaro to attend annual naval exercises that are held in a town outside the capital.

Critics contend that Bolsonaro is trying to sow doubt early among his base of passionate supporters about next year’s election, setting the stage for potential conflicts similar to those spawned by former President Trump’s allegations of fraud in the U.S.

Bolsonaro has repeatedly insulted Luis Roberto Barroso, a Supreme Court justice who is president of Brazil’s electoral court, accusing him of working to benefit former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been leading in polls for next year’s election.

The measure voted on Tuesday was a watered-down version of an initial proposal to require printouts at all of the nation’s voting ballot boxes. That measure was rejected last week by a congressional committee.

Electoral authorities and even many of Bolsonaro’s political allies opposed the proposal, saying it would attack a nonexistent problem and could create opportunities for vote-buying.

Advertisement

Claudio Couto, a political scientist with the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation, said Tuesday’s rejection marked Bolsonaro’s biggest legislative defeat.

“The administration is getting more frail in every aspect. It suffers in polls, it is investigated in the Senate inquiry on the COVID-19 pandemic and the chances that Bolsonaro is not reelected are getting bigger,” Couto said. “By insisting [on] today’s proposal to solve a problem that does not exist, Bolsonaro has made this defeat to be important.”

The call for a vote appeared to be a bid by lower house Speaker Arthur Lira, a Bolsonaro ally, to settle the dispute for good and ease tensions.

On Monday, Lira called the military exercise taking place the same day as the vote a “tragic coincidence.″

“We hope that this subject is finally ended in the lower house,” Lira said after the vote.

Juan Gonzalez, the U.S. National Security Council’s senior director for the Western Hemisphere, told reporters Monday that Biden administration officials were “very candid” in speaking last week with Bolsonaro about elections, particularly in light of what has happened in the U.S.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@At least 28 soldiers have died saving residents from wildfires ravaging mountain forests and villages east of Algeria’s capital, with the overall death toll rising to at least 65, officials said Wednesday.

Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said the country would enter a three-day period of mourning starting Thursday that would include suspending all government activity except for acts of solidarity. He tweeted Tuesday night that the dead soldiers were “martyrs” who had saved 100 people from blazes in two areas of Kabyle, the region that is home to the North African nation’s Berber population.

The mountainous Kabyle region, 60 miles east of Algiers, is dotted with difficult-to-access villages and, with temperatures rising, has had limited water. Some villagers fled, while others tried to hold back the flames using buckets, branches and rudimentary tools. The region has no water-dumping planes.

The forestry director in Tizi-Ouzou, the regional capital, said Wednesday that 18 fires remained active in the region. Dozens of fires burned elsewhere across the north, but their deadly force was concentrated in Kabyle.

The deaths and injuries Tuesday occurred mainly around Tizi-Ouzou, which is flanked by mountains, and also in Bejaia, which borders the Mediterranean Sea, the president said.

Prime Minister Aimene Benabderrahmane told state television Tuesday that initial reports from security services showed the fires in Kabyle were “highly synchronized,” adding that “leads one to believe these were criminal acts.” Earlier, Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud traveled to Kabyle to assess the situation and also blamed the fires there on arson.

“Thirty fires at the same time in the same region can’t be by chance,” Beldjoud said on national television, although no arrests were announced.

There were no immediate details to explain the high death toll among the military. A photo on the site of the Liberte daily showed a soldier with a shovel dousing sputtering flames with dirt, his automatic weapon slung over his shoulder.

Dozens of blazes sprang up Monday in Kabyle and elsewhere, and Algerian authorities sent in the army to help residents battle blazes and evacuate. Multiple fires were burning through forests and devouring olive trees, cattle and chickens that provide the livelihoods of families in the Kabyle region.

North Africa has been sweltering in searing temperatures, including neighboring Tunisia, where scattered fires in the east were reported. Algeria’s National Meteorology Office reported that high temperatures were expected through Thursday in nearly a dozen wilayas, or regions, including around Tizi-Ouzou. In some places, the mercury was forecast to hit 116 degrees.

A 92-year-old woman living in the Kabyle mountain village of Ait Saada said the scene Monday night looked like “the end of the world.”

“We were afraid,” Fatima Aoudia told the Associated Press. “The entire hill was transformed into a giant blaze.”

Aoudia compared the fires to bombings by French troops during Algeria’s brutal war of independence, which ended in 1962.

“These burned down forests. It’s a part of me that is gone,” Aoudia said. “It’s a drama for humanity, for nature. It’s a disaster.”

An opposition party with roots in the Kabyle region, the RCD, denounced authorities’ slow response to the blazes as citizens organized local drives to collect bottled water and other supplies.

Calls for help, including from Algerians living abroad, went out on social media, one in English trending on Twitter with the hashtag #PrayforAlgeria. Photos and videos posted showed plumes of dark smoke and orange skies above hillside villages, and soldiers in army fatigues without protective clothing.

Climate scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms. A worsening drought and heat — both linked to climate change — are driving wildfires in the U.S. West and Russia’s northern region of Siberia.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Democrats pushed a $3.5-trillion framework for bolstering family services and health and environmental programs through the Senate early Wednesday, advancing President Biden’s expansive vision for reshaping federal priorities just hours after handing him a triumph on a hefty infrastructure package.

Lawmakers approved Democrats’ budget resolution on a party-line 50-49 vote, a crucial step for a president and party set on training the government’s fiscal might at assisting families, creating jobs and fighting climate change. Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations would pay for much of the plan.

Passage came despite an avalanche of Republican amendments intended to make their rivals pay a price in next year’s election for control of Congress.

House leaders announced that their chamber would return from summer recess in two weeks to vote on the fiscal blueprint, which would disburse the $3.5 trillion over the next decade. Final congressional approval, which appears certain, would protect a follow-up bill to enact the spending and tax changes from the threat of being killed by a Republican filibuster in the 50-50 Senate.

Advertisement

Even so, passing that follow-up legislation will be dicey: Democratic moderates who are wary of the massive $3.5-trillion price tag are sparring with progressives who demand aggressive action. The party controls the House with just four votes to spare, while the evenly divided Senate is under the party’s control only due to Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote. Solid GOP opposition to the legislation seems guaranteed.

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), once a maverick congressional progressive voice but now a national figure wielding legislative clout, said the measure would help children, families, elderly and working people — and more.

“It will also, I hope, restore the faith of the American people in the belief that we can have a government that works for all of us, and not just the few,” he said.

Republicans argued that Democrats’ proposals would waste money, raise economy-wounding taxes, fuel inflation and codify far-left dictates that would harm Americans. They were happy to use Sanders, a self-avowed democratic socialist, to try to tar all Democrats backing the measure.

If Biden and Senate Democrats want to “outsource domestic policy to Chairman Sanders” with a “historically reckless taxing and spending spree,” Republicans lack the votes to stop them, conceded Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “But we will debate. We will vote.”

The Senate turned to the budget minutes after it approved Biden’s other major objective: a compromise bundle of transportation, water, broadband and other infrastructure projects costing about $1 trillion in new and old spending. That measure passed 69 to 30, with McConnell among the 19 Republicans backing it. It will need House approval next.

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) assured progressives that Congress would pursue sweeping initiatives that go beyond the infrastructure compromise, in a nod to divisions between the party’s moderates and liberals that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) need to resolve before Congress can approve Democrats’ fiscal goals.

“To my colleagues who are concerned that this does not do enough on climate, for families, and making corporations and the rich pay their fair share: We are moving on to a second track, which will make a generational transformation in these areas,” Schumer said.

In a budget ritual, senators plunged into a “vote-a-rama,” a nonstop parade of messaging amendments that often becomes an all-night ordeal. This time, the Senate held over 40 votes before approving the measure around 4 a.m. Eastern time, more than 14 hours after the procedural marathon began.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) missed the budget votes to be with his ailing wife.

With the budget resolution largely advisory, most amendments were offered not in hopes of passing but to force the other party’s vulnerable senators to cast troublesome votes that can be used against them in next year’s midterm election.

Republicans crowed after Democrats opposed GOP amendments calling for the full-time reopening of pandemic-shuttered schools, boosting the Pentagon’s budget and retaining limits on federal income tax deductions for state and local levies. Those deduction caps are opposed by lawmakers from upper-income, mostly Democratic states.

Republicans were also happy when Democrats opposed restricting the Internal Revenue Service’s access to some financial records, which McConnell’s office said would prompt political “witch hunts,” and when Democrats showed support for Biden’s now-suspended ban on oil and gas leasing on federal lands, which Republicans said would prompt gasoline price increases.

One amendment may have boomeranged after the Senate voted 99 to 0 for a proposal by freshman Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) to curb federal funds for any municipalities that defund their local police. That idea has been rejected by all but the most progressive Democrats, but Republicans persist in accusing them all of backing it.

In an animated, sardonic rejoinder, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) called Tuberville’s amendment “a gift” that would let Democrats “put to bed this scurrilous accusation that somebody in this great esteemed body would want to defund the police.” He said he wanted to “walk over there and hug” Tuberville.

Republicans claimed narrow victories on two nonbinding amendments with potential long-term implications when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III, one of the chamber’s more conservative Democrats, voted with them on both.

One amendment indicated support for healthcare providers who refuse to participate in abortions. The other voiced opposition to teaching critical race theory, the study of systemic racial inequities in America — though there’s scant evidence that it’s part of public school curricula.

The budget blueprint envisions creating new programs such as tuition-free pre-kindergarten and community college, paid family leave and a Civilian Climate Corps whose workers would tackle environmental projects. Millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally would have a new path toward citizenship, and there would be financial incentives for states to adopt more labor-friendly laws.

Medicare would add dental, hearing and vision benefits, and new tax credits and grants would encourage utilities and industries to embrace clean energy. Child tax credits beefed up for the pandemic would be extended, along with federal subsidies for health insurance.

Besides higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, Democrats envision savings by letting the government negotiate prices for the pharmaceuticals it buys, by slapping taxes on imported carbon fuels and by strengthening IRS tax collections.

Democrats have said their policies will be fully funded, but they’ll make no final decisions until this fall’s follow-up bill.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Taliban seized three more provincial capitals and a local army headquarters Wednesday to complete a blitz across Afghanistan’s northeast, giving the insurgent group control of two-thirds of the nation as the U.S. and NATO complete their withdrawal of forces.

The fall of the capitals of Badakhshan, Baghlan and Farah provinces put increasing pressure on the country’s central government to stem the tide of the advance, even as it lost a major base in Kunduz. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rushed to Balkh province, already surrounded by Taliban-held territory, to seek help from warlords linked to allegations of atrocities and corruption. He also replaced his army chief of staff.

Although the capital, Kabul, has not been directly threatened in the militants’ advance, the stunning speed of the offensive raises questions of how long the Afghan government can keep its grip on the slivers of the country it still controls. The government may eventually be forced to pull back to defend the capital and just a few other cities.

“I think what I would say to President Ghani is if you remain spread out everywhere, the Taliban will be able to continue to apply their current approach with success,” warned Ben Barry, the senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “You’ve got to do a bit more than stopping the Taliban. You’ve got to show you can push them back.”

Advertisement

The success of the Taliban offensive also calls into question whether the militants would ever rejoin long-stalled peace talks in Qatar aimed at moving Afghanistan toward an inclusive interim administration, as the West hoped. Instead, the Taliban could come to power by force — or the country could splinter into factional fighting like it did after the Soviet Union’s withdrawal in 1989.

The multiple fronts of the fighting have stretched the government’s special operations forces — while regular troops have often fled the battlefield — and the violence has pushed thousands of civilians to seek safety in the capital.

The U.S. military, which plans to complete its withdrawal by the end of the month, has conducted some airstrikes but largely has avoided involving itself in the ground campaign.

The latest U.S. military intelligence assessment is that Kabul could come under insurgent pressure within 30 days and that if current trends hold, the Taliban could gain full control of the country within a couple of months, according to a U.S. defense official, who discussed the internal assessment on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — whose country is contemplating running and protecting Kabul airport after U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces withdraw — told CNN-Turk television that he may meet with the Taliban leadership.

“If we don’t bring them under control at the highest level ... it will not be possible for us to ensure peace in Afghanistan,” Erdogan said.

Humayoon Shahidzada, a lawmaker from Farah, the capital of Farah province, confirmed Wednesday to the Associated Press the fall of his city.

In Farah province, Taliban fighters dragged the shoeless, bloody corpse of one Afghan security force member through the street, shouting: “God is great!” Insurgents carrying M-16 rifles and driving Humvees and Ford pickup trucks donated to the Afghan government by the United States rolled through the streets of the province’s capital.

“The situation is under control in the city, our mujahedin are patrolling in the city,” said one Taliban fighter who did not give his name, referring to his fellow insurgents as “holy warriors.”

The crackle of automatic weapons fire continued throughout the day in Farah.

Hujatullah Kheradmand, a lawmaker from Badakhshan, said the Taliban had seized his province’s capital, Faizabad. An Afghan official, who requested anonymity to speak about an unacknowledged loss, said Baghlan’s capital, Pul-i-Khumri, also fell.

The Afghan government and military did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the losses.

The insurgents earlier captured six other provincial capitals in the country in less than a week.

On Wednesday, the headquarters of the Afghan national army’s 217th Corps at Kunduz airport fell to the Taliban, according to Ghulam Rabani Rabani, a provincial council member in Kunduz, and lawmaker Shah Khan Sherzad. The insurgents posted video that they said showed surrendering troops.

The province’s capital, also called Kunduz, was already among those seized, and the capture of the base now puts the country’s northeast firmly in Taliban hands.

It wasn’t immediately clear what equipment was left behind for the insurgents, though a Taliban video showed them parading in Humvees and pickup trucks. Another video showed fighters on the airport’s tarmac next to an attack helicopter without rotor blades.

In the southern province of Helmand, where the Taliban control nearly all of the capital, Lashkar Gar, a suicide car bomber targeted the government-held police headquarters, provincial council leader Attaullah Afghan said. The building has been under siege for two weeks.

The rapid fall of wide swaths of the country raises fears that the brutal tactics the Taliban used to rule Afghanistan previously will also return, including severe curtailing of women’s rights. Some civilians who have fled Taliban advances have said that the insurgents imposed repressive restrictions on women and burned down schools, and there have been reports of revenge killings.

In the face of Afghanistan’s rapidly deteriorating situation, Germany and the Netherlands both announced Wednesday that they would suspend deportations to the country.

Speaking to journalists Tuesday, a senior European Union official said the insurgents held about 230 of the more than 400 districts in Afghanistan. The official described an additional 65 districts as under government control while the rest were contested. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal figures.

In addition to the northeast, much of the north has also fallen to the Taliban, except for Balkh province. There, warlords Abdul Rashid Dostum, Atta Mohammad Noor and Mohammad Mohaqiq planned to mobilize forces in support of the Afghan government to push back the Taliban. Dostum in particular has a troubled past, facing investigations after the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. He is accused of killing hundreds of Taliban fighters last year by letting them suffocate in sealed shipping containers.

On Wednesday, Dostum said that the Taliban “won’t be able to leave north and will face the same fate” as the suffocated troops.

Ghani meanwhile ordered Gen. Hibatullah Alizai to replace Gen. Wali Ahmadzai as the Afghan army chief of staff, according to an Afghan official who spoke to the AP and local media reports. The Defense Ministry official spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had yet to be made public.

Alizai was the commander of the Afghan army’s Special Operations Corps — the elite troops that, along with the air force, have been forced to do most of the fighting as regular forces have collapsed.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@More than 50 former opposition lawmakers and rights activists, including an American lawyer, were arrested in Hong Kong in early-morning sweeps Wednesday on suspicion of violating the city’s national security law, marking one of the biggest crackdowns to date on political dissent in the Asian financial capital.

The raids, which included the arrest of a pollster and warrants to investigate several independent media outlets, highlight Beijing’s determination to transform the semi-autonomous Chinese city at a time when the United States and Europe are distracted by political tumult and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Police said about 1,000 officers fanned out to 72 locations targeting suspects involved in an informal primary held by opposition parties in July to select candidates for legislative elections, which were later postponed by the government.

Chinese officials had warned that the primary was illegal and could violate the new national security law, which has sent a chill across the territory over the past six months by banning, in effect, pro-democracy protests and silencing high-profile critics such as jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai.

Opposition candidates had hoped to win at least 35 seats in the 70-seat legislature last September in order to be able to veto budgets and challenge pro-Beijing government policies — reasons cited Wednesday by the government as subversive and grounds for arrest.

“People involved are suspected of making use of what they call ‘a 35 plus’ plan ... to some way paralyze the Hong Kong government,” John Lee, Hong Kong’s security secretary, said at a news conference Wednesday.

Lee also accused the suspects of developing a “10-step mutual destruction plan” to mobilize supporters to riot and bring Hong Kong to a standstill. Lee appeared to be referring to a prediction by legal scholar Benny Tai, who was among those arrested, of what would happen to Hong Kong if China continued to diminish its autonomy.

Tai helped establish the primary elections and launch the 2014 Occupy Central and Umbrella movements, precursors to the massive protests that swept through Hong Kong in 2019.

Lee said the 600,000 people who merely voted in the primary were not subject to arrest.

Even before Wednesday’s mass arrests, Hong Kong’s legislature has been devoid of any opposition. All 15 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp quit in November to protest the disqualification of four colleagues accused of “endangering national security.”

The former lawmakers were among those arrested Wednesday, including Wu Chi-wai, Alvin Yeung, Lam Cheuk-ting, Andrew Wan and James To, according to their Facebook pages.

Police also arrested American human rights attorney John Clancey, who assisted with the primary and could become the first foreigner charged under the national security law. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong declined to comment.

Clancey was seen being escorted out of his office by police carrying a crutch. When asked by a reporter if he had anything to say to the people of Hong Kong, he responded: “Continue to work for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.”

Those arrested could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of violating the national security law, which targets acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to endanger national security.

Police also seized Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist-turned-activist, who wrote in an editorial published in the Los Angeles Times last year that Hong Kong must “brace for a new era of deadly repression.”

Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the arrests removed “the remaining veneer of democracy in the city” and would do little to achieve Beijing’s goals.

“Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,” Wang said in a statement.

Long seen as a redoubt of Western living standards and values on the edge of Communist-ruled China, Hong Kong has gradually seen many of its distinctions from the mainland diluted or erased since Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997 under a framework known as “one country, two systems.” Under that agreement, Hong Kong’s autonomy was supposed to be preserved for 50 years, until 2047.

Since the handover, the city’s economy has been overtaken by Shenzhen, the technological and industrial powerhouse across the border. Its independent courts and media are increasingly losing ground under pressure from the national security law.

And the political ferment that fueled major protest movements in 2014 and 2019 alarmed and spurred a backlash from an increasingly belligerent Beijing led by authoritarian President Xi Jinping, who saw the pro-democracy demonstrations as a challenge to Chinese sovereignty and Communist Party rule.

It remains to be seen what the incoming Biden administration will do to pressure Beijing on Hong Kong, though Antony Blinken, the nominee for secretary of State, said in a tweet that the new White House “will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing’s crackdown on democracy.”

The Trump administration has been embraced by a segment of the city’s activists, who applauded moves to sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials.

Those activists are less hopeful about the European Union, which signed a major investment deal with China last week despite withering criticism of China’s treatment of Hong Kong, its continued repression of ethnic Uighurs in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang and its use of “boycott diplomacy” to punish Australia for challenging its policies.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the mass arrests “a grievous attack on Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms.”

“These arrests demonstrate that the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities deliberately misled the world about the true purpose of the National Security Law, which is being used to crush dissent and opposing political views,” Raab said. “The U.K. will not turn our backs on the people of Hong Kong.”

To stifle opposition in the city, Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing government has purged teachers who support the democracy movement, jailed journalists and targeted the bank accounts of rights defenders. After welcoming generations of refugees from mainland China over the last century, Hong Kong is now seeing some of its own residents flee for asylum abroad. Others with means have begun immigrating to countries such as Britain to escape the reach of Chinese law.

The anti-government sentiment has been largely driven by younger generations trapped between the legacy of British colonialism and harsh Chinese rule. Many are unsure of how to chart a future in a city with less freedom, fewer jobs and housing prices growing further out of reach .

But in a sign of some of the divisions besetting this city of 7 million people, many of its older residents, especially those with closer ties to the mainland, generally agree with sections of the city’s elite who want a return to political and economic stability.

It’s unclear how China will bring millions of critically minded Hong Kongers to heel without introducing the same draconian measures found on the mainland, such as a strictly censored internet.

Sunny Cheung, a 25-year-old activist now in exile who ran successfully in the primary election, said Beijing was seizing on the U.S. presidential transition to uproot what little democracy remained in the territory.

“The Chinese Communist Party wants to use this gap to purge activists to avoid a backlash from the U.S. and the rest of the world,” he said.

Times staff writer Pierson reported from Singapore and special correspondent Cheung from Hong Kong.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden’s administration on Friday offered its full-throated support for local cities and school boards in Texas and Florida that are defying orders by their Republican governors that prohibit mask-wearing mandates in schools.

In a pair of open letters from Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, the administration condemned orders by Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida that contravene public health guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cardona also noted that federal COVID-19 relief funds for schools could be used to fill any financial gaps caused by penalties imposed by state leaders on local school districts.

“The Department stands with these dedicated educators who are working to safely reopen schools and maintain safe in-person instruction,” Cardona wrote.

Texas and Florida are experiencing some of the nation’s worst COVID-19 outbreaks, driven by the spread of the Delta variant among unvaccinated populations. The two states alone accounted for 40% of COVID-19 hospitalizations over the last week, the White House said Thursday.

Both Abbott and DeSantis have said they believe parents should decide whether their children wear masks in school. The CDC earlier this month recommended universal mask-wearing in K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status, to slow the spread of the variant.

The letters, which mark the Biden administration’s sharpest pushback to the state policies, come days after the president indicated that he did not believe he had direct authority to overturn the governors’ actions.

“I say to these governors: Please help. But if you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way,” Biden said earlier this month. “The people are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.”

Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran has said he may recommend that the state’s Board of Education withhold the salaries of the superintendent and school board members of districts that have instituted mask mandates.

Cardona wrote that “any threat by Florida to withhold salaries from superintendents and school board members who are working to protect students and educators (or to levy other financial penalties) can be addressed using (federal virus relief) funds at the sole and complete discretion of Florida school districts.”

In addition to prohibiting mask mandates, Abbott’s administration has said that schools do not need to conduct contact tracing for potential COVID-19 infections. Cardona’s letter makes clear that federal funds can also be used for contact tracing.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Oregon’s governor said Friday she will send up to 1,500 National Guard troops to hospitals around the state to assist healthcare workers who are being pushed to the brink by a surge of COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant.

Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, said the first group of 500 Guard members will be deployed Aug. 20 to serve as material and equipment runners in the most stricken hospitals and to help with COVID-19 testing, among other things. Troops will be sent to 20 hospitals around Oregon.

There were 733 people hospitalized with the virus in Oregon as of Friday, including 185 people in intensive care units — more than 60 people more than just a day before and nearly double what the number was two weeks ago.

“I cannot emphasize enough the seriousness of this crisis for all Oregonians, especially those needing emergency and intensive care,” Brown said. “When our hospitals are full with COVID-19 patients, there may not be room for someone needing care after a car crash, a heart attack or other emergency situation.”

Advertisement

The Delta variant now makes up 96% of all samples tested, up from just 15% six weeks ago, according to Oregon Health Authority data.

“The harsh and frustrating reality is that the Delta variant has changed everything,” the governor said.

Oregon, once viewed as a pandemic success story, has seen that progress slip away in recent weeks as the highly contagious Delta variant gains a foothold in counties with lower vaccination rates. The state kept an indoor mask mandate and social distancing rules in place until June 30; shut down restaurants, bars, gyms and other businesses repeatedly since March 2020; and had strict indoor capacity limits for businesses long after other states had returned to near normal.

Amid the surge, Brown has mandated masks for all students and staff, regardless of vaccination status, in K-12 schools when classes resume later this month , and a new statewide indoor mask mandate took effect Friday.

But earlier this week, hospitals warned that Oregon’s record-setting virus hospitalization numbers were pushing them to capacity and some have already had to start delaying care for non-COVID conditions. Several counties in southern Oregon, where fewer than half of eligible adults are vaccinated, are particularly hard hit.

All hospitals in Jackson and Josephine counties, in the state’s southwest corner, are at capacity, with patients on gurneys in hallways and emergency rooms overflowing. The counties teamed up to ask the state to set up a medical tent for non-COVID patients. They are awaiting a response.

“This is the worst condition our hospitals have seen, likely ever. I don’t know that anyone could recall a time where we’ve had this much pressure on our health care system,” Josephine County Public Health Manager Michael Weber told reporters Thursday.

There were 1,785 new or presumed cases statewide Friday and seven deaths. Other deaths this week included a 19-year-old woman in the state’s rural northeastern corner.

About 29% of adults in Oregon are unvaccinated and more than 102,000 vaccine doses have been thrown away due to non-use. More than 70% of eligible residents have had at least once shot, and 65% are fully vaccinated, according to state data.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the Afghan capital, Kabul, teetered in the face of a relentless onslaught by Taliban forces, the first contingents of U.S. Marines tasked with rescuing Americans and others were set to arrive in Afghanistan over the weekend, administration officials said Friday.

The urgency of the new mission was underlined by fierce Taliban advances that have startled the world as diplomats face rising regional instability and a widening humanitarian crisis.

By Friday, Taliban fighters, who are seizing U.S.-funded military equipment as they roll, seemingly unchallenged, across the landscape, had captured Afghanistan’s second- and third-largest cities and most national territory.

Advertisement

The arrival of 3,000 troops will more than double the number of U.S. forces in the battered country, after the long-promised withdrawal to end America’s longest war was scheduled to conclude by September.

Analysts said it was possible the Taliban will wait to attack Kabul — in part because of the U.S. presence, and because the Islamic extremists can probably lay siege to, isolate and starve the city by cutting off most of its land exit routes. Unlike other Afghan cities, Kabul has an enormous population, some 6 million people, and has swollen in recent days with those fleeing other parts of the country.

“We have noted with great concern the speed with which they have been moving and the lack of resistance they have faced,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Friday. He said Kabul was not in an “imminent threat environment,” but the Taliban is “clearly” trying to isolate the city.

Pentagon and State Department officials continue to insist that the U.S. Embassy is not shutting down completely, despite the fact that most employees are likely to depart, leaving only a skeleton staff. Employees are reportedly being ordered to destroy sensitive embassy files, and there are plans, not yet finalized, to move the entire embassy operation into Kabul’s fortified Hamid Karzai International Airport.

The alarming events in Afghanistan had echoes of the United States’ 15-plus years of war in Iraq. In both cases, civilian and military commanders arguably lost sight of their missions’ strategic goals and overstayed their effectiveness. In the case of Iraq, U.S. troops had to return three years after their withdrawal to fight a new enemy, Islamic State; in Afghanistan, the last soldier had yet to leave before the threat came roaring back.

The Taliban’s swift victories during the last week indicate that, like they were in Iraq, U.S. training and plans for civil freedoms and democracy are often trumped by corruption, tribal instincts at self-preservation and the outright fear Islamist militants can incite with stonings, beheadings and other cruelties.

On Friday, the Taliban snatched Logar, a small provincial capital some 30 miles outside of Kabul, the seat of power for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his government.

It was a small but significant victory in an advance that has brought more than half of Afghanistan’s provincial capitals under Taliban control; among them is Kandahar, the second-largest city and the militant group’s birthplace.

In Kabul, panic appears to have set in, with reports that high-level officials such as Vice President Amrullah Saleh have fled the country amid rumors that Ghani will resign.

“From the second half of the Trump administration to now, we have been encouraging Taliban morale and discouraging the morale of the Afghan government,” Earl Anthony Wayne, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, said in explaining the speed with which the Taliban advanced.

The Taliban was buttressed when President Trump’s envoys agreed last year to sit down in Doha, Qatar, with the group’s representatives, the first time a U.S. government had done so. But the talks cut out the Afghan government, which felt marginalized. That was underscored when one of the U.S.-Taliban agreements forced the Afghan government to release some 5,000 Taliban prisoners — many of whom are fighting today.

Aside from differing geography, the resurgence of the Taliban and the rise of Islamic State read like the same disturbing story of U.S. intervention. At its inception, the Islamic State resembled the Taliban of late. Racing through the rugged Mideast terrain in August 2014 atop weathered Toyota pickups, the Islamic militants scythed through one city, then another and another still. Whole army units — all paid for and trained by the U.S. — disintegrated.

Advertisement

Islamic State blitzed through wide swaths of Syria and Iraq, commandeering a full third of each country for what it claimed was its caliphate. And the United States, three years after its last soldier had withdrawn from Baghdad, returned to a war it thought it had left behind.

In Afghanistan, the question is if the U.S. will have the chance to leave in the first place. The Taliban, the Islamist Afghan group that the U.S. came to defeat after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, has arguably never been stronger. Its resurgence, much like that of Islamic State in 2014, has seen it take over — with astonishing ease — areas it could never have hoped to breach in the past. The Taliban now has its knife to the government’s neck.

As in Afghanistan, it was war weariness that pushed then-President Obama to withdraw from Iraq in 2011. In a ceremony to mark the departure of the last U.S. troops in December of that year, Obama said that although it wasn’t a “perfect” withdrawal, “we’re leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people.”

But by mid-2014, with Islamic State scooping up millions of dollars of materiel — Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, some 2,300 Humvees — and turning its sights to Baghdad, Obama had to justify the use of military power once more in Iraq to lead an international coalition against the militants. That campaign — though winding down — continues to this day.

In Afghanistan, the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, which the U.S. supported with a trillion dollars over two decades, has been far more jarring than the experience with their Iraqi counterparts in 2014, for whom it took three years to gather force.

In a little over a week, an Afghan government force with 300,000 soldiers on the books has ceded territory to an adversary less than a third of its size. Government soldiers have surrendered en masse, bequeathing the militants thousands of trucks, dozens of armored vehicles, antiaircraft guns, artillery and mortars, seven helicopters (seven others were destroyed) and a number of ScanEagle drones.

The approach toward Kabul triggered Biden’s decision Thursday to dispatch the 3,000 soldiers and Marines. In addition to helping to evacuate parts of the embassy, the troops will speed up the transport out of Afghanistan of interpreters who worked with American military and diplomatic missions and would risk death under the Taliban because of their U.S. affiliation.

Urgency distinguished the Afghanistan scenario today from Iraq in the 2010s.

“Panic withstanding, Islamic State did not threaten the capital” of Baghdad, said Ryan Crocker, a former ambassador to both countries. “It was pretty clear that IS would be at its full extension by Fallujah,” 40 miles west of Baghdad.

A tactic to which both governments resorted as they faced Islamic forces was to call on local militias to join in their defense. There were very different consequences. In Iraq, those militias were backed by Iran, lived on to fight another day and now menace U.S. forces still there. In Afghanistan, Ghani put out the call, and few local militias responded or were able to muster a defense.

In Iraq, 6,000 U.S. troops were eventually redeployed to dismantle the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate. Pentagon officials now say the new Afghanistan operation, which is also sending 3,000 troops to Qatar to provide backup, is limited and narrowly defined.

Kirby from the Pentagon refused to describe the new push as a combat mission.

“We’re all mindful of the perilous situation in Afghanistan and the deteriorating security situation,” Kirby said. The troops will be fully equipped, armed and have the right to attack in broadly defined self-defense, he said.

“If we need to adjust either way, left or right, we’ll do that,” he added.

But veteran diplomats and observers of the region warn of how perilous deeper involvement can be.

“We cannot let ourselves get trapped as the defenders of the capital and saviors of millions of Afghans,” Crocker said. “We’d be risking a Beirut-style situation.” He was referring to a deployment into Lebanon of U.S. Marines that stayed beyond its original mission and was attacked in 1983 by suicide bombers; 241 Marines were killed.

Others thought U.S. forces could avoid getting sucked into an unending Afghanistan morass.

“I don’t see a world in which we go back to Afghanistan,” said a retired U.S. military officer who fought in both countries. He asked for anonymity because he continues to work on policy issues with government agencies. “Iraq matters in a way that Afghanistan just doesn’t. We went back to Iraq because Iraq borders all these countries we care about” — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Turkey — “and I don’t think we care very much about Pakistan or Iran, at least in a positive sense.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Good evening. I’m Karen Kaplan, and it’s Friday, Aug. 13. Here’s the latest on what’s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.

Newsletter Get our free Coronavirus Today newsletter Sign up for the latest news, best stories and what they mean for you, plus answers to your questions. Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.

You can grumble about the fact that even fully vaccinated people are being asked — and in some cases required — to wear masks indoors again as the Delta variant runs amok across California. But it’s getting harder to deny that those masks are making a difference.

Experts are pointing to indoor mask mandates like the one in Los Angeles County as a major reason why the Golden State has managed to avoid the sky-high coronavirus infection rates and increasingly overcrowded hospitals seen in other parts of the country.

Advertisement

Our better-than-average vaccination rates have offered protection too. More than 63% of Californians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 54.7% are fully vaccinated, according to our vaccine tracker. Nationwide, 59.2% of Americans are at least partially vaccinated and 50.4% are fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.

But mask policies are interesting because there’s such a clear difference between California’s approach and those of Texas and Florida, which rank right behind us in terms of population.

It’s been a little more than two weeks since state health officials recommended that fully vaccinated people resume wearing masks in indoor public settings. L.A. County’s universal indoor mask mandate is nearly a month old, and it’s been copied by other counties, including Santa Barbara, Sacramento and much of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, on the other hand, are not only opposed to statewide mask mandates, they don’t want local governments in their states to implement them for themselves.

(You may recall that DeSantis threatened to have his state’s Board of Education withhold the salary of a school superintendent in Tallahassee if he imposed a mask mandate for students. Nonetheless, some school districts in Florida are proceeding with them, as are several in Texas.)

My colleagues Rong-Gong Lin II and Luke Money looked into how those differing approaches are playing out in terms of each state’s COVID-19 caseload. The differences they found are striking.

Over a seven-day period that ended this week, California reported 141.1 new coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents. That’s less than half the rate for Texas, which had 297.8 new cases per 100,000 residents during that time.

And Texas looks like a paragon of health compared to Florida, where there were 653.8 new coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents in those same seven days. All of those figures come from the CDC.

Advertisement

We shouldn’t get bent out of shape about every single infection, but what about the more serious cases of COVID-19 that cause patients to seek hospital care?

Over the course of the week, California reported an average of 772 new hospital admissions per day. In the same week, Texas averaged 1,403 new COVID-19 hospitalizations per day and Florida averaged 2,071.

For a little more evidence that mask mandates are helping, consider this: During the first week of August, L.A. County reported 20,979 new coronavirus cases. That represented a 6.5% increase from the previous week — higher to be sure, but in terms of growth it was better than the 22% increase the week before.

Advertisement

The 6.5% figure also looks good when you consider that the number of new coronavirus cases throughout the state was 20% higher during the first week of August than during the last week of July — and the number for the last week of July was 57% higher than the week before.

Of course, it’s far too soon to conclude how much — if any — of the credit should go to mask mandates. Researchers will have to work to disentangle their effects from those of vaccines, past infections, testing programs, school reopenings and other factors. That will take time.

It’s also possible that the divergence in mask policies and coronavirus outcomes is a pure coincidence. As scientists often say, correlation does not imply causation.

Still, I’d rather be in California than Texas, where hospitals are being asked to postpone elective medical procedures. Dr. Natasha Kathuria, an emergency room physician in Austin who has sent patients home because she didn’t have the bandwidth to treat them, said she hears from colleagues in her native Florida that conditions there are even even worse. She’s worried that Texas will soon be following in Florida’s footsteps.

“This is disaster medicine,” Kathuria said. “We’ve never felt this disheartened during the pandemic.”

What Native Americans can teach us about COVID-19 vaccines

Vaccine hesitancy is a problem throughout the country — after all, more than 40% of Americans who are old enough for the COVID-19 shots still aren’t fully vaccinated — but if you had to pick a group of people for whom the shots would be a tough sell, Native Americans might be high on your list.

They’ve got legitimate reason to be wary of anything the government says is good for them. On top of that, they’re often far from hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and nearly 1 in 4 live in poverty — a higher proportion than any other racial or ethnic group in the U.S.

Reasons like this had health experts bracing themselves for some hard work. Even some tribal leaders had low expectations.

“There is going to be pushback to this vaccine,” Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation, predicted in December.

Advertisement

But once again, the pandemic threw them a curve, albeit a welcome one: It turns out Native Americans have the highest COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country.

More than 100 million Americans provided their race or ethnicity when they got their shots. That data suggests that Native Americans are 24% more likely than whites, 31% more likely than Latinos, 64% more likely than Black Americans and 11% more likely than Asian Americans to be fully vaccinated.

How did they do it? My colleague Richard Read visited the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana to find out.

One of the keys to success was the recognition by tribal leaders that vaccines offered the clearest, safest path out of the pandemic. And they framed vaccination as a way to protect tribal elders, who were particularly vulnerable to serious cases of COVID-19 due to their high rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity. (In doing so, they seem to have headed off the conspiracy theories and other forms of vaccine misinformation that took off elsewhere.)

The messages were spread via social media and on the radio. To motivate people, tribes reminded people that COVID-19 had killed Native Americans at a rate 2.4 times higher than for white Americans.

“You’ve got to have armor, and the armor is the vaccine,” Nez said.

That message was received. In a poll of Native Americans, 75% said they would get vaccinated, and that their primary motivation was “a strong sense of responsibility to protect the Native community and preserve cultural ways.”

Advertisement

Tribal health workers pushed hard as soon as the vaccine became available, and they were able to set their own priorities for administering the shots. At Fort Belknap, health workers got them first, followed by essential workers and elders. They also prioritized teachers and other workers at schools attended by Native children — a fortuitous decision, since staffers were partially vaccinated when one of the schools had a sizable outbreak in January.

Tribal leaders got the shots early, to bolster confidence in the vaccine and demonstrate that it was safe.

Now, among the 3,500 people served by the Indian Health Service at Fort Belknap who are old enough to get a vaccine, 67% are fully immunized. That compares with a mere 40% in neighboring Phillips County and 59% for the country as a whole.

The country’s largest tribe, the Navajo Nation, says that more than 70% of its vaccine-eligible members are fully vaccinated.

Advertisement

“This has been just a tremendous effort across all of Indian Country to take care of our people,” said Dr. Loretta Christensen, a member of the Navajo Nation and the chief medical officer of the federal Indian Health Service.

Hopefully, public health leaders elsewhere will learn from that success, said Latoya Hill, a senior analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

“I think it can serve as a model for broader vaccination efforts across the country,” she said.

Students returned to school this week, and in California, that meant wearing masks on campus. By and large, kids have dealt with the face coverings just fine. But the same can’t be said for all their parents.

Advertisement

Dozens of parents gathered in downtown Chino this week, waving signs demanding to “Unmask our kids” and “Let them breathe.” In Amador County, east of Sacramento, one parent allegedly assaulted a teacher over the face-covering rule.

K-12 students can be exempted from the statewide mask mandate if they have legitimate medical, mental health or accessibility reasons. But some parents are concerned that masks will hinder their children’s social growth, or cause them to overheat. Some object to the mandate on principle.

“It’s about respect, and it’s about a parent’s right to choose what’s right for their kids,” one woman told KTLA.

Torie Gibson, superintendent of the Amador County Unified School District, said the parents she serves were polarized over masks.

Advertisement

“There’s just no middle ground: Either people are super supportive of it and have no issues with it, or they’re completely, adamantly against it,” Gibson told my colleague Hayley Smith.

The backlash isn’t limited to California. A mask mandate for Las Vegas-area schools prompted a lawsuit from attorneys seeking class-action status. They claim the mandate violates the constitutional rights of thousands of parents and children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly endorses universal masking in schools, especially since students under 12 are not yet eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The AAP noted that the number of new coronavirus infections in children nationwide increased last week to 94,000, more than double the number from two weeks earlier.

Teachers and other employees of the L.A. Unified School District will be subject to another mandate. Interim Supt. Megan Reilly said Friday that workers in the nation’s second-largest school system must be vaccinated by Oct. 15.

The vaccine mandate is intended to reassure parents that their children will be safe on campus. It was endorsed by United Teachers Los Angeles, the union representing more than 30,000 teachers, nurses, counselors and librarians. A similar vaccine mandate was approved earlier in the week by the board of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District.

The L.A. City Council moved closer to implementing a vaccine mandate of its own. Members voted Wednesday to have city attorneys draft a law that would require people to have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine before entering an indoor restaurant, bar, gym, shop, movie theater or other venue.

Many details of the proposed law have yet to be worked out, including exactly where it would apply and how it would be enforced. Once decided, the rules would go back to the City Council for a final vote. L.A. previously said it would require city employees to either provide proof of vaccination or submit to weekly testing.

San Francisco is moving ahead with a vaccine mandate of its own. Beginning Aug. 20, patrons of gyms, restaurants, bars and other indoor venues will need to present proof that they’re fully vaccinated before they can enter. Employees will also be subject to the mandate, effective Oct. 13.

A negative coronavirus test result will not be an acceptable alternative under the policy announced Thursday by Mayor London Breed.

“We know that for our city to bounce back from the pandemic and thrive, we need to use the best method we have to fight COVID-19, and that’s vaccines,” she said, adding that the mandate has the support of the city’s business community.

On the national front, the CDC urged pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The new advice was prompted in part by safety data revealing that the miscarriage rate for women who received at least one dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was around 13%, which is within the normal range.

Only about 23% of pregnant women have been vaccinated, according to the CDC, even though such women run a higher risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications if they come down with COVID-19. The agency had previously encouraged pregnant women to consider vaccinations but stopped short of a full recommendation.

The new vaccination advice also applies to women who intend to become pregnant and to nursing mothers. It echoes the guidance from top obstetrician groups.

Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that transplant recipients and other people with severely weakened immune systems can get a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. The decision affects several million Americans, and is in line with policies in France, Israel and several other countries.

People whose immune systems are suppressed by medications and diseases have a harder time responding to vaccines, and small studies have suggested that an extra dose can help. The FDA said qualified people can receive a third dose at least 28 days after their second shot.

There was no mention of immune-compromised patients who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Some scientists are pushing back on claims made by Pfizer about the value of booster doses of its vaccine. The company said it would seek FDA authorization for booster shots, but it has not yet delivered conclusive proof to confirm that they will help, especially against the Delta variant.

The pharmaceutical industry’s rush to recommend boosters is “a little frustrating,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Even if boosters are safe, he said, the U.S. effort should still focus on “vaccinating people who are unvaccinated.”

Dr. Sadiya Khan, an epidemiologist and cardiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, agreed. She said the drive to deliver booster shots is premature while the virus is still circulating among millions of unvaccinated people — the ones responsible for “the overwhelming majority” of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.

“Giving up on that greater strategy of vaccinating the population is going to lead to continued surges,” Khan said. “The potential for harm is quite large.”

And here’s something that’s unlikely to ever happen here: Australia’s capital city began a weeklong lockdown Thursday after a man — just one — was found to be infected with the coronavirus.

Officials don’t know how the Canberra man became infected, but the virus was detected in the city’s wastewater. It was the first locally acquired case since July 10 of last year.

As a result, Canberra retail stores are closed, residents can leave their homes only for essential reasons, and restaurants can only fill orders for takeout. Melbourne, Sydney and several other Australian cities are also in lockdown due to the Delta variant.

Both the CDC and the L.A. County Department of Public Health recommend a “layered” approach to safety. That means relying on a variety of measures instead of counting on a single silver bullet. These layers include:

Face masks. California has implemented a universal mask mandate for all K-12 students while they’re indoors. Exceptions will be rare and hard to get. Some districts, including L.A. Unified, also require masks outdoors.

The pandemic in pictures

(Stacey Plaisance/Associated Press)

This photo of a COVID-19 patient walking across her hospital room with the help of a physical therapist feels like a throwback to an earlier time in the pandemic when hospitals were overwhelmed with coronavirus victims. Unfortunately, it was taken this week at a medical center in Louisiana, where patients are once again so plentiful that a doctor who normally treats people with epilepsy has been pressed into service changing sheets, emptying trash cans and wheeling patients to the radiology department.

Dr. Robin Davis comes in on her days off so that overworked nurses can get a little relief. And boy do they need it: Dozens of rooms in the intensive care unit alone are occupied by pallid COVID-19 patients hooked up to ventilators and beeping machines. In some parts of the state, people seeking treatment for heart attacks and strokes are being turned away from hospitals.

A year ago, Davis felt helpless as she watched friends and neighbors die. This time she’s frustrated because so many of these illnesses could have been averted with vaccines. Only slightly more than 37% of Louisiana residents are fully inoculated.

The earlier waves of victims “were people that didn’t have a chance,” Davis said. “There was nothing we could do to stop this for them. You’ve got a chance now. You have something that gives you the opportunity to have a fate that isn’t like theirs. Please don’t squander it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Florida’s health officials say the number of COVID-19 deaths jumped significantly from 600, reported in the previous week, to more than 1,000 this week.

The new deaths tallied by the Florida Department of Health raise the total COVID-19 death toll to 40,766. Last summer, the state reported seven-day averages of about 185 deaths per day, whereas the average Friday stood at 153. But the state continues to lead the country in rate of hospitalizations.

Florida has about 89 adult patients with COVID-19 per 100,000 people. Hospitalizations rose slightly Friday from 15,358 to 15,441 patients, including about 3,200 patients who are in intensive care units. In its weekly report, the state had an average 21,680 new cases per day in the past seven days, continuing to reach all-time highs as it has in the last two weeks.

In Broward County, officials said the hospital beds for adult ICU patients were filled near capacity while their pediatric ICU beds were entirely full. Many of Florida’s hospitals can convert spaces like conference rooms and ambulatory centers into COVID units.

Mary Mayhew, president and CEO of the Florida Hospital Assn., said hospitals were using other spaces such as cafeterias.

“Between increasing numbers of COVID patients and unusually high patient volume of extremely ill non-COVID patients, our hospitals are working to maximize their available staff and beds,” Mayhew said in a statement.

Some officials worry the surge of cases fueled by the Delta variant is happening as children return to school for the fall semester, most without a mandatory mask policy. Various school districts have already reported cases among students and staff, and although they were probably infected before classes resumed, officials have placed some under quarantine.

In Palm Beach County, officials said they ended the second day of classes with 440 students sent home to quarantine. As of Friday afternoon, the school district had reported 134 cases, of which 108 were students and 26 employees.

In Broward County, where classes have not started, two elementary school teachers and a teacher assistant, all in their late 40s, died from COVID-19 in a 24-hour span earlier this week, the teachers union said in an emailed statement. The three were unvaccinated.

Union President Anna Fusco had previously told WFOR-TV in Miami on Thursday that it was four teachers, but the union later said the fourth death was a Broward County Public Schools graduate with close ties to the school district through her job.

School superintendents have pleaded with Gov. Ron DeSantis to allow them to adopt clear mask requirements that follow guidelines set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending masks be worn indoors at schools nationwide.

World & Nation Texas seeks out-of-state medical help amid COVID-19 crisis Gov. Greg Abbott directs agencies to find additional medical staff and he requests that hospitals postpone elective procedures as the Delta variant overwhelms hospitals statewide. But his ban on mask mandates remains in place.

The Republican governor has issued orders to block school mask mandates, saying school districts should allow parents to opt out if they don’t want their children to wear masks in classrooms. A Florida judge gave DeSantis until Monday to defend his attempts to block mandatory school mask policies against a lawsuit by parents of several school districts.

Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper ordered the state to file a motion to dismiss a complaint that argues the governor’s orders and ensuing rules are violating the Florida Constitution by not offering a safe education as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have been rising since July.

The lawsuit also says the state constitution grants power solely to local school boards to operate, control and supervise classes within their districts. The parents maintain that while it may be safe to operate schools in some areas of the state without masks, it is not safe to do so in “crisis” areas of Florida, which includes Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, St. Petersburg, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Miami.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Taliban’s dramatic recapture early Friday of Kandahar — the group’s birthplace and onetime redoubt of its late spiritual leader Mullah Mohammed Omar — marks a full-circle moment in the long Afghan conflict, a dizzying, dust-colored rewind of history.

Kandahar was the lodestar, the center of gravity for the Taliban until December 2001, when U.S. special forces — the tip of the American spear wielded after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 — chased Omar and his followers out of the southern province’s terrain of pomegranate and apricot orchards and homes of sun-dried brick. The loss of Kandahar — more than the Taliban’s ejection a month earlier from the nation’s capital, Kabul — marked the true end of the group’s harsh five-year rule over Afghanistan.

Now, the insurgents’ newly regained control of Afghanistan’s second-largest city and the ethnic Pashtun heartland surrounding it will provide a glimpse — likely a grim one — of how the militant movement envisions its abruptly reprised role of conqueror.

Eight astonishing days have seen the Taliban seize half of Afghanistan’s provincial capitals, with its fighters drawing a tightening net around Kabul. The juddering velocity of events has left the U.S. and its Western allies scrambling to preserve a diplomatic presence, in part to address the humanitarian crisis spawned by the Taliban takeover of most of the country’s north, south and west.

Kandahar was emblematic of a nation the U.S. never fully understood and never came close to taming. And as Afghan soldiers beat hasty retreats and America prepares to formalize its own troops’ departure, the city’s more than 600,000 inhabitants are preparing for what many expect will be a return to a cruelly constricted way of life — one that children are too young to remember and that some adults remember all too well.

“We are certainly concerned by the speed with which the Taliban has been moving,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Friday — an understated way of characterizing the movement’s unrelenting march, which has sown fear among millions of Afghans and astonished a watching world.

In many ways, though, the current Taliban onslaught has been reminiscent of the campaign that first propelled the group to power: slow, then sudden.

Back then, in the early 1990s, the movement’s origin story unfolded gradually in the rural districts surrounding Kandahar. Clusters of devout young talibs, or students, began to coalesce around Omar, an austere cleric who had won a loyal following with storied military exploits against the Soviets — one of which cost him an eye.

In the late fall and early winter of 1994, the group emerged from the countryside and seized Kandahar, imposing an unyielding brand of Islam that was initially welcomed by a population disgusted by the wanton excesses of local warlords.

By September 1996, Kabul had fallen to the militants.

In Kandahar, the once-obscure cleric relished the trappings of power. A few months before the takeover of Kabul, Omar had ensconced himself as the “emir of the faithful,” brandishing a sacred relic — a cloak purportedly worn by the prophet Muhammed — as a symbol of his divine mandate. Fatefully, he had accepted the allegiance and patronage of Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda chieftain who proceeded to set up shop in Kandahar, establishing training camps and moving his family to the city.

As the Taliban’s spiritual home, Kandahar had the first taste of the baroque punishments the group imposed on all Afghans: whippings, stonings, the near-extinction of women’s role in public life. But as Taliban rule went on, the world’s eyes were drawn to the group’s depredations elsewhere: the March 2001 destruction of the monumental Buddhas of Bamiyan, stadium executions in Kabul, a fundamentalist-minded theocracy that forbade music.

In the first years following the U.S.-led invasion, American troops were the face of the new order in Kandahar. Elite U.S. forces took up residence in Omar’s tiled, chandeliered palace on the outskirts of the city. Kandahar Airfield, the sprawling base through which tens of thousands of coalition troops passed, sprouted fast-food outlets, souvenir shops and even a hockey rink.

The Taliban had never gone far, though. After the loss of Kandahar, the movement’s military leadership regrouped, unmolested, in Quetta, Pakistan, on the other side of the mountain frontier. Wounded Taliban members were treated in Pakistani hospitals; Pakistani madrasas, or religious seminaries, schooled boys in the virtues of jihad.

Omar retained command but remained resolutely out of sight; his death in 2013 — of natural causes, the Taliban insisted — was not formally confirmed by the Afghan government until 2015. His eldest son, Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, is now part of the group’s leadership structure.

In 2006, Canadian coalition partners took over primary security responsibility for Kandahar, coming under near-constant attacks by the Taliban, including firefights in outlying districts. Kandahar bustled and boomed, but journalists who visited the city during those years were keenly aware of the watching eyes of Taliban loyalists. By 2008, Taliban fighters were routinely staging bold and bloody strikes inside Kandahar.

That triggered renewed U.S. engagement in the Pashtun heartland, including areas north of Kandahar. A major American military offensive was launched in 2010 in Marja, to the west of Kandahar in Helmand province. American air power was a crucial underpinning of missions by NATO and Afghan troops.

Although Kandahar retained its conservative character, with women often wearing the all-enveloping burqa in public, the two-decade span of the U.S. military mission brought a generational shift in women’s aspirations — perhaps the biggest social change experienced in the city.

Girls attended school, albeit with more community resistance than in more cosmopolitan centers like Kabul. Women could sometimes work outside the home, with some building long careers in government ministries, hospitals and Western-supported organizations that encouraged efforts like women’s entrepreneurship and access to healthcare.

Those hard-won hopes were dashed with heartbreaking speed. Many in Kandahar had worried for years about the depth of the U.S. commitment. Those fears deepened with the February 2020 deal signed in Doha, Qatar, by the Trump administration and the Taliban, which laid out the planned pullback of American troops but also called for talks among Afghan actors in crafting a political blueprint for the country’s future.

Word from the Biden White House that the U.S. military presence would formally end at the end of August — soon before the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks — was met with consternation among Kandaharis who had in some way tied their fate to the Afghan government, or to the West. They wrote frantically to friends and former associates in the United States, wondering whether they could leave the city, or even the country.

But it all happened so fast, as if a prophecy awaiting fulfillment. News reports and social media documented the Taliban entering the city center and occupying government buildings while Afghan forces staged a panicked retreat, some screeching out of town in American-bought military vehicles.

Pashtana Durrani, the executive director of a nongovernmental organization that promotes girls’ education, spoke despairingly to Britain’s Channel 4 on Thursday, as the city was falling. She feared for her life, she said, because the visibility of her role made her a target.

Durrani agonized about whether some of the bright young students she had mentored would be forcibly married off to Taliban fighters. In a video clip of her remarks that circulated on social media, her voice and eyes were like those of a person watching a loved one die.

“The girls we work with have already fled — I don’t know where the students are,” she said. “The Kandahar that I knew, the child[hood] life that I lived ... it’s for nothing. Everything for nothing.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mexico’s president is on a drive to persuade people to send their kids back to school in September, and on Friday the government released some frightening figures on what the effects of the pandemic have been on schoolchildren.

The Interior Department says a total of 5.2 million students under 18 did not register for classes last year, and that domestic violence increased 24% in the first quarter of 2021, compared with the same period of 2020, before the pandemic gained force.

The department also cited increases in child homicides and teen pregnancies, rises that presumably resulted in part from kids not being at school. The broader effects of the pandemic — cancellation of activities, social distancing and economic pressures — may have also played a role.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador says children need to be back in physical classrooms for social development as much as academic reasons.

But given that Mexico is experiencing its highest surge to date in coronavirus infections — but not hospitalizations — many parents are loath to send their kids back to classes.

The high dropout rate during the pandemic may be due to the fact that many parents in Mexico did not see much value in enrolling their kids in online classes, which have been the only option available in most states since schools closed.

Not only is internet coverage spotty in Mexico; parents say it is hard to keep kids focused on online classes. In addition, most Mexicans who can afford it send their kids to private schools and tuition fees didn’t seem worth it for online classes.

Mexico has suffered almost 247,000 test-confirmed deaths, but because so little testing is done, official figures suggest the real toll is closer to 370,000.

Mexico has now vaccinated about 59% of adults with at least one dose, but only about half of them are fully vaccinated.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As Afghanistan’s provincial capitals fell in astonishingly rapid order to the Taliban this week, President Biden made it clear he has no regrets for withdrawing American forces from the country after two decades. A politician known for his deep reserve of empathy, Biden has offered surprisingly little solace to the Afghan people: “They’ve got to fight for themselves,” he said Tuesday.

There is no doubt that Biden’s decision is rooted in deep personal conviction — and a calculation that Americans no longer see a rationale for continuing “the forever war” to stabilize Afghanistan’s fledgling democracy. Nevertheless, ending the two-decade U.S. campaign has allowed the Taliban to reassert its power with an onslaught far more swift than what Biden predicted just last month — a devastating denouement that could put the president in political peril.

“This is not going to end well,” said Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator and a Defense secretary under President Obama. He praised Biden’s “courage” for making a firm decision, calling it “the right thing to do,” but predicted there would be political consequences.

“Very likely Kabul will fall and he will be seen, moving right into the next election, as the president who wasted 20 years, pulled Americans out and lost Afghanistan,” Hagel said.

Biden has long argued for bringing the conflict to an end, an exit that eluded his predecessors. When he took office, the U.S. military presence had been scaled back to around 3,500 troops.

Biden announced in April that he would withdraw the remaining U.S. forces by Sept. 11 — the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which Al Qaeda planned from Afghanistan. To generals’ earlier warnings that a rapid withdrawal would allow the Taliban to gain ground, Biden said the time had come to reorient America’s defense priorities toward more urgent threats.

“We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago,” he said at the time. “That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021.”

While numerous Republicans in Congress are already criticizing Biden over the withdrawal, it remains unclear how much of the American public is concerned about the fate of Afghanistan or even paying attention to news of the Taliban’s steady overtaking of the government the U.S. has spent more than $2 trillion shoring up over the last two decades.

Seven in 10 Americans back Biden’s decision to withdraw, according to a July poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, including 77% of Democrats and 56% of Republicans.

“An overwhelming majority of Americans think this is the right idea, and that’s what politics is all about,” said Ivo Daalder, Obama’s former ambassador to NATO. “If the answer is $2 trillion, 20 years only to see it fall in two weeks, I don’t see the American people saying that’s a good deal, let’s do it all over again.”

Recent polling has also revealed new public skepticism about the origins of the war launched by President George W. Bush. Now a growing number of Democrats and independents have come to view the war itself, long seen as defensible in comparison with the conflict in Iraq, as a mistake.

“That’s a big reason why I would not expect this decision [to withdraw], even with the visuals of the Taliban taking over, to have a big effect on Biden’s approval rating,” said Frank Newport, a senior pollster at Gallup.

Recent surveys also show that people in the U.S. are primarily concerned about the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and the economy. Roughly half the country, polls have shown, doesn’t follow any news about Afghanistan.

But until now, Afghanistan was rarely in the news. In recent weeks, coverage of a deteriorating situation has ramped up as the departure of U.S. forces has allowed the Taliban to capture vast terrain. On Thursday, the Pentagon announced it was sending some 3,000 troops — about the same number as the U.S. was withdrawing — to help remove U.S. Embassy personnel from Kabul.

That’s drawn comparisons to the helicopter rescue of Americans from the embassy in Saigon, undermining Biden’s assertion last month that the situation in Afghanistan was “not at all comparable” to the U.S. exit from Vietnam in 1975. “There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of [an] embassy,” he said. “The likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.”

Many Afghans fear imprisonment or execution by the Taliban, an Islamist group that ruled brutally in the 1990s; women in particular have said they fear a return to repression, and tens of thousands who aided U.S. forces as interpreters or contractors are especially vulnerable to violent retribution. Human rights groups say they are already getting reports of Taliban atrocities.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the ranking GOP member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Biden and the State Department were painting a “rosier picture” of the reality than the intelligence community was relating. “President Biden’s lack of leadership has enabled the deteriorating situation on the ground in Afghanistan,” McCaul said. “He will be abandoning our Afghan partners and the women of Afghanistan to be slaughtered — and he will own the horrific images that come from it.”

Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) has requested a full House briefing on Afghanistan when the House returns to session Aug. 23. The politics of Afghanistan don’t align with the usual partisan divide, splitting Democrats and Republicans. Both parties, of course, have had presidents who continued the war.

For months, Biden’s advisors insisted they were bound by the February 2020 agreement that the Trump administration signed with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar. Under President Trump, the U.S. agreed to begin withdrawing its troops by May of this year if the Taliban agreed not to attack them.

Although many other elements of that pact were routinely violated by the Taliban, Biden insisted on sticking by the one point that he instinctually and politically favored: bringing Americans home.

But critics said the agreement was fatally flawed from the beginning because it excluded the Afghan government. That in turn demoralized Kabul and its armed forces, and gave long-desired legitimacy to the Taliban. It began a long disintegration of the Afghan government’s ability and willingness to fight and emboldened the Taliban, analysts said.

Biden’s contention that a deal made with a group like the Taliban by a previous administration had to be respected was “worse than disingenuous,” said Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries.

“From the day we sat down with the Taliban, this deal wasn’t about peace. It was about surrender, American surrender, and the complete delegitimization of the Afghan government and army,” Crocker said.

Yet Biden also risked a new round of American casualties — something avoided in more than a year in Afghanistan — if he had backed out of Trump’s bargain. More than 2,400 U.S. troops and over 3,800 security contractors were killed in the war and more than 20,000 service members injured. Afghans have paid a far higher toll.

Biden “was dealt a terrible hand, and he made it worse,” Crocker said.

Now the message “will ping around the world” that the “righteous arms of the faithful” — as Taliban militants cast themselves — have driven American forces from Afghanistan, he said.

Former Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, an ex-Republican who is now a Libertarian, tweeted Friday that Taliban gains “underscore the futility of permanent occupation. The United States wasn’t able to meaningfully shape circumstances through 20 years of war. We’d have seen the same results had we pulled out 15 years ago or 15 years from now.”

Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, retweeted Amash’s statement, one of the administration’s few public acknowledgments of Afghanistan on Friday. The White House later Friday tweeted a photo of Biden at Camp David being briefed on Afghanistan by phone.

The increasingly harrowing reality of Afghanistan will play out just as Democrats are straining in the weeks ahead to advance Biden’s domestic agenda, a $1-trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5-trillion budget that would amount to a dramatic expansion of the social safety net. Beyond Washington, an ugly withdrawal from Afghanistan could undermine Biden’s attempt to convince U.S. allies that “America is back” as a global leader.

One former U.S. diplomat in the region, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Biden often recalls to people how he recognized on his numerous visits to Afghanistan as vice president that top military officials had overstated the strength of the country’s democratic regime.

“He knew the military was overpromising and underdelivering,” the former diplomat said. “He saw through the military always asking for ‘a little more time’ — and it’s clear as these provincial capitals fall like dominoes, that another five years wouldn’t have solved the problem.”

Advertisement

But, the diplomat continued: “Even if you’re right, that doesn’t change the ugliness of it all. And even if it’s not a big political loss, around the world people will look at it as a sign of: ‘Don’t rely on America.’”

With peace talks in Doha not expected to produce meaningful results, several former officials and experts said the only solution may be a massive United Nations-led humanitarian intervention that would include peacekeepers and guarded enclaves where Afghans could shelter from the Taliban. But any such mission would have to be led by an international coalition, not the U.S., they said.

The United States “can be involved but not leading it,” said Earl Anthony Wayne, a former career U.S. diplomat who was stationed in Afghanistan. “We’re tainted goods.”

But many are willing to live with whatever complications arise from Biden doing what his predecessors over 20 years have not.

Gil Barndollar, who was deployed twice in Afghanistan and is now a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a group that supports withdrawal, said that there was plenty of blame to go around in explaining the swift advance of the Taliban but that withdrawal was long overdue.

“You can quibble with pieces” of how the U.S. withdrawal has occurred, he said, but “a healthy majority of Americans agree that the war is already lost, and at some point you have to rip the Band-Aid off.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Earth sizzled in July and became the hottest month in 142 years of recordkeeping, U.S. weather officials announced Friday.

As extreme heat waves struck parts of the United States and Europe, the globe averaged 62.07 degrees Fahrenheit (16.73 degrees Celsius) last month, beating the previous record set in July 2016 and tied again in 2019 and 2020, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The margin was just .02 degrees (.01 Celsius).

The last seven Julys, from 2015 to 2021, have been the hottest seven Julys on record, said NOAA climatologist Ahira Sanchez-Lugo. Last month was 1.67 degrees (0.93 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th century average for the month.

“In this case first place is the worst place to be,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. “This new record adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe.”

“This is climate change,” said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann. “It is an exclamation mark on a summer of unprecedented heat, drought, wildfires and flooding.”

Earlier this week, a prestigious United Nations science panel warned of worsening climate change caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and other human activity.

Warming on land in western North America and in parts of Europe and Asia really drove the record-setting heat, Sanchez-Lugo said. While the worldwide temperature was barely higher than the record, what shattered it was land temperature over the Northern Hemisphere, she said.

Northern Hemisphere temperatures were a third of a degree (0.19 degrees Celsius) higher than the previous record set in July 2012. For temperature records, that’s “a wide margin,” Sanchez-Lugo said.

July is the hottest month of the year for the globe, so this is also the hottest month on record.

One factor helping the world bake this summer is a natural weather cycle called the Arctic Oscillation. It’s sort of a cousin to El Niño, and in its positive phase, it’s associated with more warming, the NOAA climatologist said.

Even with a scorching July and a nasty June, this year so far is only the sixth warmest on record. That’s mostly because 2021 started out cooler due to a La Niña cooling of the central Pacific that often reduces the global temperature average, Sanchez-Lugo said.

“One month by itself does not say much, but that this was a La Niña year and we still had the warmest temperatures on record ... fits with the pattern of what we have been seeing for most of the last decade now,” said University of Illinois meteorology professor Donald Wuebbles.

The world set a record in July, but the United States only tied for its 13th hottest July on record.

Even though California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington had their hottest Julys, slightly cooler than normal months in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Alabama, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire kept the nation from approaching record heat levels.

The last time the globe had a July cooler than the 20th century average was in 1976, which was also the last year the globe was cooler than that normal.

“So if you’re younger than 45 you haven’t seen a year (or July) where the mean temperature of the planet was cooler than the 20th century average,” said Princeton University climate scientist Gabriel Vecchi.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nicaraguan police raided the offices of the storied opposition newspaper La Prensa on Friday.

The National Police said in a statement the raid was part of an investigation into “customs fraud and money laundering.” It said the newspaper’s offices “remain under police custody.”

The raid came one day after La Prensa suspended its print edition because the government’s customs office had once again withheld newsprint paper.

La Prensa, founded in 1926, has been critical of President Daniel Ortega, who has also recently arrested dozens of opposition figures. Ortega’s government has often leveled accusations of money laundering, tax fraud and other charges to raid nongovernmental and civic groups it disagrees with.

La Prensa had said it would continue an online edition, but it was unclear how long it could continue to do so. La Prensa has been the country’s only newspaper with a print edition since another opposition paper, El Nuevo Diario, closed in 2019.

On Thursday, La Prensa said in an editorial, “Once again the Ortega-Murillo dictatorship has withheld our paper,” referring to the president and his wife and vice president, Rosario Murillo. “Until they release the raw material, we cannot continue with the print edition,” the newspaper said. The move also affects its sister paper Hoy.

The move marks the third time the government has withheld the newspaper’s paper or ink. The paper had ceased printing for about 500 days in 2018 and 2019 amid widespread protests against the government.

Nicaragua is scheduled to hold national elections Nov. 7, and Ortega is seeking a fourth consecutive term. He placed an opposition vice presidential candidate under house arrest last week, then released her pending the outcome of an investigation.

Over the last two months, Ortega’s government has arrested nearly three dozen opposition figures, including seven potential challengers for the presidency.

On Monday in Managua, the opposition alliance National Coalition said in a statement that it did not recognize the current electoral process as a way out of Nicaragua’s political crisis and urged Nicaraguans not to recognize it either.

Later Monday, authorities announced the arrest of opposition leader Mauricio Díaz Dávila, a candidate for congress and a former ambassador to Costa Rica. He had been called to the attorney general’s office on Monday as part of an investigation for alleged acts against the state.

His political party, Citizens for Liberty, said he was arrested with violence. His ability to run for office had been canceled by the electoral court three days earlier. Party President Kitty Monterrey, whose Nicaraguan citizenship was withdrawn last week, called for his immediate release.

Murillo also announced Monday that the government had recalled its ambassadors from Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Costa Rica “in reciprocity” for steps taken by those governments. She declared recent criticism from those governments as “interfering and interventionist.”

Argentina and Mexico had offered to try to mediate negotiations between the government and opposition, but that offer was rejected by Ortega. Costa Rica and Colombia had condemned Ortega’s government for recent actions against the opposition.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The death toll from floods and mudslides in northern Turkey rose to at least 38 on Friday, officials said, as emergency crews searched collapsed buildings, swamped homes and submerged basements for more victims and survivors. An opposition politician said more than 300 people may be unaccounted for.

Torrential rains that pounded the Black Sea coastal provinces of Bartin, Kastamonu, Sinop and Samsun on Wednesday caused the flooding that demolished homes and bridges and swept away cars. More than 1,700 people were evacuated across the region, some lifted from rooftops by helicopters, and many were being temporarily housed in student dormitories.

Health Minister Fahrettin Koca announced on Twitter late Friday that 32 people died in Kastamonu and six in Sinop.

In Kastamonu, a stream burst its banks and inundated the town of Bozkurt. Raging floodwaters demolished one waterfront building and severely damaged two neighboring buildings. A number of bodies washed up on the Black Sea shore, Halk TV reported, airing footage of people carrying a body bag on a beach in an unidentified province.

The floods struck on the heels of wildfires in southern Turkey that devastated forest lands in the seaside provinces of Mugla and Antalya that are popular with tourists. At least eight people died and thousands of residents were forced to flee.

Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms. Such calamities are expected to happen more frequently as the planet warms.

Hasan Baltaci, an opposition party lawmaker who represents Kastamonu, told Halk TV that residents had contacted Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, seeking information about 329 people feared missing. He cautioned that some of the names could be duplicates and that others could be of people who were unable to contact loved ones.

The missing include 12-year-old twin sisters and their grandparents, who were trapped inside the eight-story building that collapsed in Bozkurt. Emergency crews were seen sifting through the rubble searching for survivors.

The girls’ mother, Arzu Yucel, told the DHA news agency that she had left the apartment building after authorities advised residents to move their vehicles to higher ground. When she returned, water surrounded the building and prevented her from entering. From another building, she watched her daughters wave at her.

“We spoke by phone. They waved from the balcony. They said, ‘Don’t worry, Mommy, we are fine,’” Yucel said. “They told us ‘Move your cars higher.’ They didn’t say, ‘Save your lives, save your children.’ I could have gotten them out of there.”

Speaking in Bozkurt late Thursday, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu described the scenes as “the most severe flood disaster I have seen.” On Wednesday, he said, flood waters reached 10 to 13 feet high in some areas.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who canceled celebrations marking his ruling party’s 20th anniversary, visited the area on Friday and promised to reconstruct demolished homes, roads and bridges.

“With God’s permission, we will overcome this disaster as well. We will do whatever it takes as a state ... and hopefully, we will rise from our ashes,” Erdogan said.

The Turkish leader referred to the recent wildfires and floods that happened elsewhere.

“Like many parts of the world, our country has been struggling with natural disasters for a while. It’s the same in America, Canada, Germany and other parts of Europe,” Erdogan said. “Our hope is to escape these disasters with the least damage possible.”

Bozkurt resident Yilmaz Ersevenli told NTV that he left his house to move his car to a safe area as the floodwaters began to rise but soon got swept away. He said he managed to save himself by holding onto a tree that had also washed away.

“I nearly lost my life trying to save my car,” he said.

In Bartin province, at least 13 people were injured when a section of a bridge caved in. AFAD said 10 people are currently hospitalized.

In total, five bridges collapsed in the floods while two others were damaged, AFAD said. Dozens of villages are still without power and several roads remain blocked. Helicopters were evacuating villagers Friday from areas where there was no access by road.

Erdogan said Thursday that at least 4,500 personnel, 19 helicopters and 24 boats were involved in the search-and-rescue operation.

Turkey’s Black Sea region is frequently struck by severe rains and flash flooding. At least six people were killed in floods that hit the eastern Black Sea coastal province of Rize last month.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two new wildfires that were started by lightning late Thursday afternoon grew rapidly Friday in southeastern Oregon not too far from the site of the Bootleg fire, which until recently was the nation’s largest blaze.

The Patton Meadow fire about 14 miles west of Lakeview, near the California border, exploded to 11 square miles in less than 24 hours in a landscape sucked dry by extreme drought.

An RV park was evacuated overnight in the remote region about 350 miles southeast of Portland that’s dotted with ranches, rural subdivisions, campgrounds and RV parks. The largest town in the area, Lakeview, has a population of about 2,600 people.

Another nearby fire was smaller but also growing and was just over one square mile Friday afternoon.

Gov. Kate Brown declared an emergency to help get firefighting crews and resources to the Patton Meadow Fire, which is also threatening communication infrastructure, authorities said.

Tamara Schmidt, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman with the fire incident command team, said fire growth was extremely rapid due to the weather conditions.

World & Nation Northwest heat wave: Volunteers get water to the vulnerable Volunteers are scrambling to hand out water to homeless people in Portland, Ore., as the Pacific Northwest sweats through a heat wave that’s gripping the normally temperate region.

“That’s substantial fire activity,” she said. “We’re still in initial attack. This is a really fresh fire.”

The fires are near the area torched by the monstrous Bootleg fire, which until recently was the nation’s largest blaze. That fire started July 6 and burned an area more than half the size of Rhode Island before crews gained the upper hand. The fire is 98% contained.

Triple-digit temperatures and bone-dry conditions in the state, which is undergoing a third day of extreme heat, will increase the fire risk in Oregon through the weekend, officials warned.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The New York state Assembly will suspend its impeachment investigation into Gov. Andrew Cuomo once he steps down, the chamber’s top Democrat said Friday.

Cuomo announced his resignation on Tuesday over sexual harassment allegations, days after he faced increasing pressure to resign or face the possibility of being ousted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature through the impeachment process. Cuomo said at the time that it would not take effect for 14 days, at which point he will be replaced by Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul.

The state attorney general last week released an independent investigation that found Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women.

Speaker Carl Heastie said in a statement that the Assembly Judiciary Committee had heard from its lawyers that it can’t impeach and remove an elected official no longer in office. Nevertheless, Heastie said, the evidence the committee had gathered “could likely have resulted in articles of impeachment had he not resigned.”

Since March, outside lawyers have been helping the committee conduct a wide-ranging investigation on whether there were grounds to impeach Cuomo, a Democrat. The announcement came on a day the Assembly had initially set as a deadline for Cuomo’s legal team to respond with any additional evidence refuting the allegations against him.

Cuomo’s office and lawyer, Rita Glavin, didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from the Associated Press about whether the governor was going to comply with the deadline.

“Let me be clear — the committee’s work over the last several months, although not complete, did uncover credible evidence in relation to allegations that have been made in reference to the governor,” Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Lavine said.

That included evidence related to sexual harassment, the misuse of state resources in conjunction with publication of the governor’s book on the pandemic, and “improper and misleading disclosure of nursing home data.”

As the answer to the legal question of impeaching a departed official remained unclear for several days, some Democrats, including Assemblymember Ron Kim, had urged the Assembly to impeach Cuomo anyway to prevent him from running for office again in New York.

Heastie said he’s asked Lavine to turn over “to the relevant investigatory authorities all the evidence the committee has gathered.”

Cuomo faces ongoing probes from the state attorney general over his $5 million book deal and from state prosecutors, who are scrutinizing his handling of nursing-home deaths data. The state’s ethics commissioners, who could levy fines against Cuomo, are also looking into similar issues.

Heastie also cited “active investigations” by county district attorneys in Manhattan, Albany, Westchester, Nassau and Oswego concerning incidents of alleged sexual harassment by Cuomo.

Several women have said the governor inappropriately touched them, including a current aide who said he groped her breasts at his official residence, the Executive Mansion, last November. That aide, Brittany Commisso, filed a criminal complaint that could result in a misdemeanor groping charge.

Some Judiciary committee members, including Democrats Phil Steck and Kenneth Braunstein, said Friday morning that they wanted the committee to at least release a report of their findings to the public.

Heastie’s statement didn’t say whether the committee would still publicize its findings.

Heastie’s spokeperson Mike Whyland didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment Friday. Heastie on Monday estimated the probe has cost taxpayers “millions” so far, but didn’t respond to repeated requests by the AP for an estimate.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was confident in June about the ability of his company’s COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the highly contagious Delta variant.

“I feel quite comfortable that we cover it,” Bourla said.

Just weeks later, Pfizer said it would seek authorization for a booster shot after early trial results showed a third dose potentially increased protection. At the end of July, Pfizer and BioNTech announced findings that four to six months after a second dose, their vaccine’s efficacy dropped to about 84%.

Bourla was quick to promote a third dose after the discouraging news, saying he was “very, very confident” that a booster would increase immunity levels in the vaccinated.

There’s one hitch: Pfizer has not yet delivered conclusive proof to back up that confidence. The company lacks late-stage clinical trial results to confirm a booster will work against variants including Delta, which now accounts for 97% of new coronavirus infections across the U.S., according to forecasts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Pfizer announced its global Phase 3 trial on a third dose in mid-July. That trial’s completion date is in 2022. Phase 3 results generally are required before regulatory approval.

“We are confident in this vaccine and the third dose, but you have to remember the vaccine efficacy study is still going on, so we need all the evidence to back up that,” said Jerica Pitts, Pfizer’s director of global media relations. The financial stakes are enormous: Pfizer announced in July that it expects $33.5 billion in COVID-19 vaccine revenue this year.

Meanwhile, Pfizer recently said that if a third dose couldn’t combat Delta or other variants, the drugmaker is poised to come up with a “tailor-made” vaccine within 100 days.

All of this has sown a sense of confusion about what exactly will work, and when. The pharmaceutical industry’s rush to recommend boosters for the public is “a little frustrating,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Even if a booster is found to be safe, he said, the U.S. effort should focus on “vaccinating people who are unvaccinated.”

In any case, decisions about boosters do not rest with vaccine makers, said Offit, who advises the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration about vaccines.

“Pharmaceutical companies aren’t public health agencies; it’s really not theirs to determine when or whether there should be booster dosing,” he said. “That is the purview of the CDC.”

Indeed, the CDC and the FDA ― the federal agencies overseeing the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines ― said in July that fully vaccinated Americans do not need a booster shot. Currently authorized vaccines ― from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson ― are working as they should: All three lower the risk of COVID-19 cases severe enough to hospitalize or kill a person.

If hospitalization and death rates increase among the vaccinated, then it would be time to talk about boosters, Offit said, but “we’re not there yet.”

Advertisement

The White House has added to the mixed messaging: Spokesperson Jen Psaki confirmed that the U.S. will buy an additional 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for inoculating children under 12 and for possible boosters.

Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta, said the confusion is not necessarily the fault of any one institution. Rather, she said, “there is genuine scientific uncertainty about how well [existing] vaccines work against the new variant.”

Scientists are piecing together information from observational studies, outbreak investigations and analyses of antibody responses.

For many Americans, the confusion has set off a feverish search for an illicit third dose just in case it’s necessary.

“I snuck in a dose of Pfizer last week,” Angie Melton, a 50-year-old mother of four, shared on Facebook. Melton received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot at a mass vaccination site in April and feared the highly contagious Delta variant could infect her and then her unvaccinated 10-year-old son, who has asthma.

After consulting friends and doctors and seeing reports about mix-and-match approaches in Europe, Melton signed onto a local pharmacy site and made an appointment to get a Pfizer shot. She’s scheduled for a second shot as well.

“I’m trying to keep my family safe,” Melton said.

On Thursday, the FDA said transplant recipients and other immunocompromised people can get a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to offer added protection against the Delta variant.

Immunocompromised patients like Sarah Keitt, who has multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease, expressed relief about that prospect. Keitt, a disability rights activist who lives in Connecticut, said her neurologist told her to get a booster even after she had received two doses of the Moderna vaccine. She said she was eager to get another dose but still frustrated about a lack of confidence in how much protection it would offer.

“If someone could definitely say there is a 95% chance you are protected” by a booster, Keitt said, “I would love it.”

Despite widespread media reports of “breakthrough cases,” a recent data analysis by KFF found that hospitalizations and deaths are extremely rare among the fully vaccinated ― well below 1%.

Offit points to a recent outbreak in Provincetown, Mass., in which only four of the 346 fully vaccinated people who had breakthrough infections were hospitalized with COVID-19. Two of them had underlying medical conditions and no one died.

“This vaccine still does an excellent job in the face of the Delta variant at protecting people against severe, critical disease,” he said.

Science CDC document paints more dire picture of threat posed by Delta variant The Delta variant is more formidable than previously believed, due to its ability to infect and be spread by people who are vaccinated, a CDC document says.

Yet the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against variants is still under debate. This month a new preprint study by the Mayo Clinic found that the product’s effectiveness against infection dropped to 42% from January to July as the Delta variant’s prevalence markedly increased.

Pfizer and partner BioNTech announced they are developing an updated version of their vaccine to target the genomic features of the Delta variant.

However, the idea that a new formulation could work better is “mostly hypothetical at this point,” said Vaughn Cooper, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the University of Pittsburgh.

Dr. Vincent Rajkumar, a hematologist at the Mayo Clinic who closely studies his patients’ immune responses and antibody levels, said using the current vaccine and testing a new version sounds reasonable.

There is one hypothesis that if breakthrough infections are due to a drop in antibody levels, boosting those levels will be enough, Rajkumar said. But the more worrisome hypothesis is that the Delta variant, or any other variant, might be less threatened by the antibodies the current vaccine generates.

“So unless you boost [antibodies] with a vaccine that is specific to Delta, it won’t work,” Rajkumar said. Testing both hypotheses is the “right thing to do in the interest of time.”

At the same time, though, the push for giving booster shots to healthy populations is premature, said Dr. Sadiya Khan, an epidemiologist and cardiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. That’s because even if those already fully vaccinated do get a third dose or booster, the virus is still circulating among millions of unvaccinated people.

“The overwhelming majority of infections and hospitalizations and deaths are occurring among those who are unvaccinated,” Khan said.

“Giving up on that greater strategy of vaccinating the population is going to lead to continued surges,” she said. “The potential for harm is quite large.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In a country that takes great pride in its museums and monuments, the final resting place of one of Mexico’s signature historical figures is easy to miss.

A simple red plaque — just a name and the years he lived — marks the spot where his tomb is embedded in a wall to the side of the altar in a dilapidated downtown church. Few worshipers take notice.

The name alone, however, recalls centuries of conflict and a never-ending debate about the essential identity of Mexico:

HERNAN CORTES 1485-1547.

The legendary Spanish military commander may be hidden away in death, but a few blocks away, authorities are readying a remembrance of his momentous triumph — the conquest of the Aztec Empire.

Friday marks the 500th anniversary of the fall in 1521 of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán, now the site of Mexico City. The bloody siege culminating in its surrender launched three centuries of Spanish dominion in Mexico.

The conquest still stirs profound disquiet in the national psyche.

Politicians and activists have put their own spin on history, casting Cortés as the coldblooded archetype of European imperialism. But regardless of the denunciations, his military campaign is what led to Mexico’s modern identity as a mixed-race nation.

“We were all born from the conquest, no longer Aztecs, no longer Spanish, but Indian-Hispanic-Americans, mestizos,” wrote Carlos Fuentes, the late Mexican author. “We are what we are because Hernán Cortés, for good or for bad, did what he did.”

This week in Mexico City’s central plaza, or zócalo, workers have been erecting a more-than 50-foot-tall replica of the emblematic Templo Mayor, the main sanctuary of the Mexicas, as the Aztecs called themselves. A multi-colored light show will flash images Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent, and other Aztec motifs.

“A society needs to know where it comes from to know where it is going,” Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s City mayor, said at a forum last month detailing plans for the occasion. “How can we resolve some of our great problems if we don’t know where they began?”

By any measure, Spain’s arrival in the New World was a global milestone, a meeting of civilizations that had evolved distinctly through the millennia.

“It was a turning point in human history, and we will never go back,” said Matthew Restall, a professor at Penn State University and author of “When Montezuma Met Cortés: The True Story of the Meeting That Changed History,” chronicling the encounter between the Aztec ruler and the Spanish conquistador. “These were human beings who had been on the planet for tens of thousands of years and never knew about each other.”

Portraying the Spaniards’ arrival as a nationalist parable of good versus evil — a glorious native culture devastated by European marauders — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has called for historic “reconciliation.”

“The so-called conquest was accomplished with the sword and the cross,” he declared a few months after taking office. “Thousands of people were murdered during this period. A culture was imposed, one civilization on top of another, to the point where Catholic churches were constructed on top of the temples of pre-Hispanic peoples.”

Both Spain and the Vatican have rebuffed the president’s demands for apologies. Events from five centuries ago cannot be judged by “contemporary considerations,” the Spanish government said. The Catholic Church pointed out that during a 2015 trip to Bolivia, Pope Francis already apologized for colonial-era abuses committed against Indigenous populations in the Americas.

“We want him to do it in Mexico too,” López Obrador shot back.

No one disputes the culpability of Cortés and his captains in massacres, torture, forced religious conversion and enslavement in a quest for glory and gold. However, many historians also dismiss López Obrador’s good-versus-evil template as one-dimensional.

“It’s a simple vision of history in which one sees everything as black and white,” said Alfredo Ávila, a historian at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “The historic reality is never that simple.”

Mexican officials have dubbed the remembrance “500 Years of Indigenous Resistance.”

The “resistance” tag overlooks an uncomfortable fact: More than 90% of Cortés’ troops in the siege of Tenochtitlán were Indigenous rivals of the Aztecs, notably warriors from the Tlaxcalan and Totonac cultures. Post-conquest, historians say, other Indigenous peoples bowed to Spanish hegemony, while Cortés rewarded allies in the war against the Aztecs with favored treatment, including exemption from some royal taxes.

“Many Indigenous groups collaborated with the Spanish,” said historian Miguel Pastrana Flores, also at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “It was an alliance that not only fought with the Spanish, but provided the Spanish with food, shelter, helped fabricate their arms and build their boats.”

The Aztecs ruled a vast realm, from present-day Central America to central Mexico. But divisions roiled their domain. Resentment seethed among vassal communities fed up with their overlords’ demands for tribute, including victims for human sacrifice.

Cortés skillfully played on these deep fissures, recruiting personnel to bolster the thin Spanish ranks.

Today, some view the events of 1521 less as a Spanish-versus-Aztec struggle than as a tipping point in an internal Mesoamerican clash among the diverse Indigenous populations of the day. An alliance of convenience with the bearded outsiders brought the benefit of horse-bound cavalry, sophisticated military tactics and technologically advanced weaponry, including cannons, muskets and crossbows.

As historical interpretations have evolved, the Spanish usurpation and how it is construed remain a tinderbox in Mexico.

Sheinbaum, the Mexico City mayor and a protege of the president, recalled her youthful miseducation about Mexico’s origins.

“They made us see — or at least, that was the history that I learned in school — that the conquest of Mexico had been almost romantic, and that there had simply been an ‘encounter of two worlds,’ ” she said. “And, in reality, history wasn’t like that.”

Cortés, an ambitious and ruthless adventurer with a penchant for defying his superiors, arrived on Mexico’s Gulf coast in 1519 and set his sights on the treasures of the Aztec Empire, based hundreds of miles away in a high-altitude valley flanked by volcanoes. He and his 500 or so initial troops proceeded north, convincing legions of Indigenous adversaries of the Aztecs to join them as warriors, porters and laborers.

Accompanying Cortés was his interpreter and trusted consort, Malintzin, an Indigenous woman now known as La Malinche, who remains an incendiary figure in Mexico — denounced in popular culture as a traitor, but celebrated by some as an extraordinary woman who overcame slavery, prejudice and misogyny.

The Spaniards were awed at first sight of the wondrous island-city of Tenochtitlán, with its broad causeways across a series of lakes.

“These great towns … and buildings rising from the water, all made of stone, seemed like an enchanted vision,” Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a member of the expedition, wrote in “The Conquest of New Spain.” “Indeed, some of our soldiers asked if it was not all a dream.”

Montezuma, both wary and curious, had sent emissaries in a bid to dissuade the strangers from venturing to his capital. When Cortés insisted, the emperor extended a welcome to the newcomers, providing luxurious lodgings and a “sumptuous dinner” after thousands of Aztecs lined up to gawk at the foreigners’ motley ranks, wrote Díaz del Castillo.

The Spaniards, fearing a gilded trap, hatched an audacious plot: They grabbed Montezuma at his palace and forced him back to their quarters and held him hostage. The great monarch whose many underlords could not even look him in the eyes would never be a free man again.

The Aztecs revolted in 1520 after a Spanish massacre of their noblemen at the Templo Mayor. The conquistadors and their allies suffered heavy casualties as they fled the city. Killed during the tumult was the captive Montezuma. The Spaniards pinned his death on a native mob, but many historians believe that the enraged conquistadors executed Montezuma.

Mexican schoolchildren have long learned about the Noche Triste — The Night of Sadness — as the Spaniards’ nocturnal retreat from the Aztec uprising is known.

This year, in another revisionist touch, Mexico City renamed the plaza where a grief-stricken Cortés supposedly mourned his losses as Noche Victoriosa, or Night of Victory.

“It’s time to give a voice to the original peoples of our land,” Sheinbaum tweeted last month, heralding the rebranding of the plaza. “It’s time to revise the past in order to transform the present.”

One problem: Historians say casualties among the Indigenous rank and file aiding Cortés far outnumbered Spaniards who perished in the chaotic withdrawal. Scholars also dispute the mayor’s comments that contemporary racism in Mexico can be traced to the Spanish.

Advertisement

“This government makes political use of history and thinks that changing the name of a plaza changes history,” said Alejandro Rosas, an independent historian. “The typical idea is that [Mexico] was practically an earthly paradise until the Spanish brought all the bad. That’s also false.”

Cortés soon regrouped and, with reinforcements from Spain and additional Indigenous recruits, launched his siege of Tenochtitlán.

By then, a smallpox outbreak — the native people of the Americas had no immunity to the virus — had ravaged the Aztec capital. Nonetheless, its warriors mounted a spirited defense, using hundreds of canoes to transport forces between the city and the lake shore and to thwart enemy advances on the causeways. Cortés deployed newly built brigantines with sails, oarsmen and cannon while blockading supplies of food and fresh water to the city.

In what is surely one of the epic battles in the history of the Americas, tens of thousands were killed in months of cavalry and infantry charges, door-to-door urban warfare and naval engagements. In his firsthand account, Díaz del Castillo describes onslaughts of arrows, darts and stones and the doleful sight of Spanish prisoners being placed on sacrificial altars as captors cut open their chests and “drew out their palpitating hearts which they offered to the idols before them.”

But the battered, starving Aztecs finally surrendered on Aug. 13, 1521, their last emperor, Cuauhtémoc, captured and tortured. Cortés ordered Cuauhtémoc executed four years later for alleged treason.

“We could not walk without treading on the bodies and heads of dead Indians,” wrote Díaz del Castillo. “The stench was so bad that no one could endure it.”

Cortés eventually returned to Spain to deal with various legal and financial entanglements. He died there in 1547. He was 62.

Convinced that his achievements had been underappreciated in Spain, he had wanted his body returned to Mexico. It took almost two decades, but in 1566 his remains were shipped across the Atlantic.

As anti-Spanish independence fervor gripped Mexico in the early 19th century, some feared that independistas would desecrate the remains. So in the 1820s, one of Cortés’ sympathizers reportedly collected the remains for safekeeping, hiding them in a hospital. Years later, he secretly hollowed out a space at the Jesus of Nazareth Church, deposited a lead, wood and glass container holding the bones — including a skull wrapped in lace — and then repaired the wall, according to various accounts in the Spanish and Mexican press.

The church is said to be around the corner from the spot where Cortés and Montezuma first met, though contemporary, traffic-clogged Mexico City is unrecognizable from the island Aztec capital.

The whereabouts of Cortés’ remains were a mystery until 1946, when the discovery of a document revealed the secret and Mexican officials authorized a team to extract them. The bones were returned to the church wall the following year with the simple red plaque.

Amid Friday’s memorial events, none are planned for Cortés.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If desperation had a face, it might resemble that of Nooria, a widowed mother of seven from the northern Afghan city of Kunduz.

The Taliban in recent days overran Kunduz, one of a succession of provincial capitals to fall to the Islamist militant group as it swiftly encircles the nation’s capital, Kabul. For Nooria, who did not want her family name used, the fighting announced itself when a rocket crashed into her home, badly injuring one of her sons.

The temporary haven they found is far from a safe one: a Kabul park, Hasa-e-Awal, which has become a sprawling makeshift camp for war-displaced people from across Afghanistan. But with Taliban fighters only a few dozen miles from the city by nightfall Saturday, Kabul itself is in peril.

“My heart is beating with fear at the thought of the Taliban,” said Nooria, 35, who ekes out a living as a house cleaner. When the militant movement last ruled Afghanistan, a five-year reign that ended in 2001, widows like her faced a brutal fate, banned from supporting themselves except by begging, burqa-clad, in the street.

If the fighters come here, she said, she and her children would run away again, but she did not know where.

As huge swaths of Afghan territory have fallen to the Taliban over the last week, largely without resistance from government forces, those who were driven from their homes converged on the capital from north, south and west — fleeing by any means of transport available, carrying what they could. More than a quarter-million Afghans have become refugees in their own country just since May, the United Nations said.

With the flood of arrivals, Kabul’s few green spaces have been transformed into a mosaic of colorful patterned fabric hung from tree branches, clasped with bands normally used to secure men’s trousers.

The only material signs of comfort are rugs, plastic mats and blankets to cover the bare ground. Poignantly, people remove their shoes before entering these improvised shelters, just as they would in their homes.

This particular camp sprang up only six days ago, say its unofficial organizers, but already more than 200 families have settled in. No government aid has come, they say, but local businesses and good Samaritans living nearby have taken pity on those arriving, donating what food, clothing and supplies they can spare.

Often, the displaced families cluster near others from their hometowns; here their children tumble together like puppies. As Nooria spoke, she soothed someone else’s crying child.

The lives they left behind were ordinary ones. Nooria’s neighbors in the park include Mohammad Massoud and his family of eight; in Kunduz, he had a little sandal shop.

Nearby is another Kunduz couple: grocery owner Mohammad Taher, 52, and his wife, Zakera Hamidiyan, 35, sheltering with their 19-year-old daughter, Asma. Their experience with the Taliban was terrifyingly intimate: The fighters pushed their way into the family’s home and occupied it, drawing fire from the city’s defenders. An incoming salvo left Asma with a burn that still marks her face.

Some who suddenly found themselves homeless amid the violence had recently made bold efforts to better their lives. Zainab Ahmadi, a 27-year-old in a pink head covering, joined the local police force seven months ago in her home province of Takhar, in the country’s northeast. The pay was better than at her old job as a cook, but her boss sent her and the other officers home when the fighting started.

Zainab Ahmadi, 27, from Takhar province, is a police officer and mother of three. Along with her husband, Noor Mohammad, they fled to Kabul in hopes that she could collect her monthly government salary of 8,000 afghanis (about $100) and use it to rebuild a home. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)

In Kabul, her ambitions are modest. She and her husband hope she might be able to collect the last month’s government salary still due her: 8,000 afghanis, the equivalent of about $100. With that money, they could try to start over here, she said, but that was yet another risk; it seemed no safer than the life they left behind.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Israel recalled its top diplomat from Poland on Saturday after the Polish president signed a law that restricts the rights of former Polish property owners, including Holocaust survivors and their descendants, to regain property seized by the country’s communist regime.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called it “a shameful decision and disgraceful contempt for the memory of the Holocaust” and said “Poland has chosen to continue harming those who have lost everything.”

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said he had instructed Israel’s top diplomat in Warsaw, the charges d’affaires, to return home immediately for an indefinite period. He said the new Israeli ambassador to Poland, who was scheduled to leave for Warsaw, will remain in Israel.

“Poland today approved — not for the first time — an immoral, antisemitic law,” Lapid said.

The Israel Foreign Ministry also said it was recommending that the Polish ambassador, who is on vacation, not return to Israel.

The law, which was passed by parliament on Wednesday, is an amendment to Poland’s administrative law, which will prevent property ownership and other administrative decisions from being declared void after 30 years.

It does not distinguish between Jewish and non-Jewish claimants.

The legislation has angered Israel and the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called on President Andrzej Duda this week to veto it, arguing that it would severely restrict the “process for Holocaust survivors and their families, as well as other Jewish and non-Jewish property owners, to obtain restitution for property wrongfully confiscated during Poland’s communist era.”

But Duda said in a statement that he had analyzed the matter carefully and decided to sign the law to end legal uncertainty and fraud linked to properties whose ownership remains in doubt decades after World War II.

Duda said he strongly objected to anyone suggesting that the law was directed specifically against Jews who survived the Holocaust, which was carried out by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland and elsewhere.

“I unequivocally reject this rhetoric and say it with all my strength,” Duda said. “Linking this act with the Holocaust raises my firm objection.”

Before World War II, Poland was home to Europe’s largest Jewish community of nearly 3.5 million people. Most were killed in the Holocaust and their properties confiscated by the Nazis. Poland’s post-war communist authorities seized those properties, along with the property of many non-Jewish owners in Warsaw and other cities.

When communism fell in 1989, it opened up the possibility for former owners to try to regain their lost properties. Some cases have made their way through the courts, but Poland has never passed a comprehensive law that would regulate restituting or compensating seized properties.

Some of those cases have been beset by fraud. Criminal groups have claimed to be rightful owners, obtaining valuable properties, and in some cases evicting tenants.

“I am convinced that with my signature the era of legal chaos ends — the era of re-privatization mafias, the uncertainty of millions of Poles and the lack of respect for the basic rights of citizens of our country. I believe in a state that protects its citizens against injustice,” Duda said.

The legislation was widely supported across the political spectrum in Poland.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A young mother had just celebrated her first wedding anniversary and was one of six members of a Jacksonville, Fla., church to die over a 10-day span.

Another Florida woman had just given birth to her first child, but was able to hold the newborn girl only for a few moments before dying.

A California man died a few weeks shy of his 53rd birthday while his wife was on a ventilator at the same hospital in Oakland, unaware of his passing Aug. 4.

The COVID-19 death toll has started soaring again as the Delta variant tears through the nation’s unvaccinated population and fills up hospitals with patients, many of whom are younger than during earlier phases of the pandemic.

Advertisement

The U.S. is now averaging about 650 deaths a day, increasing more than 80% from two weeks ago and going past the 600 mark Saturday for the first time in three months.

Data on the age and demographics of victims during the Delta surge are still limited, but hospitals in virus hot spots say they are clearly seeing more admissions and deaths among people under the age of 65.

Florida hospital officials are seeing an influx of young, healthy adults filling their wards across the state, many requiring oxygen. In the past week in Florida, 36% of the deaths occurred in the under-65 population, compared with 17% in the same week last year when the state was experiencing a similar COVID-19 surge. Florida is the national leader in COVID-19 deaths, averaging more than 150 a day in the last week.

The younger patients mark a shift from older and frail people, many living in nursing homes, who succumbed to COVID-19 a year ago before states made seniors a priority to get inoculated first. More than 90% of seniors have had at least one shot, compared with about 70% for Americans under 65.

At a predominantly Black church in Jacksonville with a hipster vibe, contemporary music, and a strong social media presence reflective of its young, energetic congregation, six members died over 10 days starting in late July. All were under the age of 35.

They were “all healthy, all unvaccinated,” laments Pastor George Davis of Impact Church, who knew each one personally and has struggled with his own grief at the funerals. He’s held two vaccination events for his congregation of about 6,000 where more than 1,000 received shots.

Among the church members who died were a 24-year-old man Davis watched grow up since he was a toddler, and a woman from his worship team who celebrated her first wedding anniversary only weeks before she died. Her husband recovered.

Davis said the young woman was “just the picture of health, vibrant.”

“There is a sense among younger people that they are somehow invincible,” said Dr. Lena Wen, public health professor at George Washington University and former Baltimore Health Commissioner. “Unfortunately, though, some people who are hospitalized are going to die and that’s going to mean some people who are younger; and as you’ve seen these are people in some cases who are leaving behind young children.”

Among those parents are Kristen McMullen, who had decorated her baby’s room with rainbows and suns, fully embracing her favorite season, summer — after which she would name her first child.

The 30-year-old woman fell ill three weeks before her due date and was admitted to a hospital in Melbourne, Fla., with COVID-19.

After an emergency cesarean section, McMullen was able to hold her baby girl for a few moments before being rushed off to an intensive care unit, where she later died.

“She would say that she was scared and that she didn’t want to die,” her aunt Melissa Syverson said, struggling to talk in between sobs. “She was fighting to get back to the baby.”

McMullen’s aunt said her family did not want to disclose whether McMullen was vaccinated.

Carlos Reyes was skeptical of the vaccine and so was his wife, Maria — until they and their two teenage children had to be rushed to the hospital in Oakland.

Their 14-year-old son, Sergio, did not need to stay after getting oxygen while 19-year-old Emma joined her parents in the intensive care unit. She was released after a few days, and the parents were put on ventilators.

Their 32-year-old daughter who has an autoimmune disease was the only one vaccinated when they fell ill.

“We were all just a little hesitant at the beginning,” said the couple’s oldest daughter, Jasmine Rivas Fierro, 34.

Their four children didn’t want to break their mother’s heart by telling her while she was still in intensive care that Carlos had died a day after their 22nd anniversary.

“She loved him so much,” Rivas Fierro said of her mother, who is still in the hospital.

The family is telling people that they must be fully vaccinated to attend Carlos’ funeral next week.

Cindy Dawkins also left behind four children, ranging in age from 12 to 24. She died Aug. 7, less than a week after she celebrated her 50th birthday with her family at Universal Studios in Orlando. She had a cough and seemed tired that day before her condition quickly deteriorated and she had to be rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

Her family believes she contracted the virus at her waitressing job at a bistro in their hometown of Boynton Beach, Fla., where her co-workers have also tested positive. She was healthy and had been getting tested regularly but was still mulling over getting the vaccine.

“Maybe the vaccine would have helped fight it, but I don’t know if it would have completely stopped it,” her 20-year-old son, Tre Burrows, said.

As the family wrestles with grief and sorts out guardianship of Dawkins’ youngest children, they are also saddened by what could have been. Dawkins came to the U.S. from the Bahamas when she was in high school and her children say she was close to becoming an American citizen, an event the family planned to celebrate with a trip over Thanksgiving.

“Everything was finally going right,” her daughter Jenny Burrows said. “And then this happened.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@With the Obama healthcare law undergoing a revival under President Biden, this Sunday is the deadline for consumers to take advantage of a special sign-up period for private coverage made more affordable by his COVID-19 relief law.

A strong close would bolster Biden’s case that Congress needs to make permanent the temporary boost in health insurance subsidies provided by the COVID legislation. His campaign promise to build on existing programs to move the U.S. toward coverage for all may also gain credence.

The government says more than 2.5 million people have signed up since Biden ordered the HealthCare.gov marketplace to reopen Feb. 15 to account for health insurance needs in the pandemic. Then, starting in April, the cost of coverage came down due to sweeter subsidies in the COVID law, which attracted more enrollment. Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, are hoping that this deadline weekend in mid-August will surprise skeptics.

“We’ve seen even in the last couple of weeks increased interest in enrollment,” Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in an interview. “When you make coverage more affordable, people buy it. What we need to do is to make coverage more affordable.”

Biden’s special enrollment period ends at midnight local time Sunday around the country. The regular annual sign-up season won’t start again until Nov. 1.

Interest has been high in a couple of states feeling the scourge of the delta variant. Nearly 490,000 people have signed up in Florida, and more than 360,000 have done so in Texas.

At a nonprofit service center in Austin, Texas, more than 500 people have enrolled so far with the help of staff and volunteers. Foundation Communities health program director Aaron DeLaO said the schedule is booked and they’re working to clear the waiting list.

“Especially with the delta variant, people are thinking about their health a little more,” he said.

The application process can be complicated, requiring details about citizenship or legal immigrant status, income, and household members. That’s before a consumer even picks a health insurance plan. People can apply online, via the HealthCare.gov call center, or through programs like the one in Austin.

About 9 in 10 customers at Foundation Communities have selected standard “silver” plans, which cost somewhat more but offer better financial protection when illness strikes. “That to me says that people are really interested in having comprehensive coverage,” said DeLaO.

The Obama-era Affordable Care Act offers subsidized private insurance to people who don’t have job-based coverage, available in every state. The ACA also expanded Medicaid for low-income adults, an option most states have taken. The two components cover about 27 million people, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

“Obamacare’s” place among government health programs seems secure now, after more than a decade of fruitless efforts by Republicans to repeal it or get the Supreme Court to overturn it. Earlier this year by a vote of 7-2 the conservative-leaning court dismissed the latest challenge.

The subsidy increases in Biden’s COVID law have made a tangible difference. The average premium paid by new customers dropped from $117 a month to $85 a month, or 27%, with the more generous aid. According to CMS, the median — or midpoint — deductible went from $450 to $50, a reduction of nearly 90%. People who already had ACA coverage can also get the increased aid by going back to the insurance marketplace. People who’ve had a spell of unemployment are eligible for added breaks.

But the enhanced subsidies are good only through 2022, and Biden is pressing Congress to make them permanent. An extension seems likely to be included in the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion domestic policy package, however it isn’t guaranteed to be permanent, with so many other priorities competing for money.

About 30 million people remain uninsured, and a clear majority would be eligible for ACA plans or some other type of coverage. “If you build it they won’t necessarily come,” said Karen Pollitz, a health insurance expert with the Kaiser Foundation. “People still need to be made aware that there is coverage out there.”

The Biden administration may make progress, but “this can’t be the end of the story,” said health economist Katherine Baicker of the University of Chicago.

It remains way too complicated for people who juggle low-paying jobs to get and keep coverage, Baicker explained. “There is both a need to expand access to affordable insurance and to better inform people about the options available to them,” she said.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The death toll from severe floods and mudslides in coastal Turkey has climbed to at least 57, the country’s emergency and disaster agency said Saturday, as authorities disputed reports that dozens more were missing.

Torrential rain that pounded the Black Sea provinces of Bartin, Kastamonu and Sinop on Wednesday caused flooding that demolished homes, severed at least five bridges, swept away cars and rendered numerous roads unpassable. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said 48 people were killed in Kastamonu, eight in Sinop and one in Bartin.

Eight people remained hospitalized, according to the agency.

Speaking late Saturday in Kastamonu, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 15 of the dead had not yet been identified. He slammed opposition parties, social media users and media for claims that hundreds could be missing. He said a total of 77 cases of missing people remained in Kastamonu and Sinop but emphasized that doesn’t necessarily mean they are dead. He added the previous number of missing was 143, including duplicate names and some reached alive.

The Kastamonu provincial governor’s office also said reports that there were 250 to 300 unidentified bodies were untrue. It did not specifically address how many people might be missing in the flooding.

In Sinop, floodwaters almost completely wiped out the village of Babacay, leaving toppled homes, damaged bridges and rubble in their wake. A five-story apartment building constructed on a riverbed was destroyed, along with numerous homes.

Rescue teams and sniffer dogs kept up their painstaking task of trying to find the missing. AFAD said 5,820 personnel, 20 rescue dogs, 20 helicopters and two search planes were at the disaster spots.

About 2,250 people were evacuated across the region before, during and after the floods, some lifted from rooftops by helicopters. Many were being temporarily housed in student dormitories, authorities said.

Climate scientists unequivocally say that climate change is leading to extreme weather events as the world warms because of the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Such calamities are expected to happen more frequently as the planet warms.

Experts in Turkey, however, say interference with rivers and improper construction also were contributors to the massive damage in Turkey’s floods.

Geologists have said that construction narrowed the riverbed and the surrounding alluvial flood plain of the Ezine stream in Kastamonu’s Bozkurt district, where the damage was most severe, from 1,312 feet to 49 feet. Residential buildings were built along the waterfront.

During severe rains, the contracted stream has limited area in which to move and can overflow. Videos posted by residents showed water rushing downstream in Bozkurt as the surrounding buildings and roads flooded.

One geologist, Ramazan Demirtas, explained the riverbed narrowing on Twitter and said that humans were to blame for this week’s disaster.

Across the Black Sea, days of heavy rain also produced flooding in broad areas of southern Russia. Authorities in the Krasnodar region said Saturday that more than 1,400 houses flooded following storms that swept the area this week. About 108,000 residents of 11 settlements were left without power.

The regional emergency headquarters said a total of 1,531 people have been evacuated. The Black Sea resort city of Anapa was among the worst affected. Officials have warned that heavy rain was expected for two more days.

The floods struck on the heels of wildfires in southern Turkey that devastated forestland in the seaside provinces of Mugla and Antalya, which are popular with tourists. At least 16 people died in the wildfires, including eight emergency workers whose firefighting plane crashed Saturday, and thousands of residents and tourists were forced to flee.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck off the coast of the Alaskan Peninsula early Saturday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.

Despite the size of the quake, no tsunami warnings were issued. The closest place to the epicenter was Perryville, home to a little more than 100 people 85 miles northwest. Much of the land around the part of the Gulf of Alaska where the earthquake struck just before 4 a.m. is home to wildlife refuges.

Alaska is a hotbed of seismic activity. The Alaska Earthquake Center, housed at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, detects an earthquake every 15 minutes, on average, according to its website. The center also says that 75% of all U.S. earthquakes with a magnitude over 5 occur in Alaska.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A powerful magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck southwestern Haiti on Saturday, killing at least 304 people and injuring at least 1,800 others and destroying hundreds of homes. People in the Caribbean island nation rushed into the streets to seek safety and to help rescue those trapped in the rubble of collapsed homes, hotels and other structures.

Saturday’s earthquake struck the southwestern part of the hemisphere’s poorest nation, almost razing some towns and triggering landslides that hampered rescue efforts in two of the hardest-hit communities. The disaster also added to the plight of Haitians, who were already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, a presidential assassination and deepening poverty.

The epicenter of the quake was about 78 miles west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The widespread damage could worsen by early next week, with Tropical Storm Grace predicted to reach Haiti late Monday or early Tuesday.

Aftershocks were felt throughout the day and late into the night, when many people — now homeless or frightened by the possibility of their fractured homes collapsing on them — stayed in the streets to sleep.

In the badly damaged coastal town of Les Cayes, under darkness that was only punctured by flashlights, some praised God for their surviving the earthquake.

“We are alive today because God loves us,” said Marie-claire Jean-Pierre, whose home collapsed a moment after she and her son stepped outside when they felt the ground begin to shake.

Prime Minister Ariel Henry said he was rushing aid to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals overwhelmed with incoming patients. A former senator rented a private airplane to move injured people from Les Cayes to Port-au-Prince for medical assistance.

Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said he would not ask for international help until the extent of the damages was known.

“The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,” Henry said. “We have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people.”

Jerry Chandler, director of Haiti’s Office of Civil Protection, told reporters that the death toll stood at 304 Saturday night. Rescue workers and bystanders were able to pull many people to safety from the rubble.

Chandler said a partial count of structural damage included at least 860 destroyed homes and more than 700 damaged. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were also affected.

On the tiny island of Ile-a-Vache, about 6½ miles from Les Cayes, the quake damaged a seaside resort popular with Haitian officials, business leaders, diplomats and humanitarian workers. Fernand Sajous, owner of the Abaka Bay Resort, said by telephone that nine of the hotel’s 30 rooms collapsed, but he said they were vacant at the time and no one was injured.

“They disappeared — just like that,” Sajous said.

People in Les Cayes tried to pull guests from the rubble of a collapsed hotel, but as the sun set, they had only been able to recover the body of a 7-year-old girl whose home was behind the facility.

“I have eight kids, and I was looking for the last one,” Jean-Claude Daniel said through tears. “I will never see her again alive. The earthquake destroyed my life. It took a child away from me.”

The reports of overwhelmed hospitals come as Haiti struggles with the pandemic and a lack of resources to deal with it. Just last month, the country of 11 million people received its first batch of U.S.-donated COVID-19 vaccines, via a United Nations program for low-income countries.

The earthquake struck more than a month after President Jovenel Moise was killed, sending the country into political chaos. His widow, Martine Moise, who was seriously wounded in the attack, posted a message on Twitter calling for unity among Haitians: “Let’s put our shoulders together to bring solidarity.”

As he boarded a plane bound for Les Cayes, Henry said he wanted “structured solidarity” to ensure the response was coordinated to avoid the confusion that followed the devastating 2010 earthquake, when aid was slow to reach residents after as many as 300,000 Haitians were killed.

President Biden authorized an immediate response and named U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power as the senior official coordinating the U.S effort to help Haiti. USAID will help to assess damage and assist in rebuilding, said Biden, who called the United States a “close and enduring friend to the people of Haiti.”

Argentina and Chile also were among the first nations to promise help.

Humanitarian workers said gang activity in the seaside district of Martissant, just west of the Haitian capital, also was complicating efforts.

“Nobody can travel through the area,” Ndiaga Seck, a UNICEF spokesman in Port-au-Prince, said by phone. “We can only fly over or take another route.”

Seck said information about deaths and damage was slow coming to Port-au-Prince because of spotty internet service, but UNICEF planned to send medical supplies to two hospitals in the south, in Les Cayes and Jeremie.

People in the capital felt the quake and many rushed into the streets in fear, although there did not appear to be damage in Port-au-Prince.

Haiti, where many live in tenuous circumstances, is vulnerable to earthquakes and hurricanes. In addition to the devastating magnitude 7.1 quake in 2010, the nation was struck by a 5.9 temblor in 2018 that killed more than a dozen people.

By late Saturday, the island nation had experienced six aftershocks stronger than magnitude 5.0 and nine above 4.0.

Claude Prepetit, a Haitian civil engineer and geologist, warned of the danger from cracked structures.

“More or less intensive aftershocks are to be expected for a month,” he said, cautioning that some buildings, “badly damaged during the earthquake, can collapse during aftershocks.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Children are being newly hospitalized for COVID-19 at a record rate in the United States, with numbers surging since the beginning of July as the Delta variant has overtaken the nation.

But that national boom has been driven largely by a few states, such as Florida, Texas and Georgia, and the numbers in California have been less dire.

While there has been a rebound in recent weeks in California, rates of new hospitalizations for COVID-19 among kids and teens age 17 and younger have not reached the heights as in the hardest-hit parts of the country. Nor have those rates surged as high as last winter. That’s a major difference from Florida and Texas, where daily rates of youth hospitalization for COVID-19 surpassed their wintertime peak.

California is now reporting 18 new hospitalizations a day among children and teens, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 10 times worse than just two months ago but still below winter levels, when there were 29 children a day being newly hospitalized with COVID-19.

The recent uptick in pediatric hospitalizations has been discouraging for doctors and troubling for parents with children younger than 12, who are not yet eligible to receive a coronavirus vaccination — especially as schools reopen their doors. The spread of the Delta variant has also raised questions about whether it is causing more severe disease than earlier variants.

Public health officials have said that California has taken steps to ensure children can go back to school safely, including requiring masks in indoor school settings and regular testing for unvaccinated workers. They also believe higher-than-average levels of vaccination in the state will help protect children.

“Parents should feel reassured that case rates are still very low amongst children; serious illnesses still remains relatively rare,” said L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer. “And if we all are doing our part, we’re hopeful that schools are going to open with a lot of safety and without a lot of increased risk.”

Still, schools are reopening at a fraught moment.

Earlier this summer, there were so few children suffering from COVID-19 at Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego that medical staff decided they no longer needed a special unit to isolate young patients with the virus. Only four children were admitted with the coronavirus during the month of June.

“We were all congratulating each other that COVID was gone,” said Dr. John Bradley, Division of Infectious Diseases director at Rady. “A little prematurely, it turns out.”

Advertisement

Earlier this week, there were four children hospitalized with COVID-19 at the San Diego hospital. That increase has been disappointing but still far below last winter, when there were three to four times as many on a typical day, Bradley said.

Children’s Hospital Los Angeles said it had 14 hospitalized patients with the coronavirus as of Thursday — triple the number in the previous week — and half of them are showing symptoms that could be related to COVID-19, according to hospital officials.

Children’s Hospital of Orange County is seeing similar trends. Earlier in the summer, there were many days where there was not a single child hospitalized with COVID-19 at the Orange hospital, but an uptick began in mid-July. As of Thursday, there were 10 children hospitalized, five of whom were in intensive care.

“Children are less likely to become severely ill with COVID compared to adults,” said Dr. Coleen Cunningham, the hospital’s senior vice president and pediatrician in chief. “However, they are not immune, and some become quite ill,” including from pneumonia and organ failure; inflammation that can lead to heart damage; and long-lasting symptoms of fatigue and headaches, a condition known as “long COVID.”

COVID-19 deaths among children remain relatively low. Out of 64,000 overall deaths from COVID-19 in California, 30 were among children. In L.A. County, six children have died from COVID-19, including two under the age of 12. Nationally, more than 400 children have died from COVID-19, according to CDC data. In comparison, 756 children died by unintentional drowning in 2019.

But “none of us would accept even a 1 in 10,000 chance of our child being killed or maimed when we could do something to reduce that risk,” said Dr. Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer for L.A. County-USC Medical Center on the Eastside, the flagship public hospital for the county.

Spellberg said that despite the overall increases in L.A. County, there were no kids hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Thursday morning at County-USC — and only one or two children coming to the hospital daily with symptoms that could be treated at home.

Nationwide, there are now about 263 children newly hospitalized a day for COVID-19, a 20% increase from the winter peak.

That national boom in pediatric hospitalizations has been driven largely by a few states. Only three states are responsible for nearly half of new daily hospitalizations for COVID-19 among children: Florida, which is reporting 56 new pediatric hospitalizations a day over a recent seven-day period; Texas, 42; and Georgia, 25. Most of the states that have higher-than-average rates are in the South.

Among the nation’s three most-populous states, the rate for new daily pediatric hospitalizations for COVID-19 per 100,000 children in Florida is 1.32; in Texas, it’s 0.57; and in California, it’s 0.2.

Experts say California is likely faring better because of relatively higher vaccination rates. Children under the age of 12 are not yet eligible for vaccines, but they can be better protected from COVID-19 if teenagers and adults around them are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.

Vaccination rates have lagged in the states with the highest rates of new COVID-19 hospitalizations among children, and some, such as Florida and Texas, have also banned local governments and schools from imposing mandatory mask mandates, although some local officials have pursued the orders anyway.

Doctors warn that healthy children can still become seriously ill with COVID-19. Last summer, more of the children admitted to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles for COVID-19 had underlying health problems, said Dr. Michael Neely, chief of its Division of Infectious Diseases. Now, “it’s striking kids who really were just healthy kids with no real medical problems.”

Advertisement

The youngest patient as of Tuesday was 2 weeks old and on oxygen, Neely said. Others ranged into their teens. All were unvaccinated, some because they were too young for the shots.

Delta “is not discriminating whether you have underlying problems or not,” said Dr. Daisy Dodd, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist with Kaiser Permanente Orange County. “It’s hitting anybody that is not immunized.”

COVID-19 outbreaks have been increasing in L.A. County schools and programs in recent weeks, although not to the same extent as during the autumn and winter. Out of 25 outbreaks that occurred between April and July, more than half were associated with youth sports, and associated with inconsistent mask wearing; socializing outside of games and practices; traveling and lodging together during training camps and athletic events.

Federal health officials say it’s expected that hospitalization rates will rise among children given the nature of the Delta variant, which is at least twice as transmissible as the Alpha variant and produces up to 1,000 times more levels of virus in the upper throat, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-diseases expert.

Because Delta is so highly transmissible, “you will see more children likely get infected,” Fauci said at a recent briefing. And “even though the percentage is small — a certain percentage of children will require hospitalization.”

There is no definitive evidence that children are suffering greater severity of disease from the Delta variant, Fauci said, although it remains a possibility.

Experts say that younger children have been less likely to contract COVID-19 because they have far fewer proteins called ACE2 receptors in their noses that the virus must access to infect the body.

California How to show vaccination proof amid California COVID mandates California state officials and private businesses are increasingly prepared to request proof of COVID-19 vaccination as a precondition of both work and play.

Among states that have been reporting the data, no more than 0.03% of all child cases of COVID-19 have resulted in death, according to a recent report by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Assn. And less than 1% of children with the virus have been hospitalized, that report found.

Still, some families who have endured the virus caution that people should not be cavalier about what it means for a child to get COVID-19.

A few weeks ago, Naomi Wilson had stopped at Starbucks after running an errand and was alarmed to realize that she couldn’t taste her brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso.

The Glendale resident, who was fully vaccinated, soon tested positive for the coronavirus, an example of a “breakthrough” infection. Her 16-month-old son, Micah, who is too young to be eligible for the vaccine, also got the virus. At first, the child seemed unaffected.

Then came the screaming: nights when he would wake up hourly, crying out in pain. Wilson took the toddler to urgent care, where a doctor examined his badly swollen throat and what looked like an ear infection. The doctor prescribed an antibiotic and instructed them to bring the boy back to the hospital if he failed to improve, Wilson said.

Micah never ended up being hospitalized, but “the whole thing was just terrifying,” Wilson said.

Another Glendale parent, Sari Sherwood, said that despite taking precautions, her entire family got COVID-19 in December, including her sons, ages 10 and 12. Her older son became so delirious that it was scary, she said.

“You’d ask him, ‘Do you want some soup? Are you hungry?’ And he’d say, ‘Fire truck,’” she recalled.

Her younger son got a fever that soon cleared, but “he seems to have the most trauma,” Sherwood said. “He is so scared of getting sick and of getting his father sick. ... The PTSD of kids is not being talked about.”

Experts urged that parents get their children tested for the coronavirus if they see symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19, such as fever, chills, difficulty breathing, fatigue, body aches, headaches, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose, nausea or diarrhea. Although most children who get infected will not need to be hospitalized, they can spread it to others who will, so testing ensures that they can be quarantined to protect others, said Neely of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.

Wilson, the mother of the Glendale toddler, credits vaccine-induced antibodies she had passed along to her son through nursing with protecting him from a more severe case of COVID-19.

She has shared her story as a “cautionary tale” to encourage parents to take COVID-19 seriously — and specifically to encourage pregnant and breastfeeding moms to get vaccinated.

Many parents “are still operating under this mindset where it doesn’t affect kids,” she said. “And I have seen firsthand that it really does.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The U.S. Marines dispatched Zak Lara to Afghanistan a decade ago, stationing him in Helmand province, where he guarded against Taliban advances and trained Afghan soldiers in Sangin, a community of 20,000.

He left seven months later at age 20, proud of having helped build wells and housing and thankful to have dodged death. Seventeen Marines from his unit were killed in action. Dozens survived with lost limbs. More later died by suicide. He got an honorable discharge and started a career in communications.

This week, Lara read with anguish the news of the Taliban’s capture of Lashkar Gah, the Helmand provincial capital, part of a lightning offensive as U.S. forces withdraw from Afghanistan.

“I’m conflicted,” said Lara, who lives in Los Angeles and grew up in Victorville. “How long do we need to be there? So many people dead. So much money. So many resources. But I also wonder, could we have stayed longer and done more?”

As the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks approaches, America’s longest war is likely to end the way it began. The U.S. once nearly extinguished the Taliban, the extremist Islamist group that had harbored Al Qaeda head Osama bin Laden while it governed Afghanistan. The Taliban is expected to soon move on the national capital of Kabul, an event the Biden administration is hastily preparing for by evacuating embassy staffers.

Those such as Lara, among the 800,000 U.S. troops to serve during the conflict, have spent the days revisiting their time in a more than $1-trillion war that has cost 2,448 American lives and far more Afghan casualties.

“It just feels like Vietnam all over again,” said retired U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Travis Mills of Manchester, Maine, who had both arms and legs amputated after a roadside bomb explosion outside Kandahar in 2012.

American leaders have long said the U.S. needed to leave the country, a position supported by voters in both major parties.

Former President Trump, whose administration held a long series of negotiations with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, set the departure in motion. President Biden has moved forward with the withdrawal, emphasizing this week that Afghans have “got to fight for themselves.”

For many veterans, whose lives, minds and bodies were forever changed by the war, the moment has rekindled questions of America’s role around the world, the sacrifices soldiers make and the reasons behind them.

Mills, who served for eight years, including three tours in Afghanistan with the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division based at Ft. Bragg, N.C., said he largely supported the troop withdrawal and wished it started years ago. But if it were up to him, he added, the U.S. would keep bases in Bagram and Kandahar — already abandoned — to provide air support to Afghan forces.

“For the people of Afghanistan, your heart goes out to them. You don’t want to leave them stranded,” he said. “I just hope that they can find a way to fight back.”

So far, that has not been the case. Afghan forces far outnumber Taliban fighters and have the advantage of an air force but have been repeatedly overrun. Over the last week, the Taliban has captured 18 of 34 provincial capitals, including the second-largest city, Kandahar.

“To put it plainly, it just sucks,” said retired Army Col. Arnold Strong, who did multiple tours in the country that included training Afghan security forces in Kabul.

Strong, 53, has spent recent days trying to help his former interpreter obtain a visa to relocate to the U.S. as part of a longstanding State Department program to resettle Afghans and Iraqis who aided the U.S. government. Living in comfort in the U.S., he felt guilty knowing Afghans who slept in fear.

“Here I am on my perch on the beach, whereas my friends in Afghanistan are wondering if they will live throughout the weekend,” the Long Beach resident said. “I am very supportive of President Biden’s decision to withdraw. That noted, the speed of it based on a relatively artificial timeline of Sept. 11 will have disastrous consequences for the Afghan people.”

Jen Burch, who served in the Air Force and volunteered as a medic in a Kandahar military hospital in 2011, said that after reading news of the Taliban’s march, she lost sleep and had flashbacks to violence during her service.

“To watch everything collapse, it’s just hard not to see and think that our leadership has failed us,” said Burch, 34, of Washington, D.C. She believes President George W. Bush and his successors have mismanaged the war.

“It’s been a rushed process to meet this goal” of troops going home, said Burch, who retired because of post-traumatic stress disorder in 2014 and is due to complete a degree in global studies at the University of Denver this fall. “Why do we have to do it around the anniversary?”

Generals and politicians have long agreed that the Taliban would almost surely regain power if the Americans were no longer around. But retired Green Beret Larry Wadsworth, who did two tours in Afghanistan, also saw a danger closer to home. Pulling out would leave the U.S. at the risk of another attack, he feared, though he doubted anything on the scale of Sept. 11.

“Americans notoriously turn a blind eye to the world, and unless something happens to them they don’t understand what third- and fourth-order effects are of decisions that are made,” said Wadsworth, who was injured by “friendly fire” in 2002 when a U.S. Air Force gunship mistook his team and allied Afghan forces for the enemy.

“As long as they’ve got their warm cup of tea or latte and nothing’s happening to them, they don’t care. They don’t understand the ramifications of us leaving that region, or the ramifications of the security of nations and of themselves,” he said.

Thomas Coffman, an Iowa winemaker who put in a year in Afghanistan with the Army and NATO, agreed with Wadsworth.

U.S. forces should have remained in the country just as they have stayed in Germany, Japan and South Korea since World War II and the Korean War, he said.

“We can’t just up and leave a place that’s ready to implode on itself like Afghanistan,” said Coffman, 52, who served from 2010 to 2011.

“There’s going to be regret for everybody who lost loved ones or who took a chapter out of their life there,” he added. “It’s going to make you think long and hard about the sacrifices everybody made.”

Coffman also thinks back to having seen old Soviet dome-style tanks lined up, and British field artillery cannons rusting away, in an area of the country near Kandahar that Alexander the Great invaded. “Everybody has trouble in Afghanistan,” he said, giving a nod to the fact that foreign armies have for centuries believed they had the right to remake the region only to retreat.

Not all veterans saw the withdrawal as an admission of defeat.

Marine Gunnery Sgt. Anthony Rios of Fallbrook, Calif., was about to return home from Afghanistan when he was hit in the left leg by a rocket-propelled grenade in 2010. Rios, 46, came home with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. Still, he said, he “would go back in a heartbeat.”

“When I was there, I did the right thing. I gave assistance, what was within my ability,” he said. “My job was to fight. I’m not a warmonger. I’m there to survive and to go home with the guys I came with. ... Victory is all in how you see things.”

Retired Army infantryman Isiah James, who grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and enlisted in 2005 when he was 18, first deployed to Iraq and then, several years later, to Afghanistan. He said he joined in order to explore the world.

While he was in Afghanistan, Navy SEALs killed Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011.

“I see that and I’m thinking, OK, why are we still here?” he said. “There was no reason for us to be here.

“My mission at that point was getting back to America alive,” James, 34, said. “That was it.”

James medically retired from the Army eight years ago. Today, he lives in New York and is a policy advisor for the Black Veterans Project.

He saw the war as one waged for too long with an unclear objective.

“What’s happening there now is exposing the lie we have seen for the past 20 years,” he said. “We were never training Afghans to truly fight and protect their country. … Now we are pulling the Band-Aid off the bullet wound, and the world is seeing it in real time.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain’s police watchdog says it has launched an investigation into why a 22-year-old man who fatally shot five people in southwestern England on Thursday was given back his confiscated gun and gun license last month.

Police have said Jake Davison killed his mother and four other people, including a 3-year-old girl, before taking his own life in the port city of Plymouth. It was Britain’s first mass shooting in more than a decade. Firearm crimes are rare in Britain, which has strict gun control laws and regulations.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct said late Friday it would investigate the Devon and Cornwall police department’s decision-making in relation to Davison’s possession of a shotgun and the license. The watchdog said it was not yet known whether the shotgun returned to Davison was the same one he used in Thursday’s shootings.

Police took away the gun and the certificate in December 2020 following an allegation of assault three months earlier, the watchdog office said. They were returned to Davison last month.

“We will examine what police actions were taken and when, the rationale behind police decision-making and whether relevant law, policy and procedures were followed concerning Mr. Davison’s possession of a shotgun,” the office’s regional director, David Ford, said in a statement.

“The investigation will also consider whether the force had any information concerning Mr. Davison’s mental health and if so, if this information was appropriately considered,” Ford said.

Hundreds attended a candlelight vigil in Plymouth on Friday, close to where the killings took place.

Police said Friday the motive for the shootings was unclear but there were no immediate signs they were an act of terrorism or that Davison had connections to extremist groups.

They said Davison shot and killed his 51-year-old mother, Maxine Davison, also known as Maxine Chapman, at a house before going into the street and killing 3-year-old Sophie Martyn and her father, Lee Martyn, 43.

According to the police timeline, Davison next killed Stephen Washington, 59, in a nearby park, before fatally shooting Kate Shepherd, 66, on a nearby street.

Two other people were wounded.

Shaun Sawyer, chief constable for Devon and Cornwall police, told reporters that investigators think the crimes started as “domestically related” and “spilled into the street.” He said the investigators were keeping open minds but do not think extremist ideology prompted the attack.

“Let’s see what’s on his hard drive, let’s see what’s on his computer, let’s see what’s on social media,” Sawyer said.

Davison appeared to post on YouTube under the name Professor Waffle. The account has been taken down and replaced with a notice saying it violated the site’s community guidelines. In a final 11-minute clip posted before the killings, “Professor Waffle” talks about how he was “beaten down and defeated by ... life.”

He talks about struggling to stay motivated to lose weight and work out, and working as a scaffolder at ages 17-18. He hinted at lacking a love life, referring to “people who are incels” — shorthand for “involuntarily celibate.”

The “incel” movement justifies violence against women as revenge for men who are rejected as sexual partners. The online subculture has been linked to deadly attacks in California, Toronto and Florida.

Davison said that while he wouldn’t describe himself as an “incel,” they are “people similar to me, they’ve had nothing but themselves, and then they’ve socially had it tough.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tropical Storm Grace formed Saturday morning in the Atlantic Ocean, while Fred remained a tropical depression headed into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Both systems were expected to bring heavy rain and flooding. Fred, which has already been classified as a tropical storm before, could regain such strength later in the day or on Sunday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

Grace was centered about 420 miles east of the Leeward Islands and could reach the Lesser Antilles by Saturday night. It was moving west with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.

A tropical storm warning was issued for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the British Virgin Islands. Forecasters said Grace could reach the Dominican Republic by Monday.

Grace was forecast to bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico into Monday.

Meanwhile, Fred remained a tropical depression with top winds around 35 mph. Forecasters said the system appeared “disorganized,” and projecting that it would pass west of the lower Florida Keys on Saturday afternoon and then move into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Florida Keys west of the Seven Mile Bridge to the Dry Tortugas. Fred was centered Saturday morning 90 miles south of Key West, and it was moving west-northwest at 13 mph.

Once a tropical storm, Fred weakened to a depression by its spin over Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power to some 400,000 customers and caused flooding that forced officials to shut down part of the country’s aqueduct system, interrupting water service for hundreds of thousands of people. Local officials reported hundreds of people were evacuated and some buildings were damaged.

Fred was expected to bring 3 to 5 inches of rain to the Keys and southern Florida through Monday.

No evacuations are planned for tourists or residents in Monroe County, Keys officials said Friday. The county’s emergency management officials are advising people in campgrounds, recreational vehicles, travel trailers, live-aboard vessels and mobile homes to seek shelter in a safe structure.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Taliban fighters on Saturday seized the Afghan government’s last big northern stronghold, the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, according to news reports and provincial officials, dealing the latest staggering blow to the country’s beleaguered government.

At the same time, insurgents tightened a near-encirclement of Afghanistan’s capital, pushing to within a few dozen miles of Kabul as more American troops flew in to help with an airlift of U.S. Embassy personnel. The Biden administration said Saturday that an additional 1,000 U.S. service members would be deployed to aid in that effort, but the president again rejected criticism of the U.S. decision to conclude its overall Afghan mission by the end of this month.

“One more year, or five more years, of U.S. military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country,” President Biden said in a statement.

Meanwhile, an already dire humanitarian crisis deepened as tens of thousands of frightened refugees from cities and the countryside across Afghanistan thronged Kabul, fearing that the takeover of their communities meant a reimposition of harsh Taliban rule.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in his first televised address since the Taliban seized much of the country in a lightning offensive spanning the last nine days, appeared almost disconnected from the drumbeat of disastrous news. He cited “achievements” of the last two decades, coinciding with the U.S. military presence, and appealed that they not go to waste.

The Afghan leader, who has so far rebuffed pressure to resign, offered no concrete steps to counter Afghanistan’s rapid unraveling, other than saying that unspecified “serious measures” were being taken.

“My focus is on preventing further instability, violence, and displacement of my people,” Ghani said in brief prerecorded remarks. He said he was holding consultations with Afghan elders, political figures and international representatives.

But only hours after Ghani spoke, insurgents claimed a huge new prize: the country’s fourth-largest city. The fall of Mazar-i-Sharif was particularly significant, not only because of its strategic position as the main hub of the country’s north, but because it was defended by a pair of powerful ex-warlords whose fighters — unlike the Afghan security forces in most locales — had appeared prepared to offer staunch resistance.

Afghanistan’s warlord figures, however, are also known to cut deals and stage strategic retreats when their own survival is at stake. Reports circulated that the two prominent Taliban foes with substantial militias loyal to them — Atta Mohammad Noor and Abdul Rashid Dostum — took refuge in neighboring Uzbekistan. Only days earlier, Ghani had flown to Mazar to try to win pledges they would fight to keep the city from falling.

Earlier Saturday, pressing ahead with an onslaught that has left more than half of Afghanistan’s provincial capitals in their hands, Taliban fighters overran Pul-e-Alam, a gateway town south of Kabul, according to news agency reports citing local officials. The province of Paktika, bordering Pakistan, was also said to be in Taliban hands.

Rounding out a day of setbacks, the eastern province of Kunar and Mehtar Lam, the provincial capital of Laghman province northeast of Kabul, fell without fights, according to Afghan lawmakers. And the central province of Daikundi surrendered with only two gunshots heard in the capital, Nili, a lawmaker said, according to the Associated Press.

The Taliban’s stunning territorial gains of recent days — together with the seizure of millions of dollars of U.S.-bankrolled military equipment — marked a high-water point in the Taliban drive to return to power after being toppled in a U.S.-led invasion following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The Islamist group, which had harbored the Al Qaeda extremists who launched the attacks on New York and the Pentagon, imposed brutal fundamentalist rule for five years before losing power.

In what has become a pattern repeated across Afghanistan’s north, south and west, Taliban fighters were reported to have encountered little resistance from Afghan security forces when they took control of Pul-e-Alam, the capital of Logar province, only 40 miles from Kabul.

As the week drew to a close, the Taliban movement cemented its grip on a string of cities including Kandahar, the country’s second-largest metropolis and the main hub of Afghanistan’s south. The fall of Mazar-i-Sharif leaves the country’s three biggest cities after Kabul in the insurgents’ control.

With the wholesale crumbling of Afghan forces the United States spent billions of dollars equipping and training, the only major city still in government hands besides Kabul was Jalalabad, in the east.

The insurgents have been methodically cutting transport links between Kabul and other major cities, taking aim Saturday at Maidan Shahr, on the main highway connecting the national capital and Kandahar, according to news agencies.

Most of the U.S. forces dispatched to help secure diplomatic personnel and Afghan support staff — two Marine battalions and an infantry battalion — were to be in place by Sunday evening, the Pentagon said. On Saturday, after a White House statement referred to a total of 5,000 troops aiding in the operation, a senior Defense Department official then broke that number down as 4,000 military personnel en route or already on the ground, with an additional 1,000 now being deployed as well.

Although it wasn’t clear whether the Taliban would move swiftly to try to take Kabul, or simply isolate it while weighing the next step, more Western countries are preparing to pull up diplomatic stakes. U.S. diplomats, along with those of other countries, were destroying sensitive documents in preparation for possible departure.

But the pullback comes as tens of thousands of Afghans are frantically pleading for documentation to help them leave the country.

The internally displaced — whose ranks have grown by 250,000 just since May, according to the United Nations — are camped out in Kabul parks and squares, having made the trek from the provinces to seek safety in Kabul. Food hoarding is taking hold across the city, and many of those who fled the Taliban’s advance have nothing but clothes and perhaps some simple bedding, humanitarian groups said.

Speaking in New York on Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Afghanistan was “spinning out of control” and called for urgent talks to stem the growing chaos.

“This is the moment to start serious negotiation,” he said. “This is the moment to avoid a prolonged civil war, or the isolation of Afghanistan.”

The threat of international pariahdom is one of the few possible means of leverage the international community says it can try to wield against the Taliban. So far, warnings of an aid cutoff have had little apparent effect.

It was unclear whether the Biden administration would be able to keep to its pledge to finish withdrawing U.S. troops by month’s end. Before the current phase of the crisis erupted, the U.S. presence had been reduced to between 2,500 and 3,000 troops. Now an equal number are arriving.

At the onset of this month’s Taliban offensive, U.S. officials pointed to the numerical superiority and firepower advantages of Afghan security forces, but there is growing acknowledgment that the Afghan police and military have been hollowed out by rampant corruption, low morale, a lack of basic supplies like food, and the abrupt withdrawal of the technical support of U.S.-paid contractors.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The day began with the blaring cacophony of traffic as Kabulis rushed headlong to attend to last-minute business: a frantic search for an ATM still dispensing cash, a fruitless journey to a shuttered shop, a harrowing trip to the airport in hopes of escaping an advancing foe.

And it ended, in this noisiest of cities, with near-silence — and with broadcast images of turbaned Taliban inside the Afghan presidential palace, the opulent, fortified compound in the heart of the capital whose name means “citadel.”

Kabul, transformed over the past 20 years into a cosmopolitan city of bodybuilding gyms and burger joints, gaudy wedding halls and frozen-yogurt bars, had fallen to the insurgents in the same manner as much of the rest of the country: with hardly a fight.

Advertisement

That surreal defeat — as if a film was suddenly fast-forwarded — seemed to herald a return to darker, more repressive times.

Within hours of the first Taliban fighters appearing early Sunday on the city’s outskirts, President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country, signaling the government’s effective collapse. The U.S. Embassy was emptied of its staff; helicopters clattered overhead, carrying diplomats to the airport.

In the sweltering summer heat of Kabul’s streets, tempers were short and nerves frayed. Fistfights broke out at some intersections. Faces of passersby were stamped with expressions of sadness or anger, or both. Pedestrians — adults and small children — wove between cars caught in standstill traffic jams.

Among city residents, word spread quickly of a prison break at a gigantic jail on the city’s east side. By nightfall, warnings circulated on social media, telling people to stay inside and lock their doors.

Throughout the day, Afghan police abandoned checkpoints and traffic posts across Kabul. Within hours, some had been replaced by Taliban fighters.

The insurgents’ leadership issued a statement saying the only Taliban aim in the city was preserving order and safety — but ordinary people spoke only of their fear. Near the city center, one Afghan soldier made a throat-slitting motion.

“Afghanistan is dead. I am dead,” he said.

Despite two decades of an American-led military presence that was deeply woven into daily life in Kabul — blast walls and barricades, lumbering armored vehicles and fortified checkpoints — many in the city had always suspected the Taliban would be back. With the Taliban toppled a scant two months after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, many of the movement’s disciples blended in and bided their time, knowing their day would come.

On Sunday, as bearded fighters fanned out across the city, women and girls feared the loss of chances to work and study, and men wondered how they would keep their families and livelihoods safe. Kabul remained the capital, but the Taliban were already referring to the country as they had back during their five-year rule: the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

At the international airport, there were desperate scenes as people tried to shove their way inside the terminal in hopes of catching a plane to somewhere, anywhere. Commercial air traffic was halted; only military and official flights were coming and going.

The roar of a helicopter overhead could be heard in the background of a video posted on Facebook by former President Hamid Karzai. With his three little girls surrounding him, their expressions innocent and puzzled, he declared that “we are trying to solve the issue of Afghanistan with the Taliban leadership, peacefully.”

As day turned to night, an uncanny quiet fell, with the remnants of Ghani’s government calling for calm. The Afghan interior minister, Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal, said government forces were helping to maintain security — though few were in evidence by nightfall.

The minister called for a 9 p.m. curfew, telling people to stay off the streets, but it was hard to know whether residents were obeying that directive, or simply hunkering down because they were too afraid to venture out.

As twilight fell, a small contingent of Afghan soldiers were still at their posts on Wazir Akbar Khan hill, overlooking one of the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods. One of them wanted his picture taken near the giant Afghan flag that flies on the hilltop, a landmark that can be seen from far away.

City lights twinkled; only the clinking of the flag’s metal halyard against the flagpole broke the silence. The soldiers looked solemn.

The soldier who asked for a keepsake photo wasn’t a native of Kabul; he was from Badakhshan province, in the far northeast. But for him, he said, the city’s fall was “like a quick death.”

He and his comrades planned to try to return to their home provinces, though he said they would fight if insurgents came to their homes — fearing, like many who worked for the government and security forces, that they might face reprisal.

Back in his shanty-like quarters, the soldier looked around, let out a deep sigh.

Then, for the last time, he took off his uniform.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Afghan President Ashraf Ghani slipped out of his country Sunday in the same way he had led it in recent years — a lonely and isolated figure.

Ghani quietly left the sprawling presidential palace with a small coterie of confidants — and didn’t even tell other political leaders who had been negotiating a peaceful transition of power with the Taliban that he was heading for the exit.

Abdullah Abdullah, his longtime rival who had twice buried his animosity to partner with Ghani in government, said that “God will hold him accountable” for abandoning the capital.

Ghani’s destination was not immediately known. In a social media post from an unknown location, he wrote that he left to save lives.

Advertisement

“If I had stayed, countless of my countrymen would be martyred and Kabul would face destruction and turn into ruins that could result to a human catastrophe for its six million residents” Ghani wrote.

Abdullah, as well as former President Hamid Karzai, who had beaten a path to Ghani’s door on numerous occasions to plead with him to put compromise above retaining power, were blindsided by the hasty departure.

They said they had still been hoping to negotiate a peaceful transition with the Taliban, said Saad Mohseni, the owner of Afghanistan’s popular TOLO TV.

“He left them in the lurch,” he said.

Earlier Sunday, Karzai had posted a message to the nation on his Facebook page, surrounded by his three daughters, to reassure Kabul residents that the leadership had a plan and was negotiating with the Taliban.

Just hours later, he discovered the presidential palace had been abandoned.

“Ghani’s inability to unite the country and his proclivity to surround himself with his cadre of Western-educated intellectuals brought Afghanistan to this point,” said Bill Roggio, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a U.S.-based research institute. “As Afghanistan collapsed, he refused to deal with the problems and further isolated himself from the power brokers he needed to deal with the problem, and the Afghan people as well.”

Ghani’s style of rule was often characterized as cantankerous and arrogant, rarely heeding the advice of his government and often publicly berating those who challenged him.

He was accused by ethnic minorities of championing the ethnic Pashtuns, like himself, seeing himself as a counter to the Taliban, who are mostly from the same ethnic group. He alienated other ethnic minorities and the gap between Afghanistan’s ethnic groups grew ever wider.

As he campaigned for the presidency in 2014, Ghani was taking an anger management course. It seemed to have faltered as multiple tribal elders in meetings with the president have spoken of his verbal lashings.

Ghani’s critics say his heavy-handed leadership style is to blame, to some degree, for the rapid disintegration of the Afghan army and an anti-Taliban alliance of warlords who fled or surrendered to the insurgents rather than fight for a widely unpopular president.

“His downfall was his insistence on centralizing power at all costs and a stubborn refusal to bring more people under his tent,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the U.S.-based Wilson Center. “Later on, his inability to develop a clear strategy to address the Taliban insurgency and perceptions that he was obstructing the peace process hurt him as well.”

Ghani, 72, spent most of his career overseas as a student and academic before returning to Afghanistan in 2002.

He arrived with a powerful set of economic credentials. He was attractive to the West with his World Bank background and was seen as a possible solution to Afghanistan’s crumbling and corrupt economy. He was finance minister for two years until 2004. He survived cancer.

In 2014 he fought his first presidential race. It was criticized as deeply flawed and allegations of widespread fraud threatened to destabilize the still fragile nation. Both Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah claimed victory. In the end, the United States brokered a compromise and divided power between the two men and even created a new position of chief executive.

The next election in 2019 fared the same. Again, accusations swirled of deep corruption and both Ghani and Abdullah declared themselves president. They eventually ended months of bickering and Abdullah became head of the National Reconciliation Council that was to bring Afghanistan’s warlords and political leaders together to put a united face before the Taliban.

But Ghani’s belligerent operating style undermined him again.

“He worked with a very small circle of ‘yes’ men and got filtered news about the country from them,” said Torek Farhadi, a former advisor to the Afghan government. “Others didn’t dare talk truth to him. He replaced all experienced people in the army and the government with junior people beholden to him. In a traditional country, Ghani was the guy who governed upside down.”

As the Trump administration opened negotiations with the Taliban in 2016, Ghani was asked by U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to cobble together a strong united team — one that could conduct tough negotiations with the Taliban. Efforts quickly faltered.

In April, a frustrated U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken urged Ghani to forge a united stand. He warned the president that he had to expand his circle and be inclusive.

“Unity and inclusivity ... I believe is essential for the difficult work ahead,” Blinken wrote.

“Even with the continuation of financial assistance to your forces from the United States after an American military withdrawal, I am concerned the security situation will worsen and that the Taliban could make rapid territorial gains,” Blinken warned.

Roggio, of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said there are many reasons for the government’s collapse, but “Ghani was not the man to lead Afghanistan during its darkest hour.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The rapid collapse of Afghanistan’s government to the Taliban has left American officials increasingly concerned about the potential for a rise in terrorist threats against the United States.

Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told senators on a briefing call Sunday that U.S. officials are expected to alter their earlier assessments about the pace of terrorist groups reconstituting in Afghanistan, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press.

In June, the Pentagon’s top leaders said an extremist group like Al Qaeda may be able to regenerate in Afghanistan and pose a threat to the U.S. homeland within two years of the American military’s withdrawal from the country.

But based on the evolving situation, officials now believe Al Qaeda and others may be able to grow much faster than expected, according to the person, who had direct knowledge of the briefing but was not authorized to discuss the details of the call publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

The Pentagon was sending an additional 1,000 troops directly into Kabul to assist evacuating U.S. personnel, bringing the total number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to about 6,000, a U.S. Defense official said. The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a deployment decision not yet announced by the Pentagon.

The Biden administration officials on the call with senators — among them were Milley, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III — said U.S. intelligence agencies are working on forming a new timeline based on the evolving threats, the person familiar with the matter said.

The intelligence community must create a new threat assessment amid widespread criticism of its evaluation of how quickly the Afghan government would fall. The Taliban entered Kabul less than a week after reports that military intelligence assessed that the capital could be surrounded in 30 days.

Current and former officials on Sunday pushed back against criticism of what was widely seen as an intelligence failure. One senior intelligence official said that “a rapid Taliban takeover was always a possibility,” adding: “As the Taliban advanced, they ultimately met with little resistance. We have always been clear-eyed that this was possible, and tactical conditions on the ground can often evolve quickly.” The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

But President Biden didn’t suggest such an outcome at a July 8 news conference, when he said “the likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely. ”

The pullback of U.S. military forces across Afghanistan over the last several months sharply limited intelligence agencies that worked side by side with troops. Without that military presence, spies would be severely limited in what they could collect about the morale of Afghan troops or support for the Taliban.

“If they leave, which they did, that means we leave as well,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, who held several roles related to Afghanistan during a 26-year career in the CIA. “And that certainly affects our intelligence gathering footprint.”

Connecticut Sen. Christopher S. Murphy, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has backed the Biden administration’s strategy and been in close touch with the White House, said in an interview that “the speed is a surprise” but that he would not characterize the situation as an intelligence failure. He said it has long been known that Afghanistan would fall to the Taliban if the United States pulled out.

“The Taliban has lots of reasons to honor their agreement with the United States and keep Al Qaeda at bay. And our mission now is to put ourselves in a position where we can monitor and verify that commitment,” he said.

During the briefing with members of the House, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy became furious after the administration officials would not confirm that President Ashraf Ghani had left the country, according to a person who participated in the meeting.

“Why are we doing this now?” McCarthy asked.

Ghani flew out of the country as the Taliban insurgents closed in on Sunday and posted on Facebook that he had chosen to leave the country to avert bloodshed in the capital. He did not say where he had gone.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the original question about Ghani’s whereabouts, and also asked about the status of American evacuations.

Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican and Green Beret who served in Afghanistan, sharply criticized the briefing for lawmakers as “a regurgitation of the president’s statement” from Saturday.

Waltz said Austin blamed the Afghan forces’ lack of will to fight, while Blinken cited the deadline set by former President Trump’s administration for an American withdrawal.

“There was no discussion of a path forward except some vague reassurances that they’ll protect the homeland,” Waltz said.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Afghans woke fearfully to both a new and old reality Monday with their country under the control of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist group that ruled Afghanistan with a brutal hand for five years before a U.S.-led invasion ousted it from power in 2001.

The Taliban captured major population centers with breathtaking speed last week, culminating in the fall Sunday of the capital, Kabul, and the ongoing flight of foreign diplomats, including ones from the U.S. There were reports Monday of chaotic scenes — and at least two deaths — at Kabul’s international airport amid the crush of people desperate to flee the country.

The millions of Afghans left behind now face a radically different government, and lifestyle, from the one they have known over the last two decades.

How will the Taliban rule? Have they changed?

When the Islamist insurgent group first came to power in 1996, it billed itself as a corrective movement in a society mired in the lawlessness of years of civil warfare.

Under its harsh interpretation of religious jurisprudence, women and girls were pushed almost completely out of public life and forbidden from employment and schooling. The Taliban imposed sartorial injunctions on both sexes, and mandated such brutal punishment as hand-chopping and execution by stoning — for infractions of its brand of Islamic law. It also banned television and music.

Lately, the militant group has sought to present a more benevolent image.

“We will respect rights of women,” said Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen in an interview with the BBC. “Our policy is that women will have access to education and work.”

But they will also have “to wear the hijab,” he added, referring to the Islamic head covering for women.

Other statements from the Taliban have sought to reassure Afghans and others that insurgents would not engage in looting or revenge killings against members of the former government, and that embassies, international missions and charities would be allowed to continue their work unperturbed. Even international journalists, the group said, could operate after registering with authorities.

Yet the group’s recent actions have been at odds with that rosy image, unverified reports say. In the areas it has recently overrun, girls’ schools have reportedly been closed, women have been plucked out of their place of employment and told to send a male relative in their stead; or forced into marrying a Taliban fighter. (A Taliban spokesman on Twitter vehemently dismissed the last assertion as propaganda.)

Opinion Op-Ed: The Afghanistan blame game has begun As the Taliban captures one capital after another in Afghanistan, the familiar Beltway parlor game of who “lost” the country has begun.

It has also re-imposed harsh punishments. Last month in the southwestern province of Helmand, the group’s fighters hanged two men it said had been convicted as child kidnappers. It kept their bodies swinging from a bridge for days.

And far from offering amnesty for those linked to the state, there have been ominous reports from residents on social media and elsewhere of militants going door-to-door asking for government employees. Months before the Taliban entered Afghanistan’s major cities, scores of activists, journalists, prominent female advocates and other members of civil society were killed in a Taliban assassination campaign.

What does it mean for neighboring nations?

The Taliban is now in control of every border crossing, including with Iran in the west; Pakistan in the east and south; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan on the north; and a finger-like strip of territory in the northeast leading to China’s Xinjiang region.

Several of those countries shut down their borders before the Taliban onslaught, amid fears of a flood of refugees. Pakistan, whose longtime embrace of the Taliban has emboldened jihadists on its soil and made its borders with Afghanistan especially porous, potentially has the most to lose. Still, with a transition now under way, several of those nations have taken a fait-accompli approach to the Taliban’s return and plan to recognize their government.

Behind that acquiescence are economic considerations: Afghanistan has billions of dollars worth of copper, iron, talcum and lithium. In recent days, China has already made in-roads with the Taliban, developing ties that it hopes will bloom into economic cooperation, including in its Belt and Road initiative. Russia and Iran have also met with Taliban leaders to discuss future ties.

What about the NATO countries?

For European members of NATO, the fall of the U.S.-backed Kabul government spurs fears of a refugee crisis similar to the one in 2015, when millions of Syrians escaping war at home sailed over the Mediterranean or trekked across Europe.

Those fears appear well-grounded. In recent days, as the Taliban blitzed through the country, many Afghans have frantically searched for a way out. On Sunday, as reports filtered in of Taliban fighters at the gates and the capital encircled, Kabul residents rushed to queue up in front of ATMs to take money so they could purchase the few airline tickets remaining before commercial flights were suspended Sunday.

Separated by an ocean, the U.S. has little cause to worry about a deluge of refugees, even as it faces international embarrassment. Washington’s main concern moving forward is that Afghanistan will become a safe haven again for militant groups — with the Taliban as their example.

“International jihadism is almost part of the Taliban’s identity,” said one former NATO representative and Afghanistan advisor, who spoke on background to be able to talk freely. He added that modus operandi of some parts of the Taliban rely on what he called “a business model for training and letting other jihadist networks operate in their territory.”

“That won’t change. This kind of strategic failure, this will impact America,” he said.

But it’s unclear what would could possibly make President Biden re-engage with a conflict he’s long wanted to leave.

“I was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan — two Republicans, two Democrats,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “I would not, and will not, pass this war on to a fifth.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Warning of tough days ahead with surging COVID-19 infections, the director of the National Institutes of Health said Sunday the U.S. could decide in the next couple weeks whether to offer coronavirus booster shots to more Americans this fall.

Dr. Francis Collins also pleaded anew for unvaccinated Americans to get their shots, calling them “sitting ducks” for a Delta variant that is ravaging the country and showing little sign of letting up.

“This is going very steeply upward with no signs of having peaked out,” he said.

Federal health officials have been actively looking at whether extra shots for the vaccinated may be needed as early as this fall, reviewing case numbers in the U.S. “almost daily” as well as the situation in other countries such as Israel, where preliminary studies suggest the vaccine’s protection against serious illness dropped among those vaccinated in January.

Israel has been offering a coronavirus booster to people over 60 who have already been vaccinated.

No U.S. decision has been made because cases here so far still indicate that people remain highly protected from COVID-19, including the Delta variant, after receiving the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna regimen or the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

But U.S. health officials made clear Sunday they are preparing for the possibility that the time for boosters may come sooner than later.

“There is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness,” Collins said. “And Delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with. The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with healthcare providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward” with others, such as older Americans.

He said because the Delta variant only started hitting the U.S. hard in July, the “next couple of weeks” of case data will help the U.S. make a decision.

Moderna President Stephen Hoge said seeing some “breakthrough” infections emerge among the vaccinated within six months has been surprising, even if most symptoms so far have not been life-threatening. “I think that suggests we are going to need booster vaccines to get through the winter,” he said.

Last week, the Food and Drug Administration said people with weakened immune systems can get an extra dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to better protect them as the Delta variant continues to surge.

“If it turns out as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly, we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is President Biden’s chief medical adviser.

While the U.S. currently is seeing an average of about 129,000 new infections a day — a 700% increase from the beginning of July — that number could jump in the next couple weeks to 200,000, a level not seen since among the pandemic’s worst days in January and February, Collins said.

Both he and Fauci stressed that the best way to stem the virus is for the unvaccinated to get their shots.

Currently, about 60% of the U.S. population has gotten at least one dose and nearly 51% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Areas with low vaccination rates have been particularly hit hard with infections, such as Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Mississippi.

“That’s heartbreaking considering we never thought we would be back in that space again,” Collins said of surging infections. “But here we are with the Delta variant, which is so contagious, and this heartbreaking situation where 90 million people are still unvaccinated who are sitting ducks for this virus, and that’s the mess we’re in. We’re in a world of hurt.”

Fauci said as more people get their shots, in many places everyone — both the vaccinated and unvaccinated — will have to do their part with “mitigation,” such as mask-wearing in schools and other public spaces.

“We’ve just got to realize that we’re dealing with a public health crisis,” he said. “The more you get infections, the more spread you get, the greater opportunity the virus has to continue to evolve and mutate.”

Collins spoke on “Fox News Sunday,” Fauci appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and Hoge was on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There are plenty of places to turn for accurate information about COVID-19. Your physician. Local health departments. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But not, perhaps, your local government’s public comment session.

During a meeting of the St. Louis County Council earlier this month, opponents of a possible mask mandate made so many misleading comments about masks, vaccines and COVID-19 that YouTube removed the video for violating its policies against false claims about the virus.

“I hope no one is making any medical decisions based on what they hear at our public forums,” said County Councilwoman Lisa Clancy, who supports mask wearing and said she believes most of her constituents do too. The video was restored, but Clancy’s worries about the effect of that misinformation remain.

Videos of local government meetings have emerged as the latest vector of COVID-19 misinformation, broadcasting misleading claims about masks and vaccines to millions and creating new challenges for internet platforms trying to balance the potential harm against the need for government openness.

The latest video to go viral features a physician who made several misleading claims about COVID-19 while addressing the Mount Vernon Community School Corp. in Fortville, Ind., on Aug. 6. In his six-minute remarks, Dr. Dan Stock tells the board that masks don’t work, vaccines don’t prevent infection, and state and federal health officials don’t follow the science.

The video has amassed tens of millions of online views, and prompted the Indiana State Department of Health to push back. Stock did not return multiple messages seeking comment.

“Here comes a doctor in suspenders who goes in front of the school board and basically says what some people are thinking: The masks are B.S., vaccines don’t work and the CDC is lying — it can be very compelling to laypeople,” said Dr. Zubin Damania, a California physician who received so many messages about the Indiana clip that he created his own video debunking Stock’s claims.

Damania hosts a popular online medical show under the name ZDoggMD. His video debunking Stock’s comments has been viewed more than 400,000 times so far. He said that while there are legitimate questions about the effectiveness of mask requirements for children, Stock’s broad criticism of masks and vaccines went too far.

YouTube removed several similar videos of local government meetings in North Carolina, Missouri, Kansas and Washington state. In Bellingham, Wash., officials responded by temporarily suspending public comment sessions.

The false claims in those videos were made during the portion of the meeting devoted to public comment. Local officials have no control over what is said at these forums, and say that’s part of the point.

In Kansas, YouTube pulled video of the May school board meeting in the 27,000-student Shawnee Mission district in which parents and a state lawmaker called for the district to remove its mask mandate, citing “medical misinformation.”

The district, where a mask mandate remains in effect, responded by ending livestreaming of the public comment period. District spokesman David Smith acknowledged that it has been challenging to balance making the board meetings accessible and not spreading fallacies.

“It was hard for me to hear things in the board meeting that weren’t true and to know that those were going out without contradiction,” Smith said. “I am all about free speech, but when that free speech endangers people’s lives, it is hard to sit through that.”

After hearing from local officials, YouTube reversed its decision and put the videos back up. Earlier this month the company, which is owned by Google, announced a change to its COVID-19 misinformation policy to allow exceptions for local government meetings — though YouTube may still remove content that uses remarks from public forums in an attempt to mislead.

“While we have clear policies to remove harmful COVID-19 misinformation, we also recognize the importance of organizations like school districts and city councils using YouTube to share recordings of open public forums, even when comments at those forums may violate our policies,” company spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said.

The deluge of false claims about the virus has challenged other platforms too. Twitter and Facebook each have their own policies on COVID-19 misinformation, and say that like YouTube they attach labels to misleading content and remove the worst of it.

Public comment sessions preceding local government meetings have long been known for sometimes colorful remarks from local residents. But before the internet, if someone were to drone on about fluoride in the drinking water, for instance, their comments weren’t likely to become national news.

Now, thanks to the internet and social media, the misleading musings of a local doctor speaking before a school board can compete for attention with the recommendations of the CDC.

It was only a matter of time before misleading comments at these local public forums went viral, according to Jennifer Grygiel, a communications professor at Syracuse University who studies social media platforms.

Grygiel suggested a few possible ways to minimize the effect of misinformation without muzzling local governments. Grygiel said clear labels on government broadcasts would help viewers understand what they’re watching. Keeping the video on the government’s website, instead of making it shareable on YouTube, could allow local residents to watch without enabling the spread of videos more widely.

“Anytime there is a public arena — a city council hearing, a school board meeting, a public park — the public has the opportunity to potentially spread misinformation,” Grygiel said. “What’s changed is it used to stay local.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A warehouse where fuel was illegally stored exploded in northern Lebanon early Sunday, killing 20 people and burning dozens more in the latest tragedy to hit the Mediterranean country in the throes of a devastating economic and political crisis.

It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion near the border with Syria. Fuel smuggling operations have been ongoing for months.

The Lebanese Red Cross said a fuel tanker exploded and its teams recovered 20 bodies from the site in the border village of Tleil. In a statement, it said it evacuated 79 people who were injured or suffered burns in the blast. Hours after the blast, Lebanese Red Cross members were still searching the area for more victims as Lebanese soldiers cordoned the area.

A Lebanese military official said the explosion occurred after the army confiscated a warehouse in Tleil where about 60,000 liters of gasoline were stored and the order was given to distribute the fuel to residents of the area. Residents had gathered to acquire the scarce commodity, available only on the black market at exorbitant prices or not at all.

It was not clear what caused it, the official said told the Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

Outside the Salam hospital in the northern city of Tripoli, a woman collapsed after she was told her son succumbed to his wounds.

“Oh, my God. He has little kids,” said the woman as she wept. “Why did you leave me, Ahmad?”

A young man standing nearby cried: “We will go to your homes and burn you there,” a reference to Lebanon’s political leaders, blamed for decades of corruption and mismanagement that has led the country to bankruptcy.

At a hospital in Beirut, where some of the burn victims were brought, Marwa el-Sheikh from Tleil was waiting for word about her brother, who was being treated for burns, and her brother-in-law, a retired soldier, who was still missing.

“Some people were burned beyond recognition,” she told the AP. “They are the victims of the shortcomings and carelessness of our politicians who led us to this.”

A nighttime video circulating online showed residents gathered at the site before the explosion, filling up gallons with fuel. AP footage showed the charged remains of what appears to be part of a tanker that exploded. Lebanese soldiers, a Red Cross vehicle and other trucks could be seen in the area.

Hospitals in northern Lebanon were calling for blood donations of all types. Lebanese Health Minister Hamad Hassan called on hospitals in northern Lebanon and the capital, Beirut, to receive those injured by the explosion, adding that the government will pay for their treatment.

The explosion comes as Lebanon faces a severe fuel shortage that has been blamed on smuggling, hoarding and the cash-strapped government’s inability to secure deliveries of imported fuel.

The shortages have paralyzed the country long dependent on private generators to light up their homes. Most of those generators have now turned off their engines because of the crippling diesel shortages. The American University Medical Center on Saturday warned it may be forced to shut down in less than 48 hours due to fuel shortages, which would threaten the lives of its critically ill patients.

Tleil is about 2.5 miles from the Syrian border, but it was not immediately clear if the fuel in the tanker was being prepared to be smuggled to Syria, where prices are much higher compared with those in Lebanon.

The fuel crisis deteriorated dramatically this week after the central bank decided to end subsidies for fuel products — a decision that will likely lead to price hikes of almost all commodities in Lebanon, already in the throes of soaring poverty and hyperinflation.

On Saturday, Lebanese troops deployed to petrol stations, forcing owners to sell fuel to customers. Some gas station owners have been refusing to sell, waiting to make gains when prices increase with the end of subsidies.

The Lebanese army also has been cracking down on smugglers active along the Syrian border, confiscating thousands of liters of gasoline over the past days. El-Sheikh said residents had gathered around the confiscated petrol at Tleil, where the army was giving it for free, when the explosion happened.

Lebanon has for decades suffered electricity cuts, partly because of widespread corruption and mismanagement in the small Mediterranean nation of 6 million, including 1 million Syrian refugees.

Sunday’s explosion was the deadliest in the country since an Aug. 4, 2020, blast at Beirut’s port killed at least 214, wounded thousands and destroyed parts of the capital.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is proposing a procedural vote this month that would set up future passage of two economic measures crucial to President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda, a move Democratic leaders hope will win votes from unhappy party moderates.

In a letter Sunday to Democratic lawmakers, Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested that the House will take a single vote that would clear an initial hurdle for both a budget resolution and a separate infrastructure bill. The budget blueprint would open the gate for Congress to later consider a separate $3.5-trillion, 10-year bill for social and environment programs.

Nine centrist Democrats said Friday that they would vote against the budget resolution until the House first approves the bipartisan $1-trillion package of road, railway and other infrastructure projects. That measure, which the Senate approved last week, is the top priority for moderates, who want to bank a quick win by sending it to Biden for his signature.

By forcing lawmakers to vote on moving both measures an initial step forward together, Democratic leaders hope moderates will be forced to abandon their threat — at least for now — and join the rest of the party in pushing its economic and social agenda toward eventual passage.

Politics Slow journalism: Something to add to your summer reading list Slowing down, reporting details in depth and writing at length can produce better and more accurate descriptions of the world, even in the Internet Age.

In the face of solid Republican opposition, Democrats can lose no more than three defectors to pass legislation through the closely split House. Democrats are calling the House back from summer recess on Aug. 23.

“Our goal is to pass the budget resolution the week of August 23rd so that we may pass Democrats’ Build Back Better agenda” as fast as possible, Pelosi wrote, using the name for Biden’s overall economic plans.

She said the initial procedural vote she wants the House to take “will put us on a path to advance” both the infrastructure and the social and environment measures.

The $3.5-trillion measure is the top priority for progressive Democrats. Passing the budget resolution is pivotal because that would shield the $3.5-trillion bill from Republican Senate filibusters, or delays, that would kill it.
