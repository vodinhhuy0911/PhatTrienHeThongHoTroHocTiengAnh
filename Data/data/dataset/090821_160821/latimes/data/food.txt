Every piece of nigiri shaped by Morihiro Onodera’s hands reminds me to appreciate the humbler beauty beneath the shiny overlay.

In matters of sushi, the sea treasures will always vie for the limelight: uni in the soft shades of Renoir’s oranges, tuna glowing deep reds and creamy pinks, saba cut to accentuate a curving streak of silvery skin. Onodera — “Mori” or “Mori-san” to the fan base he’s accrued over nearly 40 years in Los Angeles — pays the rice underneath equal respect. His care begins at the source. Last decade he helped bankroll a farm in Uruguay growing nutty, slightly chewy rice to his proclivities. By next year he’ll be serving a variety he’s commissioned in Iwate prefecture, the region along the northeast coast of Japan’s main island where he grew up.

Until then, he’s using sweet koshihikari rice produced in the Ibaraki prefecture north of Tokyo. He polishes unhulled shipments daily at Morihiro, his tiny new sushi restaurant in Atwater Village. During service the milling machine sits like an art piece, shiny and silent, on a perch to the left of the six-seat sushi bar.

The pearly rice clumps together easily in Onodera’s palm when he forms nigiri, and separates just as readily when consumed: The grains are so distinct I could probably count them with my tongue (if I wasn’t so absorbed in the collective pleasure).

If the ripple of crises over the last 17 months swiftly and mercilessly razed a top stratum of Eurocentric haute cuisine in Los Angeles (Somni, Dialogue, Trois Mec, Auburn, Lucques, Patina and Bon Temps number among the losses), our high-end sushi culture has, by and large, weathered the decimation. You can experience seasonal rarities on mesmerizing pottery at Little Tokyo newcomers Sushi Kaneyoshi and Sushi Hide; roll with the baroque, glittered stylings at Go’s Mart in Canoga Park or study Hiroyuki Naruke’s meticulous knife skills in the solemn silence of Q Sushi downtown; consider the intensifying effects of aging fish at Sushi Inaba or surrender to the seamless, fast-clipped choreography at Nozawa Bar in Beverly Hills.

Onodera has a special place in L.A. His talents flourished as the city’s tastes in sushi awakened, evolved and diversified. He arrived in 1985 and worked at two defining sushi restaurants: Katsu on Hillhurst and Nobu Matsuhisa’s Beverly Hills game-changer, Matsuhisa. Along the way he trained with Jiro Ono. For 11 years Onodera ran his own place, Mori Sushi in West L.A., which he opened in 2000. He reappeared briefly at Shiki in 2017, followed by a gig at Inn Ann, the restaurant perched in the farthest and highest corner of the garish Hollywood & Highland shopping center. The food was spectacular, even if the location felt odd to the point of fiction.

“Here is much better,” Onodera sighed across the sushi bar in Atwater Village, laughing and shaking his head.

He returned to restaurant ownership in November, and as with many sushi restaurants he floated his business by selling elaborate takeout bentos and chirashi feasts before indoor dining resumed in the spring. During the pandemic’s hardest days, when memories reared up even when I wanted to squash them back down, I dreamed of Onodera’s sushi rice. “Body temperature” is the analogy often used to describe its ideal degree of warmth for nigiri. At Morihiro that means somewhere between the heat you feel on your wrist when you take your pulse and the warmest zone in the center of your chest.

Cold from a carryout box, the rice was good. Being able to once again eat it freshly cooked as intended, though, is utterly life-affirming.

Diners reach for nigiri at Morihiro. (Maggie Shannon / For The Times)

Diners choose from among three tiers at the restaurant. Four-course meals, served at one of the room’s seven tables, range from $65 to $100, depending on the amount of sushi. They include small appetizers — likely pickles, a square of homemade tofu and other daily whims — with miso soup and a small dessert. A $45 version centers around three sushi rolls. These are satisfying meals, full stop.

An extravagant omakase, an investment of appetite and funds, costs $250 per person at a table and starts at $350 per person in front of Onodera at the sushi bar. If that price makes you blink, or scowl, know that devotees keep the sushi bar seats booked for weeks out. (It’s the same, online sleuthing tells me, at first-rate sushi restaurants across L.A. charging similar amounts.) I slipped in on a Sunday night when there happened to be a cancellation.

Sitting in the middle of the action, facing the master, felt like dropping in on a workshop in full production mode. Stacks of ceramics on three rows of shelves behind him emphasized the impression; Onodera has been making his own earthy, elegant tableware for much of his career. He stood at the counter surrounded by sous chefs Lily Sugiyama and Yoko Hasebe and pastry chef Laura Ochikubo. They worked calmly and furiously. Some sushi bars radiate serenity, or gravity. This scene exuded a chaotic sort of warmth. The realness pulled me in.

First dish: homemade tofu, made with particularly sweet soy milk from Kyoto, crowned with a dot of freshly grated wasabi and set in a pool of soy sauce. It came in a glossy bowl the color of a robin’s egg with a speckled brown glaze around the inner rim. The presentation amplified the tofu’s smoothness; it was as custardy to the eyes as it was to the palate.

At least five more starter courses arrived apace. A zensai plate held small tastes that burbled as much with texture as flavor: marinated salmon roe that burst on the roof of the mouth; slices of steamed abalone paired with yuzu koshu for bright, peppery blasts; a long, slim, al dente ear of baby white corn; seaweed in vinaigrette with okra and the Japanese ginger called myoga; and startlingly beautiful salt-cured cherry blossoms suspended in plum wine gelatin.

Between the sashimi of Hokkaido scallop and the mound of big-eye tuna tartare dolloped with a heaping tablespoon of caviar, I wondered if I might be starting to feel full.

Then the procession of nigiri began. I took a picture of the silvery saba, sliced to evoke a serpent’s tail slithering onto its mottled plate.

I told myself to put down the phone and be present. Onodera’s charisma is part of his legend. One minute he’s as serious as a jeweler perfecting a ring for his own dearest. The next he’s as casually jokey as your coolest uncle.

I watched and remembered how his hands have minds of their own. His eyes are taking in customers coming through the door, noting the pacing of his team, nodding to manager Tokiko Binkley as she pours a daiginjo sake with unmistakable banana notes. His fingers and palms keep working — forming nigiri, or molding rice and crinkling sheets of seaweed into rolls.

He placed each piece in front of me. I reached out to match his rhythm. We settled into the communion that hard-core sushi adherents live for: the cool (and sometimes gently warmed) seafood against fleshy rice, the tingling blaze of freshly grated wasabi, the intimacy of the exchange and the anticipation of what comes next.

During a grouping of fishes in the mackerel and herring families, Mori-san pointed out the kohada, or gizzard shad. Curing and vinegar teased out a hanger-steak-of-the-sea meatiness. “It’s my favorite,” he told the group. “Jiro’s favorite too.”

The night’s conclusion neared. After a hand roll filled with kanpyo (strips of sweet squash), Onodera asked the four of us remaining at the bar if we’d like more of anything. One of the couple next to me furrowed his brow. “We’re so full we can’t eat anything else,” he replied. “Please don’t blacklist us.”

While those of us with more room ate delicate mochi molded around matcha ice cream, Ochikubo pressed fresh taiyaki (fish-shaped waffles) for us to take home for breakfast. Often they’re filled with red bean paste; this night they oozed strawberry jam.

More than three hours after dinner began, I took one last sip of sake, exclaimed my thanks to Mori-san and his crew as they beamed back and finally staggered out of Morihiro. I gazed into the night — at El Buen Gusto restaurant across the street, at the Out of the Closet thrift store up the block and toward the mountains looming invisibly in the black distance.

This is what fine dining in Los Angeles is all about, I thought. Walking to the car I pulled the taiyaki out of its takeout box and burned my tongue trying to eat it. Didn’t matter. It was still delicious, and nothing could ruin the moment.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@My last memorable restaurant experience in 2020 was in November at one of the city’s modern classics: A.O.C. on West 3rd Street.

I couldn’t have known the meal would be a finish of sorts to the year. It was about two weeks before the Los Angeles County Department of Health suspended outdoor dining as COVID-19 cases spiked (and then kept climbing through the holidays). The interior courtyard of the restaurant’s rococo Spanish-Californian building was full that night; a staff member instead led me and my partner to a makeshift patio in an adjacent parking lot.

We tugged our table and inched our chairs closer to the nearest portable heater. The world felt dark in many ways.

Amid so much bleakness, the qualities that make A.O.C. a fundamental part of the city’s dining culture held fast. Our server’s we’re-in-this-together warmth still rings in my chest. My fellow hadn’t been to the restaurant since before its 2013 relocation, several blocks from the cramped bar where Caroline Styne (the wine director and front-of-house ace) and Suzanne Goin (the chef) first opened A.O.C. in 2002. He’d never had the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with Parmesan, one of Goin’s signature bites. We started there, with the tiny, porky cylinders hurling oversize flavors and textures as we bore into them.

The menu laid bare the season: pear and Manchego salad scattered with hazelnuts; sliced duck breast paired with an elegant apple-potato-bacon gratin; and a side of sweet potatoes tangled with spinach and sauced with nutty-smoky romesco. It was the kind of all-around-great meal that leaves you smiling to yourself — that puts you in a mind to reach over and hold your beloved’s hand on the car ride home.

We recalled that evening when we booked a birthday dinner at A.O.C. in late April. Fava beans and green garlic had replaced root vegetables. Strawberries and last-of-season blood orange segments hid in a salad’s extra-peppery arugula leaves.

Now that it’s July, apricot slivers and halved cherries tumble in the greens. Another salad, a mix of tomatoes that varyingly pop and squish, summons Greece with its other ingredients: purslane, inky olives, sharp feta. Fresh thyme perfumes prawns baked in the wood oven and served over sunny cornbread pudding.

These concentrated tastes of summer are unmistakably A.O.C. The setting is new, though, so eating them feels as if the dishes have somehow passed through a mirror’s reflection. Last month Styne and Goin opened a second A.O.C. in Brentwood, replacing the sprawling, ambitious Tavern that the two of them had run since 2009.

They wholly reconsidered the space, doing away with the glassed-in atrium and created an overall tone that’s clubbier and more timeless. Step to the right of the entrance into a dim room that retains the long bar from its Tavern days. Shades of charcoal, eggplant and walnut set the mood. A drink called the Yorkshire Sour (bourbon, lemon and strawberry dashed with rhubarb bitters) feels appropriate here, at least before you disappear into the deep wine list. The decibels can be thunderous when the room fills to capacity.

The other direction leads into a brighter area where the decor seems rightly designed around its mesmerizing green and gold wallpaper; I can imagine staring into its ornate, inkblot patterns in the breakfast room of a top-flight Parisian hotel. Beyond this stretch is an intimate alcove that’s still lively in sound but probably the restaurant’s quietest nook.

If the two A.O.C.s share little in common physically, they are identical twins philosophically. The menu redoubles the communal, small-plates ethos that Goin and Styne led the charge to codify in Los Angeles. The bounty is Californian; the oomph of flavors draws on cuisines distinct to the many cultures that exist around the continents-spanning Mediterranean Sea. Harissa slashes through the richness of beef cheeks. The bright, earthy and sour intensities of za’atar, sumac and labneh with preserved lemon surround lamb chops like a flashing aura.

Goin’s particular genius is in striking a taut balance: She follows the mantra of “let the ingredients speak for themselves” while also pushing flavors to heady extremes.

Sometimes this deftness comes through unexpectedly, as in what looks like a simple side of Swiss chard. The greens sponge up the saffron butter in which they’re sautéed; by the time the chard reaches the table the spice’s color and musk have permeated to a cellular level. It’s rich and fresh and a little bitter and all-around glorious.

Goin’s sly use of tension may best be savored in her long-running Ode to Zuni, a crisp-skinned roast chicken with soothing bread salad that riffs off of Judy Rodgers’ magnum opus recipe. Goin slips in fennel and green olives to disrupt the pure comfort-food vibes.

I’ve never had an experience at A.O.C. — either of them — that was less than solid. It can be downright thrilling right now in Brentwood with the key players on hand — the smooth service that lights up the room, the dishes powerful and dynamic in their fine-tuning.

A tip: Order something from the menu’s top section, labeled “to start.” The bacon-wrapped dates are listed there, as is the gratifying, always-changing “farmer’s plate” of roasted vegetables and spreads with grilled toast. It may sound random, but something about kicking off with one of these sets the timing on the right track. They zip out of the kitchen, helping to calm hunger, and then the rest of the courses tend to flow in a pleasing rhythm.

I brought a few first-timers with me to meals in Brentwood. Their reactions to some of the prices — $25 for a small fillet of sea bass with mustard and pancetta, the smart wines by the 6-ounce glass priced mostly in the teens to mid-20s — remind me that A.O.C. is essential, but it isn’t inexpensive.

At both locations, Goin and Styne have a decisive advantage in the dessert department: pastry chef Shannon Swindle, who has been with their group since 2019. I’ve been admiring Swindle’s sweets since we both worked in Dallas a dozen years ago; his precise, seasonal sensibility melds organically with Goin’s. In the same way that I seek focaccia covered with cherries and Taleggio or summer squash with chermoula among the sides on the savory menu, I’ll skip over Swindle’s chocolate torta and butterscotch pot de crème (wonderful as they are) for his of-the-moment fruit creations.

Back in November, his apple upside-down cake with sherry-soaked raisins and garam masala ice cream capped our evening with spice and cheer. Lately he’s been baking buttery apricot cake sprinkled with caramelized pistachios; frying ricotta fritters served with clouds of lemon cream and blueberry-verbena jam bleeding purple juice; and sending out peach and berry crumble still bubbling in its small cast-iron skillet, with vanilla ice cream atop melting like estuaries over craggy streusel.

It’s rare to the point of uncanny that an institution can duplicate its success — not just the cooking style and the systems but its spirit too. Goin, Styne and their team have pulled it off.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@At House of Mandi in Anaheim, a young server requires both hands to hoist a platter full of gold. The menu labels it “No. 7,” a hulking tray of rice, chicken and lamb stained in sunset shades of turmeric and saffron.

So many meaty, half-buried forms jut out from the grains that the eyes have trouble landing. Where to begin? Probably with a chicken leg, its skin crisp-soft and nearly orange from a cumin-forward spice rub. Next, reach for a forkful of lamb tugged from a shank and coupled with a stray almond sliver. Spoon sides of minted yogurt and tomato-chile chutney over the rice, making it as saucy as you like and tinkering with interplays of hot and cool. This is a place to slow down. Few customers appear rushed.

Mandi (the name for this feast) originates in Hadhramaut, Yemen, a region of craggy hills and fertile valleys in the country’s eastern-central region; it stretches to the coast of the Gulf of Aden, which flows into the Arabian Sea. Similar to covered-oven traditions that extend back to Mayan culture, the meats and rice for mandi have historically been cooked in pits over coals. “Underground,” Sarem Mohamed said in emphasis.

Mohamed runs the restaurant with his family. Their modern adaptation of mandi might lack the smoldering fragrance of the original method, but the meats emerge uniformly lush and a hint of smokiness threads through the spices.

Fahsa, a stew of shredded lamb and vegetables, comes to the table boiling and garnished with hilba (ground and soaked fenugreek beaten to the texture of whipped cream). (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)

House of Mandi opened in October. It anchors one end of the U-shaped Little Arabia Plaza, in the space that housed Olive Tree for 15 years before it closed last spring, sitting catty-corner from the wonderful Lebanese bakery Forn Al Hara and its za’atar-varnished manaeesh. In the surrounding few blocks, also unofficially dubbed “Little Arabia,” one can crunch through the bright green center of Palestinian-style falafel at Kareem’s; consider the textural shifts between grilled, baked and fried versions of Syrian kibbeh at Aleppo’s Kitchen; and satisfy sweet cravings with a gooey, crunchy slab of pastry from Knafeh Cafe.

Yemini cooking, its dishes indelibly scented by the trade routes that ran through the Arabian Peninsula and along the Red Sea, has been rare in Southern California restaurants. (A boomlet may be stirring, though: Monasaba, a small chain of Yemeni restaurants based in Canada, launched in nearby Stanton in April.) Without question House of Mandi concentrates on its namesake dish: There are 10 versions that vary in size and in combinations of meats, including a peppery variation of lamb called haneeth, served wrapped in foil to preserve its succulence.

But the menu goes further, surveying a gratifying swath of stews and breakfast staples. During one lunch a Jordanian friend who knows Yemeni cuisine well steered our order away from the overt, substantial pleasures of mandi; he wanted us to have the head and stomach space to give other specialties their due. He pointed me toward fahsa, lamb stew rushed to the table roiling volcanically in a stone pot, the way soondubu arrives erupting in Korean restaurants.

Floating atop the stew, melting but also astonishingly intact, is hilba, a scallion-flecked condiment made by soaking ground fenugreek in water and then beating it to the fluffy consistency of Cool Whip. Dairy-free cooks in search of an improbably creamy, savory garnish might want to experiment further with this miracle of science. I noticed instructions for hilba in “Sifratna,” an excellent cookbook on Yemeni food by Amjaad Al Hussain.

Breakfast dishes at House of Mandi include shakshuka, foul and lamb liver. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)

Once the fahsa cools you might eat it half with a spoon and half with the Yemeni flatbread delivered and replaced frequently by the staff. Wider than a basketball hoop and blistered near the center, it’s best when it’s as fresh from the oven as your fingers can handle.

As with the mandi, the kitchen presents variations on themes with stews: vegetable with ground beef, lamb and vegetable; all-vegetable; and shrimp with tomato and garlic. Each appears in its small bubbling cauldron, most graced with hilba.

Shafoot, a salad of herbed yogurt and cucumbers layered over delicate crepes that bring to mind extra-thin injera, moves in like a cold front between mouthfuls of stew.

The restaurant opens at 11 a.m.; its breakfast options appeal any time of day. (Al Hussain notes in her book that her family frequently enjoys morning dishes for dinner.) Ubiquitous shakshouka comes in scrambled form, the medium-firm curds gripping diced tomatoes and onions. A soothing, pureed version of foul (dried fava beans) with a generous glug of olive oil is ideal for dipping bread. In this mix I also love an order of spiced lamb liver sauteed with onions and tomatoes. Its iron richness rings strong and true among the other flavors.

The menu repeatedly refers to “Yemeni sauce.” That’s zahawiq, also called salata harra, a spicy condiment that’s more widely known these days as zhoug — its adoptive name in Israel and throughout much of the Middle East. Many versions blaze with green chile; House of Mandi uses tomato and, while it has some flicker, it’s easy to use liberally.

I mentioned most customers come for an unhurried meal. The pace of the restaurant is leisurely in general; if you need to be in and out in a flash, call ahead for carryout. Otherwise, settle in. Most of the dining space has Western-style tables and chairs. A core clientele of families and friends gravitate to the Yemeni-style floor seating in one corner, relaxing on cushions patterned in red, black and white. They linger over platters, often finishing with sips of black tea piney from cardamom or strong coffee served with dates.

If you’re driving back to Los Angeles after banqueting on a blur of rice and bread and meats, I recommend the jolt of caffeine.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Last month, the owner of Permanent Records Roadhouse, a combination bar, record store and music venue in Cypress Park, announced his establishment’s new COVID-19 policy: To enter, customers must present either proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test dated within the last 72 hours, in addition to ID.

You probably won’t be surprised to read that Lance Barresi’s staff immediately started to field complaints that labeled them Nazis and communists. It was suggested — incorrectly — that the policy violates the federal healthcare privacy law.

“Permanent Records Roadhouse is part of a growing chorus of Los Angeles-area restaurants and bars implementing their own COVID restrictions as the highly transmissible Delta variant causes infection rates in the region — and many parts of the country — to climb,” Stephanie Breijo reports. (And she’s got a list of 20 restaurants —including Permanent Records Roadhouse — that have established their own entrance protocols. )

I’m Alice Short, the acting food editor of The Times, and today’s newsletter looks at the some of the new ways restaurants and bars are trying to cope with the resurgence of COVID-19.

You may remember that when the state reopened June 15, it abandoned its tier system and the guidelines for table spacing, capacity limits and mask mandates. Then, Stephanie reminds us, “in mid-July, L.A. County mandated a return to indoor masking, regardless of vaccination status. [On July 28] state health officials urged fully vaccinated Californians to resume wearing masks in indoor public settings, and the CDC recommended a return to indoor masking in public settings even for vaccinated Americans in places experiencing ‘substantial’ or ‘high’ coronavirus transmission rates.”

On Tuesday, New York City officials announced vaccination-verification requirements for many types of indoor public spaces; the next day, the city of Los Angeles announced it will consider something similar. “If passed,” Times reporter Luke Money writes, it “would be the widest-ranging vaccination-verification effort in the city yet.” And on Wednesday, the Palm Springs City Council passed a motion that will require proof of vaccination — or recent negative COVID-19 test results — to dine or drink indoors

Not everyone is on board with this approach. Last month, Basilico’s Pasta e Vino in Huntington Beach generated headlines worldwide when it decreed that proof of being unvaccinated is required for entrance.

The declaration caught the attention of columnist Steve Lopez, who wrote that his first thought was that the restaurant should be shut down and the owner fined. But then he wondered if the restaurant owner might be “on to something,” adding:

“Instead of letter grades, as we have in the windows of Los Angeles restaurants for health and safety ratings, let’s have big signs in every window, V for vaccinated and U for unvaccinated. If you want to eat at a V restaurant, you’ve got to show proof that you got the shots.”

In the meantime, Lopez turns to the experts to refute vaccine mythology and urges us not to “give up entirely on those who, at the moment, are saying no to the jab.”

— In our latest installment of Week of Meals, chef and food writer Jenny Dorsey explains how she plans her weekday recipes — and how she gets two completely different meals from just one chicken.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This is the fifth installment in our “Week of Meals” series, which gives you five weeknight dinner recipes with all the planning and strategizing built in. Each meal makes four servings, comes together — start to finish — in less than 60 minutes, and requires 10 or fewer ingredients (not counting cooking oil, salt and pepper or water). The groceries for all five meals can be bought from a single grocery store and in a single shopping trip and will cost less than $100 total.

Chef and food writer Jenny Dorsey provides the recipes for this installment in our Week of Meals series. Here’s how she plans her weekday recipes, some of which utilize an electric pressure cooker to prepare offal — even on a busy workday — while others show how she gets two completely different meals from just one chicken.

“No week is complete for me without offals. I’m very pro-offals, and I think we could help solve some important food supply and access issues if we could destigmatize and encourage offal eating in this country, to be honest. Trotters are one of my favorite cuts because they don’t require any pre-cleaning (versus my other favorites, which are kidney, stomach and intestine — in that order).

“My tomato-and-egg stir-fry is a classic Chinese ‘home-style’ comfort dish that most everyone will make. I know it seems odd (because tomatoes are a New World crop, and also, with eggs??) but truly it’s one of the easiest and most delicious things I’ve been eating since I was a kid. I add garlic and scallions to my version but some purists literally only use tomato and egg. As with everything, I encourage everyone to dress this up/down and make it their own.

“I like to get a whole chicken and cut it up so I can play with different flavors throughout the week and not get bored eating so much chicken. So I started making this braised dish with the dark meat parts regularly because I live so close to El Super and can always get tomatillos and fresh tortillas. It’s such a versatile marinade that can be used for anything from chicken to pork to beef to fish!

“And for the breast pieces, I like to use them in my adaptation from a salted duck recipe my mother shared with me a while ago. It requires a little more effort to salt the chicken, but it really is worth it to get juicy poached breasts as a result. The ginger-garlic-scallion sauce is a variation of the ones you’ll find for Hainanese chicken, and it’s probably my favorite sauce in the whole world.”

3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

Granulated sugar

SUNDAY PREP

This is the cooking you’ll want to do on your shopping day, preferably Sunday, to get more of the laborious or time-consuming tasks out of the way.

Break down a chicken and marinate its parts:

Using a knife or kitchen shears, break down 1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds) into 8 pieces: two drumsticks, two thighs, two wings and two boneless breasts. Save the carcass for making chicken stock, if you‘d like.

Advertisement

For the bone-in pieces:

Transfer the drumsticks, thighs and wings to a large resealable plastic bag or bowl. In a blender, combine the following:

1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt

1 teaspoon whole cumin

½ teaspoon granulated sugar

½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns

4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce

4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

2 small shallots, thinly sliced

Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon

Blend the ingredients together into a smooth paste and then scrape onto the chicken pieces in the bag. Close the bag, squeezing all the air out as you do, then massage the paste into all the pieces. Transfer the bag to the refrigerator and marinate at least 2 days and up to 5 days to use in the Chipotle-Braised Chicken With Tomatillo Bean Salad.

For the breast pieces:

Remove and discard the skin from the breast pieces. Separate the tenders from the breast meat, then place all four pieces on a plate. Warm a dry skillet over medium-low heat. Add:

Advertisement

2 tablespoons kosher salt

2 teaspoons whole allspice

1 whole star anise pod

Toast the spices, tossing occasionally, until fragrant and the salt starts to turn yellow, about 10 minutes. Pick out the spices and process them to a fine powder in a spice grinder. Combine the ground spices with the salt, then rub the salt all over the chicken breast pieces and tenders. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 days or up to 5 days to use in the Salted Chicken with Ginger-Mint Sauce and Sautéed Lettuce.

Par-cook the pig trotters:

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, place 2 ½ pounds pig trotters, halved lengthwise and then halved crosswise to make 4 pieces per trotter (ask your butcher to do this; or use small pork shanks).

Cover with cold water by 2 inches, then bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer and cook for 1 hour. Drain the trotters, discarding the cooking liquid, then let cool to room temperature. Transfer the trotters to an airtight container and refrigerate up to 4 days, to use in the Quick-Braised Pig Trotters With Star Anise and Lemon.

Prepare the Herby Pork Meatballs:

In a large bowl, combine:

1 pound ground pork

¼ cup panko breadcrumbs (or regular breadcrumbs)

3 tablespoons minced shallots

1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary

2 teaspoons kosher salt

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 large egg, lightly beaten

Mix everything together until evenly combined, then shape into 12 to 14 meatballs, about 1 ½ inches in diameter. Transfer the meatballs to a parchment paper- or foil-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days to use in the Mustard Greens and Beans Soup With Herby Pork Meatballs.

Make the Tomatillo Bean Salad:

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then add 4 peeled and rinsed tomatillos.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“L.A. in a Jar” is a four -part series on preserving fruit at home throughout the seasons in Southern California, complete with helpful tips and guidance on everything you need to know about making and using fruit preserves, plus master recipes for stone fruit jam, apple butter, citrus marmalade and berry jelly.

Making jam is how I like to relax. Others may get massages, go hiking or do yoga. I prefer meditatively chopping, and then lazily stirring, fruit in a big pot until it’s thick and takes on the sheen of silk. I got into jam-making as a kid because I loved eating it so much. Whether it was strawberry Smuckers, muscadine jelly from an artisan near my home town in Mississippi, or an apple butter or peach jam from that “country store” restaurant, my sweet tooth called for preserves, so I yearned to learn to make them myself.

I’ve learned a lot about making preserves from years of cooking. I’ve made great preserves and really bad preserves — ones that set too soft and ones that were completely burned on the bottom. I’ve read just about every book on the subject and used their recipes to see how each approaches the art of mixing raw fruit, sugar and lemon juice into a luscious, spreadable fruit preserve.

Preserving fruit may seem like an intimidating undertaking akin to baking bread, but, well, you learned all about sourdough last year during the pandemic, so why not learn how to make the best stuff to spread on it and see how much easier it is to make than bread? Whether it’s a stone fruit jam with lots of tart chunks of fruit, a smooth and rich apple butter, a bitter marmalade mottled with citrus peel, or a glistening jewel-like berry jelly, preserving fruit is the best way to keep the best produce in the country around a little longer in your kitchen than it does in the markets.

In Los Angeles, we track the seasons not by looking at the sky or thermometer, but by looking at the produce stands at the markets. Through the year, most of the produce changes so much and so quickly that it may seem as if you’re shopping at a totally new site with each visit to your neighborhood market. And whether you live here or are visiting, you’ve no doubt stopped by a farmers market to gasp and gawk at the wonderful fruit and bought a lot more than you can deal with on an impulse, drugged by all the heady aromas and beautiful colors. That’s where making preserves comes into play. And it’s a California pastime that everyone, no matter the skill level or interest, should experience at least once in their life.

To show you how easy it is for the home cook to make, we’re creating four issues over the next year that highlight different forms of fruit preserves — stone fruit jam in July, apple butter in October, citrus marmalade in January and berry jelly in April — complete with the basic steps and tips to get it done, but without all the extra information that can make preserving fruit seem intimidating or boring.

My hope is to convince you that preserving is actually quite easy, enjoyable and as low-maintenance as cooking a marinara sauce. The best part? You control the ingredients, which is important in a homemade version of a store-bought product typically rife with artificial sweeteners and subpar fruit. I’ll tell you what equipment you need to make preserves (I can practically guarantee you already own it all), how to make it with no recipe (you can memorize it) and how the preserves you make will last a long time without having to can them (your fridge is your friend!).

This is not a manual for the professional business owner or anyone looking to sell their product. This is a no-nonsense guide for casual home cooks, curious market shoppers, novice fruit fanatics and anyone else who just wants to learn a new, delicious skill that’s more fun and rewarding than making your 100th loaf of sourdough.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This story is a component of the feature “Seasons of Preserves: Stone Fruit,” which is part of a four-part series on preserving fruit at home called “L.A. in a Jar.” For a more-detailed version of the method, below, see the recipe for Master Stone Fruit Jam.

There are really only four steps in the jam-making process:

(Silvia Razgova / For The Times)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This story is a component of the feature “Seasons of Preserves: Stone Fruit,” which is part of a four-part series on preserving fruit at home called “L.A. in a Jar.”

Before you go shopping or bring the fruit home, make sure you’re prepared with the proper equipment. Jam-making may bring to mind visions of sterile metal objects and lots of clunky factory equipment, but the truth is, if you’re not canning the preserves (and I’d advise you not to at first), you only need a couple of things.

The one essential is a great pot. I’ve used stainless steel pots and enameled cast iron pots (Dutch ovens) equally and while both work great, the latter is more preferable for its ability to spread the heat across the bottom of the pot, which helps the jam cook evenly.

Because making jam isn’t worth it unless you’re making a large enough batch, always start with at least 3 to 4 pounds of fruit and cook it in a “large,” approximately 7- to 8-quart-or-so, pot. Whatever pot you use, make sure it has tall sides (at least 5 inches) because boiling jam likes to increase in height and splatter. And if you’re cooking in a shallow pan, it can spill over if you don’t keep a close eye on it.

Advertisement

I like to use a large, long-handled heat-proof silicone spatula or wooden spoon to stir the fruit. The long handle keeps my hand away from stinging-hot fruit juice and the wide blade of the spatula scrapes the bottom of the pot efficiently. Don’t use a metal spoon though, since the heat of the jam can travel up the handle of the spoon and burn your hand — trust me on this.

Speaking of hands, while it’s not essential, I recommend gloves. There will be a splattering of fruit juice, and it’s a good idea to avoid boiling hot sugar and juice on your skin. I use a pair of thick (clean) heat-proof gloves meant for gardening, but you can also use some classic yellow dishwashing gloves if you have them (just know that the latter is only good for protecting from splatters; they’re not heat-proof so don’t go grabbing boiling hot jars with them).

In addition, you’ll want to keep a small bowl of cold water and a spoon nearby for skimming the surface of the jam and a ladle ready for decanting the jam into jars or whatever vessel in which you want to store it.

But before you start to cook, you’ve got to weigh everything you’re using, so make sure you have a good digital scale. If you bake a lot, you’re likely to already have one, but if not, you should get one. Weighing the fruit and other ingredients is more accurate and will allow you to measure, mix and cook everything in one vessel. Less equipment to clean and a better jam? Sounds like easy math to me.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This story is a component of the feature “Seasons of Preserves: Stone Fruit,” which is part of a four-part series on preserving fruit at home called “L.A. in a Jar.”

This guide is all about giving you the tools to make small batches of jam for you and your family that can stay in the fridge and that you can enjoy together. However, like me, you may want to gift your jams to friends and family elsewhere. And for that, you’ll need to can them properly so they’re shelf-stable.

Dozens of preserving books (all wonderful resources), USDA warnings, and generations of cultural panic over home-canned, -preserved or -fermented food have left most people thinking that canning fruit preserves is akin to outfitting a home with electrical wiring — too complex to comprehend and a sure sentence for death if you don’t know what you’re doing. The “B-word” — botulism — is a worry that doesn’t apply here because you will have cooked your jam at a high enough heat to kill the responsible bacteria and you’ll be using so much acid, in the form of lemon juice, in this recipe that they can’t survive. If you want reassurance beyond what I provide below, read and follow the USDA’s “ Preparing and Canning Jams and Jellies ” guidelines.

While canning isn’t any more complicated or intimidating than making the jam and takes a lot less time, the only reason I dissuade you from doing it is because it requires more equipment than you have at home. Canning your jam also feels project-y (i.e., less exciting and more prescriptive than cooking it) and isn’t completely necessary; hence why I advise you simply store your jam in an airtight container in the refrigerator. But if you’re committed to go all the way with this process, I’m going to explain what I do to make my jams shelf-stable.

Once I put the pot full of macerated fruit on the stove and bring it to a boil, I start washing the jars I’ll pack the jam in. I use half-pint glass jars made by Ball, but you can use any jars you like as long as they’re approved for canning. Use brand-new jars each time so there’s no worry about anything from an old jar — dents, scrapes or leftover dried-on particles — disrupting the seal and cleanliness. I don’t have a dishwasher, so I use the hottest tap water I have and some soap. I wash the jars, lids and bands thoroughly and set them on a paper towel on the counter near my stove. I also wash the jar funnel and ladle I’ll use to get the jam in the jars.

Once washed, I let everything air-dry while the jam finishes cooking. (If it’s not dry by the time I need it, I wipe the excess water away with a clean paper towel.) Once the jam is done, I turn off the heat under the pot and put on my heat-proof gloves to hold the jars while I fill them with jam. (You can use a kitchen towel but, trust me, this is much easier and safer.) I place the funnel in one jar and use the ladle to pour the jam into the jar while the jam is still very hot.

Once the jam is filled to the top of the jar, I remove the funnel and the level of the jam drops about 1/8 to 1/4 inch below the top. This is exactly what you want. I then place the lid on the jar and screw the band on, using only my fingertips so that it’s not too tight. This is called a “finger-tight” seal and allows the lid to be secured while being loose enough to allow air to leave the jar while it’s being canned. When the jars cool, this creates an air-tight seal. Repeat filling and closing the rest of your jars in the same manner.

As soon as the jars are filled and closed, remove the rack from a canning pot, fill it three-quarters of the way with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Position all the jars in the rack so they remain upright and lower the rack and jars into the boiling water. Once the water returns to a boil, set a timer for 10 minutes and let the jars boil, or “process,” until the timer rings.

Remove the pot from the heat and carefully remove the rack from the water (it will come with handles, which makes this part easy). Using those heat-proof gloves, transfer the hot jars to a paper towel or kitchen towel and let them stand until they cool to room temperature. You’ll know the jars are sealed correctly when the “button” on top of the lid is no longer sticking up. Sometimes it makes a pleasing (or frightening) popping noise as this happens, but not always; check the lid to make sure.

Now you have fully shelf-stable jam that will last for at least a year, but I doubt it will last that long in your house or anyone else’s who loves eating jam.

Whether you make it or buy it, you’re going to want to eat your jam all the time. But aside from toast, what can you use it for? After more than a few friends asked that question when I gave them my jam,

I came up with a list:

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Slather it on toast, preferably over almond or peanut butter, and top it off with a pinch of flaky sea salt.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Spoon it over scoops of ice cream for an instant fruit sundae.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Spill dollops of it all over a homemade frozen custard during the last 10 seconds of churning for a rippled fruit ice cream.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Shake a spoonful with a shot of your favorite liquor and a splash of lemon juice in a cocktail shaker for a bespoke cocktail.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Spread it between layers of a cake for an instant filling.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Spatter a spoonful into your morning bowl of yogurt and top with granola.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Serve a small bowl of it alongside cheeses, cured meats and nuts on an appetizer platter.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Swirl it into pan drippings for a sweet sauce for chicken thighs, duck, lamb or steak.

(Nicole Vas / Los Angeles Times)

Stir it with soy sauce or vinegar for an instant marinade or stir-fry sauce.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@People are getting tired of cooking. I understand that feeling intimately, especially as someone whose job it is to cook and come up with new recipes to inspire you, the reader. Whether for work or pleasure, I’m never not chopping or boiling something. The endless meal planning, organizing and, worst of all, dishwashing really takes a toll. All this to say, I get you.

One year into cooking more meals at home than ever before, the fatigue has set in for even the most cooking-obsessed among us. So to ease the frustration of having to cook for yourself or your household every day, I’m introducing a series called “Week of Meals,” which will give you five weeknight dinner recipes with all the planning and strategizing built in.

Each meal will make four servings, come together — start to finish — in less than 60 minutes, and require 10 or fewer ingredients. The groceries for all five meals can be bought from a single grocery store and in a single shopping trip (remember, we’re looking to alleviate your frustration) and will cost less than $100 total.

Of course, there are some caveats: Spices, condiments and other basic pantry staples I expect you to have will be priced by the amount used in the recipes and, whenever possible, I will give substitutions for them in the recipe’s headnote. But also know that if I call for certain spices, they will be used at least twice throughout the week so you can get used to incorporating them in different ways and with different ingredients.

Staples like salt and pepper, cooking oil and water will not be included in the shopping list nor will they be counted in the 10 ingredients for each recipe (because, well, if you don’t have these things, maybe takeout really is the best option). For oil, however, I will provide the total amount needed for all five recipes so you can check whether you have enough before shopping.

Any ingredients that need to be prepped ahead of time will be listed in the “Sunday Prep” section, so that once it’s time to cook, some of the hard work will already be done. And all meat, produce, herbs or other fresh/perishable ingredients will be fully used up by the end of the week so there will be no half-used, sadly wilting herb bundles to toss out on Friday.

We will publish the grocery list in full, along with the specific grocery store where the author has shopped so that, should you choose, you can go to that location or the same chain. Specialty chains and gourmet grocery stores will be off-limits.

Whether you follow the plan in full or simply make one recipe, my hope is that you will enjoy delicious, simple and balanced weeknight meals without any of the mental or physical anguish that goes along with planning and prep. Sometimes I will develop the recipes for a “Week of Meals,” but much of the time they will be developed by other cooks and authors in California with the goal to have them — by going to their own neighborhood grocery stores — show you how different cooks get dinner on the table throughout the week.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This is the fourth installment in our Week of Meals series, which gives you five weeknight dinner recipes with all the planning and strategizing built in. Each meal makes four servings, comes together — start to finish — in less than 60 minutes and requires 10 or fewer ingredients (not counting cooking oil, salt and pepper or water). The groceries for all five meals can be bought from a single grocery store and in a single shopping trip and will cost less than $100 total.

Food stylist, recipe developer and photographer Danielle Campbell provides the recipes for this installment in our Week of Meals series. Here’s how she plans out her weekday recipes and uses the ingredients, including lots of Middle Eastern spices and sauces, that inspire her mostly meat-centric meals and add a ton of flavor to the plate.

“Creating delicious meals with minimal ingredients, and on a budget, is something working adults have to do consistently,” Campbell says. “These meals are a representation of the way I love to eat. Three of the recipes are inspired by Middle Eastern flavors, and the other two recipes provide more variety throughout the week.

“I wanted to make sure to pack as much flavor as I could into each meal. I’m a big carnivore, and I love to have a variety of proteins throughout the week. I also like to have one vegetarian dish during the week to give myself a lighter meal option while also keeping my budget in mind.

“I love fresh herbs and bright flavors, so I always try to incorporate a delicious condiment sauce like a salsa verde or a chimichurri that I can use multiple times throughout the week. Every time I visit a restaurant, I am always left thinking about the delicious meals long after I have left the building. It leaves me inspired to create even more recipes.” — as told to Ben Mims

Writer, recipe developer and cookbook author Dawn Perry provides the recipes for this installment. Here’s how she plans out her weekday meals and the ingredients that inspire her dishes, which must come together quickly and easily while also feeding her two small children.

“I rarely make a meal plan for the whole week. Instead I think in broad strokes — what protein are we having? — and then build from there, depending on what’s in the pantry. My cookbook, “ Ready, Set, Cook ” [publishing Nov. 2, 2021], is all about making meals out of whatever you have on hand, so I lean hard on long-lasting pantry items like garlic, canned beans, potatoes and bread, and then add fresh veggies and protein.

“I also try to make a few things that can be repurposed throughout the week, whether for other dinners or as part of lunch — marinated chickpeas become chickpea patties, scallion-caper relish can double as a dressing or sauce for pretty much anything the rest of the week. That way every meal doesn’t have to start completely from scratch.

“Oh, a note on feeding my little kids, almost 4 and almost 2: I wish I could say they are adventurous eaters, but they are pretty carb- and cheese-focused — can you blame them? I try to include at least one thing in the meal that they’ll eat without complaint, like yogurt, toast or pasta minus the greens. These recipes mostly fit that bill, and when all else fails, I’ll make a side quesadilla.” — as told to Ben Mims

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Before Brooklyn-based ceramic artist Stephanie H. Shih sculpted clay pieces for her first solo exhibition in Los Angeles — currently on display in Chinatown’s Stanley’s gallery — she crowdsourced ideas from her 20,000-plus social media followers.

As a way to paint a broader picture of the East and Southeast Asian diasporas that were beyond her own experiences as a Taiwanese American, she asked her followers what common Western grocery items “felt” Asian to them. Shih was surprised and touched by people‘s eagerness to share their stories.

Groceries are very personal, said Shih, who is 34. “We bring them into our homes, and we feed ourselves and our loved ones with them. So, this food feels very, very personal to people.”

Shih’s “New World Mall” exhibition is a collection of 30 life-size ceramic and hand-painted replicas of these nostalgic products. (The show’s name is a reference to a shopping center in Flushing’s Chinatown in New York City.) There’s a Carnation Sweetened Condensed Milk tin, a nod to its use in Vietnamese coffee and Hong Kong-style toast. A ceramic Libby’s Vienna Sausage can represents its role in Filipino meatloaf and Korean budae-jjigae (“army stew”). And a bottle of Heinz ketchup stands in as an essential ingredient for Japanese spaghetti.

The seed of the idea for “New World Mall” stemmed from a previous group show, “Making in Between: Contemporary Chinese-American Ceramics,” at the American Museum of Ceramic Art in Pomona that Shih participated in last year. (One of her featured sculptures was a can of Spam, which is part of her new show.) Her work caught the attention of Sebastian Gladstone, the director of the Chinatown art gallery.

Stephanie H. Shih stocked her “New World Mall” with ceramic re-creations of Western food items that Asians enjoy using. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)

“There was this real intimacy to these handmade objects that I thought was fantastic,” Gladstone said.

He reached out to Shih last December, and she started working on the pieces that touch upon the ideas of migration and colonization. Except for the Spam and Ferrero Rocher chocolates, everything was made specifically for this new exhibition. The collection includes a blue Royal Dansk cookie tin, a bottle of Maggi seasoning and a bag of King’s Hawaiian sweet rolls.

Shih questions the idea of authenticity when it comes to certain foods. As an example, she said, many people consider banh mi to be Vietnamese, even though its creation was a byproduct of French occupation and the introduction of baguettes and pâté to the country.

Lookalike ceramics crafted by Stephanie H. Shih. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)

“There’s all this discourse around how American Chinese food isn’t authentic, but I actually think that’s really inaccurate and an almost dangerous way to think about what culture is,” Shih said. “Culture isn’t static. It’s ever moving. And so, with this series, I really wanted to make a statement that these Western products, which we have incorporated into our cuisines, are authentically part of our cultures as well.”

Shih does a lot of research before she creates her artworks. She prefers replicating older versions of product labels, ideally from the 1980s or 1990s when there was a big wave of East Asian immigration to the United States. (Her parents left Taiwan in the early 1980s to attend graduate school in Philadelphia, where Shih was born.) She spends hours searching Google Images and old commercials on YouTube to get the details right. For this series, she even bought a 1990s Ovaltine canister from eBay. It was still half-full of the original chocolate milk powder.

After Shih sculpts one of her clay pieces, she paints it with meticulous detail using underglaze before its first firing in the kiln. The next round of glaze depends on the material — glass or paper or metal, for example — used in the original product. If there’s a paper label, she’ll skip the second glaze for that part of the sculpture. The appearance of glass is replicated through a high-gloss finish, while plastic and metal lids have a glaze with a lower sheen. Then she fires the artwork in the kiln again.

At Stanley’s, her 30 sculptures are presented together on a U-shaped table, taking up a small amount of space in the 1,200-square-foot gallery.

“I love the idea of this really subtle, small body of work that you’ll get really intimate with in this large space,” Gladstone said. “Big statements can come in very small packages.”

Shih took a nonlinear path to her art career. Growing up in Princeton Junction, N.J., she always had an interest in the arts, specifically in printmaking, photography and oil pastels. In high school, she took a ceramics class, where she said she “made bad bowls and pretty embarrassing sculptures of naked women.”

Shih wanted to go to art school but her parents didn’t approve of it. She attended Boston University and then ended up working as a copywriter and creative director at tech companies for a decade.

In 2015, she picked up ceramics again as a form of art therapy to manage her chronic back pain. One of her first pieces to garner notice consisted of ceramic dumplings. In 2018, after she created her first product replica, a Chinkiang black vinegar bottle, she was inspired to do a series of grocery items. For the last couple of years, Shih, who’s had other solo exhibitions featuring grocery items at the Perrotin gallery in New York and Wieden+Kennedy gallery in Portland, Ore., makes her living mostly through her artwork.

There’s a sense of home and belonging in Shih’s artwork that extends to her activism in supporting marginalized communities through fundraisers. This year, she raised $45,000 for Asian immigrants who have been fighting deportation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

As anti-Asian racism and hate crimes have increased in recent months, Shih said she believes the Asian American diaspora is going through a big moment of growth, and she hopes to see it continue.

Food is “very, very personal,” says Stephanie H. Shih. She asked the public to share favorites as she shaped her art project. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)

“The current discourse around Asian American identity is focused on representation and authenticity, both of which can be interesting topics,” Shih said. “It’s exciting to watch my peers take more interest in our power as a unified bloc.

“I hope we can progress beyond these issues and onto political projects that will actually bring us equity and safety, like healthcare for all, workers’ rights and ending deportation,” she added. “So I’m feeling a bit antsy but overall I’m hopeful about what this moment could bring.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Lincoln Heights night market, which gained popularity through TikTok, was closed down Thursday following widespread complaints from residents and businesses about its negative effect on the neighborhood.

The move, announced by L.A. City Councilman Gil Cedillo, drew condemnation from some in the community, who organized a protest late Thursday and demanded the popular street market be reopened.

The city closed Artesian Street from Avenue 33 to Humboldt Street, Cedillo’s office said in a statement, which would “eliminate illegal alcohol sales, public defecation and urination, and crime and violence that was caused by the market.”

During the closure, the statement said, the city “would fully assess the street and sidewalks, determine and perform work to abate human waste, cooking oil and flame damage, and restore vandalized signage, sidewalks, and curbs.”

“We support the economic opportunity that night markets provide to vendors and the culinary experiences it provides to consumers. However, it is unacceptable the way this site has negatively impacted the quality of life of Lincoln Heights residents and businesses,” Cedillo said in a statement. “Our duty is to maintain clean, safe and secure neighborhoods.”



What was a handful of small retailers last year had boomed into a full-fledged night market as some vendors tried to make up for money lost during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some weekend nights, at least 100 vendors would set up along the alley-like street, selling acrylic nails, earrings, cannabis pipes and food such as burgers, asada tacos and mini pancakes.

Thousands of people would descend on Lincoln Heights each week, sometimes spending nearly an hour searching for a place to park.

And that, Lincoln Heights residents said, was part of the problem.

One resident told The Times that he had to claim a parking spot in front of his house before the crowds arrived, so he wouldn’t have to park blocks away.

Residents described waking up to freshly dumped trash, puddles of urine and human feces. Business owners said blocked driveways prevented employees from driving home at the end of their shifts.

A group calling itself Respect Lincoln Heights sent out updates on gunshots, altercations and blocked streets.

“We have been making you, our civil servants, aware of these issues for many months,” said an email from the group, addressed to L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, Cedillo and the City Council.

Cedillo’s office said it consulted with city agencies including the Fire Department, Bureau of Sanitation, Department of Transportation and Bureau of Street Services about the market before instructing agencies “to begin the process of a street closure and full cleaning and maintenance of Artesian Street.”

It is unclear how long the street will be closed.

When asked if there was a plan to relocate the market, Cedillo said, “not a plan we’re prepared to execute at this moment.”

“There are thoughts about it, but the answer is no,” he said. “There’s no plan to move it.”

Erasmo Reyes, who began selling 50-cent tacos in Lincoln Heights more than a decade ago, learned of the closure Thursday afternoon.

Reyes was the first vendor to set up here, and it was his customers who coined his business’ now-celebrated name: Avenue 26 Tacos.

Though some vendors consider the money from the market extra income, he said, others are living off the sales they make each day.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Reyes said.

A few days ago, another vendor, Luis Peralta, sent a letter to Cedillo asking to meet and talk about the market. Peralta said he and his family ran a Mexican candy stand known as El Dulce.

“We the vendors understand the complaints of residents nearby and we would love to find a middle ground where we can continue to provide income for our families and joy for our community,” Peralta wrote. “We understand there is a right way to do things, from pulling out all the necessary permits to complying with city laws and regulations, we are willing to do it all. We just need help from people like yourself who can create a dialogue with the surrounding community to find solutions for their wants and needs as for ours.”

He and other vendors planned to move to a nearby street in Lincoln Heights to sell once more.

“It’s the only income we have,” he said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Palm Springs City Council has passed a motion that will require proof of vaccination — or recent negative COVID-19 test results — in order to dine or drink indoors. The regulations were approved unanimously during a special — and virtual — meeting Wednesday that was convened to discuss a series of new measures meant to curb the spread of the virus.

Effective immediately, customers, employees and other visitors must wear face coverings in indoor settings. The same goes for large ticketed city events outside, such as the two-weekend music festival Splash House, which begins Aug. 13.

Later this month, proof of vaccination or negative test results will be required for indoor seating at bars and restaurants, which will have three weeks to implement the restrictions. A representative for the city said that there is not a determined time window necessary for the Covid-19 test results (though within 72 hours of entry is being discussed), nor is vaccination required for employees of bars and restaurants.

Palm Springs Mayor Christy Holstege said the new order came at the request of many Palm Springs’ restaurateurs: Before Wednesday’s vote, city hall officials said a survey of local-business owners found roughly 70% in favor of the restrictions. Some restaurateurs had already begun implementing the rules.

Last week New York City announced it will enforce similar rules for indoor dining. On Wednesday, Los Angeles City Council members Nury Martinez and Mitch O’Farrell introduced a motion to require proof of vaccination or recent, negative test results. A number of L.A. restaurants and bars are already implementing these guidelines .

“I’m very much afraid in the next month that the new COVID strain is going to come in and it’s going to cause some real problems that could cause restaurants, on the inside, to close down,” LULU California Bistro co-owner Jerry Keller said during the Palm Springs City Council meeting.

Outdoor dining will not require proof of vaccination or recent negative COVID-19 test results.

According to Danny DeSelms, the city’s emergency management coordinator, COVID-19 cases double this week as compared to last week in Palm Springs. As of Aug. 3, 57.9% of Riverside County’s population is either partially or fully vaccinated. Palm Springs’ vaccination rate is notably higher, with 81% of the population partially or fully vaccinated. (North Palm Springs, a nearby but unincorporated community, is hovering at 74%.)

The new requirements, Holstege said, could help protect residents as well as the city’s depended-upon out-of-town visitors — but especially restaurant and bar staff.

“They’re really on the frontlines,” Holstege said, “so we want to make sure we do everything we can to support them as much as possible.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that proof of vaccination would be required to visit restaurants, gyms and live shows. On Wednesday, Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez and Council Member Mitch O’Farrell introduced a motion that, if passed, could result in similar restrictions in an effort to curb the resurgence of COVID-19 across Los Angeles.

But a number of L.A.-area restaurants, bars and music venues are already implementing their own COVID-19 restrictions, such as checking proof of vaccination; requiring negative results of a recent COVID-19 test; and halting on-site dining until case rates fall.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Alta Baja Market in downtown Santa Ana has five posters taped to its front doors, each more exasperated than the last.

Two of them let customers know that masks are mandatory if they’re not sitting down to eat. One has a drawing of a standard-issue three-layer blue mask with “Por Favor” written below it in cursive.

“No Shoes No Shirt No Mask No Service!” blares another. And the coup de grace — “Por Favor Wear a Pinche Mask.” Please wear a damned mask.

Welcome to Delilah Snell’s store. She’s my wife.

Once you get past those posters, Alta Baja Market is a cheery, welcoming bistro. Shelves are lined with foodstuffs and beauty products from both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Roll-up windows offer constant sunshine and ventilation.

I’ve taste-tested all the micheladas — hey, when your significant other runs a restaurant, you get some perks. But you also have to deal with the bad. So for the past year and a half, I’ve had a front-row seat to how the coronavirus has played out at a small business, in a place like Orange County.

This is infamously “pandejo” central — the home of pandemic pendejos, or blockheads. A county where a restaurant owner who openly defied mask and social distance policies got elected to the Newport Beach City Council. Where an Italian restaurant in — where else? — Huntington Beach got national attention for refusing to serve vaccinated people. Where less than 50% of the under-65 population in the 92701 ZIP Code where Alta Baja is located is vaccinated against COVID-19 — among the lowest rates in O.C.

These past 18 months have been tough for Delilah. And yet I’ve never seen her more at peace. Alta Baja offers hope that there is a way forward on this pandemic. We just have to embrace my wife’s to-go plate of kindness, luck, perspective and toughness. And it starts with a simple mantra:

Advertisement

Wear a pinche mask.

Especially now, as the Delta variant pulls us back kicking and screaming into the world of eternal COVID-19 misery.

Delilah’s been ready for this moment.

When California Gov. Gavin Newsom lifted the tiered COVID-19 restriction system and restaurants began to drop masks, she doubled down.

In an Alta Baja newsletter shortly after Newsom’s announcement, Delilah declared that she and her workers would continue to wear masks while preparing food and planned to require masks for customers until the pandemic was finally, truly over — which definitely isn’t now.

“We sympathize that we’re all stuck in this horrible situation that none of us wanted. And we let them know that. Customers get it.” Delilah Snell, owner of Alta Baja Market

Masks have become so politicized that we forget what they’re fundamentally for: not virtue-signaling or paranoia, but making sure we don’t get others sick. Hospitality, in other words.

“This world that we’re in right now, it’s different and we need to take care of each other,” she told me from the couch of our home while preparing an Instagram post for Alta Baja’s account. “And that’s what this is about: care. Do the right thing despite people maybe being upset about it.”

Now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and some state and local governments are recommending people mask up in indoor public spaces, Delilah is upset — not at the action, but that such proclamations were rescinded in the first place.

“We’re in a pandemic. This isn’t over yet,” she said. “As a business owner, I need to be responsible to my employees and customers. The easiest thing that we can all do to ensure that everyone is safe is wearing a mask.”

By the time Newsom shut down California last March for what ended up being over a year, Delilah was ready for the worst — which has basically happened.

Alta Baja never closed completely because it’s a market and considered an essential business. But her numbers suffered — she now opens two hours later and closes three hours earlier.

“A lot of people thought we’d get back to normal quick,” she said. “I wanted to go back to normal too. But I had to be as realistic as possible. This wouldn’t be something over in a couple of weeks or months. I was thinking years.”

To this day, Delilah hasn’t reopened Alta Baja to full dining capacity. She didn’t want to tell customers one thing, then quickly pivot to another — a situation most restaurants and businesses now find themselves in.

“The one thing I can be is be consistent,” she said. “But consistency has been lacking in our leadership. If you’re going to mandate masks, you better wear a mask the entire damn time. When you don’t, it’s completely unfair, and you’re sending mixed messages. Now look where we’re at.”

Her consistently hard mask stance is a recipe for daily clashes, angry customers and a flurry of bad reviews — again, we’re in Orange County. But I’ve seen her social experiment play out from Alta Baja’s counter, where I sometimes moonlight as a cashier, because that’s what good spouses do.

Those snippy posters at the entrance are more bark than bite. If someone comes in without a mask, Delilah and her workers immediately direct them to a basket full of them near the entrance with a smile, clasped hands, a “Sorry!” and a quick thank you.

If people question Delilah’s policy, her rejoinder is usually, “This is my first pandemic — how about you?” with a side of her loud, infectious laugh.

Almost every customer who comes in without a mask puts one on, and even offers an embarrassed “Sorry!” And those few who walk into the store, see a sea of masked people, get an annoyed look on their face and storm out? Have fun at Taco Bell.

“We sympathize that we’re all stuck in this horrible situation that none of us wanted,” Delilah said. “And we let them know that. Customers get it.”

My wife is so on it at Alta Baja that she even shames me.

Early in the pandemic, I didn’t wear a mask until a customer complained. Delilah upbraided me afterward, saying I needed to set an example as her husband.

I went with a bandanna at first because I wanted to look cool — and then Delilah directed me to a study that showed bandannas were basically useless at preventing the spread of coronavirus (I now wear a mask underneath the bandanna because I still want to look cool).

When Newsom lifted the mask mandate for indoor dining in June, I suggested she adopt the new policy to avoid putting off customers. She ignored me, and customers haven’t stopped coming.

No wonder I’m a columnist and not a small business owner.

Delilah gets why businesses, desperate for customers, might be more lax in mask usage. But she also says that type of thinking will keep us in an endless pandemic loop.

So she wears a pinche mask.

“I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I got someone sick with COVID at Alta Baja,” she said, “when I could’ve done something so easy to stop it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An afternoon coffee can arrive in many ways: a rushed affair featuring leftovers from the morning; a leisurely catch-up with a friend; a jittery, caffeinated first date; a searing hot espresso taken standing. And sometimes, a coffee break can flow directly into the cocktail hour.

Sure, you can pour an espresso martini, but if you’re looking to ease into caffeinated drinking, choose a coffee tonic — and add booze.

Bright, bubbly and bitter-leaning, coffee tonic — espresso or cold brew poured atop tonic water and ice — first appeared on the menu at Koppi, a roaster in Helsingborg, Sweden. By mid-2014, the sparkling drink had become a veritable thing stateside. It remains a bittersweet pick-me-up suited to warm weather.

Simple to make, coffee tonic can be just coffee plus tonic water. Naturally complex in flavor, it transitions seamlessly from coffee shop to cocktail glass with a simple stop at the bar cart.

Advertisement

One bottle to pull (and one that is already a natural with tonic) is gin. The GCT (gin, coffee, tonic) starts with a muddling of lime wedges, sugar and a pinch of salt before you add ice, a measure of gin and dry tonic. A gentle pour of cold brew overtop adds a visually striking layer that sinks into the drink with slow, steady determination.

Alternatively, if a lower alcohol-by-volume yet no less happy-hour-appropriate drink is calling, reach for a bottle of amaro. In the Cherry-Amaro Coffee Tonic, amaro is combined with maraschino cherry syrup, stirred with dry tonic and topped with cold brew. Finishing the drink with a sprig of rosemary and a lemon peel brings out the herbal, citrus notes. Although the recipe suggests a lighter, sweeter, more citrus-leaning bottle of amaro such as Nonino, Averna or Montenegro, any amaro will work. If you end up choosing a more bitter bottle, simply offset with more maraschino cherry syrup.

When making coffee tonic, specific ingredients can make a difference. Dry tonic from companies like Fever-Tree, Q Tonic or Fentimans lend balance to the final drink. (If you can’t find dry tonic, use equal parts tonic and soda water.) As for your choice in caffeine, quality coffee, be it espresso or cold brew, ensures the final drink is pleasantly bitter rather than acerbic. Finally, but perhaps most important, pour the tonic first and coffee last to avoid any of your well-deserved drink bubbling over the top of the glass.

Choose one of the two aforementioned combinations or take inspiration from your home bar and dream up your own. Whatever your choice, spiked coffee tonics served on hot days — or nights — provide a refreshing, effervescent excuse to let that afternoon coffee segue straight into evening.

Valle Venice closes

Oaxacan-food spot Valle Venice has closed. The Gjelina Group restaurant from chefs Pedro Aquino and Juan Hernandez began as a pop-up in 2020 before transitioning to a permanent space on Abbott Kinney Boulevard. A statement on the Valle Venice website states: “we will honor your reservations at Gjelina or Gjusta as best we can over the coming month. Please email reservations@gjelina.com or call (310) 450-1429.” A representative for the Gjelina Group said the team is looking at potential new restaurant spaces in hopes of reopening Valle Venice as soon as possible.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Let’s get to it, shall we? I present the indisputable and 1,000% correct Pasta Sauce Power Rankings. The general rules are:

I got jarred sauce (no cans), bought standard marinara or the closest approximation I could find (no vodka sauces, no puttanesca, etc.) and tried to include no more than one jar per brand. There are a lot of sauces here and, just as when looking at a list of Chumbawamba members, it can become overwhelming and difficult to tell them apart. You won’t really go wrong with, say, the top dozen or so sauces on this list.

I ranked these by taste and attractiveness of packaging — let’s face it, when you’re looking for a new pasta sauce, it’s usually the simple/earnestly rustic (but not too rustic) label that gets your attention.

Cost is difficult to pin down and, given there’s a wide variety of prices you might pay depending on the retailer, I didn’t use it as a metric. That said, when something is a particularly good (or not so good) value, I note that in the ranking.

1. Rao’s Marinara

This is a little complicated, so bear with me. In December, I tweeted out a photo of Victoria marinara sauce and declared it the best on the market. That was incorrect, and we regret the error. However.

Victoria does make the best sauce, but it’s the premium White Linen brand, typically found at Costco, that’s superior, not the standard marinara (which is still very good). So: Why not just put Victoria White Linen at the top of the ranking?

Because I can’t find the stuff anywhere. I haven’t seen it on shelves for six months or more. And after a lengthy conversation with a helpful Costco rep, I discovered that Victoria White Linen is virtually unobtainable in Los Angeles and Northern California Costcos. (The sauce can be bought on Amazon for a steep price.) While that might change in the future, it didn’t make a lot of sense to me to put a sauce in the top slot that would be difficult to find.

And so, Rao’s wins by default, the two sweetest words in the English language. Not that Rao’s bows to anyone — it’s a wonderful sauce. Simple, balanced, with strong tomato flavor and generous with the olive oil, it leaves a nice greasy slick on the spoon. The texture is saucy without being pasty and has the occasional big, satisfying tomato chunk. It’s a bulletproof choice for any pasta ... at least until Victoria White Linen is widely available again.

2. Mezzetta Marinara

Mezzetta, a California-based company that coined the slogan “Don’t Forgetta Mezzetta,” makes an excellent sauce, in addition to jarred olives and preserved veggies. This one has a bright, strong tomato flavor and is quite onion-forward (I like that but not everyone will). It has a smooth texture and slightly smoky flavor, and it avoids one of the most common pitfalls that afflict jarred marinaras — not being oily enough. This has plenty of that good olive oil flavor.

Very important tip when eating a jarred sauce: Don’t forget to shake well. Sometimes the ingredients can really separate.

3. The Silver Palate San Marzano Marinara

Silver Palate is a name you may know from Sheila Lukins and Julee Rosso’s 1982 cookbook or their Upper West Side shop that preceded it. The user-friendly book, with charming illustrations by Lukins, could be found in almost every kitchen I remember growing up in suburban Chicago. “It was the ‘it’ cookbook,” says my mom.

Anyway, this is a good jarred marinara. It hits your palate (ahem) simultaneously tangy and salty, and slightly peppery. The ingredient list interestingly includes carrots and pear concentrate, which give the sauce extra dimension and depth. Jars cost $7.99 on Silver Palate’s website, but you can sometimes find a deal at a supermarket — as I type this, they’re being advertised for $3.99 at Safeway.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 14

4. Victoria Marinara

Victoria ticks off the biggest and most important checkbox when judging marinara: Does it taste more or less how a simple homemade sauce tastes? This does, and then some. Victoria tastes of tomatoes and olive oil; it’s not too sweet and has a fantastic texture — superior to that of Rao’s, which I’d say is ever so slightly too thick.

A good sauce shouldn’t just sit there like a big lump on the pasta. It should be loose enough to coat the noodles, and never pasty. As I stated above, Victoria’s standard marinara is good, but not as good as its White Linen brand, which is rich and balanced and as close to perfect as a jarred sauce can get.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 9

Here’s the big surprise of the top tier. Fody specializes in low FODMAP (which stands for “fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols” — there will be a quiz later) food items. Without getting too far into it, a low FODMAP diet can help people with IBS.

This sauce has no onions or garlic, which can irritate some digestive tracts. And you know what? It’s pretty delicious. There’s a good tomato flavor and enough unctuousness from the olive oil. Where garlic or onions might have added some depth, Fody makes up for it at least partly with carrot and celery. The result is a less traditional marinara — one that leans a little more into a mirepoix/Bolognese territory — but it’s quite good nonetheless.

6. DeLallo Pomodoro Fresco

DeLallo makes a very nice sauce — more unctuous than average and with a pronounced olive flavor that’s quite noticeable. That’s balanced out by the slightly sweet tomato flavor. This strikes me as a good sauce to doctor up with some meat or sausage.

7. Michael’s of Brooklyn

If we were judging based on appearance alone, this entry would win. It has a distinctive, wide-shouldered jar and simple gold cap. The label is small and understated, with “Michael’s of Brooklyn” written in cursive. The minimal real estate devoted to the label allows shoppers to see the full glory of bright, intensely red sauce.

Big expectations, in other words. And while Michael’s may not be the best, it’s still a good sauce with bright tomato flavor, if a little on the sweet side. There’s a strong garlicky profile, with big garlic slivers in the sauce, and good texture.

8. Organico Bello Marinara

One of the better entries that’s basil-forward. The basil comes across as sweet and floral, not bitter as can sometimes happen, and complements the light, bright tomato. With pasta, the herb flavor takes a backseat and fades like a tight haircut into the background.

9. Bianco DiNapoli Organic Sauce

Genuine Northern California tomatoes go into this sauce created by Chris Bianco and Rob DiNapoli. Given Bianco’s pedigree (and the attractive label art), I expected greatness.

I received very goodness. It’s pungent and garlicky, with a natural off-the-vine sweetness that sings the tomatoes’ praises. While I imagine this would work incredibly well with a nice, salty, melted pizza cheese on spaghetti, it was a bit too light and sweet.

10. Whole Foods Premium Marinara

As with cooking a good piece of Wagyu beef, sometimes all you need to do is not mess it up. Whole Foods did a good job here — they didn’t mess it up. This has good tomato flavor, is not too sweet and has a fairly loose texture. There are some seeds and skin here, which makes for an active eating experience. Fun fact: Jeff Bezos personally prepares and taste-tests every batch of Whole Foods marinara! (Editor’s note: This is false.)

11. Kirkland Signature Organic Marinara

It’s the Costco house brand. And while they may sell only the finest in jeans, dress shirts (one lasted me almost 15 years, true story!) and 72-pound wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano , the marinara doesn’t quite live up to that majesty.

The sauce has a slight bitterness but good tomato flavor and a slightly mealy, uniform consistency. This is the best possible version of Ragu brand sauce, if that makes sense. While not the best, it’s a great deal if you have a Costco membership — $9.49 for three big 32-oz. bottles. It appears that zero effort went into the label design.

12. Mia’s Kitchen Bistro Marinara

I don’t love strong herbiness in my marinara, but if you do, this is a good option. Lots of onions and the herbs are noticeable but don’t overpower. This sauce isn’t too sweet and there’s a nice, almost smoky, cooked-down tomato flavor.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 19

13. Francis Coppola Mammarella Pomodoro Basilico

I’m a little conflicted with this one. I like the flavor, which is tomato-rich and has a surprising, subtle cayenne kick, but the texture is pretty out there. I like a loose sauce. Coppola, who directed the “Godfather” movies as well as the one where a 10-year-old boy has aged to look like Robin Williams, has a sauce that veers into Slush Puppie territory.

It’s slightly chunky and has juicy pieces of tomato, but the texture resembles that of some tomatoes thrown into a blender — not cooked down over a long period of time. I don’t necessarily mind it — the flavor ultimately overcomes any issues with runniness. Just know that you’re going to have a puddle of liquid at the bottom of the pasta bowl.

This was the most expensive of the jars I purchased — $10.99 at Gelson’s.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 5

14. Yo Mama’s Bellisima Basil

There’s a good texture to this Yo Mama’s sauce that’s juicy and not pasty. The basil flavor is not too grassy, but it’s detectable. There’s a slightly sour aftertaste but it doesn’t overpower. If you want a basil sauce, this could be a good option.

Advertisement

My favorite part of this sauce is the little note written on the label that says, “With Love, Yo Mama.”

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 21

15. Gino Angelini Pomodorini

A good sauce, but a little sweet. What made this stand out, though, is the preponderance of tomato seeds and skins in the mix (due, I imagine, to the inclusion of cherry tomatoes).

Advertisement

Again, decent flavor, but I found it distracting to have to chew — and chew and chew — my sauce.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 13

16. Sugo di Pomodoro Marinara

Next to Michael’s of Brooklyn, this was the label that most attracted my eye: the distinctive drawing of a long, red San Marzano tomato against a white label with a green border, like you’d see on a big 28-oz. can at the store. For that reason, I thought this sauce would be a winner. What can I say? I’m impressionable.

Advertisement

It’s not bad. There’s a nice tomato flavor, but this leans a bit sweet and is followed by a slightly sour finish. The texture is pastier than I’d like.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 2

17. Lucini Organic Tuscan Marinara

Not a bad sauce, and a nice texture, but Lucini tastes a bit raw, like it wasn’t cooked long enough, and it could use a little salt. If you like eating tomatoes right out of the garden, this might be for you. There’s also a fairly noticeable carrot flavor — not bad, necessarily.

18. Stella Rosa Stella Marinara

Stella Rosa, of the wine fame, also makes a decent marinara. The Stella Marinara, according to the bottle, doesn’t actually contain any wine (though, puzzlingly, the same product is listed on the Ralphs website as containing red wine).

Advertisement

It doesn’t really need it. While there’s nothing exceptional about this sauce, there’s nothing wrong with it, either. There’s the right amount of oiliness, but it’s a bit too on the tart and tangy side.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 11

19. Trader Giotto’s Traditional Marinara

This is a funny entry from Trader Joe’s, a.k.a. the place we go to for frozen food and tiny cups of free coffee. This marinara wins a couple of points because of value — a jar, while small (18 oz., instead of the typical 24 or 25), costs only $1.39. And the taste is not bad, if a little herb-heavy. What’s interesting is that while many jarred marinaras commit the sin of being too sweet, this one is nearly too salty.

Advertisement

This is also a very thin and runny sauce, bordering on soupy. As I’ve stated, I like a looser sauce, but this takes it a step or two over the line.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 17

20. Muir Glen Organic Italian Herb

Very good packaging on this — the label has a classy, Art Deco-ish feel. I’m not sure what involvement, if any, John Muir’s family had in the development of this company, which started in 1991 and was acquired by General Mills in 2000, but the name holds weight, especially in California. I imagine John Muir walking among the sequoias, opening a jar of marinara, sticking a finger in and tasting it. He then strokes his beard and nods sagely.

Advertisement

The sauce isn’t bad but that’s about all I can say for it. There’s a very sharp, floral note that lingers with this sauce that I think is thyme — it’s distinctive but not what I look for in my favorite sauces.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 6

21. O Organics Marinara

O Organics is a Safeway brand and while this sauce certainly isn’t anything to write home about, as Robert Frost might say , one could do worse. This has a medium saucy texture with nice chunks but the overall flavor profile is on the sweet side, with prominent onion and garlic powder leanings.

Advertisement

The graphic design on this bottle is one of the more unappealing things I’ve seen.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 29

22. Dave’s Gourmet Organic Red Heirloom

This feels like a lost opportunity. Here we have a good sauce that’s bright and flavorful, with nice, loose texture and good elegant variation between smooth and chunky. It’s just too darned sweet.

Advertisement

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 20

23. Ragu Old World Style Traditional

Surprise! This wasn’t nearly as bad as I had remembered — the blessings of low expectations. I anticipated Ragu being too sweet and tasting strongly of tomato paste rather than actual tomatoes. It’s still both of those things, just not to the degree I thought.

The too-smooth texture is still there but the sauce is just slightly sweet — not as bad as some other offenders. There’s decent tomato flavor and some tanginess. The worst aspect is a finish redolent of wet newspaper. Still — could be worse!

24. Newman’s Own Marinara

It takes a cool hand to be one of history’s biggest movie stars and have your own food business. But Paul Newman wasn’t just interested in the color of money. There’s an absence of malice in his wading into pizza, dressings and sauces, and the funds raised for charity prove he’s no hustler.

Advertisement

His sauce, though? This might sting a little but the verdict on the marinara is decidedly mixed. It’s no towering inferno of flavor, to be sure, but Newman is nobody’s fool — the sauce has a distinctive fennel flavor that some will like. At the end of a long hot summer , a jar of Newman’s might be what’s left in the cupboard and trying it could spark a new kind of love . But if you want to keep winning , pick a different sauce — there are other options that will leave you saying, “Somebody up there likes me.”

25. Bertolli Traditional Marinara

This sauce is a little too sweet and has a long, citric finish, like orange juice that’s been out a day too long. It hits even sweeter when eaten with pasta. The packaging, with a cute hourglass-shaped bottle, is attractive, however.

26. Primal Kitchen Tomato Basil

Primal Kitchen, which sets consumers up to achieve “new heights of wellness and vitality through real-food eating,” according to its website, specializes in that whole keto/paleo thing. I’m tempted to try it, if only because it will certainly make me healthy without needing to exercise.

Pasta seems a bit anathema to the whole concept of ketogenic eating, but that’s not my issue here. It’s that they make it with avocado oil, not olive oil, which gives it a flavor that’s totally off: a little bitter and bordering on the soapy.

Advertisement

Is olive oil not ancient and primal enough, or something? Seems to me that it’s existed at least as long as avocado oil, and it definitely tastes better with pasta.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 24

27. Barilla Marinara

Barilla is a huge player in U.S. pasta consumption as well as in Europe, where it’s carved out nearly 17% of the market — more than twice any other single brand. It stands to reason that it would make sauce, as well.

Advertisement

Barilla should stick to pasta. This is a perfunctory attempt at marinara, at best. There’s a slightly pasty texture and what tastes like powdered onion. Together with pasta, the sauce hits unpleasantly herby. The packaging on the marinara resembles that of the company’s pasta boxes — distinctive but blocky and unappealing.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 26

28. Simple Truth Organic Marinara

Simple Truth is a Kroger brand and makes a better marinara than Kroger’s fancy brand, Private Selection. I didn’t include Private Selection, as they’re both from Kroger, but here’s a little bonus ranking: Private Selection marinara tastes like sugary tomato paste and is non buono.

Advertisement

Simple Truth starts off right with a good texture — varied and with occasional nice, big tomato chunks. That’s where the goodness stops — the rest of it tastes like someone shoved a fistful of dried herbs into your gullet.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 28

29. Classico Tomato & Basil

Classico was the original fancy supermarket pasta sauce — the “nice” alternative to Ragu or Prego. The branding and design continue to evoke cracked frescoes, a young Al Pacino wandering the Sicilian countryside and stone bridges with a cute old man playing “O Sole Mio” on the organetto. You know, what we Americans think Italy is. Heinz acquired the brand in 2001.

Advertisement

It’s worse than I remember. The texture is pasty and too smooth. The taste is herb-heavy to the point of being grassy, nearly bitter. I can’t imagineany doctoring that could make this sauce better.

Packaging Attractiveness Rating: 8

30. Prego Traditional

Calling a product “You’re welcome” — the approximate translation of the Italian word “Prego” — is an extreme act of confidence in whatever it is you’re selling.

Advertisement

This falls short of that mark. It couldn’t fall shorter. If it were more nakedly short, the SEC would have to get involved. It tastes like cloying tomato paste or a bad tomato soup. In fact, that’s probably the best use for this: Water it down a little, and dip a grilled cheese sandwich into it. Even then, it won’t be very good, but you don’t want to let this anywhere near pasta.

If a jar of this sauce cost, say, a dollar, you could justify buying it. But there are enough decent sauces in the general price range of Prego (I paid $3.49 for the jar) that there’s no good reason to allow this in your pantry.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Sonoma County restaurant owner is offering a lucrative incentive for her employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Terri Stark, who co-owns Stark Reality Restaurants with her husband, Mark, is hosting a contest that will give away up to $21,000 in gift cards to workers who get vaccinated. The goal is to encourage all of the couple’s 486 employees to get inoculated.

A total of 21 gift cards — each worth $1,000 — will be split evenly among the seven Bay Area restaurants the Starks own. Vaccinated employees will be entered into a lottery, and winners will be announced in a Sept. 1 drawing.

About 85% of the staff across the seven restaurants are fully vaccinated, Stark said, but since she and her husband launched the contest on July 23, more than a dozen others have received their shots.

Advertisement

The Stark Reality Restaurants company is one of the largest employers in the Sonoma County community, the restaurateur said, and encouraging 100% vaccination among her employees is a matter of protecting public health.

“With the amount of employees that we have in this community, we feel like this is one way we could make a difference,” she said.

Bay Area health officials are asking private employers to take a larger role in countering the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus by recommending that they begin requiring employees to be vaccinated.

Health officials in Contra Costa, Santa Clara and San Francisco counties last month implored workplaces to get more involved.

Other establishments in the Bay Area are aiming to protect their employees and staff by requiring patrons to show proof of vaccination upon entry, and to wear masks inside, regardless of vaccination status.

Stark says that, although she supports proof of vaccination for inside dining, her restaurants will not be mandating vaccinations until a requirement comes from the local or state level.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I’m not sure how to start an appreciation for 99 Ranch Market, so I’ll begin with an old receipt that my mom found going through my grandmother’s stuff after she died in October. The receipt is from six years ago, from the 99 Ranch (or “Ranch 99,” as my grandmother would call it) in Van Nuys.

The receipt is so perfectly representative of the dozens of trips I took there with Pau Pau (the Cantonese name for your grandmother on your mom’s side) over the years that I feel like I’m in the store and can see where every item on the receipt is located: Cooking wine. A white onion. A medium-large claw of ginger root. Two or three bananas that she’d separated from a larger bunch (she never bought an entire cluster). Cantonese zongzi from the deli section. Sticky rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves. Rock sugar for the red bean soup she liked to make and a container of pumpkin seeds.

As my grandmother held my arm, we would amble carefully through the sliding doors and encounter the familiar, vaguely dried-fish smell of the store. Past the stacked boxes of whatever rice cracker or beef jerky was on sale in the circular that week, past the in-store branch of East West Bank, we’d begin in the produce section and take an unhurried loop around the store, like Olympians on the world’s slowest victory lap, putting things into a cart and ticking them off of her mental checklist.

All 99 Ranch stores are fun to explore. A good place to start is the bakery section, with shelf after shelf of loaves of sliced bread that’s specifically for toast, not sandwiches. The loaves come in different flavors — red bean, taro, walnut raisin — and are so tall, shaped like high, arched doorways, that they’re minor miracles of science. And they’re soft — unreasonably, almost disquietingly soft. An airy slice can be pinched together into nothingness; it makes Wonder Bread look like a dense Westphalian rye.

Advertisement

From there, you can move to the deli and peruse the prepared foods — chewy marinated beef tendon, sautéed squid, bamboo shoots with mushrooms. At the hot bar you can get a quick lunch — mapo tofu or spicy eggplant with rice or fried noodles — or something a bit more luxe, like a whole roast duck or a slab of honey barbecue pork.

After that? Wander. Explore the miles of soy sauces and rice vinegars; varieties and flavors of instant noodles beyond your wildest fantasies. Jars of pickled radish; heavy bags of Kokuho Rose rice; yakisoba noodles; six varieties of Spam, and then a dozen other brands of luncheon meat that aren’t Spam — with names like Fortune, Roxy and Celebrity. Voluminous tanks of live tilapia and Dungeness crabs; parts of a pig you won’t find at your Albertsons — kidneys, stomach and skin.

Part of my job, for the several years Pau Pau and I both lived in L.A., before she moved in with my parents at the end of her life, was to drive her around. That’s Grandson 101: Make sure Grandma gets wherever she needs to go.

Not that there was an enormous variety of places she frequented. I can name pretty much all of them: Kaiser Permanente, the post office, occasionally the airport when she would visit family in Hong Kong and, most frequently and important, the store.

Sometimes she’d call me when she wanted to buy groceries. Other times, I might get an email with an all-caps subject line: “NEED A RIDE” or just the alarming, one-word “HELP.”

Pau Pau lived within walking distance of a Ralphs, a Gelson’s, a Walgreens and a decent convenience store. But she didn’t like going to those places; she usually wanted to go to 99 Ranch.

(And Costco. Grandmas like deals, and she was no exception. Although she liked 99 Ranch, if she could get instant noodles cheaper at Costco, you’d better believe she’d fully flip allegiances. Before Costco, she used to go to Fedco , a Southern California department store chain that opened in 1948 and was basically the original Costco.)

We would sometimes talk about food or grocery store preferences, and she would reply in her characteristic way, which was to indicate that you were at the very end of a conversation, rather than the beginning or middle of one, and that she was having the final word.

Advertisement

“Anyway — I’m Chinese,” she said. “I like Chinese food.”

Which makes sense. Why wouldn’t you want to go to a store that sells the food you grew up eating? 99 Ranch and its parent company, Tawa Supermarket Inc., were founded by Roger Chen , an immigrant who wanted to eat familiar food in a new country. He used to visit Southern California in the 1970s importing cars for his native Taiwan before settling in Orange County with his family in 1983.

Seeing an opportunity to cater to the tastes of Asian immigrants in the area, Chen opened a supermarket in Westminster in 1983 and another the following year. The stores were successful, and the chain slowly grew to what it is today — 55 locations in 10 states. It seemed a lot of people wanted to be reminded of home.

Pau Pau, who moved to the U.S. from Hong Kong in 1947 and made her home in Los Angeles for 65 years, missed home too, although she rarely vocalized that specifically. Rather, she expressed it through things she ate: that red bean soup sweetened with rock sugar; soup made with pork neck bones and a slew of vegetables; lap cheong heated on a steaming pot of rice. And at 99 Ranch, or Ranch 99, she could replicate some of those flavors.

A quick side note about the name 99 Ranch. The first thing to know is that in Chinese numerology, nine is a lucky number. It’s nowhere close to eight, the supremely lucky number, but it’s still pretty lucky. The word for nine, jiu, also sounds like the word for “long” — so there’s an element of longevity and long life. It’s also considered an imperial number. There are nine rows of nine nails on the doors to the Forbidden City, for example.

The other thing to know is that, while the name of the chain is and has always been 99 Ranch, that doesn’t stop a lot of people — including my grandmother and mom — from calling it “Ranch 99.” A quick Google Trends search shows that in California, 30% of searches are for “Ranch 99” versus 70% for “99 Ranch.” And in Washington state, there are actually more searches for “Ranch 99” than for the correct name of the store.

Do you see 99 Ranch ... or “Ranch 99?” (Mariah Tauger/Los Angeles Times)

There’s really only one explanation, which has been explored on Reddit threads and social media. In some locations, the signage on the front of the store simply reads 99 Ranch Market. But in others, the number 99 is placed above and/or directly in between the words “Ranch” and “Market.” I imagine it’s just to mix up the design a bit, but when reading left to right, those signs say “Ranch 99 Market.” If there’s another plausible reason for this transposition, I haven’t heard it.

A typical Saturday afternoon might look like this: Head up Sepulveda Boulevard to Costco to buy a few things: fruit, coffee, vitamins, printer ink. After that, head over to Sam Woo’s to get some lunch. Sam Woo’s is a busy Cantonese barbecue place with big slabs of red-tinged pork and sad-looking ducks with S-shaped necks hanging from hooks. It also didn’t take reservations, which meant Pau Pau had a chance to show off a little.

She’d cruise in, disregarding the sign-in sheet and crush of waiting patrons, and go directly up to a server and say something in Cantonese. We usually were seated almost immediately, even if it meant sharing a table with strangers. Then we’d make the short walk to 99 Ranch, which was in the same mini-mall. After that? Maybe the hardware store. Maybe Ken Crane’s ( R.I.P. ) — the afternoon was ours.

Last week, I went to 99 Ranch with my mom in Milpitas — “the good one,” according to her. It’s a huge store, far bigger than the one in Van Nuys, but with a familiar layout. Hot food items on the far right side; tanks with live bass and spot prawns in the back; Chinese herbs and liquor locked behind glass sliding doors near the lottery ticket machine in the front.

We bought a few things — pork bones, a package of dried dates, ginger — to make my mom’s version of one of Pau Pau’s favorite soups. It’s a basic, comforting broth that’s homey and so totally uncomplicated that I can tell you how to make it right now:

Advertisement

Roast the bones in the oven on a sheet pan for 45 minutes. (Pau Pau would start with the raw, bloody bones ; my mom roasts them first.) Add them to a stock pot with cold water. Add plenty of ginger and a little garlic. Add a few dried dates. Then clean out your fridge. Toss in half an onion, some celery tops and whatever else you’d like to use up in the produce drawer. Simmer for several hours. Season to taste with salt and white pepper and strain.

As a kid in suburban Chicago, I didn’t grow up particularly embracing Chinese culture — and I don’t think my mom would mind my saying that when she and her brothers were kids, they didn’t either. The rush to embrace came later, as Pau Pau became older and we all realized a terrible truth: She was essentially our family’s last remaining link to China. The last person born there, the last person who really knew the stories, the last person who really knew the language.

And so, over the last couple of decades, we tried to make up for lost time: documenting the stories, diving into the family tree, recording interviews with her. When she was diagnosed with cancer last summer, every moment became one you wanted to put in a time capsule forever. But the end came so fast; she was gone in two months. I miss her more than I’ve ever missed anyone.

I don’t want to romanticize and overstate the importance of 99 Ranch in our lives — it wasn’t some profoundly meaningful experience every time we went — but I don’t want to understate it, either. It was a small but important way for her to connect, through food, with her past. And it allowed me to connect, in a small but important way, with her.

Advertisement

Now that she’s gone, that connection is even more important. Every time I set foot in a 99 Ranch, from now until forever, I will think about her. And although that doesn’t make me miss her less, as I sit here finishing a bowl of her soup, there’s some comfort in knowing that.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Maybe I’m crazy,” says Gino Angelini on a recent phone call. The 68-year-old chef-owner of the lauded Angelini Osteria on Beverly Boulevard is preparing to open an Italian restaurant in the Palisades Village this winter. “I started working in the kitchen when I was 13. You never know with the pandemic, but it will make me stronger to do it.”

Angelini partnered with friend and restaurateur Tancredi Deluca of Amici, Ombra Wine Bar and Deluca’s Deli to launch his latest project.

The new Angelini Ristorante & Bar is adjacent to Hank’s Bar and Grill near the movie theater in the Caruso Pacific Palisades development, which opened in late 2018. It joins other retail and dining options including Blue Ribbon Sushi, McConnell’s ice cream, the Draycott and Alfred Coffee.

Angelini describes the restaurant as an “expansion” of Angelini Osteria, which he opened in 2001. The menu will feature many dishes Angelini is known for, including the taglioni limone, lasagna verde “Nonna Elvira,” spaghetti chitarra alla norcina and tiramisu. Angelini says he’s working on a selection of vegan and vegetarian dishes as well. A vegetable couscous, egg-less pasta, arrabbiata with fresh tomatoes, lentil soup and cauliflower bisteca with pepperoncini, olive oil and sea salt are all under development.

“Gino is definitely going to bring a whole different level of Italian food to that community,” Deluca said.

The longtime restaurateur, who has three restaurants at the Americana at Brand, another Caruso development, said being in a location with built-in foot traffic helped influence his decision to open a new venture during a pandemic. Deluca said he didn’t hesitate when the developer approached him with the opportunity.

“It reminds me of my little town where I grew up in Italy where there is a piazza, people gather together and you eat on the sidewalk,” he said. “And we have seen that people are really wanting to go out and start living again and enjoying life.”

While restaurants across the country struggle to fill positions, Deluca said he’s counting on the loyalty of his and Angelini’s existing longtime staff; they plan to cross-train many of them for the new restaurant.

“A lot of people in our industry moved away from hospitality, and there is definitely a shortage,” Deluca said. “But both Gino and I have tremendous teams that work with us and have been with us for many years. We have the luxury of having very high retention with our employees.”

Deluca and Angelini are hoping the large patio and bar area, which will collectively seat around 60 people, will help attract business. There will be a smaller indoor space with about 40 seats.

The restaurant will be open for lunch and dinner seven days a week, and Deluca said they plan to eventually introduce weekend brunch.

1038 N. Swarthmore Ave., Pacific Palisades
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For Portland, Ore., the last 18 months have played out in a series of trials and tribulations without comparison in modern times: a pandemic that has devastated lives and businesses, wildfires and unbreathable air, civil unrest and a recent day in June where the temperature climbed to 116 degrees.

Many of the places that have come to define 21st century Portland were shuttered, at least temporarily, or reinvented, and that is very much the case for restaurants. On Aug. 10, with anxiety and infection rates rising, the governor of Oregon signed a new mask mandate, and many restaurants now require proof of vaccination for indoor dining.

In a city once viewed by the wider world as a hotbed for craft beer, casual modern cuisine and detached ironic whimsy, what is happening today?

“It’s been quite the journey,” says chef Thuy Pham of Mama Đút, one of Portland’s most lauded new restaurants. Her story, like that of so many chefs and restaurateurs across the city, is indelibly linked to the strife of the last year and a half. Thousands of restaurant jobs were lost, at least for a time. Scores of dining and drinking establishments closed, including the Pok Pok family of restaurants and John Gorham’s Toro Bravo.

But many chefs and restaurateurs have found the wherewithal to look forward, drawing from deep wells of creativity and personal expression to build something that feels challenging, compelling and, against all odds, fun. Just as great art and music historically emerge from times of societal conflict, so too has Portland’s culinary scene become a canvas to express joy and struggle, often in the same bite. Here’s a sampling of restaurants to keep in mind for your next trip north.

Republica

“We are here to tell the full story of Mexican cuisine,” Republica chef Lauro Romero said. “The good and the bad.” The sun had just set over the restaurant’s lush patio in the Pearl District, where Romero, owner Angel Medina and a tight team of collaborators have crafted a menu that focuses on the history of Mexico’s food and legacy through a lens of French and Japanese culinary techniques.

Republica offers a chef’s selection of dishes each evening alongside curated beverage pairings. Romero and Medina, a gifted maitre d’, riff joyously across five courses (omnivore or vegetarian), that challenge preconceived notions around colonialism, history and the complex ethnography of Mexican cuisine.

Dinner might include a hibiscus soup modeled on the classic jamaica agua fresca, upon which a sphere of Crenshaw melon, Oregon coast crab and puffed amaranth floats effortlessly, accompanied by an anecdote from Medina about Aztec foodways. Traditional memelas topped with spicy nopales are plated alongside two European imports, radishes and olive oil. Later you might be served a sort of pre-Columbian risotto— corn fungus, arborio and sweet corn cream — followed by a dish of pasta (cooked in mild red chilies) that’s formed into a sort of bird’s nest, laden with cotija cheese and escamoles, a kind of ant larvae. The menu changes nightly.

Republica offers two tasting menus, one that focuses on fruits and vegetables and one that contains meat and fish. This dish contains avocado, cucumber, strawberry, tomato, lime, and corn. (Christine Dong / For The Times)

Pastry chef Olivia Bartruff may be the restaurant’s secret weapon: At the end of one dinner, I was served atole ice cream with achiote meringues alongside strawberry fennel tres leches cake, which arrived with a short story about the dish’s twisting, turning history. Between the hospitality, the beverages, the cuisine and the narrative, it’s no wonder that Republica ends up on many “exciting new restaurants” lists.

Mama Đút

There may be no more emblematic culinary pivot of the last 18 months in Portland than Mama Đút, a vegan Vietnamese luncheonette whose origin story reads like a film script. “It was my 40th birthday,” chef and founder Thuy Pham recalled, “and I was dead in the water.” A hairdresser by trade, Pham’s source of income seemingly evaporated overnight in the initial panic of the pandemic. A personal interest in veganism led her to try her hand at making a batch of mock pork belly, a skill she learned by watching Buddhist monks on YouTube, and she shared the results on Instagram. Then the orders started rolling in.

“I spent my last $500 on packaging and materials,” Thuy remembered, shaking her head. “And now I can’t believe I’m here.”

A year later — after pop-ups, commissary kitchens and food fairs — Mama Đút now can be found inside a small bricks-and-mortar space, drawing daily crowds of vegans and omnivores.

Pham offers an evolving set of dishes out of her tiny counter space in Southeast Portland, serving burnt rice waffles topped with scallions and jackfruit, vegan banh mi with her signature mock pork belly, and fried mushroom bao buns drizzled in kimchi aioli. The daily dessert specials are notable — including strawberry lychee cheesecakes, ube cinnamon rolls, pandan whoopie pies — along with wonderfully tangy limeades in flavors like passion fruit and Thai tea. If Pham is serving her vivid-green pandan biscuit with five-spice soy ribs, order swiftly — it routinely sells out

“Vegans don’t want to be an afterthought,” said Pham, who is outspoken on social media around issues of activism and social justice. “I don’t know if it’s because I’m a woman of color, but I never thought I could do this before now. And so, to finally be seen now, and celebrated for my food, it has empowered me to stand up for my authentic self. Take me — and my food — for who I am.”

Ruthie’s

There’s nowhere else in Portland — and perhaps America — quite like Ruthie’s, an haute-nouveau reinterpretation of “Mormon cooking” (a term used by the chef-operators).

Collin Mohr and Aaron Kiss grew up together in Ogden, Utah, and cooked their way through kitchens in Salt Lake City and Portland before opening Ruthie’s in October 2020, after pandemic restaurant layoffs left them out of work.

The restaurant — all 120 square feet of it, housed inside a food cart with a wood-fired oven — is putting out beautiful food, with recipes inherited from Mohr’s grandmother Ruth as a thematic throughline. Some items, like the cart-made biscuits, pickles, jams and desserts, come directly from a ward cookbook passed down through generations in the Mormon community of Ogden.

“We’ve spent hours in the kitchen with Grandma Ruthie,” said Mohr, “learning how she does it and letting her slap our hands away.”

But other plates — a polyphonically crunchy pea salad with barley, cherries, goat cheese and sunflower greens; a cucumber salad with tonnato, shaved fennel and alliums; or a peanut butter and jelly pork chop with cherry gastrique and fresh basil — indicate a startling level of professionalism and cheffy composition. You’d be forgiven for blinking twice when you learn this is a two-man operation working out of a food cart.

“Mormon food is so loose-ended,” said Mohr, ”and it’s stuck in the ’50s in some ways. But it lets us express our personalities. We’re doing Pacific Northwest cuisine with a Mormon influence and making it ours.”

Lazy Susan

Local buzz was significant in early 2020 when noted Portland restaurateur Akkapong “Earl” Ninsom — of Hat Yai, Paadee and the Thai tasting counter Langbaan — announced his first concept without an overt Thai influence, overseen by a team that included alumni from some well-known Portland restaurants.

“We were slated to open March 15,” recalled Andrew Mace, Lazy Susan’s co-owner and culinary director. “Then we had to pump the brakes.” What followed was a whiplash-inducing few months with numerous pivots: open-air charcoal plate lunches, brunch boxes, outdoor seating and attempts at opening their retro-dinette-inspired dining room.

All this is prologue: In summer of 2021, Lazy Susan has emerged as one of the city’s most notable new restaurants, synthesizing a diverse and global set of influences into a menu and bar program that defies easy categorization. Your dinner at Lazy Susan might look something like this: a Negroni to start, followed by smoked whitefish salad with fried saltines, a chicken-fried pork cutlet with sauce gribiche topped with a Thai-style fried egg, a jerk quail skewer built on a recipe from line cook Chris Creque’s childhood in St. Thomas, and coal-roasted eggplant laden with labneh and honey, finished off with a slice of Mennonite peanut butter pie for dessert with a glass of oloroso sherry.

“We may have lost some of that honeymoon phase during the opening,” Mace said, “but I feel like now we’re starting to really define who we are.”

Flying Fish

A simple dictum to travelers visiting the Pacific Northwest: While you’re here, think seafood. In Portland, one of the seafood standouts is Flying Fish, a hybrid restaurant and fish market in the heart of the Southeast quadrant. The restaurant’s founder, Lyf Gildersleeve, is a fishmonger who grew up in the family trade and has managed Flying Fish across a variety of forms over the last decade.

Flying Fish’s bricks-and-mortar shop opened in February 2020, carried on as a limited-capacity fish market through a fearful spring and in June 2020 began full service outside on its open-air patio.

The menu at Flying Fish is drawn from the fish market: wild Alaskan salmon poke, Oregon coast halibut fish and chips, a daily slate of a dozen or more oysters from farms in Oregon and Washington state, and a massive Caesar salad studded with radicchio and anchovy fillet. They aren’t reinventing the wheel here — Gildersleeve stashed fish-shack menus for years before opening the restaurant, whose kitchen is overseen by chef Erik Englund — but what comes out of the kitchen at Flying Fish positively glows with that just-caught quality you get only from incredibly fresh seafood.

Oma’s Hideaway

Sometimes a pandemic pivot ends up stealing the show. Such is the case at Oma’s Hideaway, which began life as a takeout tent outside Indonesian restaurant Gado Gado, one of the city’s hottest 2019 openings. “Oma’s is a spinoff that took on a life of its own,” says co-owner Mariah Pisha-Duffly. Now it’s here to stay.

Oma’s draws on the culinary history of chef Thomas Pisha-Duffly’s grandmother, incorporating elements of Peranakan cuisine as well as contemporary influences from Northern Europe and New England. “Peranakan is sometimes also called Straits Chinese,” Mariah Pisha-Duffly explained, “a heritage that fuses Chinese, Malaysian and Indonesian food. We like to joke that it’s the original fusion cuisine.”

Diners at Oma’s can expect a kaleidoscopic approach to pan-Asian cooking, from charcoal-roasted game hen with coconut sambal to Chinese duck and foie gras sausage with braised nappa cabbage to an Instagram-star soft-shell crab sandwich with papaya salad (fans of the Night + Market fried chicken sandwich, take note). Food-friendly cocktails cruise alongside plates of Chinese barbecue and handmade egg noodles. A durian tiramisu, gentle and unctuous, steals the show at dessert.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A unique miasma of pandemic strife, social media reckonings and unexpected business churn has left Portland’s food landscape decidedly changed. The restaurant empires of Andy Ricker (Pok Pok) and John Gorham (Toro Bravo, Tasty n Sons) are gone, although two former Tasty employees have reimagined Gorham’s menus in suburban Lake Oswego. Also gone is Ryan and Elena Roadhouse’s ambitious appointment-only Japanese restaurant, Nodoguro, as well as its more casual, neighboring lounge, Tonari, whose opening momentum was wiped out by the shutdowns. Chef Vitaly Paley has closed multiple spaces over the last year, including hotel restaurants Imperial and Headwaters, but his flagship Paley’s Place is open for full service under chef de cuisine Luis Cabanas.

On the other hand, it’s easier to dine at some of Portland’s most sought-after reservation-only kitchens, where menus have been modified and made more accessible. The list includes Akkapong “Earl” Ninsom’s intimate Thai tasting-menu restaurant Langbaan, which has been reimagined as a walk-up patio experience, as well as Peter Cho and Sun Young Park’s modern Korean restaurant Han Oak, now across town in casual form as Toki, specializing in bao bun burgers and snacky brunch specials.

Some Portland mainstays are still open, including neighborhood bistro on culinary steroids Coquine, home to one of the city’s best wine programs; Le Pigeon and Canard, the high-low one-two punch from chef Gabriel Rucker, which continues to draw travelers from around the world; chef Gregory Gourdet’s new Haitian concept, Kann, which debuted as Kann Winter Village in late 2020 and is scheduled to reopen later this year; and Nong Poonsukwattana’s Khao Man Gai, home for the last decade to a perfect rendition of Hainanese chicken and rice.

Perhaps no chef/restaurateur has pivoted more dramatically than Vince Nguyen, whose minimalist tasting-menu spot Berlu opened in the summer of 2019, drawing on Nguyen’s experience cooking for Michelin-starred restaurants, including Providence and Noma. “Prior to the coronavirus, I never cooked Vietnamese food,” said Nguyen, who grew up in Orange County. “My dad worked two jobs, and we ate mostly fast food and TV dinners.”

But the pandemic led Nguyen to reconnect with his heritage, learning about Vietnamese cooking and baking traditions by watching chefs on YouTube (“It’s the modern cookbook”) and leading Berlu through a range of permutations: a weekend bakery serving bánh bò and moon cakes; elaborate takeout dinners paired with accompanying instructional videos starring the chef; rotating weekly specials exploring the lesser-known soups of Vietnam (“We avoided the phos and more obvious ones”); and night-market pop-ups serving traditional Vietnamese favorites like bánh tráng nuong, a grilled rice cracker topped with eggs, pork belly and shrimp.

“We’ve now been open longer as a pandemic pivot than we were as a tasting menu,” Nguyen said. “It’s been an opportunity for me to grow not just as a chef but as a person and to think about my experiences as a cook as well as my own heritage.”

Berlu plans to reopen with a tasting menu in the fall, Delta variant permitting. When it does, it will be an avowedly different experience, one focused specifically on the Vietnamese food Nguyen fell in love with during the shutdown.

“I’m drawn to challenges,” the chef said, “and that’s what got me into cooking in the first place. It has been a huge challenge to run a restaurant during the pandemic, but it also inspires creativity. Through these pivots I’ve been able to express myself and challenge not only myself but diners as well, by representing Vietnamese cuisine in this way. It has been challenging but also empowering.”


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Growing up in Nashville, I spent most of my time trying very hard to leave.

None of my teachers would have called me studious, but I crammed furiously for the SATs because I knew college was my ticket out. When the time came, I applied primarily to universities on the coasts: UCLA, NYU and Tulane. I didn’t care where exactly — I just wanted to be as far away from Tennessee as I could.

Someone has probably written a country song about this. I could cite it for you if I hadn’t felt so alienated by that culture: maybe something about a ramblin’ man and a one-way ticket on a westbound plane with a one-horse town in my rearview mirror.

So it was with some chagrin that, in 2010, four years after achieving escape velocity and settling in Los Angeles, I read in the New York Times that Nashville was one of “39 places to visit before you die.”

Advertisement

Seemingly as soon as I left, Nashville had become the place to be. My hometown had a new, hip moniker: “Itville.” My friends would visit and come back with fantastic stories of a wondrous land where everyone grows up eating hot chicken and life is one long bachelorette party.

These friends would invariably ask me for recommendations and my responses were always disappointing. The touchstones of a wasted childhood in the suburbs don’t make for great vacation fun. Perhaps a cherry limeade at Sonic? Captain D’s hush puppies? The Cool Springs Mall? How about one of the five or six Chinese restaurants my parents ate at on a rotation?

And so I felt a little consternation when I saw that Howlin’ Ray’s in L.A.'s Chinatown had the longest lines for food in the city. I refused to go, unable to stomach the irony of waiting in a three-hour line for Nashville hot chicken after spending most of my life trying to leave Nashville behind.

But the new Nashville was inescapable, and so was its chicken. Its legend had grown and found me in Los Angeles. It was at the grocery store, in the frozen aisle. It was a potato chip flavor. There’s a hot chicken place two miles down the street from my house. The other day a friend even asked me for my hot chicken recipe.

It was around that time that I decided I needed to go back to Nashville and get to know this new, hip place that I had grown up in with no knowledge of. So last week, I flew back to Nashville to try to see my erstwhile hometown with new eyes.

It’s been 15 years since I lived in Nashville, most of which I’ve spent falling in love with Los Angeles and making this city into my home.

I wear a Yasiel Puig jersey most weekends. I get homesick for burritos when I go abroad. I’ve become a semi-regular at a few dim sum places in the San Gabriel Valley. I have a tattoo of a map of Los Angeles on my right bicep, a Langer’s baseball cap and a Tito’s Tacos T-shirt.

Fitting in was always easier in Los Angeles because everybody here seemed to come from somewhere else. In Tennessee, it always felt like we were just pressing our noses up against the glass. We were not white nor Christian in a place where most people were.

But Nashville has changed so much since I’ve been there, and I was ready to see it with new eyes. The greater metropolitan area has grown by a half-million, with dramatic increases in Black, Latino and foreign-born populations. A tidal wave of investment has poured into the city, gentrifying multiple neighborhoods and attracting migrants from across the country and world.

I began my journey in East Nashville, where many have placed the origins of Nashville’s hipness renaissance.

East Nashville reminded me of any gentrifying neighborhood in a large city. Here, a bar with an ironic Patrick Swayze mural. There, a dive bar that serves an unexpectedly good burger. Everywhere, coffee places that make that one drink, where coffee is slowly dripped through a device that looks like a hip hourglass, full of people with more tattoos than average. In one food hall there was even a taco place selling California and Mission Style burritos.

At Hugh Baby’s, a burger place that serves burgers with pulled pork as a condiment (unsurprisingly delicious), I met Steve Haruch, a Korean American journalist and editor of the book “Greetings from New Nashville,” which has been an invaluable text for understanding Nashville’s rise.

From Steve’s book, I learned that the statue I had driven by nearly every day on I-65 was not just some dusty Civil War figure, but in fact depicted Nathan Bedford Forrest, the founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Also that floods and tornadoes have accelerated Nashville’s gentrification through the process of disaster capitalism.

And I learned that much of Nashville found out about hot chicken around the same time as I did. Until about 2012, there were only two restaurants, patronized primarily by Black Nashvillians, that served hot chicken.

We talked about skyrocketing home prices and how we tend to have a blind spot for the places we grow up. It turned out that Steve had left the suburbs of Chicago for Nashville for many of the same reasons I left Nashville for LA.

The next day, I went on a strip mall crawl of Nolensville Pike, a road where Nashville’s many immigrant communities make their homes.

I ate a fantastic tlayuda at Frida’s, a Oaxacan shop in the back of a paletería neighboring a Kurdish banquet hall, and found myself wondering how they sourced the stringy Oaxacan cheese quesillo all the way in Tennessee. They sold tostilocos there, a snack I first tried in Tijuana from a vendor on the long wait to cross the border back into the U.S.

I tried Turkish coffee for the first time at the Kurdish restaurant Edessa’s, where saffron rice was called “yellow rice.”

I wandered through the four loosely connected Kurdish grocery stores and strip malls that formed Little Kurdistan. I found Southeast Asian-style crawfish boils, taco places called La Michoacana and El Tapatio, and even a strip mall called Plaza Mariachi.

I felt overwhelmed with deja vu. If you look at a Google Maps image of Nolensville Pike, the only way I’d be able to tell it wasn’t Los Angeles is because east of the Mississippi, the Carl’s Jr.'s are called Hardee’s.

That night, I tried Hattie B’s hot chicken sandwich, and found that I preferred the version at Howlin’ Ray’s. The reasons I left Nashville began to feel very trivial.

If you go to enough places and you look hard enough, eventually you realize that everything is everywhere, for better or for worse.

Everything is everywhere because educated young people in hip neighborhoods want the same things and signal the same preferences to the same algorithms. Because developers take that data and respond with a repetitive pastiche of midcentury modern furniture, reclaimed barn wood and industrial chic decor.

Everything is everywhere because immigrants try to re-create our homes no matter where we settle. We all need venues to get married in, tastes of home, grocery stores and places to buy quinceañera dresses, jasmine rice and khachapuri.

Advertisement

Everything is everywhere because every city falls in love with the story of its own relevance, true or not.

Everything is everywhere because places are not just places any more, they are also products. History becomes the next generation‘s vibes. East Hollywood’s beloved Cha Cha Chicken becomes Cha Cha Lofts. East Nashville’s historic Hunter Station becomes Hunter Station food hall.

When you grow up in an immigrant family, one of the first things you learn is that home is not something you’re just born with. It’s something you have to go looking for.

The drive brought my parents to America from Taiwan, first to Alabama, then to Michigan, and then to Tennessee. It sent us on pilgrimages into the Deep South looking for bags of rice and xialongbao and dim sum.

I was looking for home when I left Tennessee and went to UCLA, when I became a writer and a San Gabriel Valley reporter and later resident.

It’s also true, though, that I came back to Tennessee looking for home. And I did find it, finally.

It happened around 2 a.m. last week, in a parked car in front of a Waffle House waiting for a double order of smothered hash browns. I listened to the cicadas squall, breathed in the familiar, mossy scent of wet grass and damp concrete, and wondered what life in Tennessee would be like if I had never left at all.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@While many of Portland’s bricks-and-mortar restaurants struggled to survive during the pandemic, food carts — long associated with the city — have been hanging in there and, in some cases, thriving. Relatively lax regulations and a plethora of carts for sale have made food carts an attractive option for new and emerging chefs.

The famous Alder Street pod in downtown Portland is now gone, replaced by construction for a high-rise hotel, but newer pods like Collective Oregon Eateries and the Shady Pines Vegan Court have sprung up in a burst of entrepreneurial energy.

Some of the best carts of the last 18 months include Erica’s Soul Food, where Atlanta-born founder Erica Montgomery brings a chef’s touch to dishes like hot lemon pepper wings, boiled peanuts and pimento cheese fries; Poppyseed, a food cart from pastry chef Lissette Morales Willis and chef Tim Willis (Le Pigeon) offering preserved-lemon chicken salad sandwiches, cart-made foie gras and Morales Willis’ almond Black Forest cake; Sorbu Paninoteca, a Sicilian cart specializing in torta di ceci, a chickpea flatbread upon which chef Chris Ericsen heaps mozzarella and eggplant, as well as massive, glowingly fresh salads with greens from nearby Praxis Farms; and Skidbladnir, a Celtic cart serving elaborate seasonal smørrebrøds, lamb sandwiches and whiskey-cured salmon. In addition to these new entries, prepandemic-established cart stars including Matta, Jojo, Bing Mi, Matt’s BBQ and Kee’s #Loaded Kitchen draw waiting crowds.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A friend and I recently talked about our entertaining styles in the post-vaccine world and came to the same conclusion: Long gone are the days of cooking right before guests arrive — or even serving hot food. From now on, the types of dishes we make are the kind best served at room temperature, so all the cooking can be done the night or morning prior, freeing the host from being a sweaty stress-case by the time guests arrive.

This style of entertaining is especially essential when temps are consistently warmer than in summers past. Food that can sit out in this weather and still be beautiful — no matter how long it takes guests to move to the dining table — is all I want to make right now.

Luckily, the new cookbook “Colombiana: A Rediscovery of Recipes & Rituals from the Soul of Colombia” from Mariana Velásquez is full of just those dishes. She documents the classic dishes of her native country, and it all, naturally, fits well with entertaining in warm temperatures. Velásquez also is one of the best food stylists in the country. All the food in “Colombiana” is presented beautifully to share the heat and environment through the photos, while also being approachable for a neophyte to Colombian cuisine.

A simple, tender beef roast is braised in a mixture of red wine, Cubanelle chiles and sweet, caramel-y panela then served at room temperature the next day. Cucumbers are marinated in garlic and lime juice and get better the longer they sit in the fridge. Plantains are simmered in coconut milk perfumed with clove, cinnamon and orange zest and can hang out for hours, absorbing the marinade to their core.

And for dessert, an all-in-the-blender flan-like custard made with fresh coconut and sweetened condensed milk achieves a dreamy-smooth texture after an overnight stint in the fridge.

Set out all the dishes at the same time and let guests leisurely refresh their drinks and spend a little too long chatting by the bowl of olives. You can relax knowing that dinner will be just as stunning by the time they sit down to eat.

Posta Negra Con Ensalada De Pepino Y Arroz De Coco Blanco

Velásquez uses a top blade roast, also known as top chuck roast. “The posta can be made the day prior and cooled before refrigerating. Serving this meat at room temperature works very well. Just warm up the sauce and drizzle it over the meat once you have plated the slices.”
