@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Like "Charlie's Angels," "Fantasy Island" is one of those old Aaron Spelling series that keeps resurfacing, whether anybody asked for it or not. So after a 1990s reboot and a pretty awful horror movie version last year, Fox boards the plane once again with a slightly updated version about a magical place where dreams are fulfilled and lessons learned.

Frankly, this latest "Island" visit would be better off had HBO not recently premiered "The White Lotus," a much better, more complicated look at travelers to an island paradise and those who serve them.

The most new-look aspect of this "Fantasy Island," by contrast, is that the person greeting the guests is Elena Roarke (Roselyn Sanchez), the great niece of the original white-suited emcee played by Richard Montalban, who notes that stewardship of the island has been in her family for generations.

Beyond that, there's a somewhat serialized aspect involving one of the characters introduced in the first episode, and a sexual-tension thing happening between Ms. Roarke and Javier (John Gabriel Rodriquez), the handsome pilot who flies over the new guests.

The formula otherwise remains largely the same, just with more contemporary flavor, such as a woman who comes to the island facing a terminal illness, and whose flirtation with another woman makes her husband wonder if she settled by choosing him decades earlier.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tim Drake, one of several characters to have taken up Robin's mantle in the comics, accepts a date with a male friend in the new issue of "Batman: Urban Legends," a series that debuted earlier this year.

The issue's final page sees Drake visit his friend Bernard at his home after the two shared a moment of unexpected connection (and Drake, as his alter ego Robin, must rescue Bernard from a villain). In the last panel, Drake tells Bernard, beaming, "Yeah ... yeah, I think I want that" after Bernard asks him out.

"[The issue] happened because this is who Tim is," comic writer Meghan Fitzmartin said in an interview with Polygon . "I love this character very much, and as I went back to reread as much as I could to do Robin justice, it became clear this is the story Tim needed to tell."

The last page of the comic sees Robin (out of costume as Tim Drake) gladly accept a date with his friend Bernard.

Fans have long seen Batman's loyal sidekick as a potentially queer character since the first Robin, Dick Grayson, made his comics debut in the 1940s. In a 2016 article for Slate , adapted from his book on the World's Greatest Detective, culture critic Glen Weldon documented a few instances that made readers' ears perk up. These include depictions of Batman and Robin lying next to each other, naked, in separate beds; Batman and Robin waking up in the same bed; Robin throwing jealous fits when Batman entertained female love interests. Former Batman comic writer Grant Morrison even told Playboy magazine that "gayness is built into Batman."

Despite decades of fans clamoring for queer Robin content, the sidekick's sexuality was never overtly stated, though various iterations of Robin, from Drake to newer addition Damian Wayne, have had relationships with women in the comics.

Speaking to Polygon, Fitzmartin said that Drake's new relationship doesn't erase his past dalliances with women (most notably Stephanie Brown, who moonlights as the hero Spoiler).

"I wanted to pay tribute to the fact that sexuality is a journey ... However, Tim is still figuring himself out," Fitzmartin told Polygon. "I don't think he has the language for it all ... yet."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) "What If...?" might be the most Marvel Comics thing that Marvel Studios has done, translating the what-might-have-happened-if comic-book concept from page to screen, with all its geekiness intact. The highly stylized animation and access to key actors enhances the fun, creating an extremely logical Disney+ add-on to an increasingly packed multi-verse.

The "What If...?" comic made its debut in 1977, kicking off with the question "What If Spider-Man Joined the Fantastic Four?" As it turned out, altering one key moment in history -- the Fantastic Four had indeed offered Spidey membership, and he passed -- caused ripples large and small. As unintended consequences go, the anthological format offered examples of the butterfly effect via new stories each month, sometimes clever and others far-fetched.

Translating the spirit of that idea to TV has been executed with meticulous care, and both feet deeply rooted in the Marvel movies in terms of storylines and the cast members who vocally reprise their roles. Of those, the most wrenching and noteworthy is Chadwick Boseman, who recorded material as T'Challa/Black Panther before his death last year.

That episode, which weaves T'Challa into the Guardians of the Galaxy mythology, might be the most out-there of the three previewed, but it nicely encapsulates the ability to take wild swings that play off fans' passion for the movies.

Each story is introduced by the Watcher (Jeffrey Wright), an omniscient narrator sworn not to intervene in these twists of fate, who describes the multi-verse as "a prism of endless possibilities."

(CNN) After living through a year-plus without live music, fans showed up to Thursday night's concert with Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett, the second of two sold-out shows billed as "One Last Time" at New York's Radio City Music Hall, with palpable excitement.

Douglas Heye

If you're unfamiliar with Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett as a duo, they may seem an odd couple -- but they're not new. Their acclaimed duet album of standards, "Cheek to Cheek," recorded in 2014, was followed by a tour, so last week's shows were a reunion of sorts.

I've been a Tony Bennett fan my whole life. At a young age, I was captivated by the jazz standards he, Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald made famous. I was listening to him well before he reached the 1990s MTV generation on "MTV Unplugged."

I have seen Bennett in concert several times. I'm also a live music fanatic. Not being able to go to concerts has been one of the toughest parts for me in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Records and CDs, or, more and more these days, digital or streaming, just aren't the same. A last-minute, mid-week impulse trip to New York to see this show seemed like a rational decision after more than a year with no concerts and my favorite venues closed.

The Great American Songbook is Bennett's wheelhouse. He has been singing those songs professionally for 80 years now, more and more in duet formats. In this context, a Bennett devotee might expect Lady Gaga to come off as more a curiosity than a duet partner. I admit that I did, and I was totally wrong. As Bennett has said about her , she is a jazz singer. A great one.

The "Game of Thrones" star, who welcomed his first child six months ago with actress Rose Leslie, told The Sunday Times that he is in recovery from alcoholism.

"Things that have happened to me since 'Thrones' ended, and that were happening during 'Thrones,' were of a pretty traumatic nature and they did include alcohol," he said.

The actor, 34, when on to say that at times he felt like a "bad" and "shameful person."

"And you feel that there's no way out, that's just who you are. And getting sober is the process of going, 'No, I can change,'" Harington said. "One of my favourite things I learnt recently is that the expression 'a leopard doesn't change its spots' is completely false: that a leopard actually does change its spots. I just think that's the most beautiful thing. It really helped. That was something I kind of clung to; the idea that I could make this huge fundamental change in who I was and how I went about my life."

He said she even told him his "little writing career" (don't forget to insert the quote fingers) was over.

"I go, 'OK lady, when I become a successful writer, you will never see one penny from my success. There will be no house for you. There's no vacation for you, no Elvis Cadillac for mommy. You get nothing. Because you said that,'" he recalled.

Tarantino says he had stuck to that, other than kicking in some dough after she got into "a jam with the IRS."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Britney Spears will have to wait longer for a ruling on her request to remove her father as conservator of her estate.

Judge Brenda Penny has denied a petition filed by Britney Spears' attorney Mathew Rosengart to move a September 29 hearing in the case to August 23 in an effort to remove Jamie Spears as soon as possible as the conservator of his daughter's estate, according to court documents obtained by CNN on Monday.

Judge Penny did not give a reason for her decision.

"Every day that passes is another day of avoidable harm and prejudice to Ms. Spears and the Estate," last week's petition filed by Rosengart stated. "Ms. Spears's emotional health and well-being must be, and are, the paramount concern. Further, all interested parties forcefully agree that Mr. Spears's continued presence as Conservator of the Estate is contrary to Ms. Spears's best interests, health, and well-being, and that his prompt removal -- or, at the very least, his immediate suspension -- is 'critical' at this juncture."

Rosengart had previously filed a petition to remove the elder Spears from his role as co-conservator and replace him with Jason Rubin, a CPA at Certified Strategies Inc. in Woodland Hills, California.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TV OT is a weekly look at what CNN's entertainment team is watching since too much television has us all working overtime.

(CNN) It's the end of another week, end of another Olympics and the end of my hopes of becoming the next " Jeopardy " host (Although, I never had any chance because I'm a woman and a person of color. Bazinga.)

With all these endings, let's start something. How about this week's TV OT?

Smells like teen dispirit

I'm not sure when it happened. But it was at some point between catching up on "Gossip Girl," watching the latest episode of "White Lotus" and continuing to glacially make my way through the new season of "Never Have I Ever" that I had a realization: If I was a teen girl right now, I'd be annoyed.

It seems as this generation of young women was being ushered into what us elders would like to believe is a better world -- one where they can love who they want to love surrounded by body positive messages and real-life examples of extraordinary young people using their voices and talents for good -- they've been boxed in.

If the aforementioned shows are to be believed, all teen girls are social media bullies, faux-woke hypocrites and downright mean to other people for the pure pleasure of bragging that they have two boyfriends. Young ladies, I think you need to hear this blatantly from at least one person who's been where you are: You deserve better.

This is where I admit that while I don't regularly cross paths with any teen girls, aside from the occasional cordial wave at my neighbor who walks her white fluffy dog while I walk my white fluffy dog. But roughly 180 moons ago, I was a teen girl.

The early aughts was a tough time to be a teenage girl watching television because it didn't feel like anyone making TV shows understood what it was really like to actually be one. I thought that if my lineup was any indication, I was the only freak my age not in love triangle, getting into alcohol-fueled car wrecks, dealing with a clique of over-lip-glossed queen wannabees or navigating an unwanted pregnancy. Was I a boring teen? Absolutely. But when the best and most empowering representation of a girl your own age that TV can provide is written by a now- problematic man and leaves you wishing vampires were real so you could slay them, too, that's sad.

Things have gotten better, thankfully. For one, there are more teens than ever who aren't just white, straight and wealthy/middle-class. There are differed experiences reflected (see: lots of stuff on Disney+, "All Americans," "On My Block"), and that's great. But teen girls deserve more credit and respect across the board -- on shows not made specifically for them (like "White Lotus") and especially on shows made for them.

Now, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, star of "Never Have I Ever," has acknowledged that "not everyone's going to relate" to her show or chaos-driven, two-timer character, "and that's okay," she told Teen Vogue . Which is fair and true.

TM, is that there's a reason names like Meadow Soprano, Dana Brody and Julie Taylor -- teen girls often listed among the Images matter and the bad ones stick. My only caution, as a Certified Old, is that there's a reason names like Meadow Soprano, Dana Brody and Julie Taylor -- teen girls often listed among the most annoying characters ever -- roll off the tongue a lot easier than the names of fictional teenage girls who feel or felt authentic. (But here are some, if you want to refresh your brain.) Images matter and the bad ones stick.

This generation has put up with a lot -- too much to be remembered by TV historians as the generation of hollow values that always knows the right things to say but nothing about the right thing to do.

The beautiful thing is that in your real life, you get to decide who you want to be, and it doesn't have to come from TV.

Watch the skies?

A still from Showtime's "UFO."

An Unidentified Sighing Critic (CNN's Brian Lowry) has a recommendation that's out of this world. He writes:

"The robust UFO-curious industry has been flying high since the government began declassifying certain material, adding to the tantalizing reality that some sightings that simply cannot be explained. 'UFO,' a new multipart docuseries on Showtime premiering Aug. 8, taps into that fascination, while focusing on the extent to which witnesses have been dismissed, diminished and belittled.

Produced by among others director J.J. Abrams, the project begins with the New York Times reporting in 2017 that pulled back the curtain, a bit, on government study of the issue. 'UFO' includes an interview with former senator Harry Reid, who was instrumental in bringing much of what has been reported in the last few years into the public eye.

'With UFOs, nothing is ever black and white,' says author John Greenewald Jr.

'UFO' probably won't change many hearts or minds, but it's an intriguing exploration of the gray area in between."

'Hit & Run' TV

A scene from "Hit & Run."

Lowry also drives in an important point on a new series from Netflix that you may see appear in your queue this weekend if your algorithm sees fit. He writes:

"If you're in the market for an Israeli/US thriller where nobody is who they appear to be, Netflix's 'Hit & Run' might be for you.

The show begins with a seemingly innocent tragedy, as an Israeli tour guide (Lior Raz) loses his American-born wife (Kaelen Ohm) in a hit-and-run accident. But the story spins wildly into lots of cloak-and-dagger stuff thereafter, from Tel Aviv to New York.

It's certainly binge-able, with a US-Israeli cast that includes Sanaa Lathan as a US reporter who eventually gets involved, but be forewarned: The nine episodes leave room for more, so if you're wary about committing to another one of these international vehicles that Netflix is using to fill its showroom of originals, your mileage may vary."

Say what?

The Hilton family cutting onions in "Cooking with Paris."

I struggled with what to say about Paris Hilton's new cooking show on Netflix because I'm very sensitive to what's she's been through as the original influencer. I don't like laughing at people but since she's made it clear that she's laughing with us this time, I think I can bring you this collection of best lines with no guilt.

Before we eat, a prayer: Netflix, bless this mess.

Paris, in a grocery store: "Excuse me, sir. What do chives look like?"

Paris, with three phones in her hand: "Where are my other phones? I have two more."

Demi Lovato, reading a recipe: "'Zest of one lemon.' What's a 'zest'? Is that the top of it?"

Paris: "Zest? I know what a zest is. I actually had no idea what a zest was earlier, but I learned because I went to our friend Google."

Paris, speaking to a dog: "Do you want some caviar?"

Paris, after dousing herself in a spray: "I needed a perfume break."

Kathy Hilton, to Paris: "Honey, you're getting your feathers in everything."

Finally,

Nicky Hilton, walking into her sister's home for dinner: "Just what you need — another picture of yourself."

Silver screen goes for gold

James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad'

Lowry with a final thought: "As the Olympics come to a close, a quick nod to one constituency that still appears to fervently believe in the Games, even with ratings way down: Movie studios and streaming services. All those ads for 'Dune,' 'The Suicide Squad,' 'Shang-Chi' and Disney+ prove DC/Warner Bros. and Marvel/Disney can agree on something -- namely, that when it comes to reaching a lot of the most elusive viewers (i.e. young men) that they hope will flock to such fare, this is the last big chance until football season kicks off in September."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Actor Julie Bowen of "Modern Family" and her sister helped rescue a hiker when she fainted last week at Arches National Park in Moab, Utah, the hiker told CNN.

"They could have just ignored me, passed on, but they didn't," Minnie John said Saturday. "She could have gone on -- she must have had a busy agenda that was disturbed because of me. They treated me, a stranger, with love and respect."

John, of New Jersey, recounted the events in a three-part Facebook post in which she also shared photos of her experience.

She, her husband, Shaji, and their son, Brandon, had gone to Utah to see the Delicate Arch, she wrote. The attraction, which is 46 feet high and 32 feet wide, is the largest free-standing arch in the national park and one of the most popular sights

John said that as they neared the trail's end, she felt lightheaded, dizzy and unable to make it to the arch, which was still 15 minutes away. She said she sat on a rock to avoid fainting and told her family to continue without her.

"All I remember is sitting there with my head in my hands secure on the rock," John wrote in one Facebook post. "Next thing I hear someone with a familiar voice kept asking me questions."

Minnie John is surrounded by Julie Bowen, right, and her sister Annie.

John told CNN that Bowen, best known for playing Claire Dunphy on the TV show "Modern Family," her sister, Dr. Annie Luetkemeyer, and a guide were also hiking to see the Delicate Arch. "The guide saw me fall forward," she said.

Bowen, her sister and the guide ran to John and found she'd broken her nose and the skin around her nose, she said.

In a brief phone conversation, Luetkemeyer confirmed to CNN that she and her sister rescued the hiker.

CNN has also reached out to Bowen and a representative for comment.

'They were so down to earth, so genuine, so sweet'

John, who is diabetic, had low blood sugar, was severely dehydrated, and had forgotten to eat since breakfast, she said. John said Luetkemeyer, an infectious disease specialist, was able to take care of her right away, cleaning her wound and providing her with electrolytes, medicine and pretzels.

"I had no strength in my feet," John said. "Julie and Annie got both my arms, lifted me up, and put me on the same rock I'd fallen off of. My eyes came into focus and I saw Julie in front of me as Annie was still talking to me."

Once she was seated, Bowen and Luetkemeyer used John's cellphone to contact Brandon, John explained. As they waited for the return of John's family, John asked for a group photo.

"I said, 'Can I take a picture?' and Julie said, 'Of course,' and gave me a big hug and we took a picture," John said. "They were so down to earth, so genuine, so sweet: Not at all how you might expect a big actor or a big doctor to be -- which they are. They were just so humble, so loving."

Fifteen minutes later, Shaji and Brandon returned from the arch.

"They were so frantic," John wrote in her post. "Had I fallen sideways or backwards, I would have split my head."

Minnie John received five stitches and was told she had a fractured nose

John went to Moab Regional Hospital, she told CNN, where she received five stitches and was told she had a fractured nose. She said doctors there told her many hikers don't realize how difficult the trail is, especially given the heat, and will often go ill-prepared.

"I have scabs over all the scraped parts," John said.

She added how amazed she was at Bowen and her sister's actions.

"I knew I'd never meet them again but I appreciated and admired the human part of what they did -- selfless, not selfish," she said. "We tend to forget the daily kindnesses we encounter. We're blind to everything around us and don't imagine that people will be so good, kind and caring."

(CNN) Seeing celebrities through their own eyes and stories can be fraught with ... exaggeration. Or, if the star has been particularly introspective, a lot can be learned.

Which brings me to actor Val Kilmer and our first item this week. Let's get to it, shall we?

Three things to watch

'Val'

Cancer may have robbed Kilmer of his voice, but he has still managed to find a way to have his say.

The "Top Gun" star was one of Hollywood's early adopters of handheld cameras. Thanks to that, there is plenty of footage from his professional and personal life over the years.

It all has been packaged in a documentary titled "Val," billed as a "raw, wildly original and unflinching documentary" that "reveals a life lived to extremes and a heart-filled, sometimes hilarious look at what it means to be an artist and a complex man."

Kilmer is a bona fide movie star -- and it's not often we get such an intensely personal glimpse of the progression of a career in the spotlight, courtesy of what is essentially home movies. The narration by his sound-alike son, Jack, makes it feel all the more intimate.

The film is currently in limited release in theaters and starts streaming on Amazon Friday.

'Cooking With Paris'

Paris Hilton stars in "Cooking With Paris."

'A Different World'

"A Different World" was a spin-off of "The Cosby Show."

With all the attention being paid to historically Black colleges and universities right now, it feels the appropriate time to binge "A Different World."

"The Cosby Show" spin-off ran on NBC from 1987 to 1993 and was centered on the fictitious Hillman College, a school so famous in the Black community that I have been stopped by show fans when wearing a T-shirt repping the fake institute of higher learning (receipts that I really do own such a shirt can be found here ).

Originally conceived as a show for Lisa Bonet's character Denise Huxtable, she wasn't on the show long and instead we fell in love with the likes of students Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison) and Whitley Gilbert-Wayne (Jasmine Guy).

Enjoy a blast from the past with the series when it starts streaming on HBO Max Sunday. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of WarnerMedia.)

Two things to listen to

Barbra Streisand performs.

Strike up the band as Barbra Streisand is releasing music!

"Release Me 2" is the second volume of some of the diva's rare, previously unheard tracks and her first album since 2018's "Walls."

"Working on this 2nd volume of Release Me has been a lovely walk down memory lane ... a chance to revisit, and in some cases, add a finishing instrumental touch to songs that still resonate for me in meaningful ways ," Streisand says in a note on her si te. "I'm particularly struck by the ongoing relevance of 'Be Aware' and 'One Day,' which still speak to our collective sense of humanity."

Absolutely no one does it like Babs (we can call her that after all these years, right?). "Release Me 2" is out Friday.

Chris Young performs during the "Raised on Country World Tour 2019" at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, August 17, 2019.

Singer-songwriter Chris Young is releasing his latest studio album, titled "Famous Friends."

It's accurate, given that the single of the same name, a duet with Kane Brown, hit No. 1 and he also has collaborations with Lauren Alaina and Mitchell Tenpenny.

The new album drops Friday.

One thing to talk about

Actress Lisa Rinna is reprising her "Days of Our Lives" role on a specal limited series.

Soap operas, daytime dramas, the stories -- no matter what you call them -- I miss them.

I grew up with my grandmother falling asleep (she worked multiple jobs) in front of "The Young and the Restless," basically leaving the soap to play babysitter.

Over the years, multiple daytime dramas have gotten canceled, which is why I was thrilled to hear that NBC's streaming service, Peacock, had ordered "Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem."

The limited series is a gift to fans of "Days of Our Lives," one of the longest-running soap operas ever.

It's old home week with some popular past and present "Days" stars scheduled to appear, including Deidre Hall, Jackée Harry and Lisa Rinna.

Handclaps of praise!

Something to sip on

DaBaby attends the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards at Staples Center in Los Angeles, January 26, 2020.

Call me cynical, but I don't view DaBaby's apology after he started losing gigs a moment of enlightenment.

Keeping it real, hip-hop has always had a problem with homophobia, misogyny and other issues that undercut the rights of "others."

Not that the genre is singular in that, but the music for years has been underpinned by masculine bravado that has been far from LGBTQ+-friendly.

After DaBaby's controversial comments at the Rolling Loud music festival in Miami, the backlash came from multiple fronts, including from fellow artists Dua Lipa, Elton John and Madonna, and music festival Lollapalooza , which canceled a scheduled performance prior to his apology

Here's hoping DaBaby is getting educated on why he was wrong, not just learning how to keep inflammatory comments to himself.

In "Daria," this monotone teen (Tracy Grandstaff) delivered truth bombs like she was a scuba diver and they were her only source of air. In many ways, though, Daria's singular way of seeing the world was a source of life for those surrounded by more Quinns and Brittanys than Janes and Darias. The character kept space for a whole generation of girls who didn't want to be like someone else; they just wanted to be. In her words: "I'm not miserable. I'm just not like them."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) "The Suicide Squad" is a rather ironic title for a do-over, but that's what DC and Warner Bros. have essentially done, taking another stab at the team of supervillains five years after a prior effort. On the plus side, writer-director James Gunn's movie is superior to its predecessor on most every level. Balancing that, the R-rated mayhem becomes a trifle numbing, blunting the overall effect.

At its best, Gunn manages to wed the team-of-misfits goofiness, garnished with a pinch of heart, from his "Guardians of the Galaxy" films for rival Marvel with the cheerful gore and irreverence of "Deadpool," catering to fans eager to see heroes (or villains) allowed to utterly cut loose.

This new "Suicide Squad" also shrewdly cherry-picks the best elements from David Ayer's film, bringing back Margot Robbie as the Joker's homicidal sidekick Harley Quinn, Joel Kinnaman as square-jawed Colonel Rick Flag and Viola Davis as the ruthless government bureaucrat who oversees Task Force X, whose underlings obviously prefer the more colloquial nickname when wagering on who will survive the mission. (Ayer has recently discussed that the movie released wasn't his cut, but any comparisons at this point can only be based on what audiences have seen.)

It's the specifics of the mission, actually, where "Suicide Squad" breaks down a bit, with the team dispatched to a fictional island nation known as Corto Maltese, one that has recently experienced a coup, putting at risk a secret facility where an alien intelligence is reportedly being held.

The squad's job is to penetrate the country and destroy said facility, wading -- with a whole lot of hiccups -- through a seemingly endless supply of soldiers set up to be folded, spindled and mutilated in creative and colorful ways.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) "Free Guy" is a cleverly programmed wedding of star (Ryan Reynolds) and subject matter, in a movie that's silly, handsome-looking and a great deal of fun, in roughly inverse proportion to how much one sweats the details. Traveling inside videogames doesn't always end well cinematically, but this "Guy" braves that familiar scenario and comes out ahead.

Although there's a bit of "Ready Player One" baked into the colorful world that Reynolds' Guy inhabits, a more appropriate (if loftier) spiritual heir would be "The Truman Show," to the extent the central character discovers that the world he's living in is completely artificial, a construct for the amusement of others.

Adding a degree of difficulty, Guy is a resident of Free City, a place with an inordinately high crime rate, where working at the bank, as he does, means happily dropping to the floor without even interrupting a conversation with his best pal Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) when someone barges in to rob the place.

Guy, it turns out, is a non-playable character in this videogame world, living out the same routine over and over. All that changes, however, when he encounters Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer, an Emmy winner for "Killing Eve" ), a visitor from the outside who has entered Free City on a very specific mission, and who stirs reactions in Guy that bring him very close to tilt.

What's happening here? Getting into that too deeply would spoil the fun, but suffice it to say the avatars in the game world don't bear much resemblance to their real-world counterparts, and that Comer's outside-the-game self, Millie, is at odds with the head of the videogame company (Taika Waititi, amusingly over the top) behind Free City, setting up a threat to Guy's world just as he's rediscovering his place in it.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The season finale of Apple TV+'s "Physical" brought to a, erm, climax a story that began as a tale about an unfulfilled housewife (Rose Byrne) in the '80s and concluded with a woman set free. Well, she's at least starting to set herself free.

In the episode, which began streaming Friday, Byrne's Sheila sees her aerobics business open up potential new doors, her husband's election end with a fizzle and, after a blow-up involving a cream puff, her mutual attraction to developer John Breem (Paul Sparks) move into a strange new stage.

In an interview with CNN, executive producer Annie Weisman and director Stephanie Laing, who helmed seven of the show's 10 freshman season episodes, break down the action and tease what's to come in Season 2.

This conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. It contains discussions of eating disorders that some may find triggering.

CNN: I want to start off by thanking you both for a season of TV that I cannot stop thinking about. It was so jarring and uncomfortable and a great, specific story. I was angry at Sheila the whole time, but I was also angry for her. What did you want this finale to be in terms of her journey?

Annie Weisman, executive producer: It was a long time coming that she was going to walk out the door of that house. I always knew that we wanted to be true to the difficulty of that at the time -- you know the dangerousness of that. She has spent so much of her life controlling threatening emotions -- reigning them in, pressing them down. We knew that there was going to be some release when it happened. And the writers came up with this idea for this unique kind of sexual connection that happens between her and John Breem (Paul Sparks), which ended up being the most Covid-friendly sex scene ever shot in some ways. Totally inadvertently.

Director Stephanie Laing on the set of "Physical."

CNN: I was going to work my way up to talking about the scene where they engage in self-pleasure in front of each other, but let's dive in. Stephanie, tell me about directing this finale.

Stephanie Laing, director: It starts on the page, right? Everyone just pays off so well. It's all building up to this moment. And I agree with you, you're sort of hating Sheila and then you're loving Sheila and you want her to win. So when she finally does something, I think everyone is sort of cheering alongside her.

For me, the finale is the release. It's been building, building, building. When you leave her in episode nine, she's like, 'This is how we win,' she's gained the confidence and, for lack of a better way of putting it, the lady balls to go marching off into this future that we will find out more about.

Weisman: Also, the last little tether binding her to Danny's dreams is that election, and when that gets snapped, finally... that frees her to walk out that door and have this other kind of release. And she's been spending so much time taking out her emotions on herself and inflicting mean words and behaviors on her body. It was kind of rewarding to see her do this thing. It was kind of embarrassing and unconventional, but it was a moment of pleasure and connection in her body and enjoying being looked at.

And in terms of like doing the actors, it was important to talk it through and make sure they knew that what we were suggesting was really about where their eyes were, and it was really about the connection and that the sexual part was really just more suggested than explicit. The performances are really brave and really great.

Laing: I think that speaks to everything about 'Physical.' Shooting it, behind the scenes and what you see on the screen is that everyone really created a safe space for all of it.

CNN: I wanted to ask you about those two characters because I don't get a lot of physical chemistry between them. They just seem like two repressed people who recognize themselves in each other. Can you talk about their dynamic a little bit and where is that going into this second season with that?

Weisman: I totally agree with that. I think they there's something that they recognize in each other. There's something familiar when they look at the other person, and it's over a big divide. They're, like, very different. They're both married to other people, they're politically different, their faiths are different. It shouldn't work. But I think they recognize trauma in each other, and they recognize a mutual like-mindedness about wanting power and wanting things because of that trauma. That's really like operating on a probably subconscious level, but I do think that's true that there's a certain pain that you can just kind of pick up [in] somebody else's eyes, and that's what they see in each other. So there is a connection. I don't think it's a very, anyone would call it a very healthy connection, but it is a connection. They're on a kind of collision course of each other, and that's going to continue through the second season.

CNN: Let's talk about Sheila's eating disorder. Speaking from experience, it's a long road to wanting to get better from something like this -- much less actually doing it. I don't get the sense that she wants to let go of it yet. Where is that going to take us in Season 2?

Weisman: That's right. I don't think she does. And the great thing about getting to explore it further in a second season is the inner voice is the dramatization of the eating disorder. It's almost like she's in an abusive relationship with it, and there are times when she almost gets away and it kind of pulls her back in. I think, like you just said and this is my experience too, there's this fear that without it you'll be really lost. [Weisman has : That's right. I don't think she does. And the great thing about getting to explore it further in a second season is the inner voice is the dramatization of the eating disorder. It's almost like she's in an abusive relationship with it, and there are times when she almost gets away and it kind of pulls her back in. I think, like you just said and this is my experience too, there's this fear that without it you'll be really lost. [Weisman has opened up about her own experience with an eating disorder in the past.] The lie that it tells you -- which I think is similar to an abusive relationship -- is, "Without me, you're going to lose all the things that make you you -- all the things that make anyone love you, all the things that make you good at anything. They're going to be gone without me." That's a very difficult message to get away from. The tough thing with any kind of recovery is really getting ready to feel your feelings instead of avoiding them. So she's further along than she was when we met her, but she still has a ways to go.

Laing: You can see it in her friendships, too, because that's part of it as well -- like her friendship with Greta (Dierdre Friel). There was a moment when she says, "I have a hard time making friends with women." She was saying so much in that moment.

CNN: I remember thinking that scene was a huge milestone for her. I also thought the kitchen scene in this episode with Danny was a huge moment. It was so deeply uncomfortable to see him talk about her eating disorder directly for the first time but with what seemed like no actual care or concern for her. When he shoved the cream puff into her mouth, I felt so bad for Sheila.

Laing: Again, it's just very honest. And you have Rose [Byrne] who is just so incredibly talented, and Rory [Scovel], who on the last take was fighting back tears. From his own character's point of view, he has no concept of what Sheila goes through at all. He's too hung up on himself. But even if he wasn't hung up on himself, he's just not recognizing it at all. He's in denial.

Weisman: And to his credit, she's not letting him in. The funny thing about the way the show works is that we get access to her thoughts but nobody else does. She's so good at hiding them. He can't react to things she doesn't let him in on. I think that's even more true in this [time] period where there wasn't as much language around and discussion on eating disorders. But it's even true now. People get really good at concealing it and hiding it. But if you're talking about the cream puff scene, Rory was just so nervous about doing that scene. He is as far away from this character as a person could be; he's just a wonderful actor. He was so worried that it was going to be crossing a line that you would never be able to come back from because it's really so aggressive. It's a kind of an assault, which was the idea of it.

Laing: He would walk around for days going, "Is today the cream puff day?" "Is it cream puff day?"

Weisman: For weeks he was hand wringing. Sweet Rory.

CNN: 'Assault' is a good word for it because, speaking from experience, when you have an eating disorder, what you eat, how you eat it and who sees you eat it are all such deeply personal things and triggering. When I was at my worst, what Danny did would have felt so violating.

Weisman: I'm sorry to hear that, and grateful that you bring it up because that was part of the thinking. You know, a lot of times, I think eating disorders and bulimia and binge eating can be such a punchline for so many people. Part of the goal for all of us -- the creative team and Stephanie and I talked about this a lot -- is to really take it seriously and really see the violence of it and the pain of it. That was a lot of the thinking behind that scene.

CNN: Lastly, launching a show at this time is so hard because there's a lot of great stuff out there, but you were renewed for a second season, so it means some people are watching it and loving it. Who have you found to be your audience on the show and does it at all inform your approach next?

Laing: A lot of women have reached out about the show, of course, but I have, surprisingly, had a lot of men reach out to me. So much so that two days ago, someone approached me and said, "I really think we should talk about men's eating disorders. We have this too. Why isn't this talked about?" Because we're being so honest and serious about it and taking it seriously, it is opening a conversation where it might have not been before.

Weisman: Same. I have to say, there's a lot of women who've reached out and talked to me, but I've been really surprised by the men and the kind of men who've reached out and who've responded and who talk about it. It's been really moving and interesting to hear from some dudes. I'm going to say some actual dudes -- some certified dudes -- who are intrigued by and interested in the show because I think it's turning over some assumptions and ideas that they had, and that's exciting. I feel like we just have to stay the course in terms of telling the truth and being honest and having the tone we have and letting people come to the show rather than going to them.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) In "Mr. Corman," it's Apple that gets a teacher, although it's a decidedly bittersweet one.

Three little words explain Apple TV+'s interest in "Mr. Corman," and those are Joseph Gordon-Levitt , who created, produces, writes, directs, stars and even performs music in this melancholy series, elevating a concept that looks at roads not taken and that's punctuated throughout by peculiar flights of fancy.

Gordon-Levitt's Josh Corman is introduced as a fifth-grade teacher, treading cautiously when dealing with his young charges. Over time, however, it becomes clear that he turned to teaching when aspirations to be a musician fizzled, and that he's pretty well sleepwalking his way through life.

The premise does not make, admittedly, for a particularly dynamic protagonist. The premiere finds Josh and his roommate/buddy Victor (Arturo Castro) deciding, after some debate, to go to a club, but his awkward encounter with a woman mainly highlights the "Those who can't do, teach" aspect of his existence, which is to say that Josh is lost and unhappy, despite his blandly pleasant demeanor.

There is, in fact, a lot of awkwardness along the way, including Josh's interactions with his mother (Debra Winger), and an ex-girlfriend (Juno Temple), who eventually comes into the story too.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) "The Green Knight" offers a reminder, if any were needed, why you don't see many movies adapted from 14th-century poems. Even those intrigued by tales of King Arthur and his knights might find this ambitious film as impenetrable as armor, although the lush imagery and epic tone provide some compensation for embarking on this weird, hallucinatory trip.

Writer-director David Lowery ("A Ghost Story") must be persuasive in a pitch meeting, since he sold someone on financing a project based on an anonymously written tale devoted to Sir Gawain ( Dev Patel ), Arthur's nephew, who embarks on a chivalric quest.

Introduced as a less-heralded member of the court, Gawain is surprised when Arthur (Sean Harris) asks that he join him at dinner, and further taken aback when the King requests a tale that will help to know him better.

"I have none to tell," Gawain responds, to which the Queen (Kate Dickie) adds portentously, "Yet."

An opportunity quickly presents itself, as Gawain bravely (and perhaps foolishly) steps forward to meet the challenge of a mysterious, giant figure known as the Green Knight, who has barged into Camelot. Confronting the creature with a mighty whack, he's told that he must journey to the Green Chapel in a year's time, when the knight has pledged to continue their "game" by returning the favor.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Is "Ted Lasso" a great show, or was it just the show we (or at least a lot of us) needed last summer during the pandemic? That's the question as the Apple TV+ series returns for its second season, fresh off a record haul of Emmy nominations for a first-year comedy, and with plenty of outspoken fans.

Starring Jason Sudeikis as the title character, a US football coach who is improbably hired to coach soccer in England, the show won praise as a breath of fresh air with its upbeat, can-do attitude, Ted's folksy charm and the eccentric players and personnel that fleshed out the team.

Frankly, the whole thing looked -- or at least sounded -- like a conventional fish-out-of-water concept, calculated to cash in on the cross-cultural currents and incorporate a helpful sports hook. (As Sports Illustrated detailed , Sudeikis actually introduced the character in NBC Sports promos back in 2013.)

But the program caught on, earning the kind of attention that has largely eluded Apple since it made its entry into the streaming game. Writer Sara Stewart described the show as a "mental health stealth bomb." Emmy voters concurred, with its 20 Emmy nominations besting "Glee's" first-year tally in 2010.

So in advance of the second-season premiere on July 23, CNN's Sandra Gonzalez and Brian Lowry weigh in on whether "Ted Lasso" justifies the hoopla, and whether the new 12-episode season (eight episodes of which were made available to press before the premiere was released to the public) meets the expectations raised by the first.

Brendan Hunt, Jason Sudeikis and Nick Mohammed in "Ted Lasso" season two, premiering Friday, July 23 on Apple TV+.

Lowry: I must confess, I mostly dismissed this show when it premiered because it looked so much like a conventional sitcom premise. But I think Mike Hale of the New York Times nailed it -- in an otherwise I must confess, I mostly dismissed this show when it premiered because it looked so much like a conventional sitcom premise. But I think Mike Hale of the New York Times nailed it -- in an otherwise not-very-positive review -- when he wrote, "What you wouldn't guess, and may be continually stunned by, is how determinedly cornball the show is. It's as if Sudeikis et al. foresaw the chaos and terror of the summer of 2020 and wanted to prove that America could do something right."

Gonzalez: "Ted Lasso" definitely benefitted from excellent timing. But we needed "Ted Lasso" long before the pandemic hit, and had it come out even a year before, it still would have been successful. Executive producer Bill Lawrence explained in "Ted Lasso" definitely benefitted from excellent timing. But we needed "Ted Lasso" long before the pandemic hit, and had it come out even a year before, it still would have been successful. Executive producer Bill Lawrence explained in an interview with The Wrap , "in social media, politics, public discourse right now, there's this weird combination in our country of ignorance and arrogance," and Ted, he said, was created to be "ignorance with curiosity."

Anyone familiar with Bill Lawrence humor (see: "Scrubs" and the highly underrated "Cougar Town") knows cornball with kindness is something of his brand. That he found in collaborators Jason Sudeikis, Brandon Hunt and Joe Kelly a way to elevate his own approach to material is not just good timing, that's how you make good TV ... take it from me, a person who's never made TV in my life.

Lowry: Without spoiling anything, do you have a favorite part of the new season? I thought introducing the sports psychologist was a nice touch, as was watching the arc involving Roy (Brett Goldstein).

Gonzalez: I loved that the writers took Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster) on an unexpected path to start the season. I howled when that reveal was made. And I'm with you on Roy. The character's comedic potential has soared this season as he tackles some new challenges. I apologize for the vagueness, but I hear too many spoilers make Apple, well, turn rotten.

A question for you, Lowry: Having seen part of Season 2 and given your so-so feelings on Season 1, how do you think the show's Emmy chances stack up, given it will be riding its sophomore season wave when voting takes place?

Lowry: I still think the show's basically pretty good (meaning a little overrated), but I can appreciate why people were attracted to it. Regarding the Emmys, handicapping those things is always dicey but I think it's the odds-on favorite. The show benefits from being heavily tilted toward comedy, as opposed to some of the I still think the show's basically pretty good (meaning a little overrated), but I can appreciate why people were attracted to it.

Hanks shared a video on Instagram in which he initially pretended to encourage followers to get vaccinated. He then screamed "Sike!" and shouted: "You ain't sticking me with that m*therf**king needle," before erroneously comparing Covid-19 to the flu.

"My wife lost her sense of taste and smell, she had severe nausea, she had a much higher fever than I did," Hanks told the Guardian last year, adding that he had "crippling body aches, I was very fatigued all the time and I couldn't concentrate on anything for more than about 12 minutes."

"There are, in fact, no actual grounds for suspending or removing Mr. Spears as the Conservator of the Estate" and "it is highly debatable whether a change in conservator at this time would be in Ms. Spears' best interests," the document, filed in response to a petition for Spears to be removed as conservator, states.

"Nevertheless, even as Mr. Spears is the unremitting target of unjustified attacks, he does not believe that a public battle with his daughter over his continuing service as her conservator would be in her best interests," the filing continues. "So even though he must contest this unjustified Petition for his removal, Mr. Spears intends to work with the Court and his daughter's new attorney to prepare for an orderly transition to a new conservator."

The move comes days after Judge Brenda Penny denied a petition filed by Britney Spears' attorney Mathew Rosengart to move a September 29 hearing about the case up to August 23 in an effort to remove her father as conservator as soon as possible.

"We are pleased that Mr. Spears and his lawyer have today conceded in a filing that he must be removed. It is vindication for Britney. We are disappointed, however, by their ongoing shameful and reprehensible attacks on Ms. Spears and others," Rosengart said in a statement to CNN. "We look forward to continuing our vigorous investigation into the conduct of Mr. Spears, and others, over the past 13 years, while he reaped millions of dollars from his daughter's estate, and I look forward to taking Mr. Spears's sworn deposition in the near future."

The couple may be in the midst of getting divorced , but the love train keeps a running with Kardashian West talking glowingly about the rapper/producer/entrepreneur.

Kardashian West appeared on a recent episode of Kristen Bell's "We Are Supported By" podcast and they discussed wanting to please people.

Kardashian West said she "used to care about the likeability" when it came to her being on her family's reality show, "Keeping Up With the Kardashians."

But she said that "maybe being in a relationship with Kanye for like a decade, someone who absolutely didn't care about likeability factor or what any perception of him was as long as he was true to himself" taught her differently.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Earnest to a fault, "Respect" spells out a handsome tribute to Aretha Franklin, with Jennifer Hudson and her peerless singing pipes as its formidable anchor. Yet this biography never fully sparks to life, as the Queen of Soul fights in episodic fashion to establish and later protect her musical legacy from the domineering men in her life.

Although Franklin's family spoke out against "Genius: Aretha," a National Geographic miniseries that garnered a well-deserved Emmy nomination for star Cynthia Erivo, the two projects actually complement each other. "Genius'" main advantage comes from the latitude to flesh out Franklin's painful youth, from being sexually victimized to losing her mother, while "Respect" -- even at nearly 2 ½ hours -- races through those moments, which still loom large in the story.

Cynthia Erivo in 'Genius: Aretha' (National Geographic/Richard DuCree)

The movie begins with the 10-year-old Aretha being pulled out of bed by her father, pastor C.L. Franklin (Forest Whitaker), to entertain at a party, singling her out as a prodigy. Yet that gift parallels with a life filled with hardship, which doesn't get any easier when the 20-ish Aretha lands a record contract, with her dad describing her as "a Black Judy Garland."

Crooning ballads, however, didn't capitalize on her talents, and before long dad's counsel was shunted aside by Aretha's relationship and marriage to Ted White (Marlon Wayans, effective in a dramatic turn), a slick hustler whose temper and jealousy go hand in hand with his conviction that he knows what's best for his wife's career.

It's around then that "Respect" earns its biggest dollops of it, presenting the recording sessions that birthed some of Franklin's signature hits. Not only do those sequences give Hudson an opportunity to shine, but they conjure an appreciation for Aretha's artistry as seen through the eyes of the musicians accompanying her, always a challenge with this sort of biographical tale.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Answer: This person not being selected to host "Jeopardy!" has caused a bit of outrage.

Who is LeVar Burton?

Burton fans are not happy that he didn't snag the gig to replace beloved longtime host Alex Trebek who died in November 2020 at the age of 80 after battling pancreatic cancer.

It was announced Wednesday that the show's executive producer Mike Richards will be hosting with "Big Bang Theory" star Mayim Bialik hosting occasional prime time episodes.

Social media exploded with "He was robbed!" and "They did him dirty!" type of comments.

For his part, Burton retweeted director Ava DuVernay who wrote "Me trying to create a show right in this moment for @levarburton to host and make an international hit."

On Thursday his pinned tweet was from August 5 and read "I have said many times over these past weeks that no matter the outcome, I've won."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Washington (CNN) A version of this story appeared in CNN's Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here .

Too often, the television and film industries offer meager portrayals of many groups of people and systematically leave others out.

And in its ninth annual Studio Responsibility Index report released last month, the media advocacy organization GLAAD noted that, despite an increase in the racial diversity of LGBTQ characters in 2020 wide release films, transgender and nonbinary characters were absent.

But what do television and film get right on the representation front?

Powered at least partly by streaming and the diverse backgrounds of the people behind the camera, television and film even just this year have provided meaningful portrayals of groups that have long been treated as afterthoughts. These depictions don't make up for otherwise lacking environments, but they do matter, and are worth attention.

So, as you prepare for Netflix's September release of the final season of Justin Simien's dramedy " Dear White People ," here are a few recent examples of rich on-screen representation:

'Never Have I Ever'

'Never Have I Ever' Season 2 (Netflix)

Last year, when Season 1 of Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher's "Never Have I Ever" debuted, my former CNN colleague Mitra Kalita pointed out the variety of ways that the series busts stereotypes of South Asian experiences

Season 2 continues on that stereotype-shattering path.

The show still follows the teenage Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), her mother Nalini (Poorna Jagannathan) and cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani). But the second season gives these characters even more dimension -- makes them messier, more human.

Some of Devi's plot points, for instance, include letting secrets slip, getting jealous and making up rumors. Put another way, as Devi navigates the pressures of her Indian American identity, she's sometimes a brat.

Giving its characters many layers is precisely what "Never Have I Ever" is about.

"When we talk about racism and stereotypes, it's not just the ability or the freedom to vote and to become doctors and have degrees and do successful things," Harleen Singh, a professor of South Asian literature and women's studies at Brandeis University, told NPR's Deepa Shivaram . "It's also to just be human beings who have errors, who have wants, who are contradictory. Pardon my French, but to f*** up as much as anybody else."

'Rutherford Falls'

'Rutherford Falls' (Peacock)

The premise of "Rutherford Falls" -- created by Ed Helms, Michael Schur and Sierra Teller Ornelas -- is simple. Nathan Rutherford (Helms) and Reagan Wells (Jana Schmieding) are lifelong best friends. But one day they find themselves at odds with each other when their made-up town wants to remove a statue that commemorates Nathan's ancestor.

The show is about loyalty -- not only between friends but also to one's heritage.

Reagan is Native American, a member of the (fictional) Minishonka Nation, and Nathan's mission to preserve the statue eventually puts him in conflict with one of the leaders of Reagan's tribe.

Through this tension -- mixed with comedic moments -- "Rutherford Falls" explores a range of issues that rarely get any screen time.

"What I saw in Hollywood for a very long time was that they were just willing to look at the Indigenous person as a metaphor or as a foil for something else where White characters would learn something from us or they would come to their own emotional realization due to our presence in the story," Michael Greyeyes, who plays the CEO of the Minishonka casino and is Plains Cree from the Muskeg Lake First Nation in Canada, told CNBC . "Or even worse, they would just extract from our cultures, from our stories, from our history and use it for whatever purposes that they needed."

In the same article, Schmieding expanded on what "Rutherford Falls" means for greater Native American representation on television.

"This is a really exciting time for us and there's room, there's room for it and there's an audience for it," the Lakota Sioux actor said. " 'Rutherford Falls' is like a nice little stepping stone into some even more nuanced, more engaging, exciting diverse Native and Indigenous content."

'Love, Victor'

'Love, Victor' Season 2 (Hulu)

While Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger's "Love, Victor" is inspired by and takes place in the same universe as the groundbreaking 2018 film "Love, Simon," it's no discount version of its predecessor.

For one thing, "Love, Simon" focuses on an affluent White teenager's struggle to come out to himself and his family. Meanwhile, "Love, Victor" explores these stresses through the experiences of the series' title character, who's Latino.

But the show stands out for another reason, too -- for how it complicates the coming-out narrative.

When characters come out in film or on television, they tend to be met by one of two responses: effusive support or complete rejection. In the second season of "Love, Victor," though, viewers are treated to something different, to something in the middle.

Victor Salazar (Michael Cimino) isn't disowned by his mother Isabel (Ana Ortiz) when he tells her that he's gay, but things between them change; Isabel doesn't know how to react to her son's homosexuality. Over the course of Season 2, the two work to return warmth and openness to a relationship that's grown awkward and distant.

(The new show from Amazon Prime, Josefina Trotta's " September Mornings ," also mines a queer dimension of the relationship between parent and child.)

It's a dynamic that a number of queer viewers can probably identify with.

'Pose'

'Pose' Season 3 (FX)

Created by Ryan Murphy, Steven Canals and Brad Falchuk, "Pose" was nothing short of a revelation when it debuted in 2018. With a beloved, critically acclaimed cast that includes Billy Porter as Pray Tell and Mj Rodriguez as Blanca Evangelista, the series charts New York City's underground ball scene in the 1980s and '90s.

Last month, Rodriguez made history when she became the first out transgender woman to be nominated in the Outstanding Lead Actress category for her role in "Pose." In fact, she became the first out transgender performer to earn a nomination in any lead acting category.

Part of what makes Season 3 of "Pose" notable is how movingly it pulls into focus the power of queer fellowship in the face of familial rejection.

In Episode 4, Pray Tell, who's been diagnosed with AIDS-related lymphoma, visits his Bible-thumping family in Pittsburgh. More than anything, the journey is a reckoning -- a way for Pray Tell to confront the world that's long tormented him.

"Sometimes I think I wouldn't even have this disease if it wasn't for the church and how y'all treated me," he says to his mother and aunts when they meet the news of his diagnosis with judgment.

In light of the pain that Pray Tell's Christian family inflicts on him, The Atlantic's Hannah Giorgis wrote in June that, in the third season of "Pose," "the purest moments of fellowship are those that occur in secular venues, among people who have been neglected by the families and institutions who should have been protecting them."

Indeed, like other recent pieces of television -- including Russell T. Davies' masterpiece " It's a Sin " -- "Pose" illuminates both the joy and the necessity of queer kinship.

'Judas and the Black Messiah'

'Judas and the Black Messiah' (Warner Bros.)

Shaka King's Oscar-nominated "Judas and the Black Messiah" offers a moving biographical portrait of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party who in 1969 established the first Rainbow Coalition.

Later that year, Chicago police killed Hampton in a predawn raid.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of the movie is the complexity it grants to its characters -- and by extension to Black history.

("Judas" was released by Warner Bros., which is a unit of CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia.)

When the Panthers appear in pop culture at all, they're usually depicted as championing violence. But "Judas" scotches that narrative. The movie shows the Panthers doing things like holding school lessons for kids and providing breakfast to poor Black families.

In giving its characters nuance and rigor, "Judas" reframes a vital piece of US history for a 21st-century audience.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Rock band Phish announced mid-tour a more stringent policy Thursday requiring ticketholders for their summer and fall tour dates provide proof of Covid-19 vaccination or a negative test, beginning with their shows at The Gorge in Washington later this month.

The foursome, known for their marathon jam sessions and longtime devoted festival followers, kicked off their summer tour in Rogers, Arkansas in July with a message to fans traveling: "The best thing you can possibly do before coming to a show is to GET VACCINATED!"

Taking the lyrics to their track "Down with Disease" to a new level, now they say without proof of vaccination, ticketholders going to multiple shows at the same venue will need to present one negative Covid-19 test taken within 48-hours of the concert, according to their verified Instagram page. Specific guidelines for Phish shows in Stateline, NV, Eugene, OR and Las Vegas will be forthcoming, the band said in their post.

The more stringent requirement comes at a time when the entertainment industry is showing signs of added and adapted protocols as the Delta variant is sparking concern across the country with case counts and hospitalizations on the rise.

Dead and Company -- the band whose moniker and musicians borrow from the Grateful Dead with additions including John Mayer -- announced this week they too will be requiring proof of Covid-19 vaccination or a negative test for concertgoers on select dates.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Editor's Note: TV OT is a weekly look at what CNN's entertainment team is watching since too much television has us all working overtime.

(CNN) If you need any further proof that things have changed for comic-book fans from the bad old days -- when Hollywood tended to vamp up and camp up those titles, if they deigned to produce them at all -- look no further than this week, which saw the streaming arrival of Marvel's "What If...?" and DC's "Titans" via Disney+ and HBO Max, respectively.

While the animated "What If...?" extends the Marvel brand into what feels like super-service for die-hard fans , "Titans" might be the more interesting test, since the live-action series has received a significant platform upgrade with its move from what was DC Universe to HBO Max, a much broader showcase. (DC and HBO are units of WarnerMedia, as is CNN.)

"Titans," notably, kicked off in 2018 with Robin (Brenton Thwaites) providing a rather colorful four-letter response when someone mentioned Batman, serving notice that this R-rated-ish series didn't intend to be confused with the "Biff! Wham! Pow!" TV "Batman" of the 1960s.

Still, just pushing boundaries in terms of content standards -- as DC has done with movies like "Joker" and more recently "The Suicide Squad," and Marvel tried with its gritty street-level dramas for Netflix, a la "Daredevil" and "The Punisher" -- isn't really the point; rather, it's about adapting comics in a way that accurately captures what people liked about them in the first place, and nobody who really enjoyed the Punisher wants to see him shoot rubber bullets.

That hasn't always been the case, but Marvel's success, especially, has paved the way for such distinctive efforts. The realm of streaming, moreover, has been an invitation to produce more particular fare that will appeal to subscribers by tapping into the passion of fans, which has at least as much to do with the business model as any mass numbers game.

Having watched the first half-dozen episodes of "Titans'" third season, the show seems plenty watchable -- and occasionally jarring in its surprises -- without feeling like a top-tier series. Part of that has to do with a storyline involving the villain Red Hood that inches along in advancing the plot, a byproduct of both operating on a TV-ish budget and needing to fill out a season-long order.

The soapy qualities, frankly, are also pretty familiar to anyone consuming the softer-edged version of DC fare on the CW. And while it's nice to see some of these characters get their moment, there are only so many people really longing to see Beast Boy, Starfire or Hawk and Dove translated into a live-action setting.

Ultimately, the conversation isn't so much about the latitude to present the equivalent of R-rated series -- which streaming more readily allows -- but simply telling stories the way that serves them best. As Nerdist's Eric Diaz wrote , with a show like "Titans" that creates the room to "produce something that reminds people of the source material."

Whether "Titans" and other DC Universe titles get additional wind beneath their wings in shifting to HBO Max remains to be seen, but for anyone who remembers gently bagging old comics in a plastic sleeve, the mere fact these shows exist is a beacon (or bat-signal) of just how far the medium has come.

TV rewind

Phil Keoghan (center) hosting an episode of CBS' 'The Amazing Race' in 2012.

CNN's Sandra Gonzalez takes a dip into the way-back machine:

"In December, my husband and I embarked on a journey around the world by starting the first season of 'Amazing Race.' I'd seen seasons here and there throughout the years, but we thought going back to the start would be fun. It has been.

NINETEEN seasons later, we just completed what I think was one of the best seasons so far (up there with the all-star installment that brought back a ton of favorites who had "unfinished business"). We skipped Season 8 because we could not get into the season that featured families and did not want to lose momentum on our binge with a lousy season that would be a slog to get through.

So here we are, done with Season 20, and no signs of stopping ahead.

Though we have slowed at times, we pretty reliably watched five episodes a week.

Watching the show during Covid has been a surreal experience. We started at a time when a lot of people couldn't even comprehend traveling overseas (and some still can't). So seeing the beauty of the world in what seemed like (and still does seem like) much simpler times can at times be a little heartbreaking, but it's hopeful.

Obviously, the show would be impossible -- not to mention irresponsible -- to produce right now. (Imagine the insurance policy!) But I do hope it returns one day. And I hope we return to that sense of normalcy again."

No reservations about 'Reservation Dogs'

Also, I'd echo Gonzalez's endorsement of "Reservation Dogs," with the disclaimer noted below (and perhaps a quibble about the title being a little too cute). She writes:

"Shout-out to my favorite show of the moment: 'Reservation Dogs.'

The FX series, which debuted this week, centers on a group of mischievous (and somewhat criminally inclined) Indigenous teens who live on a reservation in Oklahoma.

The cast is phenomenal -- down to the scene-stealing Mose (Lil Mike) and Mekko (Funny Bone) -- and the writing is exceptionally funny.

I refuse to let this show join the ranks of 'Lone Star' or 'Terriers' -- shows that have 'more good reviews than viewers,' as Lowry put it when we talked about the series.

I implore you to check it out. You'll thank me."

Quick bites: 'Heels' and 'Beckett'

A few of this week's premieres that didn't earn full reviews, but might be interesting to somebody:

A battle royale from the new Starz wrestling drama 'Heels.'

"Heels." As if we needed more wrestling on TV, "Heels" builds a Starz drama around small-town pro wrestling, deriving its title from those who play the bad guys (known as "heels") against the good guys ("faces") in the ring. The main draw is likely Stephen Amell -- after his As if we needed more wrestling on TV, "Heels" builds a Starz drama around small-town pro wrestling, deriving its title from those who play the bad guys (known as "heels") against the good guys ("faces") in the ring. The main draw is likely Stephen Amell -- after his lengthy run on "Arrow" -- as one of a pair of brothers who masterminds the struggling business, a married family man whose personal life contrasts with that of his free-wheeling brother ("Vikings'" Alexander Ludwig), which only contributes to the strained family dynamics.

The previewed episodes aren't badly done, but there's not much here to keep any part of you pinned to the couch. The show premieres Aug. 15.

John David Washington in the Netflix movie 'Beckett.'

"Beckett." Last seen on Netflix in " Last seen on Netflix in "Malcolm & Marie," John David Washington plays the unluckiest tourist who ever lived, seemingly, in this Netflix movie, which has a Hitchcockian quality and some good supporting players, but just strains credibility at too many turns. That begins with Washington's title character getting into a terrible car accident in Greece, not only losing his girlfriend, but in the process stumbling upon a nefarious plot that has armed people chasing him.

Can he trust anyone? Will he make it to the American embassy? Will he find help if he gets there? Will people watch all 110 minutes to find out?

Checking back into 'The White Lotus'

'The White Lotus' will return for a second season in a new locale.

HBO announced this week that its buzzy limited series "The White Lotus," which concludes Sunday, has been renewed for a second season.

The next installment will leave Hawaii as the show "follows a different group of vacationers as they jet to another White Lotus property and settle in temporarily amongst its inhabitants," according to HBO. We're counting on another cast of entitled, troubled characters from series creator Mike White.

CNN's Scottie Andrew looks at why we can't seem to get enough of watching rich and terrible people on TV , writing, "We detest the Roy family in 'Succession,' and yet we watch, rewatch and pick apart the series after each episode. We uncomfortably laugh at Jennifer Coolidge's deluded socialite has-been in 'The White Lotus,' fawn over the fashion worn by the bratty, uber-rich kids in 'Gossip Girl' and fear the wrath of girlboss Laura Dern in 'Big Little Lies.' Yet we still keep watching, often cringing our way through. Such series confirm our worst suspicions about the wealthiest among us -- but the characters' fictional riches and all the accompanying baggage makes for riveting television."

(CNN) Looking at the current television landscape, you might think it was 1997.

With the "Friends" reunion kicking things off in May and the upcoming wider release of "Rugrats," you may feel inspired to turn on some TLC, throw on a crop top and some Dr. Martens, and hop aboard the nostalgia train.

Netflix and other streaming services can definitely take you there.

Three things to watch

'Brand New Cherry Flavor'

Rosa Salazar stars as Lisa Nova in "Brand New Cherry Flavor."

Set in the early 1990s, "Brand New Cherry Flavor" will make you think of horror on acid.

The limited series feels like one long fever dream -- and I mean that in the best possible way. Granted, I'm into a good old-fashioned Hollywood revenge plot, but star Rosa Salazar brings a little something extra.

As aspiring filmmaker Lisa Nova, who seeks the dark side to get back at producer Lou Burke (played by Eric Lange), Salazar is mesmerizing.

"Brand New Cherry Flavor" starts streaming on Netflix on Friday the 13th, because of course it does.

'Respect'

Jennifer Hudson stars as the late Aretha Franklin in "Respect."

Jennifer Hudson was born to play Aretha Franklin.

The Queen of Soul knew that as well, which is why before her death in 2018 Franklin selected the Oscar winner to portray her as Hudson does in the new film "Respect."

"I don't think there can ever be enough preparation, especially when you are portraying someone you have always looked up to and admired," Hudson told me.

The film is in theaters Friday.

'FBoy Island' Season 1

There are some fun and some games on "FBoy Island."

I must write this one very carefully.

If you know what the title refers to, you may have already figured out that this is yet another dating show trying to find an angle that hasn't been done before. If you don't know what the title stands for, Google it when there are no kids around, please.

Comedian and actress Nikki Glaser serves as host as three women try and figure out which men on the island are "nice guys" and which are those who are just there for cash and, uh, pleasure.

The series wraps up the first season this week on HBO Max, which is owned by CNN's parent company.

Two things to listen to

(From left) Ashley Iaconetti and Ben Higgins attend the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Festival at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, September 22, 2017.

Oh, Bachelor Nation, I just can't seem to quit you.

Brandon Flowers of The Killers performs at the 2018 Bonnaroo Arts and Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, on June 10, 2018.

Get familiar with the town of Nephi, Utah.

That's where The Killers' new album, "Pressure Machine," is set.

It's "a concept record about life in Nephi told from the perspective of various townspeople that touches on everything from prescription drug abuse and poverty to crime, homophobia, and depression," according to Rolling Stone

But don't let that bum you out. The band's lead singer, Brandon Flowers, wants you to think about it in a literary sense.

"When I was writing these songs, I was thinking of things like Sherwood Anderson's book 'Winesburg, Ohio' or that book 'Pastures of Heaven' (by John Steinbeck)," he told Rolling Stone, "where's it's all these short stories that take place in this one setting. For some reason, I had the audacity to try it myself. Once I realized they were going to take place here and they were going to be true stories, everything just really fell in our laps."

"Pressure Machine" is out Friday.

One thing to talk about

(From left) Sydney Sweeney and Brittany O'Grady star in "The White Lotus" on HBO Max.

Who the hell needs to hop a plane for a vacation when you can check into "The White Lotus"?

This HBO Max series is the latest must-see TV and is grabbing hold of folks the way "Mare of Easttown" did a few moths ago (also an HBO Max series so bravo to our business siblings, since they, like CNN folks, are part of parent company WarnerMedia).

Billed as "a sharp social satire following the exploits of various employees and guests at an exclusive Hawaiian resort over the span of one highly transformative week," it's pretty addictive and the best kind of people-watching.

Because isn't it so much better to indulge in other people's dysfunction rather than your own?

That's true paradise.

​

Something to sip on

The Rolling Stones perform live at Adelaide Oval in Adelaide, Australia, October 25, 2014.

Not that you care, but I have tickets to go see The Rolling Stones when they play Atlanta in November.

That is, IF they play then.

The concert was already rescheduled from the original September 2020 date because of the pandemic. And now with the Delta variant, there is no telling if the show will actually go on.

Already events like New Orleans Jazz Fest (which the Stones were also scheduled to play) have canceled this year's festivities in light of rising Covid-19 cases.

I know that wasn't an easy decision, given how dependent New Orleans is on tourism, but I applaud any venue that is putting the priority on people over profit.

Besides, Mick Jagger and the fellas probably will tour for the next century so there is time.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The news that Britney Spears's father is willing to step down as the conservator of her estate was met with joy and cautious optimism on social media by the singer's supporters.

In a court filing obtained by CNN, Jamie Spears defended his actions as conservator, but said he is willing to help with an orderly transition to a new conservator following resolution of some outstanding matters in the case. He has legally overseen his daughter's life -- and an estate estimated at $60 million -- for the past 13 years.

Paris Hilton, who is a friend of Britney Spears, tweeted Thursday that she was "so happy to hear this news."

"It's been so long overdue but I'm so glad that Britney is on her way to finally being free," Hilton tweeted . "Sending so much love!"

Singer Cher also shared her thoughts.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The Rumors are true -- Lizzo and Cardi B have collaborated.

Lizzo dropped the video for her first new single in two years on Friday, which features her and pregnant rap superstar Cardi B.

The stars feature in a gold-plated music video.

The stars -- dripping in finery -- are both center stage in the gold-plated video, which takes its inspiration from ancient Greece.

Three-time Grammy award winner Lizzo teased the collaboration earlier this week, when she posted an Instagram video of herself delivering a wake-up call to Cardi -- with the caller ID signaling a collaboration.

The collaboration featured an appearance from a pregnant Cardi B.

The duo had already starred together in the 2019 movie Hustlers . Based on the true story first brought to the world in a 2015 New York Magazine article titled "The Hustlers at Scores," the film is about a group of strippers who decide to rip off their Wall Street clients.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) If you're the type who enjoys consuming an eight-episode limited series and thinking "What the heck did I just watch?" when it's over, "Brand New Cherry Flavor" might be for you. Otherwise, this bizarre Netflix drama will likely be an acquired taste, mashing up bad-old Hollywood with the supernatural, witchcraft and kittens, not always in that order.

Based on Todd Grimson's novel and set in the early 1990s, the series focuses on a young filmmaker named Lisa Nova ( "Alita: Battle Angel's" Rosa Salazar, easily the best thing about the show) who comes to town to try developing her short film into a movie. The horror-themed project has caught the eye of an aging producer, Lou Burke (Eric Lange), although as always in Hollywood, only a fool trusts the big talk thrown around at pitch meetings.

The two wind up at odds over Burke's false promises, but Lisa quickly encounters the mysterious Boro (Catherine Keener), who keeps telling her how special she is while promising her the opportunity to regain control over her creation -- and exact a measure of revenge.

What happens after that shouldn't be spoiled and probably couldn't be, but the weird detours include Lisa's absent mother, zombies, what really happened during the making of the short, and Lisa meeting a rising actor (Jeff Ward) who takes an interest in the film and her, but might have entered into a situation -- and indeed a hidden world -- that's clearly over his head.

For the first few episodes, the series -- adapted by Nick Antosca and Lenore Zion ("Channel Zero") -- effectively pulls the audience along, so strange and creepy it's hard not to be curious about who Lisa is, what's unique about her and where all of this might be heading.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Travis Barker has flown on a plane for the first time since he survived a deadly plane crash 13 years ago, TMZ reports.

According to the online outlet, the Blink-182 drummer took a flight to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, from Los Angeles with his girlfriend, Kourtney Kardashian, on Saturday.

Photographs obtained by TMZ appear to show Barker disembarking Kylie Jenner's private jet in Cabo.

The 45-year-old star has not traveled by air since 2008 when his business jet to Van Nuys, California, crashed in South Carolina, killing his security guard, Charles Still, and assistant, Chris Baker, as well as the two pilots.

The crash in West Columbia, South Carolina, on September 19, 2008, killed four.

Barker was critically injured, with third-degree burns on 65% of his body, he told the Guardian in 2015.

Depp, who also served as one of the producers of the film, portrays real-life photographer W. Eugene Smith, whose work with Life magazine documented the mercury poisoning of Japanese villagers in the early 1970s.

The star reflected on his life recently -- he filed suit after The Sun called him a "wife-beater" in an article over his now ex-wife Amber Heard's claims of abuse that he has denied -- juxtaposed to both the Japanese villagers who had been poisoned and those who have suffered from Covid-19.

"That's like getting scratched by a kitten," Depp said of what he's been through. "Comparatively."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) There's a scene in the very first episode of HBO's critically acclaimed prestige drama, "Succession," that is about as viscerally unsettling to watch as a Jigsaw death trap in a "Saw" film.

The pilot sees the media magnate Roy family -- an amalgam of the Murdochs, the Hearsts and other dynasties -- decide to play an impromptu game of softball. A boy and his family watch nearby, and when youngest son Roman Roy notices them, he brokers a deal with the boy: If the kid can score a run, Roman will pay him $1 million. It's chump change for Roman -- he's got the nasty swagger of someone fully aware of their privilege and willing to wield it like a weapon -- but the funds could radically change the boy's family's life.

The boy swings and sends the ball soaring. He darts around the bases and almost -- almost -- slides into $1 million when Roman's soon-to-be brother-in-law tags him out with disturbing zeal.

"That is so sad," Roman tells the kid, keeling over in laughter. The Roys leave the field and return to their Manhattan empire. The boy is left embarrassed.

It's perhaps the hardest-to-watch scene in a series whose de facto protagonist kills someone in a car accident (and is still, somehow, a hero).

We detest the Roy family in "Succession," and yet we watch, rewatch and pick apart the series after each episode. We uncomfortably laugh at Jennifer Coolidge's deluded socialite has-been in "The White Lotus," fawn over the fashion worn by the bratty, uber-rich kids in "Gossip Girl" and fear the wrath of girlboss Laura Dern in "Big Little Lies." Yet we still keep watching, often cringing our way through. Such series confirm our worst suspicions about the wealthiest among us -- but the characters' fictional riches and all the accompanying baggage makes for riveting television. (HBO and HBO Max -- home to shows such as "Succession" and "The White Lotus" -- share parent company WarnerMedia with CNN.)

The Roy clan of "Succession" have exorbitant wealth -- success that has come by stabbing each other in the back for decades.

As much as as we're subjected to these characters' terrible behavior, we're also treated to visual feasts of mega-yachts meandering through the Mediterranean and a curious whale splashing its tail under a Maui sunrise . We're meant to dislike the carelessness and cruelty on display, while also enjoying the luxuries these fictional characters' money can buy.

It is the American dream, after all, to ascend to a higher socioeconomic status than that which you were born into. But what the best shows about the rich get right is letting them eat cake, then squashing it.

Drawing viewers into the uber-rich lifestyle

"The White Lotus," which quickly became this summer's must-see TV , is a spiky satire that mocks whiteness, imperialism and one-percenter ennui by centering on people with more than enough money -- and a tragic nearsightedness that stops them from doing anything meaningful with it. It's at once heartbreaking, entertaining and infuriating.

Take, for example, Coolidge's haunted alcoholic Tanya. There are more despicable characters than hers -- one Ivy League trust fund kid hellbent on revenge is particularly unlikable -- but Tanya is almost more dangerous because she's oblivious to her own selfishness. More than once, she floats the idea of funding a wellness center run by beleaguered spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), but just as quickly abandons the idea to compliment a wealthy family or complain about a vacation fling. She speaks as though she's sleepwalking through her privileged life, blissfully unaware of the people she steamrolls as she moves.

Despite focusing on the uber wealthy, both "White Lotus" and "Succession" bring viewers in via outsider characters who don't fully fit that category: In "Succession," viewers are brought into the Roys' world by also experiencing the journeys of affable Cousin Greg and his power-tripping, beta-male boss, Tom Wambsgans. In "The White Lotus," those tuning in also see events through the eyes of struggling journalist Rachel, icy frenemy Paula and overworked spa manager Belinda. The average viewer can relate to these characters, while witnessing the actions of larger-than-life figures at the center of the story.

That said, the insidious nature of wealth is more subtle in "The White Lotus" -- if not more familiar to audiences. Chances are, many of us have encountered a pompous collar-popper like Jake Lacy's Shane or an oblivious White man who bumbles through a defense of his privilege like Steve Zahn's Mark. These are people who are high-powered in their own spheres, whose familial strife may not move markets but can still devastate bystanders. In that way, they're almost more detestable than the Roy family of "Succession" -- fans may have experienced the type of pain the characters of "The White Lotus" have wrought firsthand.

White said as much about "Succession" in an interview with the New Yorker

"It's a great show, but it's very king's court. You can kind of otherize them. They're billionaires," he said. "With 'White Lotus,' I wanted it to be more, like, this is your next-door-neighbor rich person who is part of the system."

Little by little, the outsider characters find themselves engaging further with the wealth and status of their associates, drawing viewers in just the same.

It's very American to be fascinated by the wealthy

But as time went on, wealthier families also came into focus: "The Jeffersons" focused on a Black family enjoying a newly prosperous life. The soap opera "Dynasty" followed the dramas of an oil magnate's extended family. "Beverly Hills 90210" featured rich, clueless teens who, despite their status, suffered just like the rest of us. Those series weren't always critically acclaimed, but they were widely watched.

Many of those series are routinely acclaimed by critics and dissected on HBO has become the primary purveyor of critically acclaimed dramas and satires about one-percenters and the harm they dole out (see also: "Big Little Lies," its soapy sibling "The Undoing" and the Gen Z revival of "Gossip Girl," among many others).Many of those series are routinely acclaimed by critics and dissected on podcasts web series and in articles like this one. But their success is reliant most of all on an audience curious about the lives of the 1%.

The characters of HBO Max's "Gossip Girl" reboot are no less status-obsessed than the stars of the original.

The American fascination with wealth is natural, given the importance our culture places on upward mobility and achievement, said June Deery, a professor and department head of communication and media at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

"The great mythology of the American Dream encourages people to think they can aspire to be wealthy in their lifetime, so they may think they are viewing a future projection of their own situation," Deery told CNN in an email.

Deery has written at length about reality TV and "wealth voyeurism," particularly through the lens of Bravo's "Real Housewives" franchise. The women on the series are particularly compelling because, in most cases, the women are members of the "nouveau riche," or "new money," Deery writes. They weren't necessarily born into wealth and status like the fictional Roy family, so their way of expressing their wealth and status is often overstated, evidenced by name-dropping famous acquaintances and adorning themselves in designer emblems

Our reactions to such series depends a lot on our own socioeconomic status, Deery said, but our impressions typically fall between admiration, disdain or a blend of both. We may, for example, laugh at how ridiculous it is that Upper East Sider Ramona Singer scoffs at any event that takes her below 59th Street or her insistence on wearing heels to the airport -- but we still envy her for her mansion in the Hamptons and a comfortable financial status that allows her to spend much of the pandemic in luxurious South Florida

"It is easier to satirize and laugh at the vulgarity and extroversion of the nouveau riche than at the restraint of old money perhaps," Deery told CNN. "It certainly seems like the Real Housewives are often set up to be mocked. Yet some viewers still write online about admiring them, envying them, almost worshipping them."

That's the American Dream at work, Deery said.

We're attracted and disgusted in equal measure

Television reflects and reinforces the importance of wealth, said Jim Burroughs, a professor who leads a master's program in global commerce at the University of Virginia and studies materialism.

"People would be materialistic without TV," he said -- noting that France's extravagant Palace of Versailles predates TV and film. But watching so much content about the lives of the rich influences the value we place on material things and personal wealth, he said.

The women of "Big Little Lies" live in beachfront mansions but carry heavy emotional baggage.

"We might initially be attracted to television because of the affluence it depicts, but then viewing this most definitely reinforces the strengths of holding these beliefs," he said. "So it's a reinforcement cycle -- we watch television because we like to see the wealth, which makes us more materialistic, which makes television more attractive," and so the cycle goes.

It's less clear, he said, why we're equally repulsed by and drawn to these characters, though he speculates it has something to do with social comparison: We compare our own actions to those around us, for better or for worse, and adjust our behaviors accordingly. We may be disgusted by the behavior of the wealthy people we watch while subconsciously coveting all that they have, he said.

"I don't believe these feelings are mutually exclusive," Burroughs said. "I think you can admire what someone has, but also be jealous of what they have as a result of these implicit comparisons to yourself. So when you see the 'real housewife' who drives a Bentley you can simultaneously admire her and resent her" -- and maybe, he said, cheer when she falls.

The shows aren't relatable -- and that may be for the best

Even when they feature "outsider" characters, series about the uber-rich are not meant to be relatable. For one, they almost always focus on White people. ( Vanity Fair's Delia Cai wrote earlier this week that "all-white casts and storylines can be considered tacky, unless it's all in service to making fun of white privilege. Then it's not only okay -- it can be extremely funny.") The shows often sideline people like service workers, house staff and the other dozens or hundreds of people in the wealthy protagonists' orbit who keep their businesses afloat -- but if the characters don't bother to learn their staff's names, the audience won't either.

The lives we see on TV -- in fiction and reality series -- are heightened for entertainment purposes, Burroughs noted. Shows are edited to "portray an extremely slanted view of reality," he said, be it through the constant jetsetting of the "Real Housewives" or the prevalence of weeknight parties and underage martini drinking in "Gossip Girl." These heightened elements can distort our view of what affluence really is, he said.

And even when series are clearly poking fun at their characters, it's possible that audiences can miss the point of even the strongest satire. Lines blur, and the voyeurs are enthralled suddenly by the lifestyle rather than the consequences of living that way, Burroughs said.

Perhaps the best argument against celebrating the lifestyle of the TV elite lies in Tanya on "The White Lotus," whose bizarre behavior suggests that she's the main character in a series in her mind. She doesn't dwell very long on the lives of others. She's mostly removed from the action, living in her own bubble of sadness. It's hard to envy anything about Tanya's disastrous personal life and profound loneliness, even if it does land her at a luxury resort. She epitomizes one of the series' main takeaways: Having it all -- even vacationing in Hawaii -- won't save you from your own misery.
