@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Lionel Messi tells CNN that Paris Saint-Germain is the "ideal" place for him to win the UEFA Champions League once again.

The Argentine superstar signed a two-year contract at the French club on Tuesday, ending his 19-year spell at Barcelona

Speaking to CNN Sport's Amanda Davies , Messi stressed that both his and his new club's ambitions are aligned -- to win the trophy that has so far eluded PSG and which Messi himself has won four times.

"I am aware of my background and the objective this club has -- fighting for a while to win a Champions League, and it was close the last few years," he told CNN.

"For me on a personal level, I would love to win another Champions, like I've said in previous years, and I think I've come to the ideal place that's ready for that. We have the same goals. It's got impressive players, one of the best squads in the world and, hopefully, we can achieve that goal which Paris wants so much, I want so much and hopefully we can enjoy it with the people of Paris too."

Just a few days earlier, Messi was in tears during an emotional farewell press conference at Barcelona, the club at which he came through in European football and flourished.

During his time with the Catalan giants, Messi won ten Spanish league titles, as well as six Ballon d'Or honors.

Although he admitted in his press conference that his departure from Barcelona was "very hard," he also said that he was "very happy" at his new club and looking forward to the future.

"The truth is, it's hard to put into words what I've had to live through this week," Messi told Amanda Davies.

"It was really difficult what happened with Barcelona -- saying farewell after being there my whole life in one place. And after three days -- without forgetting what happened -- everything changed. I was living with a lot of doubt, a lot of nerves, a lot of anticipation that this would happen and well ... a lot of excitement and desire to get started.

"It was a really special arrival, the welcome from the people who welcomed me, who came out onto the streets. I'm very excited to start this new era that I'm going to live and I'm ready to start my new life here in Paris."

Messi cries during his farewell press conference at the Camp Nou on August 8.

Upon leaving Barcelona, Messi admitted that his friends at PSG -- including his former Barça teammate Neymar and fellow Argentinians Ángel Di María and Leandro Paredes -- ultimately helped his decision to come to the "City of Lights."

Messi's arrival in Paris forms a frightening front three alongside Neymar and French superstar Kylian Mbappé. And the prospect of lining up alongside those two fellow superstars excites the 34-year-old.

"It's crazy to be able to share day-to-day life with them, with all the squad, there are some amazing transfers (that have happened this summer), and I really want to train and compete now because I'm going to be playing with the best players," added Messi.

However, there have been rumors linking 22-year-old Mbappé with a move away from the Parc des Princes, although PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi hopes Messi's arrival will convince him to stay.

"I think everybody knows the future of Kylian, he wants to win, he wants to win trophies," said Al-Khelaifi.

"He said it in public, he wants to have a competitive team and we have the most competitive in the world. There is no excuse for him now -- he can't do anything else but stay."

Within the rules

With so many high-profile, expensive players in the PSG squad, the question of how the club can afford another superstar player and still remain within UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations was put to Al-Khelaifi.

However, when asked by a journalist how the club could afford to sign Messi, Al-Khelaifi said the club would not promise something they couldn't do within the rules.

He explained the club would remain in the regulations "from day one until the end."

Khelaifi said the deal would be of benefit not just for PSG but for the city of Paris as well as the French league from a sporting and commercial perspective, among others.

"I hope Leo will not ask for a greater salary," Al-Khelaifi joked.

Al-Khelaifi told CNN that it has been "heaven already" since Messi agreed to sign with PSG, pointing to the impact his arrival has already had on the club, without even having made an appearance.

"I mean, I'm not going to tell you even the numbers the sponsors offer us today. It's something unbelievable," he told CNN Sport.

"If you also see our social media, we used to have 35 million and now we have 42 million. In even less than three days. It's amazing. I know the last two years were a crisis with Covid-19, but I believe in one thing: each crisis is an opportunity.

"And we signed four players for free and the value of those four players plus (Achraf) Hakimi increased the assets of the club to almost $3 billion. It's fantastic. People don't recognize this, they don't know that but I think they should know, those who question our financial capacity."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Lionel Messi has officially signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain, bringing his long-term association with FC Barcelona to an end.

The French giants said in a statement that the Argentine superstar is signing a two-year deal "with an option of a third year."

"I am excited to begin a new chapter of my career at Paris Saint-Germain. Everything about the club matches my football ambitions," Messi said in the statement. "I know how talented the squad and the coaching staff are here. I am determined to help build something special for the club and the fans, and I am looking forward to stepping out onto the pitch at the Parc des Princes."

Paris Saint-Germain announced the signing of Leo Messi on a two-year deal with the option for a third on Tuesday.

Messi arrived in Paris earlier on Tuesday and the club teased his arrival on their social media channels with a short clip which briefly shows his Argentina shirt and the six Ballon d'Or trophies Messi has won throughout his career.

Neymar -- who played with Messi at Barça and now stars for PSG -- wrote on Instagram in a story: "Back Together."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Neeraj Chopra's historic gold medal in the men's javelin event in Tokyo on Saturday brought the nation's Olympics performance to a spectacular close.

The 22-year-old athlete's gold medal -- the nation's first in a track and field event since it gained independence from Britain -- consolidated India's greatest ever performance at the Games, winning a total of seven medals.

And when Chopra arrived in India's capital New Delhi Monday afternoon, a mob thronged to the airport to catch a glimpse of their new national hero. Videos of huge crowds surrounding the athlete have come to symbolize what his victory means for the world's second most-populous nation.

Speaking at a news conference Saturday, the Chief Minister of the northern state of Haryana, where Chopra is from, told reporters proudly: "The Haryana boy has left his mark."

India's historic medal haul comes as the nation is still reeling from the aftermath of a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The country has witnessed more than 428,000 Covid-19 deaths and almost 32 million infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, which pushed hospitals to the brink of collapse and overwhelmed the country's healthcare system.

Set against this backdrop, Indian athletes have managed to ignite a fresh sense of national pride among a still mourning nation.

India defeated Germany to win bronze in men's field hockey -- its first medal in that sport in 41 years. The women's team came extremely close, losing to Britain in the bronze medal match, but earned praise and respect from millions across the country. The nation won either silver or bronze medals in five other events.

India's success has also placed a spotlight on the country's comparatively poor sporting infrastructure and the numerous disadvantages faced by Indian athletes, including the fact that many are not full time sportspeople.

Young athletes in New Delhi are glued to the television as wrestler Ravi Kumar Dahiya takes home the bronze medal in his in weight category in Tokyo.

Traditionally seen as a one-sport country because of its cricketing success, India experienced a "small turning point" in 2008, according to Nalin Mehta, co-author of "Dreams of a Billion: India and the Olympic Games," after air rifle shooter, Abhinav Bindra, won the nation's first gold medal at the Beijing Olympics.

"There was serious intent at a government level to put more money into sports," he said. "There was a sense that this could be a winner. A new sense of nationalism that would elevate India globally."

The government stepped up efforts to elevate the country's sporting profile on the international stage. Four years later in London, the country took home six medals -- its second most successful Olympic medal tally.

In 2016, the nation's unsatisfactory performance at the Rio Olympics -- one silver and one bronze medal -- prompted authorities to further boost funding.

Two years later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nationwide program 'Khelo India' or 'Let's Play India' to "revive the sports culture in India" with the aim of identifying and funding promising young talent.

By 2019, the government was spending $297.7 million on sports, up by nearly $90.7 million from 2016, according to annual reports from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. India's Department of Sports now also recognizes 61 National Sports Federations, up from 48 in 2017. New additions include basketball, netball and equestrianism.

Mehta also points to the proliferation of non-profit establishments including the Olympics Gold Quest, which was co-founded by billiards player Geet Sethi after he sensed "a general feeling of dejection" among Indian athletes. It has helped top athletes including boxer Mary Kom and badminton player P.V. Sindhu achieve Olympic success.

Many hope that this year's Olympic performance will usher in a new era in Indian sport -- one where its athletes are given a platform to excel and grow.

Bandana Chhetri, partner at FairPlay sports, which manages top Indian athletes, believes that Chopra's win will become a "watershed moment" in sports in India.

"I hope that a lot of young children are inspired," she said. "I want Indian sport to grow even more rapidly than it has been for last few years. The sustained efforts of everyone involved -- the Sports Ministry, the private funders, the coaches and more -- will be the only way to see India break even more records on the global stage."

Mehta said that he had never seen anything like this year's Games "in his entire lifetime."

"I've never seen Indians show such enthusiasm and celebration for our Olympic athletes. After a tough year, it's a huge emotional lifter," he said.

On Sunday, Modi took to Twitter to congratulate the athletes, adding that the medals have made the nation "proud and elated."

He emphasized that he would work harder to elevate sport in the country.

"This is the time to keep working to further popularize sports at the grassroots, so that new talent emerges and gets the opportunity to represent India in the times to come," he wrote.

In New Delhi on Monday night, Chopra walked onto a large stage for the Indian Olympic Champions' Felicitation Ceremony.

"This gold medal is not only mine," he said. "It belongs to India."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Former New Zealand Olympic cyclist Olivia Podmore has died, the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) confirmed in a statement.

"We offer our deepest condolences to family, friends and others in the NZ community who are grieving this loss," the NZOC said

"We are providing wellbeing support for members of her team and the wider team as we return home from Tokyo."

She represented New Zealand at Rio 2016 and the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in cycling track events, including the team sprint, the keirin and the individual sprint.

Podmore competes in the women's team sprint qualifying at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.

She did not represent New Zealand at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

In 2017, Podmore was the national New Zealand keirin champion.

The statement also outlined methods via which athletes or other New Zealand team members can access support from the New Zealand Olympic Team psychology team, the Health team or via sport/NSO psychology and health providers, as well as counseling in the country.

A New Zealand Police spokesperson told CNN: "Police attended a sudden death at a Cambridge property yesterday evening.

"Police are making enquiries in relation to the death on behalf of the Coroner. The Coroner will release their findings in due course."

Podmore's brother, Mitchell, posted on social media: "Rest in peace to my gorgeous sister and loved daughter of Phil Podmore. You will be in our hearts forever.''

Cycling New Zealand called Podmore a "much loved and respected rider in our Cycling New Zealand Squad."

Podmore looks on after competing in the women's elite team sprint qualifying during the New Zealand Oceania Track Championships.

"We at Cycling New Zealand are deeply saddened with the sudden loss of our young cyclist Olivia Podmore. Olivia was a much loved and respected rider in our Cycling New Zealand squad and the wider cycling community," it said

"Many people are understandably devastated and trying so hard to comprehend what has happened. We have been and will continue to provide support to our staff and riders, the cycling community and those that were close to Olivia."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has now had Covid-19 twice, but when asked by reporters Monday whether the Ravens have spoken to him about getting vaccinated, he was noncommittal on vaccines.

"I just got off the Covid list, so I've got to talk to my team about this and try to see how they feel about it," he said. "I'm going to keep grinding as much as I can about it, and go from there."

He was asked again if he would get vaccinated.

"We'll see. Talking to the doctors. We'll see," he said. He later added he felt getting the vaccine was a personal decision.

"I'm just going to worry about that with my family, keep my feelings to my family and myself. I'm focused on getting better right now. I can't dwell on that right now on how everybody else feels -- just trying to get back into a great routine," he said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Perched beside the river Seine, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, Paris' Trocadéro gardens are no stranger to crowds.

Usually a favorite for tourists, while the Tokyo Olympic Games were in full swing, the gardens attracted new visitors: sports fans. Every day, Parisians and tourists alike gathered there to watch their compatriots compete on a giant screen.

The pinnacle of the party came on August 8, when Anne Hidalgo, mayor of the French capital, received the Olympic flag during the closing ceremony in Tokyo, as Paris readied itself to host the next games in 2024.

The "City of Lights" went all in to celebrate the moment: French astronaut Thomas Pesquet played Le Marseilles, the French national anthem, with his saxophone in the International Space Station and France's elite Patrouille de France air display team flew over the Trocadéro gardens, making the French flag with their smoke trails.

"This ceremony will be a foretaste of Paris 2024," said Tony Estanguet, president of the 2024 Paris Olympics organizing committee. "It's the DNA of Paris 2024 that will be expressed."

For its third Summer Olympics, exactly 100 years after it last hosted the sporting spectacle, the French capital has ambitious plans.

Preparations for the 2024 Games are well underway and despite the pandemic's challenges, there are no major construction delays, according to Estanguet.

Three years out, the Paris team is keeping their hopes that the pandemic, which severely impacted the Tokyo Olympics, will be behind them in 2024.

"Of course, we are learning a lot as we have done here in Tokyo about adapting to the challenges of a pandemic," said Agathe Renoux, spokesperson for Paris 2024. "We are ready to adapt and we are keeping our focus on our exciting Games."

Mathieu Hanotin, mayor of the Parisian suburb of Saint Denis that will host the centerpiece of Olympics infrastructure -- the athletes' village -- shared in the optimism.

Hanotin told CNN that with spectators banned from this year's Games due to Covid-19, the "celebration was inevitably hidden," but by 2024, "we will be able to breathe."

"What's certain is that we will do a lot of work to bring back the experience," added Hanotin.

Les Invalides will host archery at Paris 2024.

The Green Games

For the French capital, Estanguet says the Games' two key themes are "green" and "participation" -- Paris 2024 will be the first Olympics to be aligned with the climate agreement signed in the city in 2015.

The Paris 2024 organizing committee has promised a 55% decrease of its carbon footprint compared to the 3.5-million-ton average set by previous Olympics.

The first step towards achieving this goal is by cutting down construction -- 75% of Paris 2024's facilities pre-date the Games and 20% will be temporary. That means only 5% of facilities -- the Olympic Village and the Olympic Aquatics Center -- will be permanent new buildings, 10 times less than previous Games.

"If there is no need, we won't build it," said Estanguet. "We will do with a temporary one."

Champs de Mars will host volleyball.

Following in London 2012's footsteps, beach volleyball will take place in a temporary stadium built in the city center, on the famous Champs de Mars, with the Eiffel Tower as the backdrop.

Roughly one kilometer to the east, the vast lawn in front of Les Invalides will host the archery and the Palace of Versailles' sumptuous gardens will welcome the equestrian events.

Plans for the opening ceremony -- unusually set to take place in the center of Paris -- remain under wraps but organizer Estanguet underlined the desire to "connect the population" with the Games.

The Games' 'beating heart'

For 2024, Paris decided to set its Olympic Village, athletics arena and new aquatics center in Saint Denis -- a suburb to the city's immediate north -- a district where the Stade de France was built to host the 1998 World Cup.

Saint Denis has had its fair share of economic and social problems. The intention is for the area to become "the beating heart of the Olympic Games" and regain its pride, said Hanotin.

With around one billion euros ($1.18 billion) of Olympics-related investment planned there, the Games hold the promise of much-needed infrastructure development across Paris, including new metro and road links.

Moreover, it also gives the people of Saint Denis a hard deadline for when they must be finished: 2024.

"It will allow us to accomplish, in several years, what will usually take 15 or 20 years to finish," Hanotin said.

The French Air Force's aerobatic team -- 'Patrouille de France' -- flies over the fan village of The Trocadero set in front of The Eiffel Tower on August 8, 2021.

An Olympic cost?

Nevertheless, the construction sprint has sparked local concerns that projects are underway without sufficient public consideration or consultation.

A new interchange on the A86, Paris' outer ring road, will bring up to 20,000 cars of traffic through the center of the community of Le Pleyel (population 13,000) according to official estimates and through a major school district.

Some locals are concerned about the long-term effects this increased air and noise pollution might have on children in the area -- and they're not alone.

The government's own environmental assessment, published in 2019, stated that the plan will increase pollution "particularly around the Pleyel intersection" where the schools are located and "could significantly affect the local population."

The presentation for Paris 2024 is seen during the Closing Ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo.

But locals say the state hasn't acted on that.

To date, more than 13,000 people have signed an online petition to modify the project. Activist groups have also filed an administrative lawsuit against the project, which was delivered to the Council of State -- the country's highest administrative court -- at the end of 2020 and is currently awaiting a decision.

"What was promised is environmental excellency in what's used to build the Olympic Village" said Gintrac. "But for us, the environment is where we live, the air we breathe and the noise we hear."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) America's most popular fashion doll Barbie has received widespread criticism on social media for not featuring an Asian Barbie in their collection dedicated to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

Mattel, the toy company that manufactures Barbie dolls, collaborated with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Tokyo 2020 organizers to release a new line of dolls in February 2020 specially designed for the Games.

The collection includes five dolls that reflect the five new sports that had been added to the Olympic program this year -- baseball/softball, sport climbing , karate, skateboarding and surfing.

Mattel did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, but in a statement reported by NBC, the company said that "our intention to represent the Asian community with the Skateboarder doll fell short and we fully receive and recognize the feedback."

"Moving forward, we will work to find more ways to champion all representation and celebrate the amazing achievements of all Olympic athletes, who are showing us that anything is possible," added a Mattel spokesperson.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The final medals are being awarded in the closing ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics, wrapping two weeks of competition overshadowed by Covid-19.

Team USA won more gold medals -- and more medals overall -- than any other country in the Games.

A total of 626 athletes competed for the USA at the Tokyo 2020 games, clinching 39 gold, 41 silver and 33 bronze medals for a grand total of 113 medals in 28 different sports. Overall, 257 members of Team USA won a medal, including 164 women and 93 men.

China and Japan, the host-country, were closest to matching the American gold-medal haul, winning 38 and 27 medals, respectively. The battle for most gold medals came down to the final day of competition, as Team USA's wins in women's volleyball and women's basketball pushed the country to the top of the chart.

Team USA's Skylar Diggins (L) puts a gold medal on teammate Sue Bird during the medal ceremony for the women's basketball competition of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games on August 8.

In the total medal count, China finished in second with 88 medals, followed by the Russian Olympic Committee with 71 medals.

Abbie Parr/Getty Images Fireworks explode over Tokyo's National Stadium at the end of the Olympics' closing ceremony on Sunday, August 8. The word "arigato," seen at left, means thank you in Japanese.

The Tokyo Olympics arrived a year later than expected, and very few fans could attend because of the ongoing pandemic.

But these Games still produced amazing performances and some unforgettable moments.

American swimmer Caeleb Dressel won the most gold medals in Tokyo (five), and Australian swimmer Emma McKeon won the most medals in all (seven). Only one other woman in history, Soviet gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya, has won seven medals at a single Olympics.

Simone Biles and her struggles with "the twisties" dominated the headlines in gymnastics, but she bounced back to win a bronze on the balance beam. And when she couldn't defend her individual all-around title, teammate Suni Lee stepped up and became the fifth straight American to win the event.

In track and field, Jamaican sprinter Elaine Thompson-Herah became the first-ever woman to win the 100 and 200 meters at consecutive Olympics. World records were shattered in the men's and women's 400-meter hurdles. And the United States' Allyson Felix became the most decorated woman — and the most decorated American — in Olympic track-and-field history.

Four sports made their Olympic debut this year: karate, skateboarding, surfing and sport climbing. And transgender athletes Laurel Hubbard and Quinn broke down barriers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tokyo (CNN) When history looks back on this year's Tokyo Olympics , images of masked athletes and empty stadiums will likely be the defining feature. But look beyond the Covid-19 protocols and it will be clear this was a Games with more than one story to tell.

Much will be made of the moment Simone Biles stepped away from gymnastic competitions and spoke openly and emotionally about the need to protect athletes' mental health.

"At the end of the day, we're not just entertainment, we're humans," Biles told reporters following her balance beam bronze.

It's a medal she said means more than her golds after grappling with the "twisties" -- a mental block during which gymnasts lose sense of where their bodies are mid-flight.

Biles arrived in Tokyo as a decorated competitor, but left having shone a light on athlete well-being and the pressures of elite sport. And she wasn't the only one to redefine her legacy over the course of the Games.

Fellow American Allyson Felix became the most decorated US track and field athlete in history with 4x400 meter relay gold on Saturday. The two medals she won in Tokyo also represent her role as an athlete mother.

"There have been so many women before me who had to stay silent about their fight," Felix said of the way sport and athletics so often overlooks women's careers during and after childbirth.

"For me to be able to step out -- I think my daughter gave me the courage to do that."

Her Olympics career spans five Games, which World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said is" frankly, off the planet."

"We are just lucky she is from our sport," added Coe. "She is magnificent."

New sports, new medalists, new records

While Biles and Felix may have both competed in their final Games, Tokyo 2020 also highlighted athletes at the start of their Olympic careers.

Take skateboarding -- a sport that made its debut in Tokyo. The podiums in the women's street and park events had combined ages of 42 and 44 years old respectively. That's an average age of 14 across the two medal events.

Great Britain's Sky Brown competes in the park skateboarding competition at the Tokyo Olympics, where she won bronze.

Skateboarding wasn't the only sport added to the Olympic program in a bid to attract a younger audience; sport climbing also sought to draw new fans to the Games with a head-to-head speed discipline and an unpredictable, down-to-the-wire scoring format.

Expect more of the same at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, where breakdancing has been added to the event lineup.

Records are broken at every Games, but perhaps not in the same stunning fashion as they were in Tokyo's Olympic Stadium.

In the men's 400 meter hurdles final, gold and silver medalists Karsten Warholm and Rai Benjamin ran faster than Warholm's previous record by more than half a second, while Sydney McLaughlin also smashed the world record in the women's 400 meter hurdles.

Olympic records were also set by Elaine Thompson-Herah in the 100 meters and Jakob Ingebritsen in the 1500 meters.

Some put it down to a springy running track and advancements in shoe technology , while others credited the athletes themselves.

Karsten Warholm reacts in shock following his world record in the 400m hurdles

"There's some efficiency in the shoe, don't get me wrong, and it's nice to have a good track," said Benjamin.

"But no one in history's going to go out there and do what we did just now, ever. I don't care who you are."

New landmarks weren't just set on the running track. Yulimar Rojas broke the women's triple jump world record with a leap of 16.57 meters -- 17 centimeters further than the previous mark that had stood for 26 years.

For others, it didn't require a record to leave a mark on the Games.

Shot put silver medalist Raven Saunders, as so many other athletes have done over the past 15 months, used her moment in the spotlight to highlight social injustice.

Saunders, a Black, LGBTQ athlete, raised her arms in an X symbol as she posed for photos on the podium, telling NBC that it represented "the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet."

Public participation

Fans may have been kept away from virtually all Olympic events amid the coronavirus pandemic, but that didn't stop them trying to experience the Games in person as many clustered around venues to try to catch a glimpse of the action.

At the Aomi Urban Sports Park, for instance, fans lining the adjacent pedestrian street had a distant view of the sports climbing competitions -- despite signs and security officials urging people not to gather there.

Similar scenes played out about a kilometer away where the Olympic cauldron is on display. The site, located on Yume no Ohashi Bridge, was rarely without a crowd taking pictures, even though notice boards and security advised members of the public to keep walking.

Then outside the Olympic Stadium, fans often queued up to pose for photos with the Olympic rings, while the nearby Tokyo 2020 store was busy with people buying T-shirts, pins, and other memorabilia.

There's little doubt that athletes would have been well supported if fans were allowed into venues -- not least because of Japan's success, winning a record 27 golds.

"All I have now is sadness. Every time I look at the tickets, I cry," one superfan told CNN ahead of the Olympics about the $40,000 worth of tickets he was unable to put to use.

At times, particularly at the start of the Games, venues were eerily quiet.

On some occasions, it was the chattering sound of cicadas that was the dominant sound of the Games.

That's not to say venues were completely devoid of atmosphere. Non-competing athletes showed they could be voracious cheerleaders from the stands, while stadium announcers and music -- blared through loudspeakers at most events -- also filled the silence.

Covid-19 countermeasures

The buildup to the Tokyo Games was dominated by the backdrop of the pandemic as rumors of a cancellation or a further postponement swirled.

At venues, hygiene protocols -- including temperature tests, mask wearing, hand sanitizer, and socially distanced seating -- were all put in place and rigorously enforced by the huge number of volunteers.

Coronavirus cases in Tokyo rose as the Games got underway, regularly topping more than 4,000 daily new infections; inside the Olympic "bubble," there were more than 400 confirmed positive cases, the majority of whom were residents of Japan.

"The flow of people in Tokyo's downtown has not increased compared to the time before the opening of the Olympics," Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Friday.

"I don't think the Olympics has led to the increase of infection."

On Sunday, the last day of Olympic competition, thick, gray clouds blanketed Tokyo as rain poured across the city -- an unusual sight at the end of a sun-baked 16 days.

The dreary weather marked a temporary end to proceedings with the Paralympics getting underway on August 24 -- another opportunity for Japan to deliver sporting drama in the midst of a global pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) When Rebecca Smith sat down to watch New Zealand play the United States Women's National Team in a Tokyo 2020 football match last week, she was floored -- and not just because of the athletes' incredible prowess.

Watching the game from London, a British commentator kept calling an American forward by the wrong name. The commentary of Great Britain's game against the Netherlands has also provoked dismay after the a commentator got two players' names wrong and seemed to be under the mistaken assumption that Phil Neville is still the GB coach -- he left in January.

For Smith -- a two-time Olympian footballer who also captained the New Zealand team -- listening to the commentary of the Football Ferns playing the USWNT was like entering a time warp: It had happened to her and her teammates throughout her whole career.

"There wasn't really any time where I really felt like this full panel of media is really interested in the game, follows the game (or) knows really in-depth about the game," Smith told CNN Sport.

To see that some commentators still hadn't done the "absolute minimum" of learning an Olympic athlete's name "basically reinforces that stereotype that no one is watching, (that) no one cares about women's football, or female athletes," Smith said.

Roll their eyes

Academics studying the intersection of gender and sport highlight the fact that commentators continue to use the word "girls" to describe elite female athletes, regardless of their age, while they would rarely refer to male athletes as "boys."

Janet Fink, an expert in the marketing of female athletes and women's sport and the Associate Dean of University of Massachusetts Amherst told CNN that it was hard to understand how in 2021 "you could call someone who's a world-renowned athlete a girl."

"I mean, if you just flipped it, and you thought about a commentator talking about (a male athlete as a) boy...it's comical."

Fink added that she believes that sort of language has an impact on how people perceive female athletes, but that it is unclear how that language impacts how female athletes view themselves.

She said: "I think they probably roll their eyes a lot of times at some of those commentators."

Still, visibility and interest for women's sport continues to grow, with former and current athletes often playing a significant role lifting those profiles, according to Smith.

A 2018 Nielsen Sports study found that the volume of media coverage of women's sports across Europe ranged from as low as 2% to just 12% at peak times, whereas the Olympics represent a more balanced playing field in terms of competition. Plus, the Olympics tends to fare better in terms of balanced coverage for women's sport than in the normal sports landscape.

A record number of female athletes participating in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics might signal yet another indicator of a that progression. But gender inequality still very much exists at the Games, with the infantilization and sexualization of female athletes a pervasive force.

Smith points to another Olympic football match last week, where a Team GB athlete's "swishing blonde" ponytail was the subject of commentary, or how one male commentator pontificated about the "beautiful" smile of a a rugby sevens player.

Ahead of 2020 Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) released new guidelines for the media to counter such coverage, encouraging broadcasters to put gender equality at the forefront of coverage, to avoid sexualizing women and to treat all athletes with integrity, instead of focusing "unnecessarily on looks, clothing or intimate body parts."

But even the IOC's new gender equality advisor, the former Olympic swimmer Naoko Imoto, has said host country Japan was failing in that regard.

Last week she blasted her home country's coverage, saying that Japanese broadcasters continue to use the word "girls," "wives" or "mothers" when describing the athletes, instead of focusing on them as "pure athletes."

'Fastest vs. pregnant'

It is language that researchers at Cambridge University have identified as consistent with general sports reporting.

In a 2016 study, researchers found that men are mentioned almost three times more often than women in general sport reporting, with language around female athletes focusing disproportionately on aesthetics and personal lives.

The study -- which drew from a multi-billion word database of written and spoken English from a wide range of media sources -- found that men are seen to have a competitive edge in sport, with male athletes associated with the words "fastest," "strong," "beat," "win," and "dominate."

Meanwhile, female athletes were associated with the words "aged," "pregnant," "married," "compete," "participate" and "strive."

The researchers drew from the same data to analyze how those word associations would play out at the Rio 2016 Olympics.

While they found that some language had improved, with the use of the gender-neutral term "sportsperson" used with higher frequency in comparison to the language of sports in general, men's sports still received 20% more airtime at the Olympics.

Culture plays a part.

Professor Toni Bruce, an expert in the sociology of sport at the University of Auckland told CNN: "I think sports media reflects society. So as society changes, then sports media changes, but it's often running behind the change -- not necessarily leading it."

New Zealand is a good example of societal change leading the way for sport coverage, she explained, noting that in the 12 channels broadcasting Olympic coverage this week to be generally good with gender-neutral terminology -- with commentators using words such as "strength" and "ability" when speaking about women.

Underpinning that language is New Zealand's structural commitment to gender parity: The country sits in fourth place for gender equality, according to the 2021 World Economic Forum Index.

"There is sort of a kind of energy in New Zealand at the moment around gender equality and making sure that we do the best job and don't fall into these old tropes in terms of how you talk about female athletes," Bruce said.

When there is a real commitment towards gender equality and growing women's sport, coupled with growing the diversity of people who are commenting, writing or in charge of news coverage, significant progress can be made, Bruce said.

Still, she acknowledged that New Zealand is likely to be in a "different place as a nation compared to some of the other countries."

This rings true for Smith, who played 74 times for New Zealand and whose 10-year international football career brought her to clubs in the US, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.

Rebecca Smith, seen in action against Japan's Kozue Ando of Japan during the FIFA Women's World Cup 2011 match between Japan and New Zealand in 2011.

In Germany, the media continued to perpetuate narrow and damaging stereotypes of female footballers, she said, even when their team thrice held the title of European champions.

But in places like the US (where Title IX, the landmark gender equity law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972 banned sex discrimination in federally funded education programs), or in Sweden (where gender equality across socio-political and economic landscapes is robust), language around women in sport appeared to be much more concentrated on terms like "athleticism" and "strength," she said.

Smith then looks to England's difficult history with women's football, explaining that although it claims to be the home of the sport, women were essentially banned in 1921 from playing it -- a measure that lasted for 50 years.

"I think that really set them behind both in like the performance and the athletes," Smith said, "but also in commentary and how they look at athletes and how they look at women."

She added that those practices still prevail, pointing to the fact that schoolgirls are still unable to play or access the same opportunities to play football as boys, with many encouraged to take up netball instead.

This segregated nature of sport was noted in the 2016 Cambridge study, which found that the only context where women are mentioned more in reporting is to delineate their sports as "other" -- meaning that men's sport is often considered the norm.

Basketball, golf, football and cycling is often just called by their names, while female teams will be marked as "women's basketball, women's golf, women's football."

Kyoung-yim Kim, Assistant Professor of the Practice of Social Science at Boston College, explains that ultimately these problems stem from a "sex-segregated structure" that is "based on the sexist understanding of gender differences."

"It is this understanding of gender that causes this problematic media coverage of girls of women," Kim said, adding that the infantilizing and "ambivalent framing of women's accomplishment" in sport stems from our social understanding of gender.

In order to change this language, that entire system has to be challenged, she said.

This year, Tokyo 2020 is hosting 18 mixed-gender events.

Athletes compete in the mixed 4x400m relay final during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo on July 31.

But Kim suggests the IOC has more work to do, pointing to the fact there is no third gender or intersex delegation as well as the continued regulation of women's participation in sport through "sex testing" -- practices that human rights advocates including Human Rights Watch say violate fundamental rights to privacy and dignity.

"The IOC and their entire structure of sport basically reproduces and embodies the binarized and hierarchical forms of gender," said KIm.

"If they want to challenge this sexist language and hierarchical language then there should be discussions, at least, to talk about how the IOC can be a frontline institution thinking critically about this binary notion about sport structure as a whole."

The IOC told CNN Sport that it is "committed to inclusion across the Olympic Movement and recognizes that all athletes, regardless of their gender identity or sex characteristics should engage in safe and fair competition," and that the current guidance on eligibility to complete in male and female competition -- issued in 2015 -- is currently under review.

"Recognizing that there is a perceived tension between fairness/safety and inclusion/non-discrimination, and in consideration of the latest developments on many fronts, the IOC has decided in October 2019 to work on a new comprehensive and rights-respecting approach to address the complexity of this issue.

Currently, the IOC is developing new guidance to help ensure that athletes -- regardless of their gender identity and/or sex characteristics -- can engage in safe and fair competition," the organization said.

There has been much debate about the inclusion of transgender athletes in the Games, with the IOC saying that they will review guidelines for trans athletes after Tokyo 2020.

"I am not entirely unaware of the controversy which surrounds my participation at these Games," said New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, who became the first ​out transgender woman to compete in the 125-year history of the Olympics on Monday.

"And as such, I would particularly like to thank the IOC for, I think, really affirming its commitment to the principles of Olympism and establishing that sport is something for all people. It is inclusive, accessible."

For Smith, who now works as a consultant, there are clear steps that we can take to drive this change, including elevating former athletes who can speak from a position of experience and authority to commentator roles, as well as investing in more women (and diversifying talent) at the executive level.

Without that commitment, the cycle will continue, with the next generation not living up to their full potential, she said.

"If we're constantly feeding them messages that are not gender equal, that are racist or homophobic or not inclusive, then I think that we're bringing up a generation that's going to be ignorant and not inclusive -- and we're not going to be the best form of the human race that we can be," Smith said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Alphonso Davies has packed a lot into his life for a 20 year old.

A refugee whose parents had to flee civil war, the Bayern Munich footballer has already won more trophies than most players dream of winning in a career.

But Davies isn't only interested in entertaining football fans on the pitch. He's garnered a mammoth following on TikTok, posting online to "put a smile on someone's face," as well as his own.

"When you make a video or TikTok, you have to enjoy your own content," he tells CNN Sports' Amanda Davies.

A life outside of football

Fans clearly enjoy Davies' satirical brand of humor.

Last year, he went viral after creating a one-man re-enactment from the beloved comedy series "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," lip-syncing his way through a police line-up scene. He plays the roles of Andy Samberg's New York cop Jake Peralta, a witness, and every one of the suspects harmonizing to the Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way."

Despite it being a technically challenging sketch to produce, he says it's his favorite one he's created so far.

Davies has become a TikTok star over lockdown, posting content for his four million plus followers.

"That took almost 45 minutes to make because I had to change different outfits and stuff like that, get the words right," he says. "That was fun to make. I got a lot of good positive feedback from that video."

He hopes to publish content that entertains his audience, irrespective of whether they follow him for his football achievements, or for his sense of humor. "It keeps me busy and it doesn't just show Alphonso Davies the footballer, it shows Alphonso Davies the person as well."

"[It] shows them that I have a life outside of football."

Dealing with hate

But if Davies enjoys his social media presence because it gives him the opportunity to connect with fans, he's also experienced the peril of existing as a Black man in the spotlight.

In December 2020, he and his girlfriend -- Paris Saint-Germain forward Jordyn Huitema -- revealed they had received racist abuse after sharing a picture of themselves on holiday in Ibiza in August.

Bayern president Herbert Hainer leaped to the couple's defense at the time.

"Exclusion, discrimination, hatred and violence in every form have no place in our world. No matter where you come from -- football offers us all a home," he told German newspaper Bild

"Football has the power to connect people. As FC Bayern, we always want to contribute to this," Hainer added.

Davies continues to receive hate comments, but he remains unfazed. "There's a lot of people out there that you're going to get hate from, not everybody's going to love you," he says. "I was raised around good people [...] they kept me strong."

In December 2020, Davies and his girlfriend, Paris Saint-Germain forward Jordyn Huitema, revealed they had received racist abuse on social media.

"Some people have some ugly stuff to say, but I know they're just behind a screen typing. It doesn't really affect me."

Eliminating sustained racist abuse online is something the sport's governing bodies don't yet have a handle on.

"The things that happened with Marcus Rashford after the Europa League final, it was ugly to see," Davies says. "We're footballers, but we're humans as well. We breathe, sleep, eat like everyone else."

"I think whichever players are getting this hate, they handle it well [...] It's not easy to see, it's very difficult."

"Ever since I was little, I knew that people have different ideas, different opinions on everything," he adds.

"If you stay true to yourself, I don't think any of those can affect you."

Giving back

In June, he rode the latest digital trend by launching his first non-fungible token (NFT) collection , which included three unique pieces of virtual art created by US-based illustrator Jack Perkins.

Before releasing each design, Davies rallied his online followers with a social campaign, which allowed fans to vote on each aspect of the collection's designs.

The three winners of the campaign will receive a limited edition NFT, along with the chance for one golden ticket recipient to meet Davies and be presented with a signed UEFA Champions League winners' shirt.

Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, will host and trade the NFTs on its NFT marketplace.

"It was a great way for some artists to show their work," he says. "Digital art is something different [...] I thought it was a cool idea to get involved."

Davies' foray into the world of digital art and cryptocurrency is all for a good cause: 20% of the funds will be donated to multiple charities to help Palestinians.

Davies, who was born in a Ghanaian refugee camp, hopes he can use his platform to give back to displaced communities.

"I have people close to my heart that are from that country. I've seen what's going on and I think it was a quick decision for me to support them," he says.

"Everything that's going on there, I think everyone deserves to get respected [...] and treated with dignity."

Advocating for displaced people across the world is an issue that he is deeply affected by. The 20-year-old might be the face of Canadian soccer, but he emerged from humble beginnings. Davies was born in a Ghanaian refugee camp to Liberian parents who were fleeing their country's civil war.

"I was in a refugee camp, people helped us, and I just want to give back to them," he says. "I think it's a good thing to do."

Migrating to Canada

At the age of five, Davies left Buduburam refugee camp in Ghana with his parents and moved to start a new life in Edmonton, Canada.

"When my parents came to Canada, they told me some stories about their time in Ghana. It's sad, it was a tough time and it was hard," he says. "Growing up listening to these stories, I just want to make a better life for my family."

His mother and father worked long hours to make ends meet. Davies himself helped raise his two younger siblings while attending Mother Teresa Catholic School, where his talents were first spotted.

He subsequently joined St. Nicholas Soccer Academy, and by the age of 14, he was enrolled in the Vancouver Whitecaps' residency program -- a development scheme that would see him become the first player born in the 2000s to play in the MLS.

Davies won the Golden Boot as the top scorer at the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the Young Player Award as the tournament's most promising player.

The following year, Davies became a Canadian citizen and, on the same day, earned his first international call up, becoming the youngest player in Canada men's football history.

Though he doesn't have many memories of his life in Ghana, looking back, he says his parents' sacrifice fuels his ambition and sense of purpose. "It's a story that is part of me, and looking back, I can't believe we made it out, which was amazing."

"I remember how hard they [parents] worked to free their family. Every time I step on the pitch, it's for them."

Early success at Bayern

Since joining Bayern in the 2018 January transfer window, Davies has had incredible success with the club.

He's lifted six trophies with coach Hansi Flick, all in the space of 12 months, including his third Bundesliga title this season and his first Champions League in 2020.

But when he arrived at the club, he was overwhelmed by its legendary starting lineup and folkloric history.

He describes his first time walking into the locker room, looking at his new teammates' pictures on the wall, as an "incredible" experience.

Davies (right) with Bayern star Robert Lewandowski (left) and former Bayern defender David Alaba (center).

"Words can't really explain it [...] In my mind, I was thinking there's no way these are the real people," he says. "And then Robben walks in the room, and it's a real guy, it's not a cartoon."

"[I] shook his hand and he introduced himself, very polite, humble guy, it was amazing," he adds. "Everything I've accomplished, it's been amazing [...] when I got my opportunity, I told myself, 'Take your opportunity,' and I took it."

He especially looks up to ex-teammate David Alaba, who has joined Real Madrid after over 10 years at the Bavarian club. "I was very excited to meet David Alaba because obviously when we were little, he was a role model for most of the kids back home."

'I'm excited for the future'

Davies is gearing up for new changes on the horizon, with RB Leipzig's Julian Nagelsmann set to take over from Flick as the club's head coach next season.

"We know he's a good coach coming in. He has new ideas, new style of play," he says. "We know he's on the younger side of the coaching world, but that doesn't matter [...] he's going to come in and really bring his wisdom and what he knows to the football club."

Despite a changing of the guard, Davies' aspirations for the club remain the same, with the intention of winning the Champions League in 2022 and clinching six trophies in one season.

"We know it's not going to be easy. It's going to be really difficult. But I feel like with the team, we can do it again."

"My time is not done with Bayern. I still have a lot more years there and a lot more trophies to win, so I'm excited for the future."

Since sustaining a tear in his left ankle during Canada's build-up to the Gold Cup, Bayern announced in July that Davies will spend some time "on the sidelines" and rehab in Munich.

Davies has since returned to training. Bayern's first Bundesliga game is against Borussia Monchengladbach on Friday, August 13.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) When filmmakers were invited to document Eliud Kipchoge's second attempt to run a marathon in under two hours , it was the runner, rather than the run, that captured their imagination.

Amid the bluster and noise that often surrounds professional sport, they found that Kipchoge's quiet, contemplative demeanor was unique -- the calm at the eye of the storm.

"Eliud's almost like a holy man -- he has the qualities of an ascetic monk," says Jake Scott, director of "Kipchoge: The Last Milestone."

The film, releasing digitally from August 23 in the UK and from August 24 in the US, tells the story of the first sub-two-hour marathon -- a feat Kipchoge achieved in Vienna, Austria, in 2019 as part of a venture dubbed the INEOS 1:59 Challenge.

A behind-the-scenes look at the carefully engineered environment created to maximize Kipchoge's performance over 26.2 miles, it's also about the understated manner of the athlete himself and his long-distance training environment back home in Kenya.

Kipchoge takes part in a training session near Eldoret in March 2017.

"We went down to Eldoret, which is a high-altitude training camp in Kenya, and we found a few dozen of some of the world's top middle-to-long-distance athletes living like monks," producer Ross Plummer tells CNN Sport

"There was no distraction, no entertainment, no family; they were running 100 miles a week and sleeping 14, 15 hours a day.

"To us, it seemed like they were training themselves to ignore pain for the last 10 kilometers of a marathon. And we thought, well, this is fantastic -- we'd love to make a story about this."

Eldoret, a town located more than 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) above sea level in the Rift Valley, is a hallowed destination for long-distance runners because of its high altitude, temperate weather and long stretches of winding, country roads.

The rural region is the place from which Kipchoge, the fastest marathon runner of all time, builds the foundation for his success in races around the world.

He set the marathon world record of two hours, one minute and 41 seconds in Berlin three years ago, before becoming the first man to unofficially run the distance in under two hours the year after. Of the 14 major marathons he's entered, he's won 12 of them.

Kipchoge, in the white vest, is accompanied by pacemakers as he attempts to break the two-hour barrier for a marathon.

On Sunday in Sapporo, the Japanese city 500 miles north of Tokyo, 36-year-old Kipchoge became the third man to defend an Olympic marathon title.

"My real excitement in Tokyo is no longer about competing at an Olympic Games -- it's about making a legacy," he said last week.

Kipchoge's mantra -- that "no human is limited" -- is one he strives to embody through his running, rather than words.

"Because he's so reserved and quiet and humble, he's quite hard to access," Scott tells CNN Sport. "Eliud, it's not that he's elusive or he's evasive in any way, he's just quiet. He doesn't say very much. And when he does speak, he says something incredibly important."

Within his elite training group, Kipchoge is "very much the captain amongst the other runners," according to Scott, and leads in an understated manner.

"Eliud is not somebody who draws attention to himself ... he doesn't distinguish himself in that way. He doesn't put himself above any other person," Scott adds.

"I think he really lives by his code of no human is limited."

Kipchoge coined that phrase during the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, his second attempt to run an unofficial sub-two-hour marathon following Nike's Breaking2 project in Monza, Italy, in 2017.

Kipchoge celebrates setting a world record at the 2018 Berlin Marathon.

Unlike the unpredictable conditions of most major marathons, these sub-two-hour attempts engineered the perfect conditions to produce a fast time.

In Vienna, Kipchoge ran on a smooth, flat course with few corners. He had assistance from an army of pacemakers to block wind and a support car beaming green lights onto the road to provide a visual marker of the required pace of two minutes, 50 seconds per kilometer.

His fluid intake was also carefully monitored, with a cyclist on hand to pass and retrieve drink bottles.

"Getting a man to the moon involved overcoming gravity. What Kipchoge is doing is taking gravity out of the equation," sports scientist Ross Tucker told CNN Sport ahead of the challenge . "The variables are too contrived for this to be regarded as a pure human accomplishment."

Another notable aspect of the challenge, and Kipchoge's career more broadly, was the shoes he had on his feet.

Nike's carbon-fiber-plated "super shoes" gained prominence around 2016, and various different versions have been released since then.

Following Nike's success, which has been spearheaded by Kipchoge's record-breaking times, other leading brands -- including Adidas, Asics, Brooks and New Balance, among others -- have come out with versions of shoes featuring a carbon fiber plate and ultralight foam.

"Is Kipchoge an outlier of immense athletic potential? Or is he a simply a very good runner who is benefiting from the immense improvements that his shoes provide? Perhaps both," said Tucker.

Beyond the marathon, there's a debate to be had about whether Kipchoge is the greater distance runner of all time.

"What can you say -- he's the world record holder and also he's an Olympic champion," US marathon runner Abdi Abdirahman told CNN Sport earlier this year. "He knows he had a great career."

"For me, Kipchoge is the best, but I think Kenenisa (Bekele) is the GOAT (greatest of all time)."

Ethiopia's Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, has held the 5,000 meter and 10,000 meter world records during the course of his career. In 2019, he won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:41 -- two seconds outside Kipchoge's world record.

"What he accomplished as an athlete, it's rare. You barely hear about it," Abdirahman continues. "He was breaking world records -- 5 kilometer, 10 kilometer -- when there were no super shoes, when there was nothing."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Naomi Osaka discovered what it's like to be at the sharp end of a sporting governing body's regulations this summer.

The ​four-time grand slam singles champion declined to ​attend press conferences as she began her French Open campaign in June -- citing the importance of protecting her mental health and addressing the toll that media interviews had previously taken on her.

The French Open organizers responded by fining the world No. 2 an amount of $15,000 and threatening to expel her from future grand slams, after they deemed her withdrawal from press conferences as a failure on her part to meet "contractual media obligations."

Osaka made the decision to withdraw from Roland Garros altogether, then skipped Wimbledon , before returning to play at the Tokyo Olympics.

What's happened to Osaka over the last few months has left many ​critical of her sport's handling of the situation, and wishing those who govern her sport ​had adopted a more empathetic and sensitive approach given ​she was dealing with mental health issues.

In fact, just after Osaka said she would be opting out of speaking to the press at the tournament, the French Open official Twitter account posted a since-deleted tweet that included photos of four other players engaging in media duties -- Coco Gauff, Kei Nishikori, Aryna Sablenka and Rafael Nadal -- which carried the caption: "They understood the assignment."

Naomi Osaka serves the ball to Romania's Patricia Maria Tig during their women's singles first round match on Day 1 of the French Open tennis tournament in Paris on May 30, 2021.

The tweet appeared to be directed at Osaka and her decision to withdraw from media obligations. It was considered by several former tennis players and pundits as insensitive, and former doubles champion Rennae Stubbs said that the post could make Osaka "feel guilty" and described it as "humiliating" for her.

And while the rule itself -- in which players are required to engage in press conferences throughout the tournament -- ​may not be a racist or misogynistic one, the context in which Osaka found herself ​punished and seemingly mocked by officials is part of a pattern in which Black women in ​elite sports are subject to harsh scrutiny.

The rigidity with which Roland Garros responded to Osaka's decision is reminiscent of the scrutiny that tennis ​governing bodies have previously bestowed upon other prominent players, including Serena Williams.

Osaka is a young, Black ​and Japanese athlete whose decision at the French Open is considered outside of the box by many. Her refusal to play by the traditional rules has seen her face backlash across the board in a particular right-wing media landscape that doesn't look too fondly on Black women that diverge from the expected path.

And tennis has a history in the way it has dealt with Black women who do things differently.

Osaka of Team Japan plays a backhand during her singles first round match against Saisai Zheng of Team China on day two of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Ariake Tennis Park on July 25, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.

In 2018, when Serena Williams wore a black catsuit at the French Open -- designed​, she said, to ​help prevent the recurring blood clots she developed after ​a difficult childbirth, ​and which she dedicated to other mothers that had undergone complicated pregnancies -- the French Tennis Federation deemed the outfit unacceptable.

At the time, the organization's then-president Bernard Giudicelli said that a tennis player must "respect the game and the place" and said Williams' catsuit wouldn't be accepted at the grand slam.

Williams found herself accused of displaying "disrespect" towards the game despite putting her physical health first, much like Osaka prioritized her mental health this year. In both cases, there was a feeling among many that Black women athletes were having ​their legitimate personal choices policed ​with insensitivity by governing bodies.

The incident in which Williams was told she couldn't wear the catsuit again was not the first time the tennis star had experienced elevated scrutiny for her appearance and attire. Throughout her career, Williams has faced criticisms of her physicality in ways that White, male tennis players never have.

Serena Williams clenches her fist after scoring a point against Krystina Pliskova during their first round match of the French Open at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, France, Tuesday, May 29, 2018.

She has been referred to as a man and has been described as "too muscular," and she and her sister Venus have been called the "Williams brothers" -- by the head of the Russian Tennis Federation, Shamil Tarpischev, a top member of a ruling body in tennis. Her ​body has been mocked by journalists and fellow tennis players.

After Williams' defeat to Osaka in the 2018 US Open final, in which there was an altercation between Williams and umpire Carlos Ramos, she was portrayed by Mark Knight in a cartoon in a way that was widely regarded as a racist stereotype -- a case in which a White artist depicted Williams as angry and ill-mannered, a trope which has been used to cast Black women in a degrading and mocking light for many years.

The events of the 2018 French Open served as yet another occasion at which Williams was subject to heavy criticism for her appearance in a history of intense scrutiny levelled at a successful Black sports woman. ​

CNN reached out to the French Tennis Federation over its treatment of both Osaka and Williams but didn't receive a response.

Gwen Berry, right, third place, looks on during the playing of the National Anthem with DeAnna Price, center, first place, and Brooke Andersen, second place, on the podium after the women's Hammer Throw final on day nine of the 2020 US Olympic Track & Field Team Trials at Hayward Field on June 26, 2021, in Eugene, Oregon.

'It's almost comical how blatant it is'

Olympian Gwen Berry is a track and field star for whom equal treatment for women, especially Black women, in sport matters greatly.

She says that "without a doubt" there is systemic racism and bias within professional sport.

"It's almost comical how blatant it is," Berry told CNN Sport. "When Serena, Naomi or another athlete who happens to be a Black woman, does anything that veers away from what's 'expected' in the top sports, they're punished."

Berry is no stranger to the penalization and marginalization brought down on Black women athletes who decide to do things on their own terms.

At the US Olympic trials this year, she turned away from the flag and held up a T-shirt that carried the words 'activist athlete' as the National Anthem played while she was on the podium after Berry says she was told it would play before the medal ceremony, not during, -- something which made her feel as if she had been "set up" by USA Track and Field.

Immediately afterwards, she was met with fury from critics including Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Dan Crenshaw, the former of whom accused her of hating America.

In 2019, Berry lost some of her sponsorships after raising her fist in protest on the podium while the National Anthem played at the Pan American Games in Peru.

She received a 12-month probation from the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee for the act, which she says was meant to highlight social injustice in America. The committee called the gesture a breach of their code of conduct.

Berry finds the punishment and marginalization that she's faced for protesting inequality in the US to be the product of both racism, misogyny and elitism in what she sees as an environment that doesn't want Black women athletes to speak out.

"It feels like, when you're an athlete and you're standing up for racial equality and for women's rights that the people at the top don't want you to do anything other than perform for them," Berry said. "It's like they're saying to us: 'You're on this stage, so you have to do what we ask and it doesn't matter what you want to say."

Berry says that, as a successful Black woman in an elite sport, she feels that she is often expected to just "remain silent when it comes to oppression."

"It's as if they [the ruling bodies of track and field] just assume that I shouldn't say anything they consider 'over the line'," Berry told CNN Sport.

"If you say anything that addresses the reality of racial inequality in this country and in this sport, you're pulled back because it doesn't fit in with how you're expected to perform."

Simone Biles, of the United States, waits to perform on the vault during the artistic gymnastics women's final at the 2020 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 27, 2021, in Tokyo.

'They don't want the field to be too far apart'

Back in May, Simone Biles -- the most decorated American gymnast in history -- received what her coach, sports journalists such as Juliet Macur and other commentators deemed ​an underscore from the US Classic judges after she pulled off a Yurchenko double pike vault.

Until that night, the move had never before been performed by a woman ​in competition.

While wearing a leotard complete with an image of a rhinestone goat emblazoned on the back -- in reference to the ​perception that she is the GOAT, or greatest of all time, in her field -- Biles achieved something unprecedented for women in gymnastics​, and was rewarded for her efforts with a score of 6.6.

That's just slightly above the scores usually given for completing significantly less challenging vaults. After receiving a score that falls within the range of points she'd been given before for far less difficult moves, Biles said to ESPN: "That's on the [International Federation of Gymnastics], that's not on me.

"They have an open-end code of points, and now they're mad people are too far ahead and excelling."

Biles has set the bar for what modern gymnasts are capable of. She has performed routines so complex and inventive that she has four moves named after her. She is widely considered the best female gymnast in the world.

So, it is understandable that she considers the 6.6 for pulling off a groundbreaking move an underscore -- and that she feels this is motivated by a desire to ensure that she doesn't excel too far ahead.

Usually when an athlete claims a historic achievement, they ​can expect to be celebrated by their field's ruling body. In this case, that didn't happen for the five-time World all-around champion.

The International Federation of Gymnastics did not respond to CNN's request for comment. They did not issue a statement elsewhere in response to Biles' comments on the US Classic score.

South African middle-distance runner and 2016 Olympic gold medallist Caster Semenya competes in the women's 5000-meter final during the Sizwe Medical Fund Athletics South Africa Senior Track and Field Championships held at the Tuks Athletics Stadium in Pretoria on April 15, 2021.

The fight for respect and recognition

​South African runner Caster Semenya is another Black woman athlete who knows what it's like to feel targeted by a governing body.

In 2018, World Athletics announced new rules that meant double Olympic champion Semenya would be forced to reduce her natural levels of testosterone if she wanted to compete in ​her events in the future after the organization declared her natural abilities an unfair advantage over other women. ​

This is despite the fact that such abilities come from a genetic condition that Semenya was born with.

Since then, the South African runner has been embroiled in legal challenges and, in February, she filed an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights.

During the years in which Semenya has pursued her challenge to World Athletics' rule changes, she has been unable to compete in many major competitions.

And Semenya isn't the only Black woman to be severely affected by the World Athletics rule changes on testosterone levels, as the Ugandan middle-distance runner Annet Negesa, who has hyperandrogenism like Semenya, also found herself fiercely scrutinized for her condition.

Kenyan athlete Maximila Imali, too, has been fighting for acceptance from the elite athletics world since 2014 -- all due to the differences in sex development that ​are part of the way she ​was born.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) in a report on the sex testing of elite women athletes noted that "women from the Global South have been disproportionately affected" by these rules and pointed out that "there have never been analogous regulations for men."

In a statement issued to CNN, World Athletics said: "Black female athletes are not marginalised in athletics, they are in the mainstream.

"There is copious evidence that Black women are thriving and being celebrated ​in track and field, that it is in fact the most accessible sport for Black women."

In reference to Semenya's case, World Athletics stated: "Our female eligibility regulations do not target any single athlete or race, they apply to athletes with specific Differences of Sexual Development who can take advantage of male levels of testosterone unavailable to other female athletes.

"These regulations were tested in the Court of Arbitration for Sport and found to be "a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of attaining a legitimate objective" of ensuring fair competition in female athletics."

The case of Semenya, then, falls into the same category as the cases of Osaka, Williams, and Berry, in which Black women at the top level of sports find themselves almost constantly policed -- for their actions, their bodies, hair and outfits.

"The thing is many of these sports, like tennis and golf and track and field, were traditionally dominated by white men and they were established by them," Berry said.

"So, the last thing that's expected at the top is for Black women to even play a role in them -- let alone to go on to excel in their fields." ​

Berry's point is most famously illustrated by the success of Serena. The 23-time grand slam champion is regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time -- in a sport that is still traditionally associated with country clubs.

Tennis is a sport with a history of being played in royal courts by wealthy, White monarchs such as Henry VIII of England and of trickling into the habits of the middle and upper classes. It has been heavily associated with White middle-class sportsmen for many years.

When both of the Williams' sisters were playing in tournaments as children, their father ​has said he overheard White parents talk about the girls in derogatory ways. Now, the younger Williams' sibling is the face of world tennis and is considered one of the finest American athletes ever.

Serena Williams celebrates with her father, Richard Williams, and sister, Venus Williams, after the Wimbledon singles final match against Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland on July 7, 2012.

'Old Boys' clubs'

Semenya's absence at this year's Olympics is difficult not to notice: one of the world's most accomplished athletes is not present at the most coveted competition of them all -- it is a glaring absence.

Greg Nott is the director of Norton Rose Fulbright, the law firm that has been representing Caster in her challenge to World Athletics.

Nott has known and worked closely with Semenya for many years and believes that the World Athletics rules are not only "rooted in racism and misogyny," but that they also "go against the entire ethos of athletics and world sport."

Nott describes the governing bodies at the top of elite sports as "Old Boys' clubs."

"The make-up of these boards does not reflect the diversity of the athletes they're ruling over," Nott told CNN Sport.

"You've got people who all think the same sitting at the same table who aren't questioning one another or challenging each other to consider anything outside of their own traditional school of thought.

"There has to be diversity in gender and race within these ruling bodies. They should be the leaders and the vanguard in sport -- they should be leading the way to encourage greater diversity in athletics.

"They should be shaping an environment in which every athlete feels comfortable to be there, regardless of their race or gender or any other differences."

Nott thinks that World Athletics' ruling against Semenya undermines the very nature of the sport.

"The entire idea behind athletics and competitions such as the Olympics and so on is that they celebrate the natural abilities of individuals," Nott said.

"So, what's happening to Caster -- whose natural advantage is being called into question -- actually goes against everything that athletics is supposed to stand for.

"She is being scrutinized for abilities that she did not gain through the use of any performance enhancers.

"To say that she should have to change herself in order to compete in what she wants to do is totally at odds with what athletics and world sport are supposed to be about."

HRW, too, are of the belief that the rules that have for so long hindered Semenya, Negesa, Imali and more are diametrically opposed to the Olympics and similar celebrations of athletic achievement.

In their aforementioned report on sex testing, the organization says:

"​Instituting and enforcing policies that are inherently discriminatory — such as sex testing regulations — flies in the face of the Olympic movement's commitments to dignity and equality for all.

"Regulating fair play is a valid undertaking for sport authorities; committing human rights violations in the process is not."

"No one should have to change themselves to be a sporting professional."

Sha'Carri Richardson celebrates winning the Women's 100-meter final on day 2 of the 2020 US Olympic Track & Field Team Trials at Hayward Field on June 19, 2021, in Eugene, Oregon.

According to Nott, Semenya's experience and treatment indicates an expectation within athletics as to what a woman should look like -- an expectation that is laid out by the executives who reside in the seat of power in track and field.

"She faces this indignity in which her body is essentially paraded around the world because she is different," Nott added.

"Just recently, she stood up in front of a group of people she was speaking to and said 'I know I have a deep voice and I know my body looks like this -- but I'm Caster. And I'm a woman.'

"And that is so powerful for her to make it clear that, regardless of whatever these ruling bodies believe a woman should look like, she knows that she's a woman and that her ordeal is rooted in discrimination."

Nott pointed out that World Athletics and other governing bodies in sport are aware that they hold most of the power when it comes to situations such as these -- and he described their actions as "gatekeeping."

"These ruling bodies regulate themselves," Nott said.

The World Athletics Executive Board is made up of eight individuals. Of those eight, only two are women. Neither is Black. As Nott points out, the board itself does not reflect the diversity of the athletes it is supposed to represent.

"They know the power they wield -- they know they don't necessarily have to take things like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into account because they're private organizations.

"So, they don't really have to answer to anyone who might question how their rules impact marginalized athletes."

He said that because these bodies are essentially free to govern as they wish, they aren't always held to account when their decisions can leave Black women athletes feeling sidelined.

In Berry's opinion, too, what has happened to Semenya is reflective of both the higher standards that Black women athletes are held to and the restrictive parameters of how a woman should appear.

"It feels as though they're saying this is what a woman looks like and if you don't look like this, then you're not a woman and you're something else," Berry said.

Imani Dorsey #28 of the NJ/NY Gotham FC looks for options during a game between NJ/NY Gotham City FC and Orlando Pride at Exploria Stadium on April 14, 2021, in Orlando, Florida.

Change comes from the top

​Some athletes, in response to racism and sexism they've encountered, have established and joined organizations dedicated to making sure their voices and experiences are heard.

Imani Dorsey is an NWSL [National Women's Soccer League] player and a board member of the Black Women's Player Collective [BWPC] -- a grassroots movement that strives to elevate the presence and representation of Black women soccer players.

She has played a pivotal role in the progression of the BWPC to date and is deeply passionate about increasing the visibility of and opportunities for Black women in soccer.

"It's crazy because soccer is the world sport, right? Anyone can play," Dorsey said to CNN Sport.

"But for some reason, in the US, it takes a lot of money to reach the top -- and the vast majority of people in this country with money are White people."

The Board of Directors ​of US Soccer oversees the governing of the NWSL and ​Major League Soccer ​(MLS​). At the present moment, there are no Black women on its board.

While there is a higher proportion of women in the US Soccer Board of Directors than there is in the World Athletics or the International Tennis Federation boards, there is still little representation of Black women athletes at the top level of soccer, too.

Dorsey, like Berry, thinks that when elite sports were initially established, the "people at the top weren't really thinking about anyone else."

Indeed, association soccer was founded in the 19th century in England and, when the ​Football Association (FA) Cup was born in ​1863, it was dominated by ​White men both on the pitch and on the governing side.

It wasn't until the late 1960s and early 1970s -- when Clyde Best and Albert Johanneson played for the English clubs West Ham and Leeds United respectively and Laurie Cunningham joined Leyton Orient -- that Black professional players in association soccer's country of origin were truly recognized.

The Women's FA wasn't founded until 1969 and, up until this point, women had been banned from playing soccer on FA grounds for more than 40 years. Only in 2002 did Mary Phillip, a Black woman, captain the England women's national soccer team -- ​nearly a century and a half after the sport was established.

Clearly, soccer has not always been a welcoming place for anyone that isn't White and male.

Dorsey also believes that change will only come when Black women athletes are in the room where decisions are made.

"When you're a minority, no one is really asking you what your experiences feel like," she said.

"So, in the BWPC, it's really about what we can do to amplify our voice and to provide our perspective because what we've reali​zed certainly in the last year is that it has been sorely missing in a lot of decision-making entities."

Dorsey also thinks that ​centering Black women's voices in conversations held within sports' ruling bodies aligns with the entire culture of women's soccer -- which she says is focused on "leaving the sport a better place for the next generation of women and girls."

To Dorsey, the inclusion of Black women athletes in sports' biggest boardrooms and governing bodies will play a key role in bringing about an end to the marginalization they face in the present moment.

Then, perhaps a new generation may not have to face the same scrutiny and sidelining that Williams, Berry, Osaka and Biles have all experienced at one point or another.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@While competing at the highest level, sportswomen can't escape scrutiny and discrimination.

For years, female athletes have had their clothing policed. Now, they're fighting back

The 2020 Tokyo Olympics are well underway after being postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic -- and while the Games are only a year behind, you might be forgiven for thinking professional sport is stuck in a far more severe time warp.

In the month building up to the world's most anticipated sporting event, female athletes have drawn attention to numerous incidents they say left them feeling shamed or sexualized.

Double Paralympic world champion Olivia Breen said this month she was left "speechless" when an official at the English Championships told her that her sprint briefs were "too short and inappropriate."

"It's just wrong -- we're not living in the 18th century, we're living in 2021," Breen said in an interview via video chat. "For me personally, I want to be as light as possible so I can jump out, run faster." In a statement posted to Twitter, Breen questioned whether a male competitor would be similarly criticized. The female official's comment, "really shocks me and makes me really cross," Breen wrote. "I just thought, that needs to change."

Breen told CNN she planned to make an official complaint. The incident not only angered her, it was also concerning, she said, as behavior like that could put women and girls off sport.

"For a girl with low confidence or low self esteem, it may make them feel rubbish."



A confusing double standard



Experiences like Breen's are nothing new for female athletes, who regularly find themselves rebuked for wearing too little -- or too much -- clothing.

Just this month, Norway's women's beach handball team was fined 1,500 euros ($1,766) for "improper clothing" after players opted to wear shorts instead of bikini briefs during a European championship game in Bulgaria.

According to International Handball Federation (IHF) regulations, female athletes must wear bikini bottoms with a maximum side width of 10 centimeters (3.9 inches), a "close fit" and "cut on an upward angle toward the top of the leg" -- though the dress code allows male athletes to wear shorts that are "not too baggy" and 10 centimeters above the kneecap.

"We have no idea why those rules are as they are," said Julie Aspelund Berg, a defender with Norway's beach handball team, during a phone call. "Why can't we just wear shorts (when) we can manage the job just as good as in bikinis?"

Berg explained that her team knew they would be fined, but preferred to compete in shorts instead of bikini bottoms because the bikinis can ride up and leave them feeling exposed.

"With those bikinis, we were all the time checking if it's in the right place. We were focusing on other things than the sport -- and that's not something we want," she said.

"We just want to be treated at the same level as the guys."

The incident quickly gained worldwide attention, and even caught the attention of singer Pink, who offered to pay the team's fines , and said European Handball Federation (EHF) should be fined for sexism.

Following worldwide backlash, the EHF and the IHF later confirmed the topic of female uniforms would be discussed by the newly elected Beach Handball Commission in August.

The incident is just another example of the "conflicting messages" women are faced with, said Stephanie Hilborne, CEO of Women in Sport, during a phone interview. "Wear less, wear more. It's a bit like the tight rope that women are forced to walk through a lot of aspects of life."



A long history of different rules

Women have long struggled for the right to participate in sports -- and to gain recognition solely for their achievements.

"Women's sport only ever gets the same representation as men's sport during the Olympics, and I think Wimbledon is probably the only other time it happens," Michael Hobson, a lecturer in physical and sports education at St Mary's University, said via video call.

While the first modern Olympic Games took place in 1896, women weren't allowed to participate until 1900 , when, of a total of 997 athletes, only 22 women competed in five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism and golf.

English tennis player Charlotte Cooper became the first woman in history to win an Olympic gold medal at the games, while wearing a full-length dress.

Women competing in sports like lawn tennis in the 19th century "wore corsets and big skirts, which obviously didn't allow very good movement," Michelle Flemons, a senior lecturer in physical education sport and youth development at St Mary's University said via video call. Dress codes were "trying to hit that balance between their femininity and their athleticism. So, basically then after they finished playing tennis, they could still find husbands," she said, referencing the research of Rachael Jefferson-Buchanan.

Hilborne said the only rules for what should be worn in competitions today "should be driven by fairness," citing swimsuits as an example.

In 2009, the international governing body of swimming, FINA, decided to ban polyurethane-based swimsuits -- dubbed "doping on a hanger" by their critics -- from competitive swimming. The performance-enhancing, non-textile swimsuits caused controversy after a series of world records were set by swimmers wearing them. A the time, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps threatened to withdraw until the suits were banned.

A 'degrading' conversation

"Time and time again, when women perform, what they're wearing becomes part of the conversation. Almost as much as the performance, which is degrading," Hobson said.

Numerous studies have been done on tennis tournaments, like Wimbledon, investigating how often female clothing was commented on. Conversely, "Male clothing is never commented upon," he added.

Officials are making efforts to push back against sexualized or stereotypical representations of female athletes. In it's updated "Portrayal Guidelines," the the International Olympic Committee instructs broadcasters not to "focus unnecessarily on looks" like make-up, hair, nails, clothing or "intimate body parts" like "crotch shots, cleavage, backsides" "especially if it does not relate to an athlete's performance."

"Athleticism and sporting prowess should be the focus of the imagery" the IOC said.

Still, the German women's gymnastics team recently made headlines for choosing to forgo bikini-cut leotards in favor of full-body versions at the Tokyo Olympics, in what the German Gymnastics Federation branded a statement against "sexualization."

The full-body uniforms, which the team wore in their qualifications at the Games last weekend, provide full coverage of the athletes' legs, in contrast to the high-cut leotards worn by many other female gymnasts at the Olympics.

"It's about what feels comfortable," German gymnast Elisabeth Seitz said. "We wanted to show that every woman, everybody, should decide what to wear."

According to Hobson, when it comes to media representation, "there's these two sort of overtly oppressive views of women: one which is overly sexualized and the other one is overly concerned with modesty."

He pointed to a famous 2016 image of Egyptian and German beach volleyball players at the Rio Olympics, presented by some outlets as a "clash of cultures."

According to the Daily Mail , pictures of the sport "famed for its revealing attire" showed "the contrasting cultures among some of the nations taking part."

"It was seen as the West versus Islamic culture -- almost a sort of sexualization versus modesty," Hobson said.

Rules reinforce exclusion and discrimination

Rules, regulations and media commentary surrounding athletes' apparel can sometimes reenforce racial discrimination.

The International Swimming Federation (FINA) this month attracted heavy criticism after Soul Cap, a UK-based brand, announced that the governing body for aquatic sports refused to approve the caps designed for swimmers with natural Black hair in international competitions, including the Olympics.

"For younger swimmers, feeling included and seeing yourself in a sport at a young age is crucial," Soul Cap founders said in a statement shared on the company's Instagram page. "FINA's recent dismissal could discourage many younger athletes from pursuing the sport as they progress through local, county and national competitive swimming."

The Black Swimming Association (BSA) said it was "extremely disappointed" by FINA's decision, adding that it "confirms the lack of diversity in elite swimming and the lack of urgency for change."

In a letter to presidents of the IOC and World Athletics, the Anti-Racism and Diversity Intergroup of the European Parliament said that FINA's effective banning of the Soul Cap at international tournaments "reflects stigmatization of Black hair and leads to institutional inequalities, especially targeting Black women."

Though FINA said it is now "reviewing" its decision not to allow the use of the swimming caps at the Tokyo Olympics following backlash, barriers for Black athletes are not confined to one sport.

"Sport is a microcosm of society and so in many ways, it reflects many of the attitudes, many of the cultural practices, many of the ideologies and "isms" of racism, sexism, the "phobias" of homophobia, xenophobia, really coming to the fore in these spaces," said Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director at the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change, during a phone interview.

"We see it manifest in the representation of our athletes, we see it come to fore in the policies, or the practices that happen within the sport."

According to Fiona May, a retired field and track athlete who has won two Olympic silver medals and two World Championships, Black female athletes: "are portrayed in a certain way," often characterized as aggressive, and have their appearances scrutinized.

"I've seen it. I've been through it," she said over the phone, "It discourages you."

May, who is on the advisory panel of Sporting Equals, an organization that promotes ethnic diversity across sport, said that as a Black athlete, you have to "be the best, not only 100% but also 120%"

Continuing, she said, "that's a bit tiring, psychologically, because you already have to think about being the best in the world, and training."

Fighting for the next generation

Fighting for better uniform standards and norms is not just about kicking back at sexualization and sexism.

Berg said Norway's beach handball team were concerned that the existing uniform regulations might deter some women whose religious beliefs require more modest attire.

"We want to include everyone. With this clothing we are actually not doing that. We were not including all women, just because of their religion, and then not allowed to actually [to participate] with such small bikinis or that little clothing," she said.

Though high-level events are a forum for the world's best athletes, experts say the way that athletes are -- or are not -- represented can have a huge impact on youth participation in sports.

"It's not just at the Olympic level, it trickles down. If I don't see myself on the screen, or my cultural traditions or family morals are not respected in these spaces, parents will not place their children in these spaces," Carter-Francique said.

Lipa Nessa, trustee for the Muslimah Sports Association said that Muslim women face many barriers to sports participation.

"When I started to play football, prior to 2014, I couldn't compete because wearing a headscarf wasn't allowed," she said, adding that a "huge chunk" of Muslim women didn't play the sport as the result of a 2007 ban on headscarves by football's world governing body.

It is encouraging to see big governing bodies taking a stand and amending their rules, Nessa said, adding that other bodies and brands have started to follow suit -- the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) changed its rules to allow players to wear religious head coverings during games in 2017.

"Big brands, sports brands have been showcasing inclusivity for a couple of years now, with sports hijabs or burkinis, head-to-toe swimwear and other modest sportswear. If they can do it, then what's stopping everyone else?"

According to Hilborne, "women should be the ones setting the rules and involved in the design" and a diverse group of women at that. "Otherwise, you're just going to keep getting it wrong," she said.

She added that the top jobs in sports are still "totally dominated" by men.

"They set the culture of the sport. In the public gaze and in the media and around the Olympics -- it does affect the way that girls and women look at whether they should take part in sport.

"It's not just having some women at the top, it's having women in the critical jobs at the top of sport, so that they can be truly influential and shift the culture. Or we're just gonna have to keep fighting these battles, which is a complete distraction from the incredible things that women are achieving in sport," Hilborne said.

The good news, said May, is that there's a growing awareness of the issues that previous generations have faced.

"I find it much better now, much much better because this new generation of women of all color, they've seen what we've been through," May said.

She sees how her daughter, long jumper Larissa Iapichino watched how her mother was treated, and as a result "doesn't take any flak from anybody whatsoever, in all senses.

"I think we gave them a bit of strength to say: 'Right, this is happening. This happened to my mom, but it's not going happen to me.'

"But there's still a long way to go."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) It was meant to be the biggest day of Paula Radcliffe's career. The whole planet was expecting the world record holder to win the 2004 Athens Olympic marathon -- a dream she had since she was 11 years old.

And then it all went wrong. A combination of a leg injury and stomach illness meant Radcliffe was forced to pull out of the race a few miles before the finish line, disoriented and in visible distress.

She was no longer the medal hopeful. Instead, she was called a "quitter" and accused of letting her country down -- just as Simone Biles has been this week after withdrawing from individual all-around competition at the Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday.

Biles, the most decorated gymnast in history, pulled out over mental health concerns and Radcliffe said that while their health issues were different, the underlying problem was the same.

"Neither one of us quit. Our bodies just weren't able to do it," Radcliffe told CNN in a phone interview. "Very few people actually understand the relationship between your mind and your body ... particularly in something that's really physically, or mentally -- or both -- taxing, you really need to know when to push through it and when to listen to your body, and it's what has made her the great champion that she is," she said.

"I would argue that she's actually even stronger mentally for being able to make that call now," Radcliffe said of Biles.

The British press hounded Radcliffe relentlessly in the aftermath of the Athens Olympics, scrutinizing her every move. Reporters were hiding in bushes to watch her train and tried to trick her doctor into disclosing her private medical records. It got so bad that she and her husband and coach Gary Lough eventually left the country and went to Arizona to focus on training.

For Biles and her generation of elite athletes, however, escaping is nearly impossible because of social media.

"It can be so cruel and so heartless and harmful and particularly in this current situation where the athletes are kind of in a bubble, removed from the real world ... then they start to think those comments are real and they hurt a lot more than if you were protected by all of your family and friends around you," Radcliffe said, referring to an Olympics held during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Paula Radcliffe looks dejected after she pulled out of the women's 10,000m event during the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics.

She also suggested that tougher regulations on social media should be put into place. "You couldn't print something in a newspaper or online that people get away with putting there and yet the people that it hurts still see it."

Several high-profile Olympians have spoken up about deleting their social media apps and accounts . Australian swimmer Ariarne Titmus, who has won two Olympic gold medals, said she has deleted every social media app on her phone to avoid "external pressure." And Dutch cyclist Annemiek van Vleuten said she went off social media to preserve her mental state after her heartbreaking silver medal in the road race on Sunday.

A major shift on mental health, finally

Yet there is some hope for things changing. Biles' announcement came just a month after tennis star Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open citing mental health reasons.

While Osaka and Biles faced some criticism -- mostly from people described by Radcliffe as "armchair warriors" -- both were also praised for speaking up.

The outpouring of support Biles received from everyone starting from her teammates and fellow athletes to the US Olympic Committee, commentators and fans showed that the conversation about mental health in elite sports is long overdue.

"It's something that really needs to be properly understood," Radcliffe said. "It took a long time to understand physical training, then it took a long time to understand proper nutrition and the psychological components to sports preparation, and how that can make you stronger, but now I think the mental health, it's huge and it needs to be properly understood."

For decades, the issue of mental health in sport was taboo -- even though the problem is worryingly widespread. A 2019 analysis by the British Journal of Sports showed that 34% of elite athletes suffered from anxiety or depression and 19% struggled with alcohol misuse, figures that are higher than among the general population.

Athletes for Hope -- a non-profit focused on helping athletes that was founded in 2007 by a group of elite sportsmen and women including Muhammad Ali, Andre Agassi and Tony Hawk -- has praised Osaka for igniting "necessary conversations about athlete mental health" and said the world was seeing an important shift in how mental health was discussed.

A statement from the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee signaled this shift. The committee said it applauded Biles' decision to "prioritize your mental wellness over all else."

"I think that makes it even more admirable that she's been able to recognize that for her health she has to step back, and I think it's helped other athletes who have been speaking up about it because, before that, there was more of a perception that people just didn't talk about it, they just got on with it," Radcliffe said.

Radcliffe was able to bounce back following her Athens heartbreak. She said the turning point came on a run she went on after reading one particularly hurtful article, calling her a quitter and gold digger, claiming she only raced for money.

"I headed out for a run and I couldn't do it and I sat down on a log on the trail, sobbing. And then I just had a moment of realization which was just, 'This is stupid. This is what I love doing, it's been taken away from me by what other people think and they're not even correct,'" she said.

She went on to win the New York marathon later that year. The following year, she set a new all-women marathon world record and then won a gold medal at the World Championships.

Morikawa, who is half Japanese, became the first man to win both the PGA Championship and the Open on his tournament debuts having won his maiden major last year.

And now he is in Japan for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as part of a four-man Team USA delegation, looking to win the country's first ever Olympic gold medal in men's single golf.

After finishing in the top 15 of the Olympic Golf Ranking at the close of the qualification period, Morikawa joined Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele and Bryson DeChambeau in receiving the honor of representing the US at the Summer Games.

Unfortunately for 2020 US Open winner DeChambeau, he has been forced to withdraw after testing positive for Covid-19. He has since been replaced by 2018 Masters winner Patrick Reed.

Just over two years ago, Morikawa was ranked 1,039th in the world having finished tied for 14th at the RBC Canadian Open in June 2019. Now, he is a two-time major winner heading to the Olympics.

And he says he's ready to soak everything up while in Japan.

"(His excitement) is through the roof to really think about where I was two years ago as an amateur and where I am now in the world, everything I've done so far," he told CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue.

"It's crazy to think that I have this opportunity, but it's something that I'm never going to take for granted. No one's going to be able to take it away from me and to be representing Team USA, it's one of the biggest honors really."

Morikawa practices ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games golf competition.

Playing for his country

While Morikawa is making his first appearance for Team USA, it is not his first time playing as part of a team in a golf tournament.

During his amateur career, the 24-year-old participated in team formats at the Arnold Palmer Cup, the Walker Cup and the Eisenhower Trophy.

But competing at the Olympics as part of Team USA is going to "top all of that by a million times" because of the Games' global appeal, according to the world No. 3.

"For golf, we're such an individual sport. And even though the Olympics -- yeah, we're playing individually, and we're making ourselves trying to win gold or whatever. You're playing for your country and those were the best memories I made as an amateur," he said.

"And this is just going to top all of that by a million times because it's on a professional stage, it's worldwide. So really anytime you wear USA on your sleeve or your chest or wherever it may be, it's something that, it's always going to be with you."

When the golf competition kicks off on Thursday, July 29, at Kasumigaseki Country Club, Morikawa will be suiting up alongside three of the top-12 ranked golfers in the world.

As well as describing having "chills" when pulling on a jersey with the US flag embossed on it, the high caliber of the selected players -- and the players that missed out -- showcases the strength of American golf at the moment.

"I think it shows the strength of young golf and a lot of young players right now. But we all want to beat up on each other. I think we try and do that. I haven't really talked to them since we've all made the team, but I know everyone's excited to be on that team.

"You can't be on the team and not be excited to represent Team USA because I think you ask any player that's ever represented their country -- wherever they're from -- it's the biggest honor, especially since we play such an individual sport, when we're able to be on a team, um, it means that much more to us."

Familiarity

For Morikawa, coming to play in Japan will be a special honor given his Japanese heritage.

Although his Japanese relatives have moved to the US, being half Japanese and having a Japanese surname "definitely resonates with a lot of people" in the country, says the two-time major winner.

"It's cool to see people just somehow relate and see me: yes, I'm an American, but yes, I'm an Asian-American. And just see opportunities and hope that people that look like me could have this opportunity to go out and make an Olympic team."

He recalls first making the trip to Japan with his family in 2017 when he was in college, falling in love with the people and culture in the process.

However, being a self-confessed foodie, it was the cuisine that really grabbed Morikawa and is one of the main things he's looking forward to in Tokyo.

"I could eat sushi all day," he gushed. "When we played the ZOZO Championship (in October 2020), I remember we were in this little town around the airport, and I think every player went to this one sushi spot in it and hands down, it's probably one of my favorite places I've ever been to.

"Definitely, something I look forward to," he added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The 24-year-old came into the final day of the major a shot behind Louis Oosthuizen, but a run of three straight birdies on the back nine helped propel the American past the South African, who had topped the leaderboard over the tournament's previous three days.

Morikawa produced some steady and brilliant golf at Royal St George's in Kent, UK, to hold off the persistent challenges of Spieth, Oosthuizen and Jon Rahm and finish 15-under par on what was an enthralling day of golf at the famous major.

In his first appearance at the British major, Morikawa became the first man to win both the PGA Championship and the Open on his debut at the tournaments.

Just over two years ago, Morikawa was ranked 1,039th in the world having finished tied for 14th at the RBC Canadian Open in June 2019. Now he is a two-time major winner.

Afterwards, Morikawa said he's not done winning majors yet.

"At 24 years old, it's so hard to look back at the two short years that I have been a pro and see what I've done because I want more. I enjoy these moments and I love it, and I want to teach myself to embrace it a little more, maybe spend a few extra days and sit back and drink out of this," he told the media.

"But I just want more. When you're in these moments and you truly love what you do, which I love playing golf and competing against these guys, these are the best moments ever because the nerves push you to just be a better person."

Morikawa celebrates with the Claret Jug on the 18th green after winning the Open.

Looking assured

Heading into the final day of action, it was almost impossible to pick a winner between Oosthuizen, Morikawa and Spieth.

Despite having a shot advantage, Oosthuizen has developed an unfortunate habit of failing at the last hurdle over recent years. And so it proved, with two bogeys on the front nine dropping the South African down the leaderboard.

Morikawa pounced to take advantage, coming up with three straight birdies to close out the back nine that gave him a four-shot lead before moments later, a birdie from Spieth reduced the gap to three.

It was never plane sailing for the American.

If overnight leader Oosthuizen faded over the final 18 holes, three-time major winner Spieth looked back to his best as he made a run at the top of the leaderboard.

The 27-year-old American's putter was red hot and his chipping clever as he recovered from some early set backs to put some pressure on Morikawa.

Oosthuizen did produce one moment of magic, hitting the flag on the tough par-three 11th hole, just millimeters from a memorable hole-in-one.

Meanwhile, reigning US Open champion Rahm was putting together his own push for the coveted Claret Jug.

An eagle on the 7th hole and a run of four straight birdies on the back nine shot him up the leaderboard and had the 26-year-old Spaniard dreaming of a second successive major.

But Morikawa was unfazed. Despite his youthfulness and relative lack of experience at majors -- he's only played in seven before this weekend -- Morikawa calmly saw off his rivals.

Morikawa celebrates after a putt on the 14th green during his final round of the Open.

He kept his driving accurate, his iron shots precise and his putting crisp as he dealt with every challenge the tricky Royal St George's course could offer.

And under the blinding English sun as the UK experienced a mini-heatwave, Morikawa was able to tap home the historic putt on the 18th hole to be crowned the 149th Open champion.

The American is the first player to win the Open on his debut since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.

Morikawa also became the second player to win the Open and the PGA Championship before the age of 25 -- the only other golfer to have achieved that feat is Tiger Woods.

After sinking the winning putt, he said that even though he may have outwardly looked calm, his nerves were jangling.

"I'm glad I look calm because the nerves are definitely up there. But you channel these nerves into excitement and energy, and that puts you away from like a fear factor into this is something I want.

"Especially as those last nine holes were coming in. Jordan was making birdies; I think Rahm was pushing; Louis had a birdie on 11, an amazing birdie. You can't worry about the score. I had to worry about every shot. Can I execute every shot to the best of my ability? Some we did, some we didn't, and then you move on. We can't control what's going to happen, what has happened. So I really looked at that as just focus on every shot, how do I see what is the best shot possible, and try and do my best from there."

Morikawa plays a shot on the 10th hole from the rough during the final round of the Open.

Close but not enough

For Morikawa's rivals, it was a case of close, but no cigar.

Oosthuizen, who won the Open in 2010, has now finished runner-up or tied second at six different majors.

And this week, despite finishing atop the leaderboard for three quarters of the Open, he faded in the final round yet again. For one of the most liked players in golf, it was heartbreak yet again as the South African finished tied for third.

As for Spieth, who was searching for his first major victory since 2017 after a long spell with some struggles, the American showed that he is a force to be reckoned with again.

Spieth was magnificent in all aspects of his game, carving up the course as he put pressure on his compatriot Morikawa.

Spieth reacts on the green of the 18th hole on day four of the Open.

However, Spieth believes it was his putting that eventually let him down.

"My putting is not where I want to be at all. I say at all," he told the media afterwards. "It's progressing the right direction, but it's not where it has been.

"And I know what needs to do to get there, and it's just very difficult to do. But it's rounds like today or this week, major championship rounds, where you have to obviously test not only your touch out here, but also a lot of knobs and breaking putts and trust lines.

"I just wasn't extremely sharp with the putter this week. I was sharper than I was at Augusta, and it's been a little bit kind of here and there this year. My bad weeks have been okay and my good weeks are really good, but I needed to put in a little bit of work trying to almost get a solid couple hundred to 500 putts in between yesterday's finish to today's round to think that I could go out and confidently go stroke enough to win."

It wasn't quite enough on Sunday as Morikawa was able to hold on to be crowned The Champion Golfer of the Year.

As a result of the win, Morikawa moves to No. 1 in the FedExCup and No. 3 in the world rankings.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Most people can't wait to head to the coast and sample the delights of the sun, sea, sand and an ice cream or two.

After an excellent first round at the 2021 Open, Jordan Spieth was relishing the chance he has to test himself at the Royal St George's course in Kent, UK.

While Spieth once again showcased his abilities on the links course on Saturday, it was overnight leader Louis Oosthuizen who came out on top at the end of the day, a crucial birdie on the 16th hole giving him a one-shot lead over second-placed Collin Morikawa heading into the final 18 holes on Sunday.

Other golfers are less convinced by the delights of playing golf by the sea.

"It's not my favorite venue that we've played. There are quite a few blind tee shots, hitting to nothing, fairways that are quite undulating," said four-time major winner Brooks Koepka in his pre-tournament press conference.

Koepka plays his second shot on the 1st hole.

Links golf is a harsh, unique style of course which can punish you for the slightest mistake, but a bit like that ice cream by the sea, when you game comes together and you get things right, life just seems to taste that little bit sweeter.

Often built on sand dunes, links courses tend to have little vegetation except tall, thick grass which makes up an unforgiving rough for players.

Between the long, dense rough and the strong sea wind, the most minute mistake can lead to calamity, with countless players' tournament hopes coming to a crashing end over the years.

PGA Championship winner Phil Mickelson thought he "was playing well coming into" this year's Open having only recently become golf's oldest ever major winner.

Mickelson plays a shot from the rough on the 12th hole at Royal St George's.

However, in Thursday's opening round, the 50-year-old Mickelson finished in joint last place of the 156-man field after shooting a 10-over-par 80.

Despite carding arespectable two-over par score on Friday, Mickelson struggled consistently with his driving, constantly having to play out of the thick rough. He missed the cut on Friday and was therefore ruled out of playing the Open's last two rounds.

The six-time major winner admitted after his round on Friday that he was having some "challenges staying sharp."

The "bomb and gauge" technique adapted by fellow American, Bryson DeChambeau -- one which has brought him his maiden major victory and shot him up the golf rankings -- was also challenged by Royal St George's.

The 26-year-old DeChambeau admitted his driver "sucked" on Thursday and his waywardness with the club meant he only made the cut by the skin of his teeth, and his struggles continued on Saturday.

Louis Oosthuizen plays an approach shot on the 16th hole during day two of The Open at Royal St George's.

Adapting

The Open's leaders after the first two rounds -- Oosthuizen, Morikawa and Spieth -- have used their skills with their irons rather than relying on their drivers and it has paid dividends.

All three players have made over 77% of the greens over the first 36-holes of the tournament as they mitigated the dangers and traps of the links course.

With an Open already to his name, Spieth looks looks like a kid excitedly queuing for an ice cream as he showcases some different skills here in the UK than he might on the PGA Tour.

"It brings a lot of the feel aspect into the game," he told the media after his first round. "I shorten swings up over here, and hit more punch shots, and stuff that I probably should be doing at home. You get less swing-focused and more shot-focused over here because the second you take your brain off the shot you're hitting, you may not find your ball.

"Instead of just a driving-range shot in Palm Springs, there's always some shot you have to play that gives you a little bit of an advantage. Certain club selections, based on if you hit a fade or a draw, they go 15 or 20 yards different distances. To sum that up, there's just a lot of external factors over here, and I think that external is where I need to be living."

Spieth plays his second shot on the 7th hole at Royal St George's.

The second-round heroics of Morikawa -- seeking to become the first man to win both the PGA Championship and the Open on his debut -- was mostly on the back of his wizardry with his irons; his dead-eye accuracy negating the natural complications the links course offers up.

It's yet to be seen whether Spieth or Morikawa can overcome the lead Oosthuizen held at the start of Saturday, but all three men are testament that to conquer a links golf course, a golfer needs to have all the tools in the tool bag.

The question now is who will be celebrating with the Claret Jug -- the Open trophy -- and who knows, maybe even a gelato, come Sunday?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) As he bid a tearful farewell to Barcelona on Sunday, football superstar Lionel Messi said a move to Paris Saint-Germain was "a possibility."

It's been widely reported that Messi has been offered a two-year contract by PSG, though the 34-year-old Argentine said no arrangements had been made with the Parisian giant, nor with any of the other interested clubs regarding his next move.

PSG did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Speaking at a media conference in Barcelona, a very emotional Messi entered the room to applause from those in attendance and delivered his final speech as a Blaugrana player, describing it as one of the most difficult moments of his career.

"In these days, in this last day I have been thinking ... to see what I was going to say, what I could say," said Messi.

"The truth is that nothing came out, I was blocked as I am still now. It is very difficult for me after so many years, after making my whole life here. I was not prepared for this."

Lionel Messi is reduced to tears during his farewell press conference at the Camp Nou stadium.

The six-time Ballon d'Or winner is leaving Barcelona, having arrived from Argentina at the age of 13.

"Today I have to say goodbye to this, as I said before, it was many years, all my life here. After 21 years I'm going with my wife and three Argentine Catalans. I cannot be prouder of everything I did and lived in this city, which I have no doubt that after being away for a few years we will return because it is our home, because that is how I promised my children too," Messi added.

Lionel "Leo" Messi reflects on his 21 years at Barcelona.

Messi is Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer for the club -- finding the net on 682 occasions -- and has won numerous major collective and individual awards, including four Champions League titles and 10 La Liga titles.

"I gave my all for this club for this shirt, from the first day I arrived to the last. And the truth is that I am more than satisfied. I would have liked to say goodbye in a different way. I never imagined my farewell this way," Messi said.

He continued: "I would have liked to do it with people, in the field, to be able to hear one last ovation from them, one last affection. I missed them a lot during all this time of pandemic which we could not play with the public. I missed that being able to have them close, the encouragement, celebrating a goal with them, let them call my name."

Fans gathered outside the Camp Nou stadium where Lionel Messi held his press conference in Barcelona.

While both club and Messi had reached an agreement over a new contract, Barcelona's dire financial situation and La Liga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations meant it couldn't be signed.

On Friday, Barcelona President Joan Laporta said "renewing Messi carried certain risks [...] but we cannot put the club at greater risk," Laporta told reporters.

"You have to put feelings aside, you have to look at numbers with a cold head. We wanted La Liga to be more flexible, but this is no excuse. We knew the rules and what we have been left with from the previous board makes it all impossible.

"The club is above everything, even the best player in the world," added Laporta.

During Sunday's Q&A session with the media, Messi was asked to comment on the tension around his departure and if Barcelona had done everything within their means to keep their star player for the upcoming season.

"What is clear to me is that I did everything that was possible to stay, the club, Laporta, said that it was not possible due to a La Liga issue, but I heard many things that were said about me, about why I didn't continue, but I can assure you that I did everything possible to stay," said Messi.

"Last year I didn't want to stay and I also said so, but this year I did want to stay and it was not possible," added Messi.

The Italian soccer club sparked outrage on Thursday after it tweeted a photo showing defender Cecilia Salvai using her fingers to pull her eyes back while wearing a red training cone on her head.

The post also included emojis that mimicked the eye-pulling gesture.

The photograph was swiftly taken down but not before it prompted a ferocious backlash and accusations of "blatant racism" from the online community.

"We sincerely apologize that our tweet, which was not meant to cause controversy or have any racial undertones, may have offended anyone," the club said in a statement published on its official Twitter account shortly after the post was taken down.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Roger Federer, the four-time Olympian and all-time great tennis champion, announced Tuesday that he would not represent Switzerland in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, saying that a recent setback with his knee forced the decision.

The 39-year-old underwent two knee operations in 2020.

"I am greatly disappointed, as it has been an honor and highlight of my career each time I have represented Switzerland," Federer wrote in a statement. "I have already begun rehabilitation in the hopes of returning to the tour later this summer."

Federer, a 20-time grand slam champion, competed in each Olympics between 2000 and 2012, winning men's doubles gold in Beijing in 2008 and men's singles silver in London in 2012. He missed the 2016 Olympics due to a knee injury.

He most recently played at Wimbledon where he was knocked out of the tournament in the quarterfinals. He last won a grand slam tournament in January 2018 at the Australian Open.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty has two things on her mind right now: the Wimbledon championships and the prospect of her first Olympic Games .

Three weeks since she was forced to retire from the French Open, where she won her first and only grand slam in 2019, Barty is back on the court having weathered what she calls a period of "slow rehab."

It's been more than 40 years since Evonne Goolagong won at Wimbledon -- the last Australian woman to do so -- while Alicia Molik is the only Australian to medal in the singles competition at the Olympics.

Were Barty, who has won 11 titles, to win either competition, it would be a momentous milestone in her career.

"Every child growing up, every athlete whose sport or code is in the Olympics dares to dream (of winning gold)," the 25-year-old tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

"I think that's a massive part of being an athlete. It's a massive part of sport."

Barty is returning from injury having been forced to retire from the French Open earlier this month.

Of particular inspiration to Barty is Cathy Freeman, the Australian 400m runner who lit up the Sydney Olympics in 2000 when she raced to gold.

"In Australia, the nation stopped, the world stopped during her race," says Barty.

"I've spoken to her a little bit about her experiences and we share mentors. For me to learn of her experiences has been really special.

"But to also hear them as a friend is really cool, just to know what she went through in her career and her different challenges and the things that she loved. Being able to learn from Cathy is the best of the best, and I was certainly very lucky."

Team spirit

With a ban on international spectators at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics , Barty won't have the same level of fervent support that Australian fans usually bring to sporting events, but she nevertheless hopes to draw motivation from her fellow teammates.

"We have such a rich history of Australian Olympians being really successful, and I think it's not always just about the success: it's about the team coming together and uniting as one," she says.

"I think the camaraderie you see in the Aussie teams are remarkable, I don't think anyone quite understands that feeling that you do have. I've had a very small taste of it in Fed Cup and a few different Australian teams, but nothing quite like an Australian Olympic team."

As for Wimbledon, which gets underway on Monday having been canceled amid the pandemic last year, Barty will be hoping to progress beyond the round of 16 for the first time at this year's competition.

Barty hits a return against Harriet Dart at Wimbledon in 2019.

Having triumphed there as a junior in 2011, the grass court grand slam is a tournament she holds dear -- as well as being her favored surface.

"Just walking into the All England Club again, it gives you goosebumps," says Barty, an ambassador for Jaguar, a sponsor of Wimbledon.

"And every single time that you walk into the gates, you're wowed. It's one of the most incredible places on Earth and certainly one of my favorites to come back to."

'The best version of myself'

Absent from the women's draw at Wimbledon this year will be Naomi Osaka , who announced she would skip the tournament having withdrawn from the French Open earlier this month.

It came after Osaka, a four-time grand slam winner, declined to speak to the media at Roland-Garros, saying at the time that she had "suffered long bouts of depression" since winning her first major title in 2018 and wanted to look after her mental health.

For her own part, Barty says that she sees the media as "part and parcel" of the job, although also acknowledges that the process isn't without its difficulties.

"Our sport certainly wouldn't be where it is without the media and without being able to share our thoughts," she says.

"Of course, at times it's challenging. I'll never hide behind that fact that some of my hardest moments have been going into press rooms. But that's OK. I think it's also not the be all and end all.

"I'm trying to do the best that I can to be a tennis player and go out there and be the best version of myself and just be my authentic self. I feel like I have nothing to hide.

"I can't comment for how Naomi's feeling. She's got a completely different career to me, everyone has their own unique challenges and their own unique story ... I hope that she's got a support network around her, that she's talking to who she needs to."

Having enjoyed a stellar junior career, Barty took a break from tennis in 2014, later saying that the sport had become "robotic" and that she was a "victim of my own success."

She turned to cricket and earned a contract as an all-rounder with Brisbane Heat back in Australia, before returning to tennis in 2016.

"It was my decision. I'm accountable for all my decisions in my life and my career," Barty says of her time away from the sport.

"I certainly can't say that that would work for everyone, but it worked for me."

After a nervy start, Djokovic recovered to win 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-4 6-3 against his Italian opponent and clinch his sixth Wimbledon title.

Having already won the Australian Open and French Open this year, he needs the Olympic gold medal and US Open title to become the first man to ever win a Golden Slam.

"That was more than a battle. I'd first like to extend my congratulations to Matteo, his family and his team for a fantastic tournament. It was a tough match today," Djokovic said in his on-court interview. "From a 7-year-old boy in Serbia constructing a Wimbledon tennis trophy from improvised materials I found in my room to standing here today with my sixth Wimbledon. It's incredible."

"After a thorough investigation that included calls, emails and video clips from concerned fans, media and broadcast partners, the Colorado Rockies have concluded that the fan was indeed yelling for Rockies mascot Dinger in hopes of getting his attention for a photo, and there was never any racial slur that occurred," the team said in a statement.

On Sunday, the Rockies said the organization was "disgusted at the racial slur by a fan directed at the Marlins' Lewis Brinson during the ninth inning" of Sunday's game. Brinson, who is Black, was batting at the time when television broadcasts picked up audio of the fan.

"The Rockies remain dedicated to providing an inclusive environment for all fans, players and guests at Coors Field, and any fan using derogatory language of any kind will be ejected from Coors Field," the statement said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The NFL's Kansas City Chiefs won't be changing the team's nickname anytime soon, but are retiring their horse mascot named "Warpaint," according to organization president Mark Donovan.

His comments came after MLB's Cleveland Indians announced Friday they would become the Cleveland Guardians next year.

The Indians will join the NFL's Washington Football Team , formerly the Washington Redskins, in moving on in recent years from a name evoking Native Americans.

But the Chiefs, like the MLB's Atlanta Braves , don't plan a name change.

"We have a really good American Indian working group that provides us real guidance and feedback and perspective on this issue," Donovan said Monday at a news conference.

He said Cleveland's recent decision doesn't change Kansas City's approach.

"We're going to continue to create opportunities to educate, create awareness and work exactly as we have over the past eight years now with the working group," he said.

One difference fans will notice at Arrowhead Stadium next season is the absence of Kansas City's horse mascot Warpaint.

"A lot of reasons for that, but we just feel like it's the right thing to do," Donovan said.

Since 2009, the sorrel tobiano mare has been a fixture at Chiefs home games.

The Warpaint tradition was reintroduced as part of the team's 50th anniversary season after a 20-year hiatus. In earlier iterations, Warpaint had been mounted by a rider dressed in traditional Native American headdress and garb.

In August 2020, the Chiefs banned fans from wearing ceremonial headdresses and Native American-style face paint in the team's stadium.

The team still allows fans to do a cheer called the tomahawk chop. There is also a pregame tradition of beating a drum.

The Chiefs are named for former Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle , a White man who impersonated Native American culture.

Before becoming mayor, Bartle was actively involved in leadership of the Boy Scouts of America. In 1925, he created the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a scouting organization that drew on Native American heritage and customs.

Bartle was not a Native American, but claimed he was "inducted into a local tribute of the Arapaho people," according to Mohawk journalist Vincent Schilling . Bartle was called "Lone Bear," and later came to be colloquially known as "Chief."

Nearly 40 years later, Bartle served two terms as mayor of Kansas City and helped bring the Dallas Texans football team there. The team was eventually renamed the Chiefs in Bartle's honor.

The Chiefs' first preseason home game is August 27.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Max Verstappen is currently navigating uncharted waters -- not that you would be able to tell.

For the first time in his short, but action-packed Formula One career, the Dutch sensation is leading the drivers' championship

Despite the chance of achieving his childhood dream of winning a world title being a real possibility this season, Verstappen is taking everything in his stride.

There is a certain pressure that comes with being the championship leader, in particular when you have seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton breathing down your neck, but it's not a pressure that Verstappen seems to be feeling.

"It doesn't make any difference to be honest," the Red Bull driver matter-of-factly tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. "We always wanted to be here and now that we have a very competitive package, we are just very happy that it's happening and now we just have to keep it up.

"I mean, it's still a very long season, we're not even halfway. Of course the gap at the moment looks nice, probably on paper, but also it's very easily gone. So we just have to make sure that we don't make mistakes and stay on top of it.

"I never really look at these things. At the end of the day, they don't really make a big difference in terms of how I feel about it."

Max Verstappen celebrates his win at the Austrian Grand Prix.

Still only 23 years of age, it's a testament to Verstappen's mental strength that he has been able to win each of the last three races after his mishap at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which saw him spin out down the main straight due to tire failure just five laps from the end.

It was a quite brilliant drive at the Monaco Grand Prix back in May that saw Verstappen take the lead in the drivers' championship for the first time and his performances have only improved since, allowing him to open up a 32-point gap over Hamilton.

But as Azerbaijan has no doubt taught him, all that hard work could come undone in an instant.

"I'm not enjoying it at the moment to be honest, not more than what I would be doing the last few years," Verstappen says. "Because I know that it doesn't say anything at the moment.

"I want to be there at the last race and finish it off in that way, because of course you can be happy right now, but then if you lose out at the end of the year, then there's nothing to be happy about.

"So that's why I'm quite neutral in everything and I'm just very focused on what I have to do."

Nobody has ever doubted Verstappen's championship-winning credentials as a driver, so far in his six-year career the common consensus has been that it's the Red Bull car that has let him down.

This season, however, that looks to have changed.

Red Bull, headed up by team principal Christian Horner, has made dramatic improvement's on last year's car and have finally provided Verstappen with a vehicle capable of challenging Hamilton and Mercedes.

Verstappen believes the team's dominance at tracks they haven't generally performed well at in the past -- France, for example, where the Dutch driver this season secured pole and the race win -- will stand them in good stead for the upcoming British Grand Prix, where Hamilton and Mercedes have dominated in recent years.

"The team, including Christian, they focus on giving me that car, which they have given me this year and now we're just working really well together," says Verstappen.

"I think we really made a good step forward from last year and now it's all about keeping that up [and] improving, because we cannot just rely on what we have now until the end of the season. We just have to keep trying to be better.

"You have to be positive as well, but we know that they [Mercedes] are going to be very strong there [Silverstone], they are bringing upgrades so it's not going to be easy. I'm confident that we can do a good job here as well."

This weekend's British GP will be the first of three races this season to feature a brand new qualifying format.

The usual one-hour qualifying session will still feature, but it will only decide the starting positions for the sprint qualifying session, rather than the race itself.

Max Verstappen kicks his tire after crashing out in Azerbaijan.

It will be this new sprint qualifying session, a 100 kilometer, 17-lap race, that will decide how the drivers line up for Sunday's grand prix.

Points that count towards to drivers' championship total will also be awarded to the top three drivers in sprint qualifying, with three for first place, two for second and one for third.

"I'm actually quite open-minded," Verstappen says of the new format. "I'm not against it, I'm not for it at the moment. I just want to see how it progresses. It's very new.

"For sure it will be a bit of an adjustment to be made in terms of how you approach the whole weekend. But I guess time will tell, we'll just find out how it goes.

"It's difficult to say right now [if it will impact the race]. After FP1 [first practice], you make your changes for qualifying and you can't really adjust the car anymore, so you hope that you make the right changes.

"So you will find out a little bit during the sprint race or qualifying race if it's good or not -- and if it's not good, then you're in trouble."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Split-second decision making, relentless focus and courage are just some of the attributes any Formula One driver needs.

Charles Leclerc first stepped into a kart when he was four years old, and was hooked by the thrill of speed after he had his first lesson with his godfather and French racing driver Jules Bianchi.

But the financial support required for motorsport racing was an extra barrier, and as the years progressed, his family weren't able to afford the cost of competing. That's when manager Nicolas Todt stepped in, taking on Leclerc in 2012 and paying for his next season.

As Leclerc made his way, Bianchi endured a fatal crash in 2014 at the Japanese GP , spent nine months in a coma, and passed away the following year. Tragically, Leclerc's father died in 2017, two experiences that the F1 star told the Guardian were "incredibly hard," but made him "stronger as a person and as a driver."

Charles Leclerc prepares to drive on the grid ahead of the Styria Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring on June 27, 2021 in Spielberg, Austria.

A family affair

These days, the 23-year-old driver has a watchful eye on younger brother Arthur Leclerc, an up-and-coming racer three years his junior, who recently joined the Ferrari Driver Academy and clinched his maiden F3 victory at Circuit Paul Ricard.

"I'm just very, very happy to see him doing so, so well," Leclerc tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies . "I really hope that he will be joining me on the Formula One grid very soon, but it's still a long way to go."

Even though Leclerc celebrates his brother's success, his protective instincts trump his ability to fully embrace his pursuit of the sport.

"I'm 10 times more stressed whenever it's him racing compared to when I am racing, because when I have the helmet on, I don't think about the danger of the sport," he says.

"But whenever I see him from the outside, I start to think about all the bad scenarios that can happen," he adds.

Ultimately, the foundation of their relationship lies off the track. "Whenever he needs help, he knows that I'm here for him and he can call me anytime [...] but most of the time, we are just speaking about our lives, just like normal brothers will do."

Charles Leclerc celebrates after his brother, Arthur Leclerc, won the F4 race before the F1 Grand Prix of Germany at Hockenheimring on July 28, 2019 in Hockenheim, Germany.

Growing up in Monaco

Leclerc was born and raised in Monte Carlo in Monaco , which is known for its cobbled streets, twinkling harbors and shiny white yachts.

He's one of the 10,000 locals in the country, and comes from more humble beginnings than the majority of the population, many of whom are millionaires attracted to the French Riviera city state's tax status.

The racing star isn't jaded by the opulence, instead presenting a sense of gratitude and humility. "From outside, I don't think it gives the same image as the image I have of my own city."

"I have all my friends, all of my family, and there's not all these glamorous parts of it, this party side. Of course, there's also this side of Monaco, but I don't feel it when I'm there, it's more relaxing."

For Leclerc, beneath the gilded veneer lies a rich history of fabled racers and spectacular circuits -- most notably, the Monaco Grand Prix

Known for its tight and twisty layout, the circuit has been a technically-challenging contest ever since it first appeared on the F1 calendar in 1950. Past victors include legends of the sport such as Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher and Graham Hill.

Leclerc says his upbringing in Monaco was key to his F1 career because he learned the merit of working hard and respecting others. "These two values are probably the most important."

"Monaco has given me most of the values that I try to share in Formula One. I'm just very, very proud and very happy to be born there."

Learning from fellow athletes

As someone who wants to reach the peak of his sport, Leclerc says he admires fellow athletes who can show their ability to excel, including Juventus and Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ronaldo, who recently equaled the all-time international goalscoring record at Euro 2020, met Leclerc when he visited Ferrari's famous Maranello headquarters in May.

"He gave us some tips [...] as an athlete. The way he prepares himself, et cetera, which was very, very interesting," Leclerc says.

"Then we had some fun driving some cars. But we didn't talk too much about work, it was more about having fun."

When asked if Ronaldo was unfazed during his ride, Leclerc laughs. "Yeah, well, brave, I wouldn't go that far, but I am sure that he enjoyed it. I think he was quite impressed by how much those cars are going fast."

Nonetheless, he has a deep level of respect for the global icon. "He's a legend of football, but not only (that). I think for every athlete, we are all very impressed by him [...] he's an amazing athlete."

Fighting for the win

Leclerc is cautiously optimistic about his prospects for the rest of the season, recognizing that Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen are the two competitors most in contention for topping the standings in 2021.

"I'm not frustrated, but I want to be back in the fight with the top guys like we were in 2019. So there's a lot of motivation for the whole team because we don't want Ferrari to be fighting for fifth or sixth place," he says.

"But on the other hand, it's very good to finally see a fight between two teams for a world title. I think people are enjoying it."

He's not wrong. Fans and neutrals alike are relishing the battle between the teams, a dynamic Leclerc will no doubt see play out at the British Grand Prix in Silverstone. Taking place on Sunday, July 18, the race is scheduled to be held in front of a capacity crowd

Having been staged behind closed doors in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, Leclerc is looking forward to the return of spectators at the event.

"It's amazing to finally see life getting back to normal a little bit. It's been a long time and it's great to feel the passion of the fans," he says.

"I don't know how much will be involved with the fans and how close we will be to them because of the bubble we are in. But we at least feel the support in the grandstand to see them while we are driving feels amazing."

The future of Ferrari

Ferrari recorded its worst season in 40 years in 2020 and the current campaign sees the team fourth in the constructors' championship. Leclerc is sixth in the drivers' championship on 60 points, with teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. on 62 points.

"We are more or less the same age, we have the same interests, we play the same sports," he says. "We are having good moments, but we are also working very well together with the team in hard moments [...] to try and come together."

Leclerc says Ferrari is focused on looking ahead to the 2022 season with the promise of a new car, while still "trying to to work as hard as possible" between races.

Carlos Sainz and Leclerc talk on the grid ahead of the Styrian Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring on June 27, 2021 in Spielberg, Austria.

The 2022 season sees the introduction of new rules which will " create radically different looking cars, capable of harder, closer racing ," according to F1.

"A lot of the guys at home are focusing on the 2022 car, which will be a huge opportunity for us, but which will be very, very important for the years after it, because it's a completely new car," Leclerc says.

"And so there's also part of the team that is still focusing on this year [...] so it's a fine balance.

"It's small steps in the right direction, but it's going in the right direction, which is very, very important."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Lewis Hamilton was the target of online racist abuse after winning his eighth British Grand Prix on Sunday.

The seven-time world champion fought back from a 10-second penalty to clinch victory following a controversial collision with rival Max Verstappen , which left the Red Bull driver in hospital.

Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said it had removed a number of comments from its platform in relation to Hamilton, who has been a huge advocate for diversity and the Black Lives Matter movement, and called the abuse "unacceptable."

"In addition to our work to remove comments and accounts that repeatedly break our rules, there are safety features available, including Comment Filters and Message Controls, which can mean no one has to see this type of abuse," a Facebook company spokesperson told CNN Sport.

"No single thing will fix this challenge overnight but we're committed to the work to keep our community safe from abuse."

Meanwhile, Twitter said that racist behavior "has no place" on its platform and strongly condemned the abuse Hamilton received.

"We have clear abusive behaviour and hateful conduct policies in place and we take enforcement of these policies very seriously," a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Sport.

"We will take decisive and swift action on any account that breaks our rules."

Hamilton's team Mercedes, Formula 1 and the sports' governing body FIA also released a joint statement condemning the racist abuse "in the strongest possible terms."

"These people have no place in our sport and we urge that those responsible should be held accountable for their actions," it read.

"Formula 1, the FIA, the drivers and the teams are working to build a more diverse and inclusive sport, and such unacceptable instances of online abuse must be highlighted and eliminated."

It comes a week after three England players -- Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka -- were subjected to racist abuse after missing penalties during the Euro 2020 final against Italy.

On Monday, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff told BBC Radio 4 that the abuse of his driver was "not acceptable" and promised to "react to it."

"We have seen it in the football in the European Championship and the abuse that is absolutely not acceptable, and the same yesterday, and I still question whether some just don't get it," he added.

Red Bull also released a statement saying it was "disgusted and saddened" by the abuse Hamilton received on social media.

"There is never any excuse for it, there is certainly no place for it in our sport and those responsible should be held accountable," it read.

Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium at Silverstone.

Around 140,000 people watched from a packed out Silverstone as Hamilton and Verstappen collided in a dramatic start to the race.

Hamilton, who was beaten into the first corner by his rival, made a number of attempts to overtake Verstappen on that first lap and when the drivers arrived at Silverstone's Copse Corner, the Briton's front-left wheel touched the Red Bull driver's back-right tire.

Verstappen spun off the track and across the gravel before crashing into the barriers. The Dutchman was taken to hospital but did not suffer any major injuries.

After the race, Verstappen took to social media to express his feelings about Hamilton's "dangerous" driving.

"First of all: I am glad I'm ok. It was quite an impact at 51G but feeling better," he wrote.

"Obviously very disappointed with being taken out like this. The penalty given does not help us in any way and doesn't do justice to the dangerous move Lewis made on track.

"Watching the celebrations after the race while still in hospital is disrespectful and unsportsmanlike behavior but we move on."

The comments were echoed by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who was visibly furious when discussing the incident after the race.

"Lewis [Hamilton] has got more than enough experience to know that is unacceptable," he told Sky Sports.

"I'm just very disappointed that a driver of his caliber should make such a move like that. It's dangerous, it looked desperate."

Hamilton and Max Verstappen take a curve side-by-side at the start of the British Grand Prix.

Hamilton sent his best wishes to Verstappen on social media after the race but said he had raced "fairly."

"Today is a reminder of the dangers in this sport," he wrote on Sunday. "I send my best wishes to Max who is an incredible competitor. I'm glad to hear he is ok. I will always race hard but always fairly.

"My team showed grit and perseverance out there. It's a dream to win in front of my home crowd."

He was backed up by Wolff who described the collision as a racing incident.

"It always takes two to tango and these two are not giving each other an inch and it's a high-speed corner, and that's why these things are nasty to look at," he told Sky Sports.

Race stewards handed Hamilton a 10-second penalty for the incident but the Brit made his way back to the front in a dramatic conclusion, overtaking Charles Leclerc on Copse Corner with just two laps to go.

Hamilton's win gave him 25 points to put him just eight behind Verstappen in the drivers' standings as the rivalry between the two intensified.

All eyes will now be on Hungarian Grand Prix which will take place on August 1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) After winning the men's Olympic marathon at Tokyo 2020, Eliud Kipchoge disarmingly remarked that he'd "wanted to test my fitness" and gauge how he was "feeling."

With around 12 kilometers of the race remaining, Kipchoge pulled clear of the lead pack to cross the line in a time of two hours, eight minutes and 38 seconds -- more than a minute clear of the Netherlands' Abdi Nageeye in second and Belgium's Bashir Abdi in third.

By winning Sunday's race the 36-year-old Kenyan became the third man to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title.

Kipchoge's victory completed a marathon double for Kenya after Peres Jepchirchir's gold in the women's race the day before. He also follows in the footsteps of Ethiopia's Abebe Bikila and East Germany's Waldemar Cierpinski as a back-to-back Olympic marathon champion.

"I wanted to create a space (between the other runners) to show the world that this is a beautiful race," the 36-year-old Kipchoge later said. "I wanted to show that we have hope in the future."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Essential Quality, trained by Brad Cox and ridden by jockey Luis Saez, won the 153rd running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York.

The horse was the early betting favorite to win the 1.5-mile race and finished ahead of Hot Rod Charlie and the 146th Preakness Stakes winner Rombauer, who finished in second and third place, respectively.

Hot Rod Charlie was the early leader but Essential Quality passed him in the final turn and held on down the stretch to win. The win gave trainer Brad Cox his first Triple Crown victory.

A limited crowd of 11,000 were allowed to attend the "Test of the Champion" with proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test required for entry.

Jockey Luis Saez reacts after winning the 153rd running of the Belmont Stakes atop Essential Quality on Saturday, June 5.

This year's race did not include Medina Spirit, the Kentucky Derby winner, after the horse failed a post-Derby drug test. In May, the New York Racing Association temporarily suspended Medina Spirit's trainer Bob Baffert from entering any horses in races at the track that is host to the Belmont Stakes.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Additional testing is planned after Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit failed a postrace drug test , throwing the horse's victory at Churchill Downs earlier this month into doubt.

Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert revealed the test results Sunday, saying the 3-year-old colt tested positive for elevated levels of betamethasone, which is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid and sometimes used to relieve joint pain in horses.

Betamethasone is allowed in horse racing in certain amounts, but Baffert said he'd been informed Medina Spirit's postrace test detected 21 picograms per milliliter -- more than double the allowed limit in Kentucky within 14 days of a race.

"I feel so bad not only for the horse, you know, but the owner, everybody involved, because this is something that, you know, we didn't do," Baffert told CNN's Carolyn Manno on Monday, adding that he planned not to go to the Preakness Stakes on Saturday.

The test revelation came just over a week after Medina Spirit won the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, beating second-place Mandaloun by half a length. The win delivered Baffert a record seventh Derby victory.

A split sample from Medina Spirit's postrace blood sample will now be tested, and if the original results are confirmed, Baffert will have a chance to appeal.

The time frame for receiving the results from a requested split sample averages four to eight weeks, but could take up to six months, according to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.

Trainer suspended

In the meantime, Churchill Downs said it had "immediately suspended" Baffert "from entering any horses at Churchill Downs Racetrack."

"Failure to comply with the rules and medication protocols jeopardizes the safety of the horses and jockeys, the integrity of our sport and the reputation of the Kentucky Derby and all who participate," Churchill Downs said in a statement Sunday.

"We will await the conclusion of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission's investigation before taking further steps."

Baffert denied Medina Spirit, who trained and raced in California before the Derby, has ever been treated with betamethasone and said his team will conduct its own investigation.

"The testing is it's been really tough everywhere we go in California, and that's why we have all these rules now that, there's a lot of transparency," he said. "They know everything we give them and we have to write it down, we turn it in. So they know every medication this horse has gotten and betamethasone is not one of them.

"And that's the troubling part of it. He wasn't administered that drug."

He said he has no idea how the drug ended up in the horse's system.

Preakness in doubt

Horse race enthusiasts are keeping an eye on how this will impact Saturday's Preakness Stakes. The race at Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course is the second leg of horse racing's Triple Crown.

Organizers said they will "review the relevant facts and information" related to Medina Spirit's positive blood test and are consulting with the Maryland Racing Commission on any decision regarding the horse's entry in the Preakness Stakes.

Baffert told CNN that as of Monday they were prepared to run the horse in Saturday's race and the horse was at the time of the interview being transported from Kentucky to Maryland.

Baffert alleges 'problems in racing'

Bob Baffert talks to reporters before the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in 2019 in Louisville. Baffert was inducted into the sport's Hall of Fame in 2009.

This is not Baffert's first run-in with reports that his horse failed a drug test: Last month, according to multiple reports, including the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette , the Arkansas Racing Commission upheld a ruling that two of Baffert's horses had tested positive for lidocaine beyond the accepted levels. However, the commission dropped a 15-day suspension for Baffert.

Baffert alluded to previous controversies on Sunday -- "I don't feel safe to train," he said -- but cast the allegation about Medina Spirit as an issue with the broader horse racing industry, saying the industry "needs to step up and we need to do a better job in racing."

"I'm not a conspiracy (theorist) -- I know everybody's not out to get me. But there's definitely something wrong. Why is it happening, you know, to me?" he asked. "There's problems in racing, but it's not Bob Baffert."

He told CNN that he knew some people were enjoying him having to deal with negative publicity.

"I've had some success with all these great horses and, you know, there's a lot of people that there's a lot of jealousy and animosity out there," he said. "And I understand that I have my critics. But this is really, you know, when it happens in the most prestigious race in America, the Kentucky Derby, Bob Baffert is not stupid."

In 2009, Baffert was inducted into the sport's Hall of Fame , which puts his number of thoroughbred wins at 3,120, with more than $320 million in purse earnings.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) It was a chance encounter that would change her life forever. In 2017, Nadhira Alharthy met the first Omani man to climb Everest.

Khalid al-Siyabi had summited Everest seven years earlier. He was part of a group of pioneering Omanis who were telling their inspirational stories at an assembly hosted by the Ministry of Education, where Alharthy was working as the director of citizenship at the time.

That evening she made a pledge to replicate al-Siyabi's achievement, using his mentorship as guidance.

"His story, it touched me," she tells CNN Sport. "I was inspired to do something for myself [...] to challenge myself."

Building up her strength

Before training to climb the world's tallest mountain, Alharthy's workout routine extended to going to the gym a few times a week.

She knew she had to dramatically change gears, beginning with strengthening her muscles and improving her resistance. With al-Siyabi's help, her training schedule developed into that of a fully-fledged endurance athlete, consisting of running, hiking, rock climbing, canyoning and caving.

The physical preparation for Everest was challenging, but improving her mental stamina was even harder. "Training the mind [...] it's harder than training our bodies," she says.

In the two years leading up to the climb, the only other person who knew about Alharthy's ambition was al-Siyabi. "We kept it as a secret for a long time," she says.

She wasn't just building up her mental strength for Everest, but also working up the courage to tell her family: "I was scared to tell them because I just decided to go to Everest without any experience."

The endurance athlete says she takes advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain. She recently visited Jabal Akhdar, part of the Al Hajar mountain range in Oman.

'I was very lucky'

In 2019, two months before setting off for Nepal, Alharthy told her family about the expedition.

"They were very surprised and shocked because I never discussed it before. They refused the idea from the beginning. My mom was very stressed and worried about my safety," she says.

Despite their reaction, she was determined to fulfil her ambition. She arrived in Kathmandu flanked by an all-Arab, all-female team -- including Mona Shahab from Saudi Arabia, and Joyce Azzam and Nelly Attar from Lebanon.

She was in constant contact with al-Siyabi until her arrival at base camp, when their line of communication started to dwindle. Her mentor had recently been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke.

"I started feeling worried about him. But I said, 'OK, he will make it, he's strong,'" she says.

A week later Alharthy received the devastating news that al-Siyabi had passed away at the age of 46. She was in shock: "Losing him, it was the hardest time there when I was climbing."

In January 2021, Alharthy became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam, Nepal.

His death gave the expedition a new sense of purpose. Alharthy wasn't just climbing to fulfill her own ambition, she wanted to honor al-Siyabi's memory as well.

"He was the only person who stood with me, he helped me," she says.

"I decided to do it not for myself and not only my country, he would also be part of [...] the climb."

After two months of trekking across snow capped mountains, she found herself atop Everest on May 23, exactly nine years to the day since al-Siyabi's summit. She commemorated her mentor by planting a piece of paper inscribed with his name on the crest of the mountain.

The poetry of their story isn't lost on her, acknowledging that "the first Omani man helped me to be the first Omani woman [to summit Everest]."

She says completing her first summit alongside three other Arab women was what crowned her triumph: "I was very lucky to have them [...] it brought us all together."

Two years later, Alharthy's face still lights up when she revisits her memories of climbing Everest. "It's not like when you buy something, when you try a new meal, when you go shopping," she says. "It was a different type of happiness."

Ama Dablam

While participating in endurance sports, Alharthy has had the chance to connect with fellow mountaineers.

In January, she became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam (22,349 feet) -- a mountain south of Everest -- while climbing alongside Qatari mountaineer Fahad Badar

"I was not planning to go to Ama Dablam from the beginning. Then one of our friends, Fahad [...] he messaged me that he was going," says Alharthy.

"I told him, I'm not as afraid of climbing the mountain as I was afraid of the cold because it's winter season and that's very difficult."

Having unsuccessfully attempted the same climb in 2018, Alharthy was "scared of failing again," but she knew that Badar's moral support, coupled with her training for Everest, would set her in good stead. "I felt that I was prepared."

With an exposed ridge that requires vertical mixed climbing in rock, ice and snow, she acknowledges this was her most grueling trial yet.

She says the technical know-how and full-body strength required to climb Ama Dablam surpassed Everest.

"There is no way for mistakes on Ama Dablam because it's like you are climbing a big wall. We had to be attached on safety ropes all the time," she adds. "If we miss anything, it's very dangerous."

Over the past year, Alharthy hasn't had a chance to plan ahead for expeditions due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, she's been taking advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain -- most recently visiting the country's epic Al Hoota Cave, which is over two million years old and has a total length of almost 2.8 miles.

"I want to use all the chances I have here in Oman to improve myself physically," she says.

Her next goal is to climb one of the 14 mountain peaks across the world that stand taller than 8,000m, dubbed by NASA as the Eight Thousanders.

Finding solidarity through faith

Cementing her status as a record-breaking mountaineer means that Alharthy has attracted waves of media attention over the past few years, but she was never searching for the spotlight.

Even though she relishes the opportunity to develop her physicality and test her resilience, she says that the intense media scrutiny that comes with the job is emotionally draining.

Her limits were tested after Everest. She was having trouble dealing with the emotional comedown of completing such a monumental feat and decided to stop training for a while. "I was feeling depressed," she says. "I felt this pressure on me, it was something I was not looking for."

Alharthy has since found solidarity through her faith.

Alharthy says she hopes her story will inspire young Omanis to participate in endurance sports.

Ahead of her expedition to Ama Dablam, she earned messages of support from her Muslim fans on social media, where she has now amassed over 16,000 followers. She sees their prayers as a form of protection. "Our faith [...] it makes you stand up again. It gives you strength, it gives you power."

Her increased visibility online means that her family is now more accepting of her endeavors. But like any parent, her mother continues to agonize over the safety of her daughter. "For them, it's something very exposed, it's something very unsafe. My mom, she's waiting for me to tell her that I will never climb again," she says. "They support me to do what I want, but they are worried."

She continues to inspire confidence in other Muslim women, many of whom have been encouraged to participate in outdoor sports after reading about her story.

"When I started training, many women were reluctant to do outdoor sports, especially those who wear the hijab, but it's now becoming quite common," she recently told the Times

Her 32 nieces also embolden her to share her journey and highlight the power of female participation in sport. "They are very strong, and they stand up for their rights," she says.

'Believe in your dream'

Alharthy says the main purpose of her journey is to practice author Todd Henry's mantra -- to figuratively "die empty" from sharing knowledge: "I think that's what Khalid was doing with many Omanis."

"I think it's a great story," she goes on to tell CNN. "Even for the new generation, for the other girls and men, just to support each other, to help each other, not to hold knowledge for ourselves."

She hopes that by teaching others about her experience through her newly appointed role as the general manager's assistant for the Girl Guides of Oman, she can lift up a new generation of young Omani people to take up endurance sports.

Alharthy is also learning from her peers. She references one of her Everest teammates, Arthur Muir, who was initially unable to finish his trek in 2019. However, in May of this year, he became the oldest American to climb the world's highest peak at age 75.

"He's very positive, [a] great personality, [an] inspiration for all of us," she says. "Believe in yourself, believe in your dream and work hard."

Ultimately, she draws strength from staying committed to her faith and her Omani roots.

"I always wake up in the morning and say, 'Alhumdullilah, thank God I'm here [...] I reached my goal," she says.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As a child growing up in Slovenia, she'd regularly be found racing up trees or scaling the door frames in her house, but it was on the climbing wall where she felt most at home and where her talent eventually shone through.

Yet despite being one of the favorites to win gold at this year's Tokyo Olympics , Garnbret's career didn't get off to the start you might expect.

She came last in her category in her first competition as a child but says she loved the sport too much to care at that stage.

"People always ask me if I was ever comparing myself to other kids, I was actually not," Garnbret, who recently scaled Europe's tallest chimney, tells CNN Sport.

"I was just enjoying myself on the wall and I was just climbing, trying to push my limits. I never thought to myself that I am better than everyone else. I just enjoyed climbing."

After a couple of years of practice and hard work, Garnbret quickly emerged as one of the best climbers in her country.

Her world-class ability then became evident as she entered international competitions and started winning them consistently.

She has gone on to win multiple World Cup events and has her eyes firmly on the postponed Tokyo Games which are set to finally go ahead this summer, which will see sport climbing make its Olympic debut.

Slovenia's Janja Garnbret says she's looking forward to making her Olympic debut in Tokyo.

'I learned a lot about myself'

The 22-year-old says the initial postponement gave her more time to work on her weaknesses but admitted the uncertainty around the pandemic was difficult to get her head around.

She was fortunate enough to have a climbing wall at home, which she used to keep in good shape during her country's lockdown, but she was tested in ways she hadn't expected.

"I could train, but for me, it was hard because I was always the motivated person. I always had small goals and, of course, big goals and I never had fluctuations in motivation," she says.

"I was always motivated but now it happened to me that I was motivated some days for training, some days not because every competition was postponed. I didn't know myself like that.

"It was just something different and I learned a lot about myself, but I got used to the situation quite quickly."

Organizers remain insistent that the Games will go ahead this year, but there is still an element of doubt that the pandemic could scupper plans once again.

Garnbret is trying to stay positive and is optimistic she'll make her Olympic debut in 2021, despite the situation seemingly changing every week.

"I think Covid last year was just, of course, something new for us and we didn't know what to expect, how to deal with it," she adds.

"But we came prepared into this year with all safety precautions and everything. It's still not a hundred percent, I completely understand that, but I will do my best and I will keep preparing for the Olympics."

Driving four hours a day

Should sport climbing make its debut at this year's Olympics, the competition will be run across three disciplines, each with their own techniques and format.

Bouldering involves navigating as many fixed routes as possible in four minutes on a four-meter high wall with no safety ropes. Lead climbing requires athletes to climb as high as possible on a 15-meter plus wall in six minutes using safety ropes, without reclimbs. Speed climbing has two climbers ascend a parallel route at the same time on a 15-meter wall set at 95 degrees -- sometimes doing so in under 8 seconds. Combined results will determine medalists.

Garnbret says speed climbing is by far her weakest discipline but has a thorough training schedule in place to improve every aspect of her performance.

She trains six days a week, splitting her time between gym work, speed climbing and her usual wall training. Due to a lack of centralized facilities in Slovenia, Garnbret often drives up to four hours a day to attend all her sessions.

It's a regime that requires determination, passion and a tireless work ethic but winning a gold medal would make it all worthwhile.

"I definitely know that every girl will take that extra year to their benefit," she says. "I know every girl has her eyes set on the gold."

"I can't say that I will win the gold because I know everyone will be 100% prepared for that.

"I will definitely keep training and I will be prepared as much as possible when the time comes and then we will see what will happen. But, definitely, I'm looking forward to it."

Garnbret says the global pandemic initally knocked her motivation.

Promoting healthy climbing

While other athletes will be backed by wealthy sponsors and a team of sport scientists at this year's Olympics, Garnbret knows climbing is not quite at that level.

The Slovenian hopes the opportunity to compete in front of a global audience will go some way towards changing that.

"I think it will be really beneficial to climbing because climbing is still a young sport. It's super young," she says.

"So it's definitely a huge playground for everyone, for sponsors, for some non-endemic sponsors that are still yet to come into our sport. That's definitely something huge."

Due to her success, Garnbret is already a role model to young climbers across the world, and she hopes she can drive the charge for better facilities in her own country.

She also wants to boost a healthy image of the sport, which she says is more important than anything.

Garnbret says the demands of climbing have led to youngsters, especially girls, trying to get lighter. This has, she says, sometimes led to people developing eating disorders in the bid for better results.

She now wants to use her platform to show the next generation of climbers that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can translate into success.

"I just want to set a good example in that you don't need to lose extra weight to be successful," she says.

"I definitely feel responsible for our sport. I just want to represent climbing as a fun sport, that it's always fun, you have to just climb up and enjoy yourself."

She continues: "I remember I fell in love [...] the first time that I tried climbing because it felt so weightless, and it was just me and the wall. I remember that I was the only kid who stayed on the wall and didn't want to come off."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Whether it's a comment about his hair or questioning his expertise, professional ice climber Manoah Ainuu is aware that people notice the difference.

Born to first-generation immigrants from Samoa and Ethiopia, the 26-year-old grew up in the outskirts of Los Angeles but later moved to Bozeman, Montana, when he went to college.

It was there that he fell in love with the outdoors and the spectacular ice climbing opportunities Montana has to offer.

Ainuu taught himself how to climb and is now a seasoned professional, embarking on trips across the United States

But he says living in a predominately White area, whilst taking part in a sport with few other Black athletes, weighs heavily on him.

Despite not recalling any overtly racist incidents, the climber says it is more an accumulation of "microaggressions" from both the local and climbing community, such as people commentating on his dreadlocks.

"Most people are like 'Oh, it's a compliment, it's kindness,' but what it happens to be is kind of backhanded," Ainuu tells CNN Sport. "They're seeing that you're different and feel like they have to say something about it.

"I'm pretty mellow, so I just ignore a lot of stuff. If someone says some stupid racist thing, I'm like: 'Whatever, I've heard this before.'

"But it really does weigh down on you. It all builds up and whether a person handles that by bottling it up or ignoring it, there's still an effect."

With films such as "Free Solo" making it into the mainstream and with climbing gyms on the rise, the sport has witnessed a boom in recent years.

But the cost of clothing and safety equipment acts as a huge barrier to entry for many and the lack of representation amongst the world's top professionals is being recognized more than ever before.

Now a member of The North Face's elite climbing team, Ainuu wants to change the narrative around outdoor adventure sports.

"I don't really like being in the spotlight, having all this attention brought to me, but what I've realized is [...] there are so many people that are looking up to me [...] and all these other Black and African-American climbers or athletes or musicians," he says.

"Just seeing someone that looks like you, doing something and excelling at it is extremely empowering."

Manoah Ainuu is an accomplished ice climber.

Black Ice

It's why Ainuu was so excited to be part of a new documentary film called " Black Ice " which looks at a collaboration with Memphis Rox -- a not-for-profit climbing gym in South Memphis, US.

The center provides a safe haven for people away from the streets; a place to relax and dive into a sport that may at first seem unfamiliar. No one is turned away, regardless of their ability to pay.

Through its inclusivity and caring ethos, the organization has opened up the world of climbing to the local community which suffers from poverty and a lack of opportunity, especially in Black communities.

Elena Delavega, Associate Professor at the University of Memphis, tells CNN Sport that South Memphis is one of the poorest areas of the city which is "underserved and under-resourced."

She also says the area is under threat from encroaching gentrification.

"That is a problem for this neighborhood because there is a desire to remove the traditional residents and to 'improve' the area," she says.

"But no improvements are happening while poor people live there."

According to the 2020 Memphis Poverty fact sheet, the poverty rate for the city is 21.7%, with the percentage higher among minority groups.

The "Black Ice" film documents how members of the gym's staff, many of whom had never been ice climbing before, travel to Montana where they met with Ainuu, fellow ice climber Fred Campbell and climbing legend Conrad Anker.

Learning from the experts, the Memphis Rox team spend time scaling frozen waterfalls and skiing in some of the coldest temperatures they've experienced.

"It was super cool. I mean, just having that much melanin in Montana," Ainuu laughs.

"Black Ice" documented an ice climbing trip to Montana, US.

Better representation

Malik Martin , the official photographer at Memphis Rox who worked as a filmmaker on "Black Ice," is acutely aware of the problems presented to young people growing up in Memphis.

"There isn't a lot of sympathy from society for people in my neighborhood, people in our circumstances," Martin tells CNN Sport. "There's a million traps for you to fall into between just trying to live and survive.

"But it's a beautiful place. I love Memphis. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else because being from where I'm from is how we're able to just get up and go to a whole new environment and tough it out.

"It was hard and it sucked but I've been shot at so this is nothing."

Having never previously considered a career photographing and making films about climbing, Martin now finds himself in love with the sport.

He says living in Memphis forces you to grow up fast, but that climbing offers you the opportunity to let your guard down.

He also understands the importance of representation in the sport and says stories need to be told by more Black filmmakers.

"Any time I point my cameras to amplify and uplift [...] being a Black filmmaker and connecting with Black people is important," he says.

"There is a difference, we can sit here and act like there isn't. There is a difference when it's based on documentaries, you know what I mean?

"When you're sitting with people and talking with people and just being able to relate."

Martin has been on multiple trips with Ainuu since filming "Black Ice" and his social media feeds are now full of climbing content.

He recalls a moment during a trip with Ainuu last year when the importance of using his camera to inspire others hit home.

The pair were driving when Ainuu noticed a frozen pillar beside the road. Martin watched his friend jump out of the car, run across the road and start climbing it without ropes.

"From the hood, that would be quote-unquote 'White folk stuff,'" Martin says. "And to see a Black dude with dreads, in top peak prowess [...] is like 'wow.'"

Fred Campbell was one of the mentors in "Black Ice".

Allies in the sport

Since the trip to Montana, Martin has also fostered a strong relationship with Anker, who remains one of the world's top explorers and mountaineers.

Anker was one of the driving forces behind the film's conception, having previously visited Memphis Rox, and has long pushed for better diversity in outdoor pursuits.

Both Martin and Ainuu say it's vital to have White allies from within the sport.

"There's one thing for you to put a black square up on Instagram," says Martin.

"Conrad understood for my life to change and for it to have any type of real social impact, he had to bring me into his circle of influence and him being a legend automatically stamps or certifies me to an extent."

Anker acknowledges that not enough has been done in the past to make climbing inclusive but says that things are changing.

Whilst organizations and events such as "Color The Crag" have been promoting diversity for years, Anker says the death of George Floyd in 2020 was a touchpoint for the global climbing community to hold a mirror up against itself.

"It's trying to change the view of how we look at climbing," Anker tells CNN Sport. "From its origin in the mid-1800s, seeing this as an athletic pursuit itself has always been the domain of the white male."

"Now as expeditions go forward, big expeditions, there is more inclusivity from both where one is from and also from a gender standpoint. Recognizing that and working to make it better is the first step."

'Reflection of society'

Anker hopes "Black Ice" will continue to encourage people from all backgrounds to adopt his love for climbing, which he says can be used as a tool to heal the deep divisions and racial tensions in the US.

"We've always revered mountains in all the world's great religions," he says.

"There's always some connection to mountains. And when you're out with someone, then that climbing with them is special.

"It's a healthy way for humans to approach other humans. And so Memphis Rox, yes, it's a climbing gym but, moreover, it's a community center where these people are. It's a really meaningful thing.

"Whilst climbing is a sport about going up mountains, moreover, it's a transformational change in how humans interact with other humans and to foster this [...] is kind of my life's goal."

Campbell, one of the experts leading the team in Montana, echoes Anker's praise of Memphis Rox but says there is no quick way to address the issue of diversity in climbing.

Instead, he calls on everyone from within the community to do their bit.

"Climbing is kind of a reflection of society," Campbell tells CNN Sport.

"No part of society's issues doesn't make its way into climbing and so I think the solution has to be multifaceted."

"Individual climbers have to be supportive of it and work to make the community really inclusive, and I think that's something that we try to do on a personal level.

"Conrad, Manoah, Malik, all of us are really, really, really interested in being inclusive and making the sport accessible to everyone."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) It started with a two-and-a-half-mile run with his partner. Now it's a lifestyle for Robbie Balenger.

He's pushed his body and mind to the very limits by taking on mammoth endurance challenges, notably running 3,175 miles across the US in just 75 days in 2019 in order to promote the benefits of a plant-based diet.

More recently, Balenger broke the record for most laps around New York's Central Park in one day.

His life now is in sharp contrast to when he was running successful restaurants.

"I lived in Austin, Texas, and was very much a part of the food and bar scene. With that comes a lot of partying and late nights," he tells CNN.

"You work hard, then you blow off steam. I was still living that kind of lifestyle and quickly realized it wasn't going to add up.

"All that partying wasn't really going to make me a very good leader or someone that could fulfill the duties of my job every day in the way I wanted to."

Then his now-fiancee invited him on a run. The short jog triggered something in Balenger, who quickly saw the advantages of exercising as a way of coping with the stresses of his job and coming up with new ideas for his restaurant.

Balenger gradually took on longer and tougher challenges; a half-marathon; a full marathon; and then found himself lining up on the start line for a grueling ultra-marathon.

"It definitely replaced that hard-partying lifestyle," he adds. "[It was] much healthier but there was still something in there that felt kind of similar. It's kind of a raw feeling."

Robbie Balenger says he has a spiritual connection with running which has helped him forge a new identity.

Run across the US

Balenger eventually stepped away from the bar scene. He flirted with the idea of charity work or working in solar energy and he also liked the thought of being a wildland firefighter. But he always came back to running.

Then, after a chance encounter with another man who had run across the US, Balenger started prepping for the biggest challenge of his life -- the transcontinental run.

"I completed it in 75 days, so that averaged out to 43 miles a day. So I was putting in an ultra[-marathon] every day," he says, smiling.

The main drive behind the project was raising awareness of better food choices. Balenger says his vegan diet was his "superpower" for the run and insists it was one of the reasons he was able to complete it.

"Here in the US especially, we have a really bad obesity problem and people are just really unhealthy," he says.

"I think I hit it at a time where people were willing to acknowledge and accept that there was an issue, and therefore, they were open to conversations because they were seeing people all around them who are unhealthy and getting sick.

"My thought was, 'I'm just going to show that I can do this on a plant based diet,' and along the way, I quickly realized not only could I do it, it was the reason I was able to do it."

In March 2021, Balenger broke the Central Park Loop challenge record, running almost 100 miles in one day.

Central Park record

After finishing his epic run, the self-proclaimed "plant-based alternative endurance athlete" had the taste for more.

In March 2021, he set a new record for The Central Park Loop Challenge, where he had to complete as many 6.1-mile laps of the park as he could within its opening hours.

From 6:05 a.m. to 12:55 a.m. the next morning, Balenger ran 16 laps -- just under 100 miles -- smashing the previous record of 11 loops.

"It was just super appealing to me coming out of the depths of Covid. It felt like it was a cool thing to do," he says.

"It was on the first day of spring and then it really resonated with me because that's where I finished my run across the United States, in Central Park.

"[I was] really excited to have accomplished it and then your legs seize up and you get really stiff and then you get really tired, and luckily, you can pass out right afterward."

Balenger runs 10 miles every day in preparation for big challenges. Come rain or shine, he throws on his sneakers and goes outside. Consistency, he says, is key.

While the thought of heading out for a run on a freezing morning might deter many, Balenger has always found a way to overcome the doubts in his mind.

It's because running is more than just a physical challenge. It's his sanctuary. It's where he feels most at peace.

"Running is the most spiritual aspect of my life," he says. "It's where I go to be with myself and to explore who I am and the energies around me and who I want to be.

"There's something that's very beautiful in the discomfort of it [...] feeling what some would call pain -- I guess it is like a dull low pain.

"But what comes out of that, you feel very alive. You feel every ounce of your being. Every step you feel your feet, you feel your legs, you feel your toes and there's something that is beautiful in that."

Spiritual connection

Balenger's father died when he was very young, and although he enjoyed his childhood, he says he never had that male role model that so many take for granted.

As he searched for a sense of himself, Balenger went chasing a party lifestyle.

"I expressed it in a lot of ways and a lot were probably not very healthy. Like being a guy that went out and drank a lot," he says.

"Partying like that was kind of embodying what I thought it meant to be a man. It was living hard and that was kind of where this masculinity showed itself."

He says running helped him redefine masculinity, especially after watching athletes compete in the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run -- one of the hardest runs in the US.

"I was like: there's another version of a man that is just rough and tumble and got all of those qualities that I think I was trying to get from this bar scene," he says.

"This is a way that is the healthier version of that. And so after seeing that, I wanted to embody that. And so that started this exploration of it and it's something that's still ongoing.

"I'm 36 years old, I'm still trying to understand what that is, and I do that through my running. It helps me to create an identity for myself that is healthy, and I think embodies a lot of what it means to be a man."

Balenger is currently tackling another mammoth challenge, in what he has dubbed the "Colorado Crush."

It involves running a marathon in June, a 50-mile run in July, and a 100-mile run in August.

In between these, he will also bid to complete the Colorado trail -- which stretches for 500 miles -- and summit 58 peaks that are over 14,000 feet.

During the challenge, he will be using neuroscience technology to see how it can optimize his sleep and help aid his recovery.

"I think the more we run, the more we move our body, we push ourselves, the clearer and higher our frequency becomes," he says.

"I think encouraging other people to do that will only better ourselves and better our communities and better the world.

"I know I am the best version of myself when I have a goal, when I'm moving my body, when I'm taking care of myself and I'm eating healthy. I want that for everyone."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Many have completed a marathon, but no-one has done anything like Michael Miraglia's Strongman Marathon.

The fitness coach and CrossFit athlete covered 26.2 miles on Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats in February by completing a variety of exercises.

The challenge, which Miraglia dreamed up himself, included a mile of a single exercise such as tire flips, lunges, handstand walks and burpees, in between which he ran a mile wearing a 20-pound vest.

The 29-year-old completed it in just over nine hours and 18 minutes -- far quicker than he had originally anticipated.

"Once you get out there, you just forget about it all," Miraglia tells CNN Sport

"You just live in the moment of like: 'Okay, here's a list of things I need to get done right now. Nothing else matters. Let me start chipping away at this.'

"You forget about the conditions. You forget about this beautiful backdrop. All you focus on is that list and objectives that you have."

Miraglia flips a tire for a mile during his Strongman Marathon.

'My shoulders were trashed'

Miraglia says the most difficult part of what he's calling the world's first Strongman Marathon was the mile-long handstand walk.

He chose to tackle it near the start of the challenge, but that didn't make it much easier.

"That was the hardest thing I've ever done," he says. "Starting off with that handstand mile, my shoulders were trashed. I couldn't feel them. They were numb. I was walking 10 feet at a time, it took forever just to finish that alone.

"Typically, handstand walks, I'm very proficient at them. I can walk pretty much whatever distance unbroken. But I was moving five and 10 feet, sometimes I'd fall right down.

"I woke up the next day and my wrists were so inflamed from all those repetitive burpees, all that handstand walking, I've never felt them throb before like that."

The dreaded handstand walk.

'This is what's fun for me'

It's not the first time that Miraglia has taken on a crazy fitness challenge.

A long-time fitness fanatic, he completed a 500-pound deadlift followed by a mile run inside five minutes (four minutes and 49 seconds, to be exact) a few months before the Strongman Marathon.

He wants to set himself more challenges throughout the year, the main aim being to inspire other people to get active.

"Hopefully that just sparks an inspiration for someone else to get off the couch and move themselves, whether they're going to flip a tire for a mile or do whatever they think is fun," Miraglia says of his Strongman Marathon.

"That's all it really comes down to. This is what's fun for me. And hopefully it sparks the interest for someone to find what they find is fun.

"I've been getting a bunch of new messages from people saying: 'I love what you're doing, I love what you represent, this pushed me to do this for a mile and this for a mile.'

"And it may not be on my level of fitness, but that's totally fine as long as they're moving. That's the whole goal of this."

Miraglia had to cut up socks to protect his knees while lunging for a mile.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Close to 17,000 runners took part in this year's Athens Marathon, but no one had undertaken a journey to the start line quite like Nick Butter.

Butter's real race had begun 674 days previously in the -25-degree cold of Toronto. Athens, the final stop of his attempt to run a marathon in all 196 countries in the world , was merely a sprint finish.

What he endured between those two events was enough to crush the spirit of even the most hardened endurance athlete, or to test the nous of the most intrepid explorer.

"How long have we got to talk about the lows of this trip?" 30-year-old Butter muses less than a week after crossing the finish line in Greece.

The numbers behind this unique achievement are remarkable, and Butter can reel them off like a schoolchild reciting multiplication tables.

It involved 455 flights painstakingly booked by his Dad back home in the UK, 120 visas, 10 passports, and 10 million steps of running. He completed 22 marathons with food poisoning, four with a kidney infection, 101 on an empty stomach, and managed 320 days without painkillers.

"The lows of the journey were quite extreme," Butter, who gave up his job as a banker four years ago to plan and complete the record attempt, tells CNN Sport.

"From being attacked and bitten by dogs, to being mugged at knifepoint in Nigeria, to being hit by a car and breaking my elbow. But actually, it was the illnesses that were the real struggles.

"When you're suffering with food poisoning or a kidney infection, that's when your body really wants to stop and just say look, I need to recuperate, but I wasn't able to. In Bangladesh I was feeling really rough ... I think I threw up maybe 20 times throughout the run."

Butter (left) celebrates at the finish line in Athens with close friend Kevin Webber -- the inspiration behind the trip.

Tears, tantrums, frustrations

Stomach bugs aside, Butter says the actual running aspect of the challenge was reasonably straightforward, his fitness sustained by running two or three marathons a week.

What was especially difficult was getting from country to country in the required timescale.

"I cannot begin to describe how complicated it is," says Butter.

"I had so many phone calls with my Dad and he said, 'Look, I really don't think we can do this. I don't think we can link them up in the timeline and with the money that we've got.' There were tantrums and tears and frustrations.

"If you'd asked me three weeks (before the end), do we think we'll finish in Athens? We were 95% sure we wouldn't."

Dangerous dogs

If getting to every country was challenging enough, then finding a scenic route to run upon arriving proved impossible.

Often it was just a matter of running laps over and over again -- 82 in Vatican City, 104 in the high commissioner's compound of the British Embassy in Kingston, Jamaica, and 105 inside a stadium in the Syrian capital Damascus.

But the most laps? A mind-numbing 335 in a hotel carpark on the Pacific nation of the Marshall Islands, where Butter couldn't escape packs of feral dogs.

"We didn't plan on dogs being such a problem, but dogs were the bane of my life," he says. "After a dog bite in Tunisia, I was conscious that if they nipped my Achilles or something, then that is really game over.

"When I checked into my hotel in the Marshall Islands, they gave me my key and a stick and said, 'If you go outside, you'll need the stick.' There's actually a big diabetes crisis on the island -- people don't walk because it's so violent with the dogs.

"I was surrounded by these big dogs and I had to turn back and run in the hotel car park, which was about 120 meters, something like that. And it was just round and round and round those 335 laps of the carpark. Terrible."

Butter had identified 15 "problematic" countries before leaving -- "anything from Iran, to Afghanistan, to Somalia, to Yemen, to Syria, to Libya" -- and he recalls crossing a roadblock on the border of Syria and Lebanon where people had been killed just days before he passed through.

Temperatures ranged wildly -- from wearing six layers for his first run in Toronto, to battling 60-degree heat in Kuwait where he drank nine-and-a-half liters of water on his run.

Food was also an issue. Butter says he went 35 days without eating having run a marathon, and calculates he lost 11 kilos in the first two weeks of his African leg, weight he put back on by eating double meals on planes.

"I'm very, very sick of plane food," he adds.

What's next?

Aside from sections where he was joined by friends from home, Butter completed much of the journey alone.

But companions were made along the way. Backed by the Ministry of Sport in El Salvador, he was joined by a group of 1,000 people made up of schoolkids and local athletes.

Presidents from nine different countries also ran with him, and over the course of the trip he accumulated 2,500 new contacts on his phone.

Then there's the friend who inspired the whole journey. Butter crossed the finish line in Athens hand-in-hand with his close friend Kevin, who has terminal prostate cancer.

He's raised $155,830 (£120,000) for Prostate Cancer UK so far -- money that's going towards a national screening program in the UK -- and hopes to reach a target of $325,000 (£250,000).

Now he will embark on a public speaking tour of schools and venues around the UK and Europe. Having sold his house and bought a camper van, he hopes to recount his tales of hardship and all the lessons learned along the way.

Butter runs with his friend Kevin Webber at the Athens Marathon in November.

Itching to start running again, Butter also wants to break the 1,000-mile running around Iceland record. Needless to say, he won't be returning to banking any time soon.

"I have absolutely no desire to go back to working behind a desk of any kind, especially in finance," he says. "I was very privileged to have that job; I earned some money and I have some brilliant friends from it, but it's not me."

Butter's attempt to be the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world hasn't been officially ratified yet. He has the travel tickets and recorded run routes to prove it, and plans to submit the paperwork soon.

Not that he minds either way. He's happy enough just telling the stories of his travels -- and has enough of those to last a lifetime.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Counterpointed by a number of striking tattoos, hers is a body defined by muscle. She is a mother of two who embodies power and strength.

Rene Campbell has dedicated most of her life to sculpting her once diminutive frame into one that, she says, goes "completely against what society thinks a woman should look like."

The bodybuilder's dedication has brought plenty of awards but building her dream body -- gaining over 85 pounds, going from a UK size 8 to 14 -- has had its challenges, too, both physically and mentally.

"I was very insecure about my body image, very insecure about myself as a person," Campbell, 44, tells CNN Sport from her home in Cornwall, UK, as she reflects on her motivation to transform herself.

"I was constantly feeling under pressure through the media that women needed to look a certain way."

"My bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself," says Rene Campbell.

'A woman with muscle'

"For quite some time I struggled with eating disorders because I was constantly trying to keep my weight really low, to appear skinny, like these women are on magazine covers," she says.

Then, she attended a women's bodybuilding show and became intrigued by the way these seemingly confident women held themselves.

Though Campbell ​says she loves the way she now looks, ​she says she is sometimes treated with cruelty, like when she has been asked to leave women's toilets.

"A lot of the time you are up against a lot of negativity. People set in an old mindset," Campbell adds.

"I was up against -- and still am -- a lot of criticism from people who don't understand why women would want to be muscular. But it just gave me a sense of confidence and mental strength.

"I'm stuck in a situation where I have to prove that I'm a woman in order to use these toilets? It's quite offensive. I do try and explain to them quite nicely. I may look this way but, at the end of the day, I am a woman. I have every right to use these toilets."

"There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession," says Campbell.

Studying female bodybuilders

For over a decade, sociologist Dr. Tanya Bunsell has been researching female bodybuilders.

"When I would tell people that I was studying female bodybuilders, the first reaction was, 'That's just not attractive,'" Dr. Bunsell, a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Science at Canterbury Christ Church University, tells CNN Sport.

"There's definitely a glass ceiling on muscularity, and that crossover boundary where the body becomes transgressive and interrogates people's notions of male and female.

"The troublesome and disturbing body of the hyper-muscular woman is deemed so outrageously deviant by society that it provokes harsh comments."

"Even though there is a huge market encouraging women to build abs and tighten their figures, the ideal still stands for smaller waists, curvy hips and lean legs, the so-called hourglass figure," adds Dr. Bunsell.

Campbell takes enormous pride in the way she has reshaped her body.

'The body becomes an amazing machine'

When she started her bodybuilding career, ​Campbell says eating copious amounts of food was, at first, a shock to the body and mind.

"My body temperature went up," she says, ​saying that putting on weight initially scared her.

"I was feeling hot all the time because you're constantly eating, but once you get over that stage the body becomes an amazing machine and it starts to take that fuel in."

"There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession," says Campbell.

"You look at any athlete that has achieved great things, there has to be a certain level of obsession."

A photograph of Campbell is currently featured in a six-month exhibition in west London called "Womanhood."

Max Ellis, the photographer who took the portait of Campbell, describes his subject as a "work of art."

"She's worked her whole life to try and achieve this," Ellis ​said. "If you're a woman and you're doing this [bodybuilding], you are swimming upstream. You're fighting every known convention."

Steroids

But bodybuilding has a dark side, a long association with steroid use to help build muscle.

"Before she went to the world championships, Rene had to do a drug test and passed the drug test, but a lot of these girls didn't pass," Wanda Tierney, chairperson of IFBB (International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness) Women's Committee , tells CNN Sport.

Campbell says it would be naïve to think that the problem does not exist, but argues that steroids abuse happens in other sports and in society, too.

"The onus is on the athletes to adhere to the rules and regulations set by their federation," Campbell says. "My federation (The IFBB), is a signatory to the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code, and the IFBB anti-doping rules are in full compliance with the 2015 WADA code."

And as she reflected on her body's evolution, Campbell was keen to stress how bodybuilding had been accompanied by a shift in her mental health.

"It was a very big shift for me mentally, because my bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The rejection was brutal. At the age of 16, Priscilla Frederick-Loomis attended a model agency casting session in New York City where she was told that she was "too heavy."

Even now at the age of 31, those two words still play on the Olympic high jumper's mind. Raised by a single mother in New Jersey, Loomis also toyed with the idea of becoming an actor and that's a dream she hasn't given up on as she has pursued her athletics career.

"I'm going to use track and field as a way to make a name for myself," Loomis, who is a two-time Pan American Games silver medalist and competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, tells CNN Sport from her home in the US. She represented Antigua and Barbuda, where her father is from.

Pursuing a career in track and field hasn't been easy.

"When you are trying to be an elite athlete, on top of trying to get signed on, on top of dealing with coaches, you also have, the pressures, one for me, of being an African-American female representing a Caribbean island. And you're adding on top of all that body shaming."

Loomis competes in the women's high jump final at the Pan American Games in August 2019 in Lima, Peru.

'Don't eat ... jump better'

If the modelling industry left Loomis scarred and dissatisfied with her shape, then perceptions of her weight have also impacted her sporting ambitions.

Even though she never thought she had an eating disorder, Loomis remembers a conversation she had with her college nutritionist, asking: "'How can I be anorexic and be an athlete?'"

"When I said to my nutritionist that I want to be anorexic, never did I mean I want to have an eating disorder. The power of the word wasn't apparent to me.

"Now, I look back like and think, 'What the hell was wrong with me? I didn't even realize a lot of female athletes have eating disorders."

But at that point in her career, that's what Loomis felt she had to do to be successful given she was 158 lbs and is 5 ft 10 tall, which she noted is six inches shorter and at least 20 pounds more than her rivals.

"In my head, it was common sense: don't eat a lot, look better, jump better," said Loomis, who remembers a time at college when her then coach Richard Fisher advised her to grab something to eat after a training session.

"I wanted an ice cream, a little ice cream," she says as she demonstrated how small the size was.

Except another coach told Loomis to put the ice cream down.

"In my head, that stuck with me for so long because I was like, 'I'm making bad decisions. I'm fat,'" says Loomis.

Loomis competes in the high jump final at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

'One in a billion'

According to US-based eating disorder expert Dr. Gayle Brooks our culture emphasizes and overvalues thinness as the health and beauty ideal.

"When this cultural value system is combined with the pressures of athletic competition, which places an emphasis on diet, appearance, size and weight to achieve peak performance, it places some athletes at high risk of developing disordered eating and possibly eating disorders," Dr. Brooks told CNN Sport.

Dr. Brooks is the vice president and chief clinical officer for the Renfrew Center, a US-based clinic specializing in eating disorders treatments. Over Brooks' 30 year career, she has treated many patients who suffer from eating disorders and acted as the eating disorders specialist in the HBO film Thin.

According to a US study -- Prevalence of Eating disorders among Blacks in the National Survey of American Life -- anorexia was the rarest eating disorder among African American adults and adolescents, while binge eating was the most prevalent eating disorder among adults and adolescents.

"We are really understanding more and more that eating disorders are not just a White, suburban women's disease, and that, you know, for a long time the belief was that women of color, particularly Black women, were protected culturally from developing eating disorders," said Dr. Brooks.

As she trained for her first Olympic appearance in 2016, Loomis adhered to a strict diet.

"I would eat super healthy and super clean, be on it for a month. One time I was just like, 'I really would love a donut, or I really would love a cupcake' and I have a sweet tooth."

However, according to then-coach Richard Fisher, Loomis wasn't eating enough.

"We started working together, she was eating maybe three meals a day tops. Everything was low and minimum.

"She would be so hungry, she would eat unhealthy things as anyone, and her lack of nutrition was hindering her from performing the correct way that she needed to."

The track and field coach adds: "A lot of coaches look at, I would say the average high jumper who's professional and look at their height and their weight ratio.

"They use that as the standard for what they believe an athlete should be, which in reality is not true all the time. Yes, it might be the perfect standard of what you want. But a lot of these athletes, you have to realize, are one a billion.

"Priscilla always used to say to me, 'I'm the shortest, fattest high jumper out there.'"

Once she's finished competing Loomis wants to pursue an acting career.

'Loving myself'

According to World Athletics, in a statement sent to CNN: "There is no one kind of body measurement requirement to qualify for the Olympics. That is not the case. There is no such requirement. The qualifying standards are all based around performance."

Last year World Athletics released a Nutrition Consensus Statement providing the latest research and guidance around nutrition to athletes, coaches and administrators.

In a statement sent to CNN Sport, the International Olympic Committee also said it "stands for non-discrimination as one of the founding pillars of the Olympic Movement, which is reflected in the Olympic Charter, Fundamental Principle 6.

"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

"Furthermore, athletes' safety and wellbeing is a priority and a core value for the IOC, which is committed to leading and supporting the Olympic Movement in the implementation of safeguarding measures, in line with its mission stated in the Olympic Charter to promote safe sport and the protection of athletes from all forms of harassment and abuse."

Even Loomis' teammates were all too quick to chime in with disparaging comments about her appearance.

After Loomis' appearance at the 2015 Outdoor World Championships in Beijing, she says she was called "thick" and "heavy" by her teammates from Antigua and Barbuda. And that was after she had just competed on the track.

The Antiguan and Barbuda Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment.

Three years later she placed fifth in the high jump at the Commonwealth Games in Australia. She went to the bar to grab a beer to celebrate when a man, who recognized Loomis from her famous purple hair, came up to her and said, "Oh, I saw you on TV. If you would drop a few kilos, you would have performed better."

As a result of those comments, Loomis says she would drink a pot of coffee to dehydrate herself to appear slim on screen.

Loomis is currently working with a female coach, Lauren Biscardi, a former New York state champion in high jump, who the 31-year-old athlete says has "changed my professional career. She has helped me love training, love myself and has allowed me to feel."

Loomis competed at Rio in 2016 and has ambitions to compete at the Tokyo Olympics and at Beijing 2022.

Cleaning business

Growing up, the African American athlete says she did not see anyone she could relate to in the advertising industry. She says she wanted to be "light skinned," but as she has discovered the idea of self-love, Loomis realized that she does not want other women "to wish they had to be different to be pretty."

"I do think that the color of my skin and my beautiful chocolate skin color are sometimes deemed as negative and not marketable," added Loomis.

"Viola Davis said it best, 'If you're darker than a paper bag, you're deemed not sexy.'

Off the track, Loomis has had to be creative in finding ways to fund her sporting career.

"I make $12,000 a year," she says, referring to her sporting income. "When people hear that, they're like, 'There's no way,'" she says, "I'm like, 'Yes I have an Olympic solidarity with Antigua and it's $1,000 a month but that has to cover everything, which it doesn't."

For her Olympic appearance in 2016, she had to move in with her coach Fisher and start her cleaning business.

Now, she lives with her husband Kenneth Loomis, a high school teacher and coach, but she still oversees the cleaning business.

"It gets exhausting. It gets tiresome. I clean just about three to four times a week. All of my clients are about an hour to an hour and a half away. So, with that, I have to start by 8 a.m. I'll clean for four hours."

"My pain is valid, my perception is valid, and my success is valid," says Loomis.

She trains two to three hours after she's done cleaning.

"As much as most people think that I'm making all this money, I'm just, you know, faking it till I make it," says Loomis, who is now training to take part at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Her goal is to become a three-time Olympian and if she makes it to Beijing -- Loomis plans to compete in the monobob, the one-person bobsled event.

Of those acting ambitions when she finally leaves track and field behind, Loomis says she wants to start attending acting classes, adding that Storm, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman are the three superheroes that she dreams of playing.

"I want to entertain people. I want to entertain large crowds. I want to make them feel things the same way that I feel from movies and get these emotions.

"Right now, at 31, I look back and realize that my story is incredible. My pain is valid, my perception is valid, and my success is valid. I'm not just another strong Black woman, I'm a powerful voice that won't allow other opinions to weigh her down or belittle herself. That's what makes me a winning athlete."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) She was comfortable with her body, though others were not.

Track and field star Marilyn Okoro, whose right arm displays a "Saved by Grace" tattoo, ran with pride for Great Britain.

"I was told that I was too big to be an 800-meter runner, too short to be an 800m runner," Okoro, an Olympic bronze medalist and World Championships silver medalist, tells CNN Sport.

GB was originally placed fifth at the 2008 Beijing Games but in 2016, third-placed Russia and fourth-placed Belarus were disqualified by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) due to doping violations, raising Okoro and her team to third place.

Okoro was awarded her 4x400m relay Olympic bronze medal at the Anniversary Games at the London Stadium in 2018.

Over the last decade, she's also competed in a variety of European and World Championships, collecting a total of three silvers and four more bronze.

'I can see your veins'

But as she looks back at her career, Okoro reflects perhaps bronze and silver were not quite good enough. Come to think of it, perhaps even a gold medal wouldn't have been good enough.

She also wants to start a wider conversation about the issues surrounding women and body acceptance.

Okoro says she started to feel that she wasn't just having to compete on the track. She was having to compete with people's expectations and demands as to what an athlete should look like.

According to Okoro, that look was skinny, slender and tall.

"Oh, I can see your veins, this must mean you're in good shape," Okoro recalls a conversation she had with coach Charles van Commenee, who worked with the British Athletics team for a number of years, during the prep camp leading into the 2010 European Championships.

Okoro says that Van Commenee then asked her about her weight.

"Proudly, I was like '60 kilograms,'" replied Okoro, who considers that her personal ideal race weight.

Okoro says that is 15kg heavier than the other athletes she raced against, placing her above traditional weight threshold norms in track and field.

According to Okoro, Van Commenee then responded: "Oh, you must be heavy boned!"

Van Commenee, who now works as a motivational speaker on "high performance culture," told CNN Sport: "Being too light or being too heavy can cause injuries and therefore the staff, led by the head coach, has a duty to address this issue.

"It would be unprofessional to turn a blind eye but obviously the right words and the right tone have to be used in addressing the issue," he added.

Okoro competes in the 800 metres event of the Norwich Union 2006 International Athletics competition at the Alexander stadium, in Birmingham, 20 August 2006. Okoro came fourth with a time of 2.03.08 minutes.

After the championships, Okoro says she began working with a nutritionist and was advised to go on a zero-carb diet.

"I just thought, 'Okay, you've just taken out all my carbs, so I'm going to have no energy' ... You start to doubt yourself."

Speaking specifically about Okoro, Van Commenee said he doesn't want to have a public debate with the track and field athlete. He continued: "If she has a problem with anything I may or may not have said, I expect her to speak with me, which she has not done."

However, Van Commenee recalled one conversation with his former athlete where he described Okoro "ranting about her non-selection for the 800m" at the 2012 London Olympics adding: "It was a very painful experience for her."

Okoro remembers the conversation differently.

"In 2012, Charles and I had an exchange regarding selections, well, he was just shouting at me in the training facility which embarrassed me."

The 35-year-old Okoro added: "It was two days before the British trials and the press got a hold of it as it potentially affected my (poor) performance at the championships and ran with the story."

Okoro emphasized that it wasn't to do with her weight on this occasion.

"It was more to do with him having to have his way and throw his dominance around," she said.

Britain's Lee Mcconnell, Christine Ohuruogu, Nicola Sanders and Okoro celebrate on the podium after the women's 4x400m relay final, 02 September 2007, at the 11th IAAF World Athletics Championships, in Osaka. USA won ahead of Jamaica and Britian.

'Athletics is a complicated sport'

In the same year, Okoro lost her British Athletics funding under the UK Lottery program.

British Athletics told CNN that they wouldn't comment on any individual decisions, but that funding allocations are made for "performance reasons."

The criteria that determines the performance and funding decisions are published each year by the organization.

UK Athletics (UKA) 2020 World Class Programme Policy states: "We have to be realistic -- athletics is a complicated sport with many varied disciplines, so one size can't fit all."

Another section highlights that athletes have to meet individual performance thresholds and demonstrate "ongoing global medal potential" to receive funding.

UKA follows a 'What it Takes to Win' data and analysis framework to assess an athlete's medal winning capacity.

The framework talks of "key physical and technical characteristics of medal winning athletes," which will be part of the athlete's review process taken in person with their coach.

Charles Van Commenee, Marilyn Okoro and Greg Rutherford of Great Britain speak ahead of the European Athletics Indoor Championships at the Oval Lingotto on March 5, 2009 in Torino, Italy.

According to leading sports scientist Simon Brundish, these characteristics are created through historic performance data.

"There are real genetic advantages and genetic barriers to be an elite sprinter or an elite endurance runner," Brundish, who's been working in international sports for 22 years, tells CNN Sport.

"Van Commenee was probably right in that Okoro was above the threshold markers, but the problem is that those markers were wrong."

"'The data will be based against historic norms. BMI, maybe even skin folds. Which is fine for say tennis, in the 80s, where all women look the same. Then Serena appears. Suddenly the 'demands of the game' change.

"She introduces a power and speed element that didn't exist before. The price of said power is muscle. Muscle increases weight. A similar thing happened with 800m and into all middle-distance events over the last 10 years or so

"The shape of women in particular has changed because the demands changed. Power and speed in the final 200m increased so the need for greater muscle mass increased."

Okoro looks on after the Women's 800m on day one during the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games -- IAAF Diamond League 2013 at The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on July 26, 2013 in London.

'No exit support'

The loss of funding hit Okoro hard, she says.

"I was cut from funding very abruptly with no exit support or care for my welfare afterward, which is all too common for many athletes in the UK.

"This, as with so many international athletes, was the start of many psychological and physical hurdles I had to face," adds Okoro, who has self-funded her career ever since.

It is not uncommon for women to be self-funded during their sports career. Tulshi Varsani, an accredited strength and conditioning coach, tells CNN Sport: "Women must pay to play."

Okoro and Mariya Savinova of Russia compete in the Womens 800m Final during day three of the European Athletics Indoor Championships at the Oval Lingotto on March 8, 2009 in Torino, Italy.

"Physically, I look different ..."

Okoro moved to the US before returning to the UK in 2017. Since then, she has been living in Wigan in the north of England, over 200 miles away from her hometown, London.

Okoro is proud of her Nigerian heritage and looking back she says her family background helped her deal with what she saw was unnecessary attention over her body shape.

"Physically, I look different and a lot more robust and muscular than a lot of the girls that I raced. My Nigerian background... that was something I had to hold my ground on," she says passionately.

"It plays a huge part in my achievements and striving for success."

If she feels strongly about recognizing her Nigerian heritage, Okoro is equally passionate about taking pride in her body shape.

"We're expressing ourselves; you know, muscles hold strong and sexy campaigns."

According to Okoro, over the course of her career while working with different coaches, some believed she spent too much time at the gym, but the reality is she mostly trains outdoors.

"I was different to what coaches in the UK perceived to be the image and shape for an 800m runner," Okoro said.

"These assumptions were there long before Charles [Van Commenee]."

Okoro says that her coaches focused on sprint training and not enough on endurance.

It was only when she started to have injuries that Okoro began to question the way she was being coached.

"Does this coach really understand? And are they really in it for me?" she reflects. "I was exhausted mentally and physically.

"It's been a real struggle to prove myself as one of the best 800m runners we've had in this country and even in the world."

Okoro, Jenny Meadows of England and Eunice Jepkoech Sum of Kenya compete in the Women's 800m semifinal at Hampden Park during day eight of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games on July 31, 2014 in Glasgow.

The 'ideal' athlete

These days all different shapes and sizes are celebrated in lifestyle magazines, red carpets, beauty advertisements and fashion brands

But is that the case with sport?

"They are women first, athletes second," Dr. Emily Matheson, a research fellow at the Centre for Appearance Research, told CNN Sport.

Dr. Matheson says more attention is given to the shape of their bodies rather than their performances and that the 'ideal' athlete is a term to describe a sleek body with minimal body fat, which is inspired by a more general Westernized view that thinness equals beauty.

"It's very common for body shaming to eventuate from gender stereotyping. More specifically, what it means to be feminine and masculine and how female athletes' bodies may defy this stereotype and in turn be ridiculed for it."

She points out that there have been small shifts in society, such as the body positivity movement, which was originally founded by black women, who celebrated their body types and reclaimed traditionally negative terms such as "fat."

Yet Dr. Matheson also argues that the body positivity movement has been "whitewashed, with many campaigns dismissing the origins of the movement."

GB's women's 4x400m relay team celebrate receiving their reallocated bronze medals, from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games during Day One of the Muller Anniversary Games at the London Stadium on July 21, 2018 in London, England.

Real models

Okoro is hoping to round off her 20-year career with a gold medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics -- but just as importantly fight body image expectations.

"You've got one body, and it was doing pretty great for me, so I needed to look after it," said Okoro, who has drawn inspiration from Serena Williams.

As Brundish references, Williams has been a key point in the conversation surrounding body image. The 23-time grand-slam champion was criticized for her shape and size. Two years ago, Williams published a letter online addressed to her mother sharing the struggles she's faced with people's body image expectations.

She wrote : "It has been said I don't belong in women's sports -- that I belong in men's -- because I look stronger than many other women do.

"No, I just work hard, and I was born with this badass body and proud of it."

Williams says her daughter Olympia shares the same physique and, in the letter, she expresses, "I don't know how I would react if she [her daughter] has to go through what I've gone through since I was a 15-year-old and even to this day."

"We don't all look the same. We are curvy, strong, muscular, tall, small, just to name a few, and all the same: we are women and proud!" Williams said.

Okoro has also drawn inspiration from women athletes in rugby and football.

"They're not your stereotypical beauty queens but they are caring less about how they look and getting dirty and delivering some great performances."

Okoro wants a new era of role models, or as she calls them "real models."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) It was the worst news that anybody could have woken up to; as Sardar Pashaei reached for his phone one morning in September, he knew immediately that something terrible had happened.

"When I woke at about six or seven o'clock in the morning," he told CNN Sport, "I see a lot of phone calls from Persian television. And when I listened to the voicemail of my journalist friend, I just cried. I couldn't control my tears."

The Iranian Pashaei, who was the 1998 Junior 60-kilogram Greco-Roman World Wrestling champion, has been living in self-imposed exile in the US since 2009.

On that fateful morning, he learned that another Iranian wrestler, Navid Afkari , had been executed, hanged for a crime that his family and friends say he didn't commit.

Pashaei, who was close to Afkari's coach in Iran, had been campaigning hard to save his life. It was a campaign that ended brutally with a hangman's noose, but in the months since Afkari was silenced, his voice seems only to have grown louder.

An ancient sport

Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in Iran and it is one of the most popular. Ever since winning their first Olympic wrestling medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Iranian wrestlers have excelled at the Games, returning home with a total of 43 medals to date, more than double the haul in their next best sport -- weightlifting.

Pashaei says that there's a wrestling gym "in every corner of every city in Iran," and successful wrestlers there are treated differently, enjoying an elevated status in comparison to other athletes. They're on a pedestal.

Iranians wrestle during a workout session at the traditional Shir Afkan "zurkhaneh" (House of Strength) gymnasium in the capital Tehran in February 2018.

The ancient sport is naturally aggressive and competitive, but experts say it's a combat sport borne out of a practice to promote inner strength through outer strength.

When viewed through such a lens, wrestling might not seem too dissimilar to yoga. The spirit of wrestling is deeply engrained in Iranian culture, where it has transcended the arena of sport.

Max Fisher wrote in The Atlantic in 2012 that "The ideal practitioner is meant to embody such moral traits as kindness and humility and to defend the community against sinfulness and external threats."

One could argue that it was these very qualities that got Afkari executed -- by his own government.

'He was the best one'

Afkari was born on July 22, 1993, and raised in the city of Shiraz; located in the southwest region of Iran, it's one of the oldest cities in Ancient Persia and known to be a hotbed of poets, literature, flowers and wine.

Legend has it that the famous Syrah grape, grown as far afield as the Rhône Valley in France and in the new world territories of Australia, New Zealand and California, first took root in Shiraz.

It was here that a young Afkari learned to find his way in the world. One of five children, he discovered wrestling at the age of nine and quickly dedicated his life to the sport.

By the time he was 17, he was good enough to be included in a group of eight wrestlers in the 69-kg category that attended a national training camp. Six years later, Pashaei says Afkari was ranked second in his division and on track to fulfill his dream of one day becoming an Olympic champion.

Parents will usually try to avoid having a favorite child or revealing the truth if they do have a preference, but Afkari's three brothers and sister knew their place in the family.

Sources close to them say that he was the apple of his mother's eye; Afkari was successful, but modest, and he was never a burden to them.

A family member, speaking to CNN Sport only on the understanding that their identity would be protected, described Afkari as "the nicest member of the family," adding that his friends would agree: "He was the best one."

Videos of him with his hands in the air, dancing and singing at home during Persian New Year, and somersaulting acrobatically into a swimming pool confirm the family's description of Afkari as "enthusiastic, full of energy and excitement." Such positivity would rub off on those closest to him, especially within his family.

They say that he wasn't particularly interested in politics, but he was keen to help out in the community, making donations and helping the poor, and he was troubled by the culture of discrimination in Iran, especially against women and those living in poverty.

That's why Afkari took part in the seismic demonstrations that swept through the country in 2018.

Initially, these were protests against the government's economic policies, but they soon morphed into political opposition of the theocratic regime and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and were regarded as the most significant domestic challenge to the government in almost a decade.

Afkari was concerned about rising prices in Iran, so -- along with millions of others -- he took to the streets to protest. His family says he was frustrated by corruption and poverty and worried that daily life was no longer affordable to many of his compatriots.

It was a fateful decision that would end up costing him his life.

A forced confession / A lack of evidence

According to the official version of events, Afkari killed Hassan Torkman, a water company security employee, during a protest in Shiraz on August 2, 2018.

Afkari and his brother, Vahid, were arrested a month and a half later, on September 17 according to the UN, and another brother, Habib, was rounded up later that year.

Afkari was condemned to death; Vahid and Habib received prison sentences of more than 33 and 15 years respectively and all were to be punished with 74 lashes each, according to Amnesty International.

Initially, Afkari confessed to the crime, but in court he retracted those words, arguing that he had been tortured during his interrogation by "men with hats, glasses and masks on," and that a false confession had been forced out of him.

His supporters say that his trial was devoid of any compelling evidence, and in fact, the only video evidence available, from a closed-circuit television camera, would have been more likely to prove his innocence.

Afkari's attorney, Hassan Younesi, told the Center for Human Rights in Iran that "There is no visual evidence of the moment of the crime, and the film presented in this case shows scenes an hour before the time of the murder."

In this June 2018 photo, a group of protesters chant slogans at the main gate of the Old Grand Bazaar, in Tehran, Iran. The case of 27-year-old Navid Afkari has drawn the attention of a social media campaign that portrays him and his brothers as victims targeted over participating in protests against Iran's Shiite theocracy in 2018.

An audio recording was made in the court and leaked by human rights activists; in it, an agitated Afkari, speaking in a high-pitched voice, can be heard pleading with the judge, who seems to have little interest in giving him a fair hearing.

Such recordings of court proceedings are extremely rare in Iran and whoever made it and released it would have done so at great personal risk.

The prosecution claimed to have video evidence of the crime committed at the specific time of 11:32 p.m., but according to the audio tape, it was never shown in court and the defendant was never able to see it for himself.

"Why are you afraid and will not show the film?" demands Afkari. "We are not afraid of anything," responds the judge.

On the recording, Afkari demands that his witness, Shahin Nasseri, be heard, somebody who can testify to the abuse he experienced while being held in police detention for nearly 50 days.

In a complaint filed with the judiciary in September 2019, Afkari described "the most severe and physical psychological torture," but according to Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, the head of the Fars Province Judiciary rejected claims that Afkari had been beaten or tortured and, in court, he was dismissed out of hand.

"Not related. Not the time for it, sit down, don't talk anymore!" ordered the judge on the recording. "You do not have a defense."

The Iranian government has said repeatedly that Afkari was not tortured and that his confession wasn't forced. CNN has asked the government if he received a fair trial, but we have not received a response.

The execution

According to the Afkari family, his final days were brutal, but there wasn't necessarily any reason to think that the end was near.

The family says that he was kept in solitary confinement for a week and "beaten by 20 guards," before being told that he and his brothers were being moved from the prison in Shiraz to the capital, Tehran.

That was a lie; instead, Afkari was executed on September 12th, at the age of 27. Much later, family members learned that Vahid and Habib were in a cell close to the gallows where they had heard their brother die.

His body was returned to his family in the middle of the night, and they say he was denied a proper burial. The authorities had already dug a hole in the dirt and that's where Navid was expected to be placed.

In the months that have passed since, he has hardly been able to rest in peace. The family has tried to honor Afkari, by placing a stone to inscribe in remembrance and a wall to protect it, but they say it was broken down by the authorities with a bulldozer.

As the Afkaris tried to prevent further damage, the father was arrested, and they were cautioned that the whole site could be completely destroyed.

Iranians in Canada on Mel Lastman Square demonstrate against the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by the Iranian regime, in Toronto, Ontario in September 2020. The death sentence caused international uproar, yet the regime persisted.

As such, Afkari's final resting place is now just a simple grave.

His death was a crippling blow to those who had loved him and also to those who had never even met him.

So successful was the campaign to raise awareness of his plight that Dana White, the head of UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) asked then US President Donald Trump to appeal to Iran for clemency.

Unfortunately, though, their efforts were in vain.

Speaking shortly after Afkari's death in a press conference, White tried to make sense of it all but could only conclude that "he was fighting for what he believed in. And it cost him his life."

One UFC fighter, Bobby Green, was so emotional that he could think of nothing else after beating Alan Patrick in Las Vegas.

Green, who was a wrestler himself before turning to Mixed Martial Arts, cut short his post-fight interview by saying, "Somebody just lost their life for protesting; that just messed me up. I thought we were going to be able to save him. That is so sad, it broke my heart. I don't even want to talk right now."

Inciting a culture of fear

Afkari was one of at least 267 people who were executed in Iran in 2020.

A report compiled by Iran Human Rights and advocacy group Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) concluded that Iran can boast of the highest number of confirmed executions in the world per capita, and that The Islamic Republic uses executions "as a tool to oppress political dissidents, including protesting citizens, ethnic minorities and journalists."

IHR's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam explained that the regime creates fear through the death penalty to maintain power, but that fear is now waning.

"Protests in recent years," he said in the report, "have shown that not only are people losing their sense of fear but they are also uniting in their anger against these executions."

While still grieving, Afkari's friends and family are dealing with further intimidation.

His former coach, Mohammad Ali Chamiani, says he has been warned not to talk about him, and just in case there is any misunderstanding, he's been banned from teaching wrestling, sacked by his gym and stripped of his benefits and insurance.

It's a humiliating end to Ali Chamiani's career; until recently, he was revered, considered on three separate occasions to be the top wrestling coach in the country.

The family is now concerned for the safety of their other sons in prison but they say that Afkari has prepared them to be strong.

Throughout the two years that he was imprisoned, family members say he was building them up, allaying their fears where possible and ensuring that they'd be able to continue his struggle when he was gone.

He knew that he was going to be put to death, but in his last night alive, his family says he called them to say that he was doing OK, asking them not to worry.

United for Navid

Afkari may be gone, but his voice is now louder than ever. The recording of him defiantly challenging the judge can be found all over social media, so, too, an audio recording that he made while he was in jail.

"During all the years that I wrestled," he states calmly, "I never faced a cowardly opponent who played dirty because wrestling is an inherently honorable sport. But it's been two years that my family and I have had to face off against injustice and the most cowardly and dishonorable opponent."

Upon realizing that his legal challenge was destined to fail, he concluded, "They are just looking for a neck to throw their noose around."

One of his most prominent supporters is Masih Alinejad, an exiled Iranian journalist, author and political activist, who's now living in New York.

She never met Afkari, but she later learned that he had reached out to her during the protests.

People protest against Iran's death penalty opposite Downing Street as a march to demand a people's vote against Brexit passes by on October 2018 in London, England.

On February 12, 2018, Alinejad had posted an image on Instagram of an Iranian woman who'd been arrested for protesting the compulsory headscarf (Hijab) law.

Among the list of 1,648 comments was one from Afkari, whose public courage and audacity would have been inconceivable to many in Iran.

In Farsi, he posted a direct attack on the Supreme Leader, a line which translates to "I spit on your rotten soul." Alinejad's original post received over 71,000 likes and could have been seen by any of her five million followers.

Alinejad told CNN that it was Afkari's brief comment, quickly lost in the sea of social media, that has posthumously formed such an unbreakable bond between them.

"I was shocked at how brave he was," she told CNN Sport. "He cursed the Supreme Leader of Iran, in public, under his own name. That is why I care so much about Navid. That actually breaks my heart. I did my best, but sometimes I feel miserable and frustrated that we couldn't save him.

"We have so many Navids now fighting for freedom," Alinejad explained, "fighting for equality, fighting for justice, fighting for dignity, fighting to have a normal life, fighting to get rid of dictatorship."

Alinejad believes that the government viewed Afkari as a threat and moved quickly to silence him, using his execution as a deterrent to others, adding, "His only crime was just joining Iran protests and that scares the government. The government actually wanted to create fear within the society."

But his execution might prove to have been a miscalculation; it may have backfired.

Alinejad is the campaign founder of United for Navid, an action group that is keeping his voice alive.

Afkari's sacrifice has motivated many Iranian athletes to find the courage to step up and speak out; while some want politics to be separated from sport in their country, all agree on the need for even greater reforms.

She understands the risks that many of them are taking.

"Sometimes, when you keep silent, they can execute you. Sometimes, when you speak up, they can execute you. So that is why we have to do something beyond just talking about Navid, talking about his goal. He wanted to have greater freedom. He wanted to have a better country [in which] to live."

Iranian-American supporters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) protest the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by Iran, in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. in September 2020.

The execution ended the life of Afkari, but it has failed to silence his voice. He continues speaking from beyond the grave: "If there's one thing I learned from stepping onto the wrestling mat," he was recorded saying in jail, "it's that I should never give into oppression and lies."

That spirit seems to be alive in his family; despite enormous pressure to comply with the government and blacken Afkari's name, they are standing firm.

"We care about the good thing that we have to do. We care about our goal, rather than think about the tortures and fear," said his relative, adding that Afkari's mother is torn between conflicting emotions.

"She has two feelings right now. She's so sad for losing Navid. And secondly, she's so proud of Navid because she knows that Navid chose the right path."

Afkari has become larger in death than he ever was in life. Pashaei concludes that the campaign of which he is a spokesman is now an unstoppable force.

"They thought that by killing this guy, they can bury his name like his body. But it never happened. Now, we see that he's a champ. He's a hero for millions of young athletes. He's everywhere now."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Athletes are trained to be tough; they've learned to push through the pain barrier and find courage when all hope might seem to be lost.

But athletes in Iran have to be braver than most. For them, the battle isn't just on the field of play, it's also away from the arenas, where the consequences of their actions could be painful, even deadly.

"I am 100% fearful," judoka Vahid Sarlak tells CNN Sport. He knows fighting for his beliefs could end badly in a country where political activists and their families are routinely intimidated, arrested and can even be executed.

"Every day, my mom asks me not to do this, she is worried daily. But I say, 'I was born once, and I'll die once.' I have sworn that I'll fight for my freedom for as long as I'm alive."

When asked to detail the kind of threats that she is facing, the soccer player Shiva Amini tries to make light of it, telling CNN: "SMS messages, such as 'We will cut your head off and send a picture of it to your family.' Do you want just one example, or do you want to hear the rest?"

They used to say that sport and politics shouldn't mix, but those days seem to be a distant memory. In many parts of the western world, athletes are now using their platforms to shape social and political discourse.

In Iran, sport and politics have always mixed, but it's the theocratic government that makes the rules and enforces them through fear.

The former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei knows exactly what can be at stake; he campaigned to try and save the life of wrestler Navid Afkari, who was executed in 2020.

Afkari's death became a rallying cry for athletes in Iran to unite and push for change in a campaign called 'United for Navid.'

"If we be silenced today, we don't have anything to tell our children tomorrow," Pashaei told CNN.

All three are now living in self-imposed exile abroad, where it's a little safer to be outspoken; all are brave, but all have been traumatized by years of harassment and intimidation.

When asked if he fears for his life, the former karate international champion Mahdi Jafargholizadeh scoffed at the suggestion: "I died 20 years ago. I lost everything when I was in Iran. If you kill me again, you just killed a dead person."

In 2017, soccer player Shiva Amini was forced to apply for asylum in Switzerland because she was observed playing without the compulsory hijab while outside of Iran.

An eternal blow

Sarlak might be a judoka, but he could easily have been a poet.

"Have you ever been in love?" he asked CNN Sport. "Sport is love," he opined. "When you meet a girl for the first time, fall in love and then lose her, would it mean that you will never fall in love again? I'm sure you will, 100% sure. The next love will come."

At the age of 40, Sarlak is still madly in love with his sport. He says a life without sport would feel "the same as death." But he's had his heart broken more than once and in ways that most athletes couldn't even begin to imagine.

At the age of 17, he says he was ordered to lose by his team at the World Junior Championships. Deliberately losing is an alien concept to any athlete but it's not for Iranian athletes in international competitions.

When entering a tournament, they don't fear the prospect of running into a stronger opponent, their biggest concern is that an Israeli athlete lies ahead of them in the draw because their government's unwritten rule means that they're not going to be allowed to compete against them.

Sarlak says that the first time he was told to lose in 1998, he didn't give it much thought -- he was still so young. But when it happened at the 2005 World Championships in Cairo, he was absolutely devastated.

"It was the most difficult moment of my life," he recalled. "I was just crying and asking why? Why should I lose? I remember my coach slapped me and told me: 'You know that you have to go and lose the match.'"

Sarlak was fighting in the 60kg repechage and on course for a bronze medal; he'd been drawn against an opponent from Azerbaijan, but Israel's Gal Yekutiel was up next.

His coach delivered the news that no athlete would ever want to hear: "Your next opponent will be an Israeli, and we are not permitted to be in a match with Israelis."

Nearly 16 years after the event, Sarlak is still traumatized by it and the details of that day have been seared into his memory.

He says that the broadcast cameras were trained on him because they realized he'd thrown the match. His coach put a towel over his head and he was rushed back to the hotel, denying him the chance to watch the rest of the competition.

"I broke all the windows in my room," recalls Sarlak. "It was the worst day of my life. A hole opened inside of me and that hole is still open. The dream of having that medal has remained with me. I will never forgive them."

To add insult to injury, Sarlak says he's still taunted about it.

"Even now, when I see my Azeri opponent, he tells me, 'Your medal is on display at my house. Your medal is on my neck now. You didn't want it and I won it.' This will never be erased from my mind."

CNN has asked the Iranian government if it acknowledges that it has prevented athletes from competing against Israelis. We also asked if they will allow their athletes to compete against Israeli opponents at the Olympics this year. They have not responded to our inquiry.

Iran's Vahid Sarlak duels with Spain's Javier Fernandez in the up to and including 60 kgs men's open category during the World Judo Championships in Cairo in September 2005. Sarlak says he was forced to default from the tournament after he'd been drawn against an opponent from Israel.

'I'm not going back'

Jafargholizadeh had always wanted to be a karate champion. He says his father was the head coach of the national team, but he didn't believe in his son.

"I remember one day I was wearing his national team jacket," Jafargholizadeh told CNN Sport. "He just slapped me in the face and said, 'Who the hell are you? You get it yourself.'"

That was all the motivation that Mahdi needed. "OK, I said, I'll show you."

He was barely a teenager when one of the top teams in the country took an interest in him, and in time, he was competing internationally -- a national champion picking up more than 20 medals all over the world.

But Jafargholizadeh says it all came to a screeching halt when he was thrown in jail in 2004, arrested at the airport and accused of planning to be an Israeli spy. He says he was tortured and interrogated for five to six months and even threatened with the death penalty.

He relays the experience in a stream of consciousness and a smile that belies the suffering he endured.

"They break my nose, many different stuff that I don't even want to talk about."

He says the accusations were so incredulous that he didn't take them seriously at first, but it reached a point where he couldn't take it anymore and he started goading his tormentors to go make good on their threats.

"I never forget that I had a shirt with buttons," he recalled, gesturing that he ripped it open and declared: "Take your gun and shoot me here now. Or you want to hang me later on? Do it now!"

It's scarcely believable that Jafargholizadeh was eventually released from jail and able to resume his competitive career at the top level, fighting again at the 2005 and 2007 Asian championships and winning gold and silver medals with his team.

But after another brush with authority in 2008, he realized that it was no longer safe for him to remain in the country. His opposition to the government in Iran wasn't much of a secret, and he was perhaps something of a marked man.

According to Jafargholizadeh, the President of the Karate Federation, a man "who has been in the intelligence service for years and years," saw him with tattoos all over his body and declared it would be his last year with the national team.

"I take my last chance; I'm not going back again. I didn't go back. I left the national team in Germany and became a refugee," said Jafargholizadeh.

Forced to forfeit

Many young Iranians dream of becoming professional athletes, but they can't imagine the pitfalls that will come with their exposure to the international community.

"Every Iranian has a passport," explains Sarlak. "On the first page, it is written that you can travel to any country you would like to go -- except 'the occupied Palestine.'"

Sarlak says even speaking the name Israel just isn't done in Iran.

"We all know that, but the intensity of this problem is more obvious with athletes because we face situations with Israel. Ordinary people may not have to deal with it, [but] this problem is a flashpoint for athletes that will never go away."

It's well known that athletes from Iran are prevented from competing against Israelis -- in any competition.

In the main sports where they could have met at the Olympics -- boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling -- there has never once been a contest between athletes from either country.

It almost happened at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, when a swimmer from each country was drawn to race in the fourth heat of the first round of the 100-meter breaststroke. But the Iranian swimmer, Mohammad Alirezaei, never showed up.

In 2017, the wrestler Alireza Mohammad Karimimachiani was in a winning position against Russia's Alikhan Zhabrailov at the Under-23 World Championship in Poland, when his coach became animated on the sideline.

He can be seen and heard on the broadcast highlights calling from the floor: "Lose Ali!" The clip, which can still be viewed at UWW.Org, reveals an increasingly desperate coach imploring his athlete to throw in the towel: "Alireza! Lose Alireza! Alireza! You must lose! Alireza, you must lose! Israel won. Israel has won."

The Israeli Uri Kalashnikov had just beaten the American Samuel Brooks and was awaiting the winner in the next round. It was the second time in his career that Karimimachiani says he had been told to lose, later he told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency that "my whole world seemed to come to an end."

Iran's Saeid Mollaei (in white) fights against Belgium's Matthias Casse during the semifinal of the men's under 81kg category during the 2019 Judo World Championships at the Nippon Budokan, a venue for the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Mollaei, who claimed he was ordered to deliberately lose a world championship fight, could compete under a refugee flag at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, officials said on September 1.

A much clearer instruction can be heard in an audio recording made at the 2019 World Judo Championships in Tokyo, when Saeid Mollaei was ordered to lose his semifinal in order to steer clear of the Israeli world champion Sagi Muki.

"Based on my stance, that of the regime and that of the minister, he has no right to compete," says the president of Iran's Judo Federation in the recording.

The ambient noise of the competition is audible in the background as he concludes with a scarcely veiled threat: "The circumstances stipulate that one should never question this stance. Make him understand that he has no right to compete under no circumstances. He is responsible for his actions."

Sarlak now lives in Germany; he breaks down in tears and leaves the interview when explaining that he hasn't been able to see his parents for 12 years. Jafargholizadeh resides in the mountains of Finland and the 1998 junior world Greco-Roman wrestling champion Pashaei is exiled in the US.

He fled in 2008, when it became apparent that his Kurdish ethnicity and the connection to his politically active father was shutting down career opportunities.

As a coach, he says he was barred from traveling out of the country with the national team.

A year before he made the decision to flee the country, he witnessed one of his wrestlers being denied the chance to fight; he told CNN that he watched from a distance as Babak Ghorbani was given the news.

"He was sitting on the stage in the stadium and he couldn't believe it. He was crying and crying. He was telling me, 'You know how hard I worked! I don't deserve this!'

"This is not just about losing one match, it affects your whole life. Your dignity has been taken away by other people, people who are usually members of the intelligence service who don't know the pain of being an athlete. This is sport, it has to be about peace and friendship, but they teach you to hate."

'Girls had no value'

Many countries would be delighted to see their athletes and teams triumph on the world stage.

In the purest sense, sporting success can be a boost to domestic morale, but it can also be used as a means of wielding soft power on the international stage. Sport is a good way to make friends and influence people -- and so they're willing to make heavy investments or even cheat to achieve those ends.

Iranian athletes have come to realize, though, that the opposite is true for them. Iran seems to routinely sabotage its own sporting success and its female athletes are in no doubt about that.

They often feel as though they have to compete with one hand tied behind their backs -- that's if they're allowed to compete at all.

Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran hasn't sent a female athlete to compete at the Olympics in swimming, wrestling or gymnastics, none of which would be possible while wearing the compulsory hijab

Shiva Amini says her proudest achievement with the national women's soccer team was at the 2009 Indoor Asian Games in Vietnam, where her Futsal team beat Uzbekistan and Japan to win their group, before losing to Jordan in the semifinals.

"With all the difficulties of wearing a hijab, in the heat in Vietnam, we were able to win," she explained to CNN. "Despite all the difficulties, because of the love we have for football and sport, we could fight and be just like any other girls."

Amini details the inconvenience of competing in a hijab, how it restricts the ability to move and how it becomes heavy with sweat: "We had a hard time even breathing."

And if the scarf became loose or if the sleeves rolled up their arms, the referee would blow the whistle to stop the game and a scoring opportunity might have been lost.

Amini, who was regarded as the most technically gifted player in the women's game in Iran, says that she and the female team were made to feel as if their status was little more than token.

"I started to realize that I am in a society that they fundamentally do not want a girl to advance," she said, outlining the experience of sharing a national training camp with the men's team and being told to remain on the sidelines.

"I asked the head of the federation why you aren't giving us the facilities and he responded by saying, 'The team only exists so that FIFA [football's world governing body] wouldn't eliminate the boys team according to their regulations.' I realized that us girls had no value. It was an insult and a humiliation."

In 2017, Amini was playing football in Switzerland and she posted pictures of it on her social media accounts.

Given that she wasn't on official business with the country of Iran, she didn't give it a second thought, until the pictures appeared everywhere back home and caused a storm of controversy: she wasn't wearing her hijab and she was playing with "anti-Islam" teams.

"For a few weeks, the entire internet was filled with stories about me," Amini told CNN. "It created a very bad situation for my family in Iran and myself in Switzerland."

She hired lawyers in both countries, but soon came to realize that the situation was now beyond her control.

"They have fully politicized this event and put your name on a blacklist in Iran," she said she was told. "I was not prepared to deal with what was about to happen, my life was about to fully change in all aspects, I did not have a good mental condition."

Amini has not been home since and says both she and her family are routinely harassed and intimidated.

Campaigning for justice

In September 2020, a dreadful event motivated these four athletes and many others to come together and tell their stories.

The execution of wrestler Afkari -- capital punishment for a murder that his family and friends say that he did not commit -- galvanized the sports community and spurred it into action.

Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee and the Executive Board at the IOC, calling for immediate action to be taken against the National Olympic Committee of Iran.

In letters sent on March 5, March 25 and April 19, United for Navid has provided the names and case studies of 20 athletes who've been negatively impacted by political interference in Iran.

"We have a simple question," states the United for Navid campaign spokesman Pashaei: "Can IOC member states torture and arrest athletes and violate the [Olympic] charter? Are you doing anything to protect these athletes? Because their rights are being discriminated against every single day."

IOC President Thomas Bach speaks during a press conference in Tokyo on November 16, 2020. Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Bach, calling for immediate action to be taken against the NOC of Iran.

According to the charter's Fundamental Principles of Olympism, "the practice of sport is a human right" and "sports organizations within the Olympic Movement shall apply political neutrality."

Access to sport should be enjoyed without "discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."

The charter concludes: "Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter."

In an impassioned plea, the emotion is clear in Pashaei's voice as he continues listing to CNN the many ways in which the integrity and safety of Iranian athletes is compromised by their own government.

"When they don't compete with Israeli athletes, they tell the IOC that this is their personal decision. It's a big lie. Every single trip, there are members of security intelligence watching the athletes 24/7 and if they do something wrong, they have been punished.

"I want to ask IOC, are you aware of this? You talk about gender equality and race equality. Are you aware that one of your members is violating the charter all the time? You have been silent about this; we're not going to be silenced."

A picture taken on March 8, 2021 in Lausanne shows the Olympic rings next to the headquarters of the IOC.

Of the 20 case studies that have been sent to the IOC so far, only 12 athletes have been identified. The names of eight others have been withheld to protect them, as they are still living in Iran.

Amini says those athletes fully support the campaign. "They are very happy with this movement. They encourage us, they push us forward. And the one thing they all say is, 'All of our hopes are in you guys,'" Amini told CNN.

There is an element of risk, also, for the athletes living outside of Iran -- many of them still have family at home.

"Once in a while they question our parents, brothers and sisters, they threaten them," says Pashaei. "But our families, all of them, believe that we're doing the right thing."

So far, the IOC's only response has been a tacit acknowledgment that they have received the documentation from the campaign.

In a March press conference, spokesman Mark Adams said: "I don't know to be honest, I think -- I believe -- we have. And as with all communications, it will be dealt with in due course, but it wasn't discussed at the Executive Board today. But trust us, it will be dealt with."

Former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei says there's "an element of risk" for athletes outside the country to campaign against Iran's NOC.

United for Navid is optimistic that the IOC will, ultimately, take action.

Earlier this year, their pressure campaign led to the International Judo Federation banning the Iran team for four years, but they're hoping that the action can be urgent.

In the letter dated March 25, Pashaei concludes with the line, "We look forward to your timely response. Every day that passes without action results in more athlete mistreatment."

Pashaei says there is evidence to suggest that the current head of Iran's Olympic Committee used to be a top-ranking member of Iran's intelligence agency, as detailed in a 2018 report from VOA/Radio Farda: "He was involved in arresting and torturing people. He is going to the Olympic Games."

"Even a little change will make a big difference," concludes Jafargholizadeh. He and the other campaigners are confident that action from arguably the biggest governing body in world sport would force Iran to take politics out of sport and treat the athletes better.

But it might take an Olympic ban to do it.

"A lot of people think we are against sport in Iran," he said, disputing that fact. "They have to know we have been athletes. We have been part of that national team for years and years. We just want to say, 'Stop torturing people and killing them.'"

"It's about our dignity," says Pashaei. "We're not going to give up. We're going to go to the end."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He came to Germany from Togo in 1995. Initially, he says, integration proved challenging -- "we didn't have a lot of interaction with people" -- but playing football provided a place where he could be himself.

"It was the first time where I had a smile on my face," adds Zinsou. "You are working hard everywhere to be part of society, but on the pitch, was always the moment where the language didn't play any role."

Zinsou is speaking to CNN Sport from his home in Munich. He talks proudly of doing well at school, being married to his German wife and father to two children. "Society ... gave me opportunities," he says.

Football still plays an important part in Zinsou's life -- he's Youth Coordinator for German football club Türkgücü Munich.

"My mission in life is teaching football," says Zinsou as he reflects on his role of overseeing Türkgücü's various youth teams. He sees that mission as not just developing talented footballers, but also teaching them valuable life skills.

Türkgücü Munich is making waves in Germany both on the sporting and political scene

A club for all

"Preserving traditions, connecting cultures," is Türkgücü's motto.

The club's crest is a mix of the Turkish and Bavarian flags and is an ode to the club's founding fathers -- Turkish immigrants, for whom Bavaria was home, and who established Türkgücü in 1975.

"I feel German, but I also love my Turkish roots," Ünal Tosun, one of Türkgücü's leading player, tells CNN Sport.

The world's largest Turkish diaspora can be found in Germany and Tosun, who is the son of Turkish immigrants, is a physical embodiment of Türkgücü's past, present and future.

"We have over three million Turkish people in Germany ... and they can also identify with me. We are an idol club for many immigrant clubs," the sharply trimmed midfielder Tosun says.

Beaming with pride as he describes playing for Türkgücü in his hometown of Munich, Tosun recounts receiving messages on Instagram from supporters in Turkey who he says "look up to us."

"We're not the typical local club," adds Türkgücü CEO Max Kothny. "If I look in the stands, there's so many people from so many cultures that it perfectly shows how the German culture is."

'The higher you go, the harder it gets'

Türkgücü's increased prominence -- both on and off the pitch -- owes itself, in part, to its rapid rise through the German football league structure.

Once an amateur team, Türkgücü now plays in the 3. Liga -- Germany's third division, which like the country's top two leagues is fully professional.

Remarkably Türkgücü now stands just two promotions away from Germany's elite league -- the Bundesliga. According to Der Spiegel in March 2020, the club's budget was $2 million. Türkgücü wouldn't confirm that figure, but did say it's "in the lower half in the table regarding the budgets in 3. Liga."

"The higher you go, the harder it gets," Kothny says with a wry smile.

Financial backing for the team has been largely provided by Hasan Kivran, a Turkish-born German, who previously played for the club, but is now a successful business entrepreneur and Türkgücü's president. Türkgücü wouldn't disclose how much Kivran has invested in the club.

"Being ambitious is not something bad -- it's something good," says Zinsou. "Following your goals is something good. Taking smart decisions to reach this goal is something good. Working with passion is something good."

Kivran intimated he was going to step down in late 2020, but then had a rethink.

"The main reasons that I changed my mind were those in charge of the company, a high level of fan support over the past two weeks and the prospect of a young talent center in southeast Munich," said Kivran in an interview with SPORT1 earlier this year.

Croatian striker Petar Sliskovic is one of a number of new arrivals at the club

Munich's second team?

Türkgücü is currently ninth in Germany's 3. Liga with 40 points, 18 behind leader Dynamo Dresden.

Germany's third division contains a number of clubs -- such as 1. FC Kaiserslautern and TSV 1860 München --- that have previously played in the Bundesliga.

That Türkgücü now plays against such clubs -- 1. FC Kaiserslautern is a four-time winner of the German top-flight league -- is testament to its rise through the German football ladder and its growing prominence.

"We've been working here since the sixth division, which is absolutely incredible!" Kothny says speaking to CNN Sport from a 15 square meter wooden portacabin that acts as the club's offices.

"This is a total start-up mentality," he adds.

Kothny says plans are afoot to build the club's own academy and training facilities, but for now this football start-up is currently without a stadium to call home.

'Home' matches are divided between the Grünwalder and the iconic Munich Olympic Stadium, one of the venues for the 1972 Olympic Games.

Playing at the Olympic Stadium -- Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich's former home before the club moved to the Allianz Arena -- Kothny and Tosun say they have to pinch themselves at times to remember the journey they've been on.

"Now we're playing in an arena which has 60,000 seats -- it's brilliant!" Kothny exclaims.

"There are so many good players who played there. They are so many important matches played there -- It's an honor," Tosun says.

Remodel and rebuild

Perhaps what's surprising is not just that Kothny is spearheading operations from relatively modest surroundings but that he's doing so at the age of 24.

"I think the future is on the young guns so I'm using it as an advantage," smiles Kothny.

"My way of thinking is a little bit different to the rest of this business, which is pretty much the same for the last like 20 years," adds Kothny, explaining how each season "we lose 80% of the roster" to ensure Türkgücü is competitive, given each promotion means the club will play against better teams.

Tosun joined the club in 2018, yet he's its longest-serving player and one of the few Turkish-German players left in the squad.

"We need to keep that factor in the history, in the portfolio of the club," says Zinsou.

"I mean, if there were somewhere a Togolese team playing in a high level, I would be very interested in joining them as well,' Zinsou says jokingly.

"Bavarian nowadays doesn't only mean that you have a German name [...] because the culture in Munich is mixed and it is rich.

"Our main focus is clearly on the quality of the players with the target to bring them to the first team," added Zinsou.

Over the last few years there has been a huge turnover of players with the aim of achieving direct promotion to 3. Liga, which signals thet scale of Türkgücü's ambition.

"That brought a lot of criticism also on us but this is how it worked. And I think the success proves that that this was the right way," says Kothny.

Fighting fear through football

Nonetheless Türkgücü's ascent and the club's strong Turkish associations have drawn plenty of attention.

Inspiring and imaginative to some; divisive and disruptive to others, the club has become a target of some far-right groups in Germany.

The extreme-right Der III. Weg -- The Third Way -- party, has been vocal about Türkgücü.

According to the German Interior Ministry, the "ideological statements of the party "The III. Way" are shaped from historical National Socialism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia."

The far-right group's website in October showed a photo of two men, one holding The Third Way flag, displaying a "Türkgücü is not welcome" banner outside Zwickau's stadium.

Underneath the photo was the statement, "Whether in Zwickau, Magdeburg or anywhere else: a Turkish team has no place in German football. The message is clear in Magdeburg and among fans of the FCM: Türkgücü is not welcome."

"We were unfortunately already prepared as far as we knew that things like that might happen," Kothny says. "Sometimes it is a burden to have the Turkish flag in your logo.

"A lot of [users on] social media are saying go back to Turkey or play in the Super Lig, but they are not realizing the background," adds Kothny, referring to the Turkish top-flight soccer division.

He also recounts how small groups of far-right supporters gathered ahead of the away game against FSV Zwickau in October in Saxony.

And when Türkgücü played 1. FC Kaiserslautern in January, racist and xenophobic stickers and flyers were put up in the vicinity of the Fritz Walter Stadium.

The club's recent rapid rise has seen it targeted by far-right supporters

Both FSV Zwickau and 1. FC Kaiserslautern took to social media to stand in solidarity with Türkgücü.

And Rainer Keßler, chairman of the supervisory board of 1. FC Kaiserslautern, said in a statement: "It is intolerable that right-wing groups try to misuse 1. FC Kaiserslautern's name, history, values and the Fritz-Walter-Stadion in the defense of inhuman slogans and ideologies. The FCK family stands for a multicultural society and expressly distances itself from nationalist ideas."

Meanwhile, in another game against SV Waldhof Mannheim in April 2020, Türkgücü player Yi-Young Park reportedly told the referee that he had been repeatedly racially insulted from the spectator area.

Mannheim was subsequently fined $2,900 by the German Football Association (DFB) for the behavior of its fans.

Kothny admits that messages at those games are "not the most brutal thing that I've read on a banner. We get letters from people all around Germany here to our post box. We get emails which are brutal, which is really like far right things against the club."

Despite the wider political landscape, Kothny says he is adamant that the club has to maintain its neutrality.

"We try not to give those people a platform [...] because then they get exactly what they want and this is awareness.

"We try to always give the answer on the pitch because this is what counts in sports. As soon as we move in one political direction, this will not turn out well for us."

Integration

The philosophy of Türkgücü's youth setup -- the club has five youth teams, which Zinsou oversees, emphasizes the teaching of life as much as soccer skills.

"This is a package for life, it's not only for football," says Zinsou, as he talks about Türkgücü's various youth teams.

"When you talk about integration, it's always on both parts. I need to go one step further and people will do a step in my direction so that we meet somewhere in the middle."

That message is one shared by Claudemir Jeronimo Barreto, known as Cacau, the Brazil-born former Germany international who played for Türkgücu, and was integration officer for the DFB until January.

While working for the DFB, Cacau was active in supporting the organization's work with refugees. According to the DFB, a scheme the association set up enabled 60,000 refugees to play football competitively in German.

In the summer of 2019, Cacau also traveled to Ostritz at the invitation of the local football club and worked alongside Michael Kretschmer -- Minister-President of the Free State of Saxony -- against a right-wing extremist rally

Tosun is hoping that he too can deliver a lasting legacy for generations to come.

"I want to be a role model with my mentality. I want to be a role model for younger players and want to help [them] achieve the same goal that I achieve," as he reflected on his career and the example he wants to set.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Harrow, Australia (CNN) Growing up in the small community of Harrow in southern Australia, 86-year-old Lachie Turner spent his childhood hearing legends of the great Aboriginal cricketer Johnny Mullagh.

"The story used to be that he could win a match, batting with just the handle of a pickaxe," said Turner, with a smile.

Mullagh was a hero in Harrow, and the surrounding livestock communities, where homesteads dot the landscape along miles of single-lane dirt roads.

At a time when being Indigenous meant you could be thrown off your land, forced into Christian missions or even shot, Mullagh -- of the Jardwadjali people from western Victoria -- grew from being a farmhand on a local estate to a world-famous cricket player.

Yet until recently, most Australians didn't know Mullagh's story, or anything about the journey that took him and 12 Aboriginal cricketers from farmsteads in Victoria, to Melbourne, Sydney and then, finally, England in 1868 -- making them Australia's first sporting team to play overseas.

But when the Aboriginal cricket team returned in 1869, their achievements couldn't save them from the institutional racism shown by colonizers towards First Nations people. Most of the team were immediately placed in missions, away from their communities and their homes. When they died some were buried in unmarked graves.

They were never paid for their historic tour.

Now, more than a century later, Australia's cricketing bodies are seeking to give the Indigenous team the recognition they deserve. The team is increasingly referred to as "Australia's First XI," a term usually reserved for a region's best cricket line-up.

On the 150th anniversary of their England tour in 2018, an all-Indigneous team was sent to the UK in their honor -- with each young player taking the name of one of Australia's First XI. Last December, Mullagh, whose Aboriginal name was Unaarrimin, was inducted into Australia's cricketing Hall of Fame and a medal created in his honor.

Paul Stewart, deputy chief executive of Australia's Lowitja Institute and a Taungurung man from central Victoria, said he felt both "pride and sadness" when he thought of the story of Australia's First XI, and what they accomplished.

"Off field it was a sad story, on the field it's a bloody ripper of a story," he said.

Colonization

All but two of the members of the First XI came from the same region in western Victoria, which had been home to Australia's Indigenous people for tens of thousands of years.

Some were part of the last generation to live in Australia before the white colonizers drove them off their land and destroyed their way of life.

Yanggendyinanyuk, also known as Dick-A-Dick, who played in the England tour, was born in the 1830s, and for about the first 10 years of his life he lived on the land with his people, the Wotjobaluk, according to his great-great-grandson Richard Kennedy.

Yanggendyinanyuk was a child when large numbers of white settlers began to arrive in the region. The colonists pushed Aboriginal people off their land and depleted or wiped out their traditional sources of food. In 1866, local newspaper the Hamilton Spectator published a letter from one settler boasting how he and other landholders had, in the past five years, killed more than 150,000 kangaroos, which they viewed as pests that ate grass needed for livestock. Native grains and vegetables were destroyed by the hooves of European cattle.

Without their traditional food sources, Kennedy said some Aboriginal people began to take sheep from farms. If caught, they and their families could be shot. The University of Newcastle's map of colonial frontier massacres in Australia -- still incomplete -- records 56 massacres of over 1,200 Aboriginal people by colonizers in what is now the state of Victoria. The atrocities that have recorded so far occurred in that region between 1834 and 1859.

Indigenous communities never recovered fully from colonization. Today, Kennedy said that he is one of about 10 people who can speak the Wotjobaluk language.

In an attempt to stay on their land, some Indigenous Australians worked on the farms and homesteads which were sprouting up across western Victoria during this period, according to Josie Sangster, curator at the Harrow Discovery Center. They were given food and board by the white settlers but weren't paid.

Among those station hands was Mullagh. Little is known about his early years, except that he was born in 1843 and in the early 1860s worked mostly on two stations -- Pine Hills and Mullagh -- where he got his name, according to Sangster.

Kennedy's ancestor, Yanggendyinanyuk, worked at Mt Elgin station for a time as a boundary rider, the worker responsible for checking and patrolling perimeter fences.

In their spare time on these stations, White Australian farmers would play cricket to unwind. And slowly, they began to teach their Aboriginal workers the game.

Humble beginnings

The western Victorian farmers weren't the first settlers to teach their Aboriginal workers how to play cricket.

In their book Cricket Walkabout, which tells the story of Australia's First XI, Rex Harcourt and John Mulvaney give examples of Aboriginal cricket players from as far back as the early 1850s. But none achieved the success of the team from western Victoria.

Sangster said homestead owners around Harrow quickly noticed their Aboriginal workers had a natural talent for cricket. Soon, landholders started talking about forming an all-Indigenous cricket team to play the local White farmers. Mullagh was selected with one of the homesteaders, William Hayman, as team manager.

In January 1866, less than a year after coming together, the Aboriginals played against a team of White players from Edenhope -- and won.

Hayman then took the team south to the regional hub of Hamilton, where they thrashed the local club 123 runs to 66, according to Cricket Walkabout. Mullagh alone took five wickets. "Within a couple of years they were beating teams, people who had played cricket all their lives," said Kennedy.

Richard Kennedy, the great great grandson of Australian Aboriginal cricketer Yanggendyinanyuk, in Ballarat, Australia, in January 2021.

Word spread of the Aboriginal team's success, partly thanks to canny marketing by Hayman who, according to Mulvaney and Harcourt, sent photographs of the Indigenous team in their uniforms to his cricketing contacts in Melbourne.

After a handful of wins in rural Victoria, the Indigenous players were invited to appear in Melbourne on Boxing Day, at one of Australia's most prestigious venues -- the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Hayman hired sportsman Tom Wills to coach the team for the big match. Wills was known for his prowess in cricket and rugby, and would go on to co-found the Australian Football League, or Aussie Rules.

The composition of the team changed during the first season. A photograph from the Melbourne Cricket Ground in December 1866 shows Mullagh, as well as Kennedy's ancestor Yanggendyinanyuk, who Sangster said joined the team sometime that year, after other players fell sick while traveling between towns.

Five others in the photo were also part of the England tour, including Zellanach, Bripumyarrimin, Brimbunyah, Bullchanach and Arrahmunyjarrimin. Like Mullagh and Yanggendyinanyuk, all five had been previously given English names -- Johnny Cuzens, King Cole, Redcap, Bullocky and Peter.

On Boxing Day, the Aboriginals lost to the top local team at the Melbourne Cricket Club, but in other ways the match was a massive success. An article in Melbourne newspaper The Age the next day estimated that about 10,000 people had watched the game, a remarkable turnout given the population of Melbourne in 1861 was only about 140,000.

It was seen as something of a spectacle at the time. "It was quite manifest throughout the play that the sympathies of the public were enlisted on the side of the Aboriginals," the article from The Age said.

Businessman W.E.B. Gurnett, who saw the team play at the Boxing Day test, took a close interest in the team -- and their potential profitability. He convinced Hayman and Wills to take them on a tour of Victoria and New South Wales.

Gurnett said there was even the possibility for a tour to England.

The five-month Australia tour began in Melbourne in January 1867, and went more or less without incident until it reached Sydney in March, where it all rapidly fell apart.

Harrow Discovery Center's Sangster said that Gurnett ran off with all the money earned from ticket sales and left Wills, Hayman and the Aboriginal cricketers stranded.

During their time in Sydney, the team had stayed at a pub at Manly Beach, in Sydney, named the Pier Hotel, which was owned by Charles Lawrence, an old friend of Wills.

Lawrence was a former cricketer who played in the English team's first tour of Australia in 1861-62. When Lawrence's teammates returned to England, he stayed behind to "lift the level of cricket in Australia," according to his great-great-grandson Ian Friend.

He took a liking to the Aboriginal cricket team and, along with two Sydney businessmen, George Graham and George Smith, offered to help finance a tour of England for the Aboriginal team -- provided Lawrence coached them.

Going 'fishing'

There is one glaring gap in the story of Australia's First XI -- almost no record exists of what the Aboriginal players thought of their journey.

None of the players wrote letters, or at least any that have survived, and even the few who had sporting careers after the tour didn't speak at length about their experiences.

Much of what is known of the Aboriginal cricket team's almost two year-long tour of Victoria, New South Wales and then England is recorded by Lawrence, their White coach, in his memoirs, and press clippings in Australian and English papers.

Kennedy said he had no idea what his great-great-grandfather thought of his role in Australia's sporting history, a fact which he finds deeply sad.

There is no record of how the cricketers felt about being smuggled out of Victoria to begin their tour. In the late 1860s, the Victorian board tasked with managing the local Aboriginal population ruled the team couldn't leave the colony to play a game in the neighboring state of New South Wales.

No reason was given why. The men were adults at the time, Mullagh was about 27 and Kennedy's ancestor, Yanggendyinanyuk, was about 35, according to the Australian Dictionary of Biography

Harrow's Sangster said the board was likely concerned the Indigenous men would pick up potentially deadly diseases, a justified fear given several players became ill during the initial tour in 1866 and 1867. Lawrence decided to take them anyway.

Lawrence smuggled the cricket team out on a boat from the Victorian city of Queenscliff, secretly sailing north to New South Wales to continue to the tour under the alibi of taking them out on a "fishing" trip.

The Englishman's great-great-grandson, Friend, said Lawrence had a genuine affection for the players. "(He) loved these guys, wanted to teach them how to play, and take them back to England to teach them cricket," he said. "(At night) he went down and slept in the cabin next to them because he was worried they might be a bit scared in the water."

But Sangster, who maintains the museum to the First XI in Harrow, said that when people are told the story of the escape from Victoria, their reactions vary.

"(Some say) how great, glad they got away from the Board of Protection, but also (some say) well, were they happy to go? They were being taken from their country ... were they happy to be doing it?" she said.

The England tour

Just over two years after they beat the local Hamilton team, Mullagh and his team were finally on a boat to England.

The team left Sydney on February 8, 1868, aboard the Parramatta, a three-masted clipper which carried wool as well as passengers, and arrived in England three months later on May 13, according to Sangster. For a group of men who had lived almost their entire lives on land, Lawrence said in his memoirs that they took to the long sea voyage surprisingly well.

"I took a good supply of copy books and endeavored to teach them to write and read. I gave them lessons every morning but this did not last long, for they soon tired and amused themselves in drawing trees, birds and all kinds of animals," he said.

The tour itself was grueling -- in less than five months, the Indigenous team played 47 games all across England, more than two a week. The team held their own. Out of 47 games they won 14 and lost 14, with the rest ending in draws. Some of the great English cricketers of the day praised the Aboriginal team, especially Mullagh and Zellanach.

"(Cricket icon) W. G. Grace, who was a young doctor at the time ... thought they were magnificent, even wanted to keep Mullagh in England," said Sangster.

But it wasn't just the cricket that drew crowds in 19th century England, according to Sangster. It was commonplace for cricket players to put on athletic sideshows -- and it was no different for the Indigenous team. Posters from events in Nottingham and London advertized the team's extra special skills, including "throwing boomerangs and spears." Kennedy's ancestor, Yanggendyinanyuk, was also lauded for his ability to dodge cricket balls using a traditional Aboriginal shield.

These displays were very popular. Lawrence wrote in his memoirs that during a match in Liverpool, a "boisterous wind" slammed a boomerang into a spectator's head. Lawrence asked the bleeding man if he needed help. "You go on with the throwing," the man said, according to Lawrence.

Pages from the diary of Charles Lawrence, coach of the 1868 Aboriginal team and one of the chief recorders of the historic tour.

The Lowitja Institute's Stewart said there was undeniably a "sideshow" element to the games. "Were they respected for who they were? Were they treated the same way as (Australian cricketer) Tom Wills and his mates were?" he said.

But Kennedy, Yanggendyinanyuk's descendent, said the team wanted to show their culture to a new audience. "I believe part of the going overseas was to basically look at a new culture and to learn about it," he said.

Among the successes of the tour, however, there were tragedies. On June 24, Bripumyarrimin, known as King Cole, died in London and was buried in a local cemetery. According to Harcourt and Mulvaney, his death was likely due to tuberculosis. Sangster said the players were not given time off to mourn Bripumyarrimin's death.

There were also incidents of racism, although only a few have been recorded. For example, in one hotel in Gravesend, Lawrence was furious to discover the Aboriginal cricketers had been charged more than twice the normal rate, and the landlord had requested separate linen be brought in for the Indigenous Australians.

The tour was initially a financial success, according to financier Graham's detailed records, with the first game at the Oval on May 25 bringing in 603 pounds alone -- the equivalent of about 70,000 pounds ($97,000) in 2020, according to the Bank of England.

But interest dwindled in the last dozen or so matches, with all but one game earning less than 100 pounds. In the end, the tour of England was considered to be a financial loss, with Graham claiming to have lost over 2,000 pounds, according to Harcourt and Mulvaney.

The only money the Aboriginal players made was won taking part in the athletics contests. At the end of the tour, Yanggendyinanyuk made one of the only remarks recorded from the Aboriginal players on journey. "We thank you from our hearts," he said.

'World famed cricketer'

The team arrived home in February 1869 to new rules and regulations for Aboriginal people. "The country that they left is not the country that they came back to," said Sangster.

The Victorian government had passed legislation to create the Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines, and large numbers of the state's Aboriginal people were placed into government and church-run missions, sometimes far from their homes.

It was seen as a kindness by the racist administrators at the time, but in practice became a method of cultural extermination. Lawrence Bamblett, co-director at the Australian National University's Australian Centre for Indigenous History and a Wiradjuri man, said the purpose of the missions "was to turn Aborigines into white people."

Of the Victorian players, only Johnny Mullagh and Zellanach, or Johnny Cuzens, were taken on by professional cricket teams. The Melbourne Cricket Club hired them as training help for the White cricketers, Sangster said, but the contracts were only for a few months and both Mullagh and Zellanach quickly got ill. Eventually, they returned to western Victoria, where the rest of their team had been put into missions.

Yanggendyinanyuk, Kennedy's ancestor, was put into Ebenezer Mission in western Victoria after he returned from England. "(He was left) with no life, no ability to be able to do anything, no ability to earn any money, only earn enough to help the family survive. It's just it's an incredible thing," said Kennedy.

For years, Kennedy and his family didn't know when Yanggendyinanyuk died, because their ancestor had been mixed up with another Aboriginal man when the two were taken to hospital for treatment for measles. He died in 1886.

"A lot of the (Aboriginal cricket players), we don't know where they were buried, their death wasn't recorded and they weren't given a proper burial, let alone a marker where they were buried," Sangster said.

Kennedy said that, growing up, his ancestor's remarkable journey had just been a story that no one really believed. But as he got older, and discussing his Aboriginal heritage was no longer a taboo, he discovered what happened to Yanggendyinanyuk. He said the story of his ancestor was one of great tragedy, resilience and pride.

"You've lost your lands, you've lost your culture, earlier you would have been seeing family getting killed ... To survive that, to adjust to a new culture, yeah it's remarkable story," he said.

Bamblett said while the story of the 1868 cricket team was sometimes seen as one of exploitation, to him and generations of young Aboriginal men and women, all the players were "heroic figures."

"Australia has always been telling Aboriginals are passive victims but we don't see it that way. In our stories, we're always the heroes," he said. "That doesn't mean that the white people didn't exploit them, it may have meant they were exploited in a way that they didn't care about."

Bamblett said that when he was growing up, and first heard the story of the First XI, he was fascinated. "The idea that the first cricket team from England to Australia was Aboriginal -- I absolutely loved it. There was only one first team and it wasn't you (white people), it was us," he said.

Yanggendyinanyuk's Kennedy said he's glad the Aboriginal cricket team is now beginning to get the recognition it deserves.

"It was a massive loss of this pride that they would have had, and really it's Australia's pride that we've lost, too ... One of the things that I'm trying to do, is to get this back known around Australia as a prideful event," he said.

The grave of Johnny Mullagh in the Australian town of Harrow, Victoria, where he was buried after he died in 1891.

On the approach to the town of Harrow, there is a small graveyard on a hill which overlooks a river valley and a patchwork of surrounding homesteads.

Lachy Turner knows it well. He dug graves there until his retirement, carrying on the work of his grandfather who was around in 1891 when Mullagh died around the age of 48. Turner said it was his grandfather who dug Mullagh's grave.

The cricketing hero was laid to rest in the pauper's section. While the rest of the graves have small, unmarked metal crosses, for Mullagh, the town raised enough money at the time of his death to buy him a three-foot high marble tombstone.

Under the lights at Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1971, Ali was once again fighting for the world title and, for many fans, boxing's true heavyweight champion had finally returned from exile.

Banished as one of the most electrifying and polarizing figures of the late 1960s, Ali had become the face of protest, and the man to unite the anti-war movement with the ongoing struggle for civil rights and racial equality.

Seconds out, round one

For the "Fight of the Century," everyone who was anyone sat ringside.

There was Frank Sinatra, hanging on the ring apron as a photographer for Life magazine; and writer Norman Mailer putting words to the action. Singers and actors -- Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman and Sammy Davis Jr -- sprinkled stardust over the proceedings.

"I remember the announcer saying, 'I'm not going to make any introductions,' everybody's here!" recalls Mike Silver, boxing historian and author of "The Arc of Boxing" and "The Night the Referee Hit Back," who was in attendance at the fight 50 years ago.

"This huge 20,000 plus fraternity of people were just generating this electricity and anticipation," Silver tells CNN Sport.

"Three hundred million people throughout the world saw this fight on television, in Africa and Asia, Europe, Japan, China ... When that first bell rang, a roar went up, a roar!"

"This wasn't just a prize fight," says boxing author Mike Silver. "This had other dimensions to it: the dimensions of race, politics, the Vietnam War."

Cassius Clay -- the young man from Kentucky who would become Ali -- won gold at the 1960 Rome Olympics, before climbing to the top of the professional game with footwork and wit that dazzled, infuriated and ultimately changed heavyweight boxing.

Frazier -- an Olympic gold medalist at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics -- had grown up on a sharecropper's farm in South Carolina.

"Smokin" Joe moved to Philadelphia, where he worked in a meat locker beating sides of beef with his fists -- the inspiration for a storyline in the film Rocky.

After Clay beat champion Sonny Liston, he changed his name and spent three years ruling the heavyweight division. But, after refusing induction into the military, Ali was stripped of the title in 1967.

In Ali's absence, Frazier won the world heavyweight crown, defeating Jimmy Ellis in 1970. Frazier also lent Ali money while he was excluded from the sport and campaigned both publicly and privately for the former champion to be cleared to box.

'Denied simple human rights'

"A heavyweight championship was more important sometimes than a presidential election," says Silver. "Certain fights, Johnson vs. Jeffries, Dempsey vs. Tunney, Ali vs. Frazier ... It was more in the public consciousness."

Silver describes the fight between Ali and Frazier -- two undefeated heavyweight champions coming together -- as unprecedented in the history of boxing due to the bout's wider significance.

"This wasn't just a prize fight," reflects Silver. "This had other dimensions to it: the dimensions of race, politics, the Vietnam War."

Ever since Ali won the world title, he had courted controversy.

As the newly-crowned heavyweight champion he had thrown off his "slave name" and while congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Ali joined a Black separatist group that rejected racial integration.

In 1966, US armed forces entered their fifth year in Vietnam and the government expanded the military draft.

Ali requested to be excluded, as a conscientious objector, but was denied. Staying true to his convictions at his scheduled induction in 1967, he was arrested, found guilty at the subsequent trial, and sentenced to five years in prison and handed a $10,000 fine.

"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam, while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?" Ali had asked.

Among other things, Ali was "vilified for being outspoken," according to academic Dr. Amira Rose Davis.

So the heavyweight title was taken from him, as was his passport, and boxing commissions refused to license him to fight.

On the floor of the US Congress in 1967, Republican Robert Michael said: "He may look upon himself as 'the greatest,' but I am sure history will look upon him as 'the least' of all men who have held the once honorable title of heavyweight champion of the world."

Dr. Amira Rose Davis, professor of history and African American studies at Penn State University, says "a lot of leaders were terrified" of Ali.

"He was vilified for his opposition to the war, vilified for being outspoken, and vilified for connections with the Nation of Islam," adds Davis.

In August 1970, Ali was permitted a license to fight in Atlanta, and the former champion was back in boxing, winning bouts against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena. Later in 1971 -- after the "Fight of the Century" -- the US Supreme Court overturned Ali's conviction in an 8-0 ruling.

"Ali made himself into somebody who's very significant in terms of his ability to command an audience," says Davis.

"To have the cameras on him and to use those cameras to speak hard truths about what it's like to be a Black man in the US, to talk about foreign policy, particularly the war.

"Because of his status, he also gets the opportunity to go on these late-night talk shows and to have cameras in his face and he never shies away from talking about civil rights or talking about police brutality.

"He's important because he allows us to see so many fractures and divisions. There are so many people that saw him as a man of the people, that saw him as a mouthpiece for their struggles."

'Cannon fodder for the state'

As opposition to the war grew, Ali's draft case also helped reveal the disproportionate number of African Americans dying in Vietnam.

"He opposed the war," says Davis. "But he also gave new arguments for its opposition. He connected the opposition to the war within a framework about the treatment of Black Americans. He talked about not being cannon fodder for the state and not being a pawn."

Frazier rose to prominence in the years Ali was absent from the ring, but he also found himself becoming a foil to the more controversial Ali.

"He [Frazier] comes to symbolize a kind of more complacent, conservative America," says Davis. "And the fight then takes on this larger meaning about the very fabric of the country and what side is going to be dominant in the ring."

Ali was happy to feed that narrative, ratcheting up the tension with claims Frazier represented the establishment. "He painted it as if you're supporting Frazier, you're against equality, you're against justice," says Davis.

"He was basically saying I'm fighting for the people in the ghetto. I'm fighting for the Black community. I'm the man of the people, and Frazier is the man of the people who are trying to oppress you -- continuing to push this framework of seeing it as a fight about pro-war conservativism versus anti-war civil rights."

Silver draws parallels between 1971 and the present day.

"We're now living in America through quite a disruptive and divided time. I can only compare it to that time. I didn't think I would see such a divided country again.

"It's astounding the divisiveness you see in America now, and if there's any comparison to it, it is the Vietnam War era in this country and then before that the Civil War."

Like Ali, NBA star LeBron James has been outspoken on political and social issues.

While boxing, and the world heavyweight championship, have diminished in influence over the past 50 years, other sports and athletes have risen to prominence. Notably NBA superstar LeBron James, who has become a leading voice against racial injustice and police brutality, and is talked about "in the same genre" as Ali.

Civil rights activist Harry Edwards places James at the forefront of the fourth and fifth "waves of athletic activism" in a continuum that includes Wyomia Tyus, Tommie Smith and Ali.

Edwards says that fourth wave came in 2012 when James and his Miami Heat teammates wore clothing to honor Trayvon Martin, an unarmed high school student shot and killed by a neighborhood watch coordinator in Florida, while the fifth came in 2020.

"I understand that for athletes you're going to take some hits from fans," four-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Johnson told CNN Sport. "You're going to have some people saying, 'I don't want politics and social issues in my sport."

However, Johnson is conscious to highlight what happened to Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who started kneeling during the National Anthem to protest police brutality in 2016 and has been unsigned to a team since 2017.

It was two years in February that Kaepernick and former teammate Eric Reid settled their collusion grievance cases against the NFL.

"You only have to look back as far as Colin Kaepernick and what was done to him and what happened to his career to understand why athletes might be apprehensive," said Johnson.

In the 15th and final round, Frazier floored Ali with a devastating left hook.

'How did he bounce up after that shot?'

"The Fight of the Century" lived up to the hype.

"It was the most intense heavyweight fight I have ever seen," says Silver.

"Ali did get under Frazier's skin," he adds. "By the time the fight took place, they genuinely didn't like each other. They were fighting with an intensity I've rarely seen.

"And Frazier fought a fight that was almost hard to believe for a heavyweight, to fight that kind of pace for 15 rounds.

"I think you would have had to have killed Frazier to keep him from winning that fight."

In the 15th and final round, Frazier floored Ali with a left hook, and it looked as if the contest was over, before, to the amazement of the crowd, he got straight back up.

"For many years, I thought when Ali was hit with that left hook in the 15th round. How did he bounce up after that shot?" says Silver.

"Ali sensed it. He saw it coming, but he couldn't get out of the way in time. If that was Ali of four years earlier before the layoff, he would have moved his head away.

"What's interesting is that we found out in that fight what we didn't know before: Because Ali rarely was hit solidly, we found out in that fight he could take a punch.

"It was a great fight. It had drama, intensity, momentum and, of course, capped off by the climax of Ali getting dropped in the 15th round, that was the icing on the cake."

Frazier won the bout on points, by a unanimous decision, giving Ali the first loss of his professional career.

Joe Frazier represents a great majority of Black athletes who are just grinding, says Dr Davis.

To commemorate the former champion and his famous win 50 years ago, friends and family of Frazier will unveil a statue inside the new Joe Hand Gym in Feasterville, Pennsylvania, on March 8.

Weatta Frazier Collins -- one of the heavyweight boxer's 11 children -- is championing her father's legacy with a scholarship fund which is awarded to vulnerable teenagers.

In January of 1973, Frazier lost the title to George Foreman, and Ali was again to shock the world, knocking Foreman out during the late-1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" fight in Kinshasa, Zaire -- to reclaim the crown he had lost seven years before.

In all the reverence Ali is held in -- "a Buddha-like figure" as Silver puts it -- his treatment of Frazier often crossed a line, calling his rival an "Uncle Tom," a demeaning term for Black people who are viewed subservient to whites, and a "gorilla."

"I swallowed a lot of razor blades," Frazier told a HBO documentary that was aired in 2000," and sometimes they cut ... inside."

In a 2001 interview with The New York Times, Ali said he had used that language as a way to promote the fight.

"In a way, Joe's right," said Ali. 'I said a lot of things in the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight.''

In that same New York Times interview, Frazier said he accepted Ali's apology. "We're grown guys. This has been going on too long. It's like we've been fighting the Vietnam War.''

"It's hard with Frazier," Davis explains. "He was somebody who didn't speak out a lot. He kept his head down and really focused on the sport. He was like many Black athletes of the day, who, for whatever reason, were not Ali.

"It's much more common to be a Joe Frazier and you can see this incredible way that boxing became a vehicle for upward mobility and in many ways, for me he represents a great majority of Black athletes who are just grinding.

"I think there's a way now, that we look back so positively on athletic activism that it's like why weren't you as outspoken? But the truth is Ali was an anomaly."

Later in his life, Ali developed Parkinson's disease.

According to Silver, Ali's activism "started a trend."

"If you're looking at the athletes today who speak out, the forerunner of this was Muhammad Ali, and they owe him something, for good or bad," says Silver.

"You can get some sense how outraged people were because you see the reaction to Colin Kaepernick taking a knee. I mean, look at the outrage.

"Multiply that by about 10 times and you'll know the outrage that people felt when Ali refused to be drafted into the US Army."

In the 50 years since the fight in 1971, Ali's legend has only grown.

"Muhammad Ali solidified himself as somebody who's going to think and pay attention to not only the struggles of the Black community in the US," said Davis, "but to connect the struggles of marginalized people from Vietnam to Louisville to South Africa.

"We lose sight of the stakes and what it means to give up your title at the height of your career, to stand for something that could quite literally cost you the career.

"We know, of course what happens but he had no way of knowing he could get back to the top. I think that that's really important to understand. Especially in 1971."

Carlo Fumagalli/AP Diego Maradona is carried around the field after leading Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup final. Argentina defeated West Germany at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.

Diego Maradona, a colorful and beloved soccer icon regarded as one of the greatest ever to play the game, has died aged 60 after suffering heart failure, a source from the Argentinian Justice Ministry told CNN en Español on Wednesday.

Maradona is best known for captaining Argentina to victory at the 1986 World Cup, where he was named the tournament's best player and scored two of its most famous goals. In his professional career, he was twice sold for a world-record transfer fee: to Barcelona in 1982 and then to Napoli in 1984. He played 188 games with Napoli, winning two Serie A titles and a UEFA Cup for the Italian club.

Following a failed drug test in 1991 and a 15-month ban from the sport, Maradona's playing career fizzled out. He would later turn to management.

In 2008, Maradona became Argentina's manager and led the team at the 2010 World Cup, where it was eliminated in the quarterfinals. He held various managerial jobs over the past decade, including stints in Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. At the time of his death, he was in charge of Gimnasia y Esgrima, a club in Argentina's first division.

Earlier this month, Maradona underwent successful surgery for a subdural hematoma — more commonly known as a blood clot on the brain.

David J. Phillip/AP Los Angeles Dodgers celebrate after defeating the Tampa Bay Rays 3-1 to win the baseball World Series in Game 6 on Tuesday, October 27, in Arlington, Texas.

The Los Angeles Dodgers closed out an unprecedented World Series with a 3-1 victory against the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington, Texas, on Tuesday.

The Dodgers and the Rays faced off during the coronavirus pandemic, making it a Fall Classic the likes of which we have never seen.

A limited number of fans were allowed to attend, and it was the first time the best-of-seven series was played on a neutral site -- the newly opened Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.

This was the 20th World Series appearance for the Dodgers, who competed for the title in three of the last four years. The team won six times, but not since 1988.

It was just the second time the Rays made it to the World Series, which they won in 2008.

Since the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who was killed in police custody in May, many athletes and sports leagues have been throwing their support behind the protest movement calling for change.

The NFL was the latest league to make a statement, starting its 2020 season with messages in the end zones that said "End Racism" and "It Takes All of Us." In each Week 1 contest, there was also a pregame playing of the hymn "Lift Every Voice and Sing," which is known as the Black National Anthem.

In some stadiums, teams gathered together on the field to lock arms in a pregame "moment of unity." A few players across the league took a knee or raised a fist during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner."

The NBA's Milwaukee Bucks made headlines in August when they decided to boycott a playoff game against the Orlando Magic. The Bucks were responding to the police shooting of Jacob Blake, which happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin, about 40 miles from Milwaukee.

The NBA went on to postpone all three of its playoff games that day, and other leagues followed suit: the WNBA, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer all called off games. The NBA and the WNBA also postponed their games the next day, as did the NHL and some baseball teams.

Since the NBA restarted its season, the words "Black Lives Matter" have been prominently displayed on its court and players have been sporting social-justice messages on the backs of their jerseys. But they aren't the only athletes who have been taking a stand.

In the late 20th century, Michael Jordan was more than just the best basketball player in the world.

He was a global phenomenon.

Jordan won it all during his playing career — six NBA championships, two Olympic gold medals and an NCAA title. He mesmerized fans with his gravity-defying dunks, his fierce competitiveness and an uncanny ability to deliver in the final moments of a game.

And he dominated off the court as well.

His Air Jordan sneakers revolutionized the industry and continue to sell out today. Gatorade commercials encouraged kids to "be like Mike." He even starred in a movie with Bugs Bunny.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Chelsea has completed the signing of Belgium star Romelu Lukaku from Inter Milan on a five-year deal in a move that reunites the striker with his former club.

Although the fee was not disclosed by the clubs involved, British and US media outlets reported that Chelsea had made an offer worth £97.5 million ($135 million) for Lukaku.

The reported fee would make the 28-year-old the second most expensive player in the history of British football -- behind only England star Jack Grealish, who joined Manchester City last week for a reported fee of £100 million ($139 million).

Lukaku becomes Chelsea's club record signing, surpassing the £71.6 million ($91 million) fee the club paid to acquire the services of Spanish goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Athletic Bilbao in 2018.

The Belgian joined Chelsea from Anderlecht in August 2011, but left the West London club for Everton in 2014 after making just 15 appearances.

"I'm happy and blessed to be back at this wonderful club," Lukaku said in a club statement. "It's been a long journey for me: I came here as a kid who had a lot to learn, now I'm coming back with a lot of experience and more mature.

"The way the club is going fits my ambitions perfectly at 28 and just coming off winning Serie A. I think this opportunity comes at the right time and hopefully we can have a lot of success together ... the challenge is to try to help the team win some more trophies. I can't wait to get started and to help the club achieve more success."

Lukaku was one of the most prolific strikers in the Premier League, scoring 87 goals in 166 games for the Merseyside club between 2014 and 2017.

In July 2017, Lukaku made the move to Manchester United where he added to his goalscoring tally, with 42 goals in 96 appearances.

Lukaku's stay, though, was short-lived, with the talisman sealing a move to Italian giant Inter Milan in August 2019.

The Belgian enjoyed a star-studded two seasons in Italy, the highlight of which saw Lukaku score 24 goals on the way to helping Inter win its first Serie A title in over a decade

The return of Lukaku to Stamford Bridge will add even more firepower to an attacking line-up which already includes German duo Kai Havertz and Timo Werner, England's Mason Mount and American Christian Pulisic.

Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia added in the club statement: "Romelu Lukaku is quite simply one of the world's best strikers and goalscorers. We are absolutely delighted to be bringing him back to the club he loves, and are excited to be adding his talent to our Champions League-winning squad.

"We are of course looking to build on last season's success, and Lukaku will play a big role in achieving our targets."

After winning last season's UEFA Champions League, Thomas Tuchel's side will have their eyes set on regaining the English Premier League title, which they last won in 2017.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Kepa Arrizabalaga came off the bench and produced the winning save as Chelsea defeated Villarreal on penalties to lift the UEFA Super Cup.

With the game in Belfast finishing 1-1 after extra-time, goalkeeper Kepa was brought on in place of Eduoard Mendy for the shootout.

It proved to be an astute tactical decision from manager Thomas Tuchel, as Kepa, who was deducted a week's wages when he refused to be substituted in the Carabao Cup final two years ago , made good saves to deny Aïssa Mandi and Raúl Albiol from the spot.

The save against Albiol saw the shootout end 6-5 in Chelsea's favor, handing Tuchel his second piece of silverware as Chelsea boss after last season's Champions League final victory against Manchester City.

"I was ready because I knew this could happen, and I tried to be ready mentally and physically when we arrived at penalties," Kepa said of the late substitution.

The athletes are currently undergoing two weeks of quarantine in Sydney as part of the country's travel rules. But those making the onward journey to their home state of South Australia will have to comply by restrictions on inter-state travel and complete an extra two weeks of quarantine in the South Australian capital of Adelaide.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) condemned the four-week quarantine for some of the team's athletes.

"While other countries are celebrating the return of their athletes, we are subjecting ours to the most cruel and uncaring treatment. They are being punished for proudly representing their country with distinction at the Olympic Games," AOC Chief Executive Office Matt Carroll said in the statement.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Around the age of 16, I arrived at an uncomfortable conclusion: As a Manchester United fan from London, I was among the most hated demographics in English football.

Like so many '90s kids, I'd been sucked in by the glamor of the era's most successful Premier League club. Each night, I closed my United curtains and slept beneath club-themed bedsheets.

Posters of striker Andy Cole and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel looked down at me from the walls. It was a childhood of continuous triumph as my heroes swept to title after title.

Except I dreaded being asked which team I supported. Having never visited Manchester, let alone seen the inside of Old Trafford, I was the punchline to endless "southerner" jokes and subjected to that most dishonorable of British sporting insults: glory hunter.

And rightly so. With an abundance of west London teams to choose from -- Chelsea, Fulham or Queens Park Rangers, for instance -- I'd used my mother's birthplace as a shortcut to success.

Die-hard fans might begrudgingly accept Saudi or Singaporean supporters picking a Premier League team at random, but there is no such sympathy for the English. You choose your local team, or you're probably a glory hunter.

When the Premier League was but a distant dream ... Brentford take on Chester City on November 28, 1998 at Griffin Park.

The ugly game

So, on a cold, wet Saturday in 2004 -- January 31, to be precise -- I tried to put things right.

Roping in two friends, I took the short bus ride to Griffin Park, home of my local team: Brentford FC. Along with 4,000 fans, we watched the lowly Bees pick up their first win in over two months against Port Vale.

Playing out in England's third tier, then called Division Two, the game was ugly and the goals scrappy. One of the dilapidated stands didn't even have a roof -- and those that did offered little protection from the rain anyway.

Choose your seat unwisely, and you'd be stuck watching the game from behind an old metal beam holding up the century-old stadium.

This must be the "real" football I'd heard so much about. And I was hooked. With kids' tickets sometimes costing as little as £5 (or $7, a fraction of the Premier League's extortionate prices), I vowed to return as often as I could.

If you'd told me, however, that almost 17 years later Brentford would have replaced -- and surpassed -- United in my affections, I wouldn't have believed you. But if you'd told me that the newly promoted Bees would be facing Arsenal in this week's Premier League opener, I would have laughed the whole bus ride home.

For decades, Brentford was seen as the epitome of a "tinpot" club: no major trophies, no money, no big-name players and a tiny -- yet, still often half-empty -- stadium.

The team last played in England's top division in the 1946/47 season, after which they bounced between the second and fourth tiers. Mid-table mediocrity and premature cup eliminations became the modus operandi.

Yet, there was much to love about the club.

Built in 1904, Griffin Park was the only stadium in the country with a pub on each of its four corners. Its atmosphere was impassioned but friendly, and free from the vitriolic chants or fan violence plaguing many of our neighbors.

Instead, Brentford attracted a good-natured crowd of long-suffering locals. They reveled in small victories, but mostly just groaned at misplaced passes and crosses gone awry.

On one occasion, a man below me in the crowd pulled the spectacles from his face and threw them towards the seemingly myopic referee in disgust, before nonchalantly replacing them with another pair from his pocket.

Despite decades of disappointment, these fans returned each Saturday for the camaraderie, the sense of belonging and, perversely, the collective suffering.

No one was here for the glory. And as I attended more and more games, dragging my dad, friends and, many years later, my utterly indifferent wife along for company, I learned the most important lesson in football: Being mediocre makes the very occasional taste of success all the sweeter.

An unlikely rise

Which brings us to Brentford's unlikely ascent to the world's most lucrative league.

Needless to say, money has a little something to do with it. Once among the few supporter-owned clubs in the Football League, Brentford was fully bought out by gambling magnate Matthew Benham in 2014. But that's only part of the story.

Rather than pumping endless millions into the club, Benham introduced a smart, data-driven recruitment strategy that is often compared to baseball's "moneyball."

The resultingly shrewd transfer policy sees promising young players plucked from European obscurity, cultivated in the fast-paced English game and then sold on for huge profit.

Take Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, West Ham's Saïd Benrahma or Brighton's Neal Maupay -- each bought by Brentford for relative pocket change and sold to their current clubs for a collective £71 million ($99 million).

As such, Brentford is widely considered to be among the best-run and most financially sustainable clubs in England. And, as a stepping-stone for unrealized talent, the team enjoys a season or two of these players' services along the way.

Brentford manager Thomas Frank is thrown in the air after the team's Championship playoff final success against Swansea City.

Under the management of Danish coach Thomas Frank -- as well as his predecessors Dean Smith and Mark Warburton, now of Villa and QPR respectively -- a series of young squads have developed an attacking, free-flowing style of football unrecognizable from that of decades past.

After successive top-half finishes in the second-tier Championship between 2015 and 2020, Brentford finally secured promotion to the Premier League through the playoffs in May, ending a 74-year wait for top-flight football. If anyone needed reminding of our suffering, it was the Bees' first time being promoted via a playoff, in any division, in 10 attempts.

Brentford last played in England's top flight in the 1946/47 season.

It is, however, easy to romanticize this rags-to-riches story. After all, Benham's ownership -- as well as sponsorship from various gambling firms -- means that success has been partially bankrolled by an industry rife with addiction.

The club's focus on developing overseas talent through its "B" team, meanwhile, has come at the expense of its youth academy, which was shuttered in 2016.

There is also a chance that success will destroy what made Brentford special. Perhaps Premier League status will make our club just like any other, chasing TV revenue at the expense of all else. Or perhaps the shiny new 17,000-seat stadium, yet to see a full crowd due to Covid-19 restrictions, will lack the charm and atmosphere of Griffin Park.

But come the end of the season, even if we are consigned to another seven decades in the lower divisions, it will have meant something far more to me than cheering on overpaid stars in a city I've never been to.

So, to fans of England's "Big Six" who are disillusioned with their clubs' overpriced tickets and attempts to break away into a big-money European Super League, let me tell you this: You may think it's sacrilege to switch allegiances, but it can be done with credibility -- just about -- intact.

If you're going to pick a team to throw your tribalist loyalties behind, it might as well be the underdog. You never know, you too might end up being a Premier League fan again one day.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Not since Real Madrid's famous 'Galácticos' squad of the 2000s has a single club boasted so much individual talent.

Paris Saint-Germain's dramatic capture of Lionel Messi -- which will undoubtedly go down as one of the most shocking in football history -- capped off what had already been an incredible summer of talent accumulation.

But can this squad deliver Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), who bought PSG in 2011, the Champions League -- the trophy the owners crave the most, but has so far eluded them?

The signings of highly-rated goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, Messi's long-time adversary Sergio Ramos, Georginio Wijnaldum and Achraf Hakimi -- added to an already stacked squad that includes Neymar and Kylian Mbappé -- mean PSG will unquestionably be the overwhelming favorite to lift this season's Champions League.

"QSI bought PSG in 2011 because they wanted increased exposure for the country ahead of an eventual World Cup," Christian Nourry, founder of Get French Football News, told CNN Sport

"That World Cup is now coming, it's only next year, but what's happened over the course of this decade is that we've seen Al Thani, the owner, fall in love with this club, really taking a lot of interest in this," added Nourry, referring to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

"[It's] far more than a pet project for him and he's seen this opportunity to create potentially the greatest attacking troika we've seen in modern football in Mbappé, Neymar and Messi, but also there are no excuses now."

At PSG, Messi will work under coach Mauricio Pochettino, a former player of the Parisian club and a fellow Argentine.

"Mauricio Pochettino must win absolutely everything, that includes the Champions League, and he must do so in style, because in style has been something that Paris Saint-Germain have really struggled to do, with a largely counterattacking style of play over the course of the last two or three seasons," added Nourry.

No pressure, then, Mauricio.

PSG 'ideal' for Messi

But it's a sentiment that Messi appears to agree with.

In an interview with CNN after his arrival in Paris, the Argentine said he believes PSG is the "ideal" place for him to finally win another Champions League title.

Despite Messi's consistently superlative individual performances over the years, the one blemish on his record in recent seasons has been his inability to again lead Barcelona to European football's most coveted prize -- although it is widely argued that the Catalan club's ineptitude in building a suitable squad around him was the root cause of this.

That, however, will not be the case at PSG, a club now stacked with an eye-watering amount of talent and a visceral desire to win a first Champions League in its history.

"For me on a personal level, I would love to win another Champions League, like I've said in previous years, and I think I've come to the ideal place that's ready for that," Messi told CNN.

"We have the same goals. It's got impressive players, one of the best squads in the world and, hopefully, we can achieve that goal which Paris wants so much, I want so much and hopefully we can enjoy it with the people of Paris too."

Messi's signing for PSG means the French giants will have one of the most formidable attacking lines in the history of the game.

PSG's new front three of Messi, Neymar and Mbappé is unquestionably the most talented attack in world football and will give opposition defenders and managers nightmares trying to conjure up ways to stop them.

"It's all just going to be about how many goals and assists is he [Messi] getting compared to Kylian Mbappé and Neymar," Nourry says. "Who is going to be taking the majority of that responsibility on? I can't wait to find out."

Off the pitch, though, questions have already been asked about PSG's finances and how the club has been able to get around the Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations.

"We're always attentive to Financial Fair Play. It's the first thing we check with the commercial, financial and legal people before signing someone," PSG chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi told reporters on Wednesday when Messi was officially unveiled.

When rumors of Messi's arrival began circulating, it was suggested that PSG would have to offload Mbappé -- reportedly to Real Madrid -- in order to balance the books. The French club, however, has been adamant that is far from the case.

"The message is clear from Paris Saint-Germain around Kylian Mbappé: the two situations are not linked," Nourry says. "Mbappé has 12 months left on his contract. In fact, Paris Saint-Germain are confident this signing will encourage him more to sign a new extension.

"The argument that we hear a lot in the capital of France at the moment is: why would you go this summer or next to Real Madrid to play alongside Karim Benzema and Vinícius Júnior, when you could spend the next three seasons alongside Neymar and Lionel Messi for your development. I think that's a pretty strong argument."

French football rules allow clubs to operate with a wage bill that is almost 100% of its annual income, a far cry from the strict Spanish rules that ultimately forced Messi's departure from Barcelona.

UEFA, European football's governing body, has also relaxed its FFP regulations since the Covid-19 outbreak, allowing clubs to operate with annual losses of more than $35 million as long as they can prove these were due to the pandemic.

"Having said that, Paris Saint-Germain have promised to make €180 million ($211M) worth of player sales this summer to the French football financial watchdog, the DNCG," Nourry explains.

"They've only done about €8 million of that, so it's going to be a very busy four weeks if they are to fulfill that and because the transfer market has moved very, very slowly for the majority of clubs, I think that's going to be tricky.

"But Paris Saint-Germain are looking to sell -- or being open to sell -- 12-14 players, those include lesser stars like Mauro Icardi and Pablo Sarabia, but [there is] no intention to sell a key player this summer in Paris."

Boost for French football?

Perhaps the only people licking their lips at Messi's arrival as much as PSG fans are those in charge of France's top division, Ligue 1, and Amazon.

"The arrival of Lionel Messi will increase the attractiveness and visibility of our championship on all continents," said Ligue 1 President Vincent Labrune in a statement on Wednesday.

"This unique event is the result of the strategy of the Paris Saint-Germain management, which has enabled the Parisian club to become one of the biggest franchises in world sport in 10 years.

"On behalf of French professional football, I want to thank PSG Chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaïfi for making this dream possible," added Lebrune, who ended his statement with three words: "Messi is magic!"

Nourry calls the signing a "huge surprise" for French football, but it is certainly a welcome one given the financial struggles the league has faced over the past 18 months.

JUST WATCHED Lionel Messi and Barcelona say adios Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lionel Messi and Barcelona say adios 02:09

Ligue 1 not only had to deal with the implications of being the only one of Europe's top five leagues not able to finish the 2019/20 season due to Covid, but also with the collapse of broadcast partner Mediapro, which had been paying almost $1 billion per year for broadcast rights.

Amazon has since come in to pick up the majority of broadcasting rights, around eight matches per week, in a deal reported by the Financial Times to be worth $323 million per season, with French broadcaster Canal+ paying $390 million per season for two matches per week.

"[It's] a great opportunity taken by Paris Saint-Germain and will hopefully result in lots of exposure for Ligue 1," Nourry says. "Because we're about 50% down on the TV rights deal this year compared to last year, with the collapse of Mediapro.

"So there's lots of excitement in France, but it's probably not going to stop about seven or eight clubs in the division this season from being unable to pay back loans they took out during Covid-19."

However, Kieran Maguire, author of "The Price of Football," believes that while PSG will certainly receive a financial boost from Messi's signing, that won't necessarily be the case for Ligue 1.

Maguire says the increased lack of competitiveness at the top of the league, created by PSG's financial outlay this summer, will cause broadcaster interest to "wane quite quickly" and remains unconvinced Messi's signing will "create a long queue" of suitors desperate to pay for TV rights.

"PSG will benefit because we already saw last night -- 150,000 shirts sold within seven minutes was the claim -- so they will benefit from being able to generate more money on match days," he told CNN. "Even if they don't put up the price of regular tickets, the commercial department will effectively be able to name their own price for hospitality packages.

Lionel Messi shirts have been in high demand at PSG's club stores.

"If you want to go in this box -- if you're a big firm of lawyers or accountants or you're an investment banker and you want to entertain a client -- we've got Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar leading the line. How much are you willing to pay for that? So I think they'll be able to to increase their revenues."

Given Messi's considerable talents and PSG now boasting arguably the greatest attacking trio in history, Maguire says it also seems likely that the club will earn more prize money for reaching the latter stages of the Champions League.

"So I think there's lots of benefits for the club," he explains. "But for French football as a whole, yes, there will be an initial media interest and a curiosity value attached to his recruitment, [but] whether that will convert into significant increases in the value of a broadcast deal ... I'm not so certain."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Manchester United paraded new signing Raphaël Varane before its match against Leeds United at Old Trafford on Saturday and then treated the French international to an impressive win in its first match of the new Premier League season.

Varane, who has joined the Manchester club from Real Madrid until June 2025 in a deal reportedly worth $57 million, was introduced to United's fans ahead of the 5-1 victory over Leeds, with Bruno Fernandes scoring a hat-trick.

Mason Greenwood and Brazilian Fred scored the other goals for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.

Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes scores his third goal in Manchester United's 5-1 win over Leeds United at Old Trafford.

Early in the second half Luke Ayling's superb long-range shot drew Leeds level, but three goals in eight minutes turned the game United's way in front of over 70,000 fans at Old Trafford.

Paul Pogba assisted four of United's five goals with another new signing Jadon Sancho, who joined from Borussia Dortmund in a $100 million transfer, coming on as a second-half substitute.

'Unique defender'

The 28-year-old Varane, who has played 79 times for France, was described by United as one of "the most decorated players in world football and has amassed over 19 trophies in his career so far, including four Champions Leagues, three Spanish titles and the 2018 World Cup."

"Manchester United is one of the most iconic clubs in world football and the chance to come here and play in the Premier League is something I couldn't turn down," Varane told the United website.

"There is a lot more that I want to achieve in my career and I know I'm joining a squad full of great players who will all have the same determination to win matches and trophies," added Varane.

"I want to make an impact here and I will give everything to become part of this club's illustrious history."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) It wasn't that long ago that six of the English Premier League's biggest teams -- Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham -- sparked outrage for signing up to the proposed European Super League (ESL).

The closed shop for the continent's biggest clubs was partly born from the desire to earn a larger slice of football's mammoth pie and to create a more stable income during such uncertain times.

Like every business, clubs were impacted by the pandemic last year with games forced behind closed doors. Teams were robbed of their matchday revenues -- the bigger the clubs were in terms of stadium size, the greater that financial hit was.

Not that you'd have noticed in recent weeks as clubs prepare for the new Premier League season.

Led by Manchester City's eye-watering $138 million deal for English playmaker Jack Grealish, the Premier League has seen bumper prices being paid for some of the best players on the planet ahead of Friday's opener as newly promoted Brentford hosts Arsenal.

Meanwhile, Chelsea reportedly paid over $130 million for its former striker Romelu Lukaku and Manchester United has already paid $100 million for Jadon Sancho.

Arsenal and Liverpool have bolstered their defenses with $69 million and $48 million deals for central defenders Ben White and Ibrahima Konaté respectively. Tottenham has also invested $65 million in buying Cristian Romero from Atalanta.

Despite the financial hit from Covid-19, football finance expert Kieran Maguire is not surprised about the amount of money being spent at present but has noticed a new trend, funded in part by the mega TV deals for those at the top of the footballing ladder.

"I think what we have seen is a concentration of spending on very, very high value players, whereas perhaps under normal circumstances, it would be improving the quality of the squad," Maguire told CNN Sport.

"So we're seeing individual values being very high but the quantity of signings has actually diminished."

Jack Grealish broke the Premier League transfer record when he joined Manchester City.

Manchester City eyes huge transfer window

When it comes to City's signing of Grealish -- the former Aston Villa captain is now the most expensive player in Premier League history -- Maguire is only surprised it took so long for a club to break the previous league record.

"All of the other transfers that have gone above that value have been in Spain and France, so to a certain extent, given the Premier League is the world's richest league, it's surprising it's taken the Premier League so long," Maguire added.

"Also, if we take a look at the transfer that it exceeded, the last one was Paul Pogba to Manchester United in 2016. So it's taken us five years for Manchester City to actually break the transfer record."

City has also confirmed its interest in Tottenham striker Harry Kane which could blow Grealish's transfer record out of the window, with a transfer potentially worth over $200 million.

Among other regulations, league rules prohibit English clubs from making an " aggregate loss in excess of £105 million over three consecutive seasons " with the idea of stopping clubs running big losses through spending on players.

Many have questioned how City, which is bankrolled by its Abu Dhabi owners, could sign Grealish and potentially Kane and still comply with those financial fair play (FFP) guidelines but Maguire explains how the club manages to balance the books.

He says a club like City, which won the Premier League, would have earned around $110 million from TV money alone after reaching the Champions League final last season and says sponsors may have paid extra bonuses as a result of the team's relative success.

But there are also other ways in which large transfer sums can fit within the regulations, with the initial cost spread out over the player's contracts.

"So Grealish signed a six-year contract. If Kane does the same, we've got an [estimated] $350 million spread over six years. So that's less than $60 million a year," Maguire said.

"At the same time, Manchester City has sold players. When you sell a player, you take all of the profit in one year rather than spreading it over a period.

"So Manchester City has actually sold players, which will cover the vast majority of that $60 million from the purchase of Grealish and potentially Kane on top of that."

Speaking of the club's recovery from the pandemic, City said: "The result of these extraordinary pandemic factors is a reported net loss of £126m ($148m) for the 2019-20 season.

"However, the club expects to immediately return to profitability in 2020-21, as a result of a less COVID-impacted season and deferred 2019-20 revenues. The likely normalized losses for each of the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons will therefore be less than £60m ($70m) per year."

'Impossible has become even more difficult'

Maguire says that within the current FFP guidelines, English football's "big clubs" will continue to drift away from the rest of the league unless FFP is rethought.

"For a club to come in and challenge the existing elite, it was extremely difficult historically," he said.

"People will point to Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016 as evidence [...] but immediately after Leicester City won the Premier League, those big clubs forced the Premier League to change the rules in terms of the distribution of TV money to concentrate a greater proportion of it in the hands of the elite.

"So what was almost impossible has become even more difficult as a consequence of these changes in the rules."

One of those teams trying to make a name for itself this season is Leeds United.

The club enjoyed its first season back in the top-flight since 2004 last year but it's still a long way short of its former glory.

Leeds was one of the most dominant teams in English football for decades but that was before the big money rolled into the Premier League.

Current owner Andrea Radrizzani says closing the gap to the league's modern elite is no easy feat but hopes football's unpredictability can benefit a team like his, trying to find its way back to the top.

"There is a different size of revenues between the clubs and a different level of finance opportunities between the clubs," Radrizzani told CNN Sport ahead of the new season.

"We play in the same league and we try to show that football is a sport that can always bring surprises. So we need to remember what Leicester did a few years ago."

So with the dawn of a new season upon us and last year's stuttering campaign -- beleaguered by the pandemic -- somewhat of a distant memory, it appears clubs, and fans, are excited to make up for lost time.

Money may be king but, as we've seen time and time again, football has a wonderful way of upsetting the odds.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) British sprinter Chijindu Ujah, who won a silver medal in the 4x100m relay at the Tokyo Olympics last week, has been provisionally suspended for a doping violation, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) announced on Thursday.

If the suspension is upheld, all four members of Great Britain's relay team -- which finished behind Italy by one hundredth of a second in Tokyo -- face being stripped of their medals. Canada would be promoted to silver and China to bronze.

According to the AIU, Ujah exhibited the "presence/use of a prohibited substance (Ostarine and S-23)" from testing conducted during the Games.

A statement said: "The AIU now awaits the conclusion of the ITA [International Testing Agency] proceedings ... which will determine whether any anti-doping rule violations have been committed and what consequences (if any) should be imposed in relation to the Olympic Games."

Ostarine and S-23 are both classed as Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs), according to the US Anti-Doping Agency -- a class of therapeutic compounds with anabolic properties that lead to bone and muscle growth.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) German soccer great Gerd Müller, who scored a remarkable 566 goals in 607 competitive appearances for Bayern Munich, died on Sunday at the age of 75, according to the Bundesliga club.

"Today is a sad, dark day for FC Bayern and all its fans," said Bayern President Herbert Hainer in a statement on the club's website.

"Gerd Müller was the greatest striker there's ever been, and a fine person and character of world football."

Nicknamed "Der Bomber," Müller still holds the record for the most goals -- 365 -- scored in the Bundesliga. He also netted 68 goals in 62 games for the West Germany national team.

"Then there's a boom, then there's a roar, and everyone shouts, 'Yes, Müller's scored!' was a lyric to a song that the Bayern player himself set to music during his playing career, according to FIFA's website.

Müller averaged almost a goal a game for Bayern Munich.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Hundreds of thousands of fans attended English Premier League matches this weekend for the first time in nearly 18 months, though one game was marred by homophobic chanting and another by "isolated incidents of disorder" ahead of kick off.

Norwich City midfielder Billy Gilmour, who was playing for the newly promoted club on loan from Chelsea, was allegedly targeted by homophobic chanting by some Liverpool fans during the visiting team's 3-0 win at Carrow Road on Saturday.

"Great result today marred by homophobic chanting by some of our fans targeting Chelsea loanee Billy Gilmour," tweeted Kop Outs, Liverpool's LGBT+ Fans Group.

"If you can't support without resorting to bigoted nonsense, you don't understand YNWA," concluded the tweet, a reference to the club's "You'll Never Walk Alone" anthem.

Liverpool FC's Twitter account said the chant was "offensive and inappropriate -- a message we have repeatedly communicated alongside Kop Outs."

"We urge supporters to remember the inclusive values of the club and to refrain from using it in the future."

Norwich City's Billy Gilmour is playing for the club on loan from Chelsea.

'Mindless actions'

According to George Starkey-Midha, who worked for anti-discrimination organization Kick It Out, the homophobic slur originates from the 1980s "and is intended as an insult to suggest all Chelsea fans are gay."

Chelsea's official LGBTQ+ & Friends Supporters Group, tweeted that it would "continue to work with clubs and authorities across the game to ensure homophobia, biphobia and transphobia are kicked out of the game."

Meanwhile over 70,000 fans watched Manchester United beat Leeds United 5-1 on Saturday, though police made six arrests during the course of the day in the northern English city.

Five arrests were in relation to public order offenses and one was on suspicion of drug offense, according to Greater Manchester Police.

"These suspects remain in custody in cells in Greater Manchester for questioning this evening," Chief Superintendent Stuart Ellison said on Saturday.

"Work has begun immediately, in conjunction with football investigating officers from both Manchester United and Leeds United, to identify offenders of other incidents of disorder so that we are able to bring them to book for their mindless actions," added Ellison.

Liverpool's Mohamed Salah scores his side's third goal of the game in the 3-0 win against Norwich.

'Respecting the people around you'

Last week, Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said that "tackling discrimination is a priority" for the organization and its 20 clubs.

"This year, we've got three things to talk about at the start of the season. We've introduced a league-wide ban, so if you are caught then you'll be banned from not just your own club but all other Premier League clubs as well," said Masters in an interview with Premier League Productions.

"Secondly, with fans coming back we're working with stewards, to help them deal with some of these issues should they arise. Hopefully they won't.

"And finally, we're working with fan groups, via our Fans' Fund, to help fund some fan education so people can fully understand the impact of discriminatory abuse on people."

On Friday, Masters also spoke of his excitement at the prospect of stadiums full of fans after English football's top-flight clubs grappled with the impact of the pandemic over the last year and a half.

"March 2020 was the last time we had a full fixture round with full stadiums, so it's a huge relief to everybody that we can open the turnstiles again," said Masters in a statement.

"Over 300,000 fans are coming through the turnstiles this weekend into raucous atmospheres, but also safe environments.

"We're asking our supporters to follow a new supporters' code of conduct, which is what we've all been following over the past 18 months, with common sense about wearing face masks indoors, following signage, being hygienic and respecting the people around you."

More than three quarters of adults in the UK have now received two doses of a Covid-19 jab, said the Department of Health and Social Care on Tuesday.

Public Health England has said the vaccines are highly effective at preventing hospitalization and deaths, with an estimated 60,000 deaths avoided.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The reviews are in for Arsenal's performance against Brentford in the English Premier League's opening match on Friday and they make for grim reading if you're a Gunners fan.

"Weak and bullied," was how Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher described Arsenal's defending when Brentford scored its second goal in the newly promoted team's 2-0 victory.

"This is pathetic," tweeted Arsenal fan Piers Morgan. "We're being bullied off the park by a team of players who've never performed in the Premier League.

"Even by Arteta standards, a new low," added Morgan referring to the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. "I can't do this for the next nine months."

'Struggle'

Carragher's comment and Morgan's tweet might be brushed off by Arsenal's hierarchy as a passing media storm, but the fact that Rwandan President Paul Kagame was moved to tweet three times after the Gunners' defeat is arguably more embarrassing.

Not least because Arsenal's jersey had 'Visit Rwanda' emblazoned on the sleeves.

The Visit Rwanda website says Arsenal is the organization's sleeve sponsor, while French club Paris Saint-Germain is described as a "premium partner."

The partnership also allows the East African country to "gain global exposure through branding on matchday LED boards at the Emirates Stadium [Arsenal's home ground], all the interview backdrops and a broad range of other marketing rights," according to the website.

"Brentford deserved to win and they did," tweeted Kagame, who in the past has described himself as a "committed fan" of his "beloved club Arsenal."

"The game itself aside Arsenal and the fans don't deserve to kind of get used to this," continued Kagame, who went on to criticize Arsenal's transfer strategy.

"It's been a struggle of about decade(s) -- ups&downs -- more downs until this point. Can't we have a plan that really works?? One part to look at is how we deal in the market -- players we buy to execute the plan. The touch&go mentality does not bring change.

Brentford's Christian Norgaard, center, celebrates after scoring his side's second goal against Arsenal.

Arsenal drift

Under former manager Arsene Wenger, Arsenal won the Premier League title in 1998, 2002, and 2004 and clinched seven FA Cups. Arsenal won the league and FA Cup Double in 1998 and 2002.

Wenger was Arsenal's manager for 22 years before he stepped down in 2018. He was succeeded by Unai Emery and Arteta, but the club's drift has continued.

Arsenal announced a three-year tourism partnership with the East African country in May 2018.

"The media has been speculating around £30 million but what I can tell you it's not £30 million ($41.5 million), it's less than that," CEO of the Rwanda Development Board, Clare Akamanzi, told CNN at the time.

"Thirty-five million people (will be) viewing their (Arsenal's) shirts every single day," Akamanzi said.

Rwanda's President Paul Kagame speaks during an interview with international media at the presidency office in Kigali, on May 28, 2021.

When the sponsorship deal was announced, critics said the money should have been spent alleviating the chronic poverty in the country.

"I think when millions of Rwandans are living on less than a pound a day ($1.28), that's fairly obscene," UK Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen told CNN at the time.

"The public have a right to know how our aid budget is being spent, and the people of Rwanda have a right to know how their president is spending their money."

Arsenal did not respond to CNN's request for comment -- by phone and email -- on when and whether the sponsorship deal had been renewed and Kagame's criticism of the club's transfer policy.

However, the East African website reported the deal had been extended until 2023.

Visit Rwanda didn't respond to CNN's request for comment about the partnership deal.

"We had really high hopes and we didn't get the result that we wanted or the performance we wanted," said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta (left) after his team's 2-0 defeat by Brentford.

'Blame the owners'

This isn't the first time Kagame has tweeted about Arsenal.

When Wenger stepped down as manager three years ago, Kagame said "this should not have been the kind of ending of an era.

"The coach is leaving and club trophy-less it was long coming! I am still a committed fan going forward. Blame the owners."

The relationship between Arsenal and Rwanda has also raised eyebrows given allegations of systemic human rights abuses in the East African country

"Football has spent the past decade being bought and sold by sovereign states, used to puff, gloss and scour international reputations. What's another friendly despot? wrote the Guardian's chief sports writer Barney Ronay, who pointed to Human Rights Watch assessment of Rwanda.

"The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) continues to target those perceived as a threat to the government," according to Human Rights Watch. "Several high-profile critics have been arrested or threatened and authorities regularly fail to conduct credible investigations into cases of enforced disappearances and suspicious deaths of government opponents."

Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Tyler Gilbert tossed the no-hitter as the team defeated the San Diego Padres 7-0 at Chase Field in Phoenix.

Gilbert, making his first career start, struck out five batters and walked Padres outfielder Tommy Pham three times.

Gilbert is only the fourth pitcher in league history to throw a no-hitter in his first start, and is the first to do so since 1953, according to MLB.com.

"I've been doing a lot of checks with the doctors, as well, on my knee, getting all the information as I hurt myself further during the grass-court season and Wimbledon," the 40-year-old said in an Instagram post Sunday.

"Unfortunately, they told me for the medium to long-term, to feel better, I will need surgery, so I decided to do it. I will be on crutches for many weeks and then also out of the game for many months."

Federer, who is tied with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic on 20 career grand slams, was noncommittal about his future in tennis.

"I want to be healthy. I want to be running around later, as well, again, and I want to give myself a glimmer of hope, also, to return to the tour in some shape or form," he added.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Former Australian rugby player and Rugby World Cup winner Toutai Kefu and his family have been injured after being attacked in their home in Brisbane, Australia.

Brisbane's Regional Crime and Intelligence Coordinator Detective Superintendent Tony Fleming confirmed in a press conference that Kefu and his family had been taken to hospital with serious injuries after a "burglary that has gone wrong."

Fleming said Kefu was in surgery after suffering "very serious wounds to his abdomen." According to Fleming, his initial condition was described as "critical but expected to survive."

The Tongan rugby union team posted on its Facebook page that Kefu had come out of surgery and was in a "stable condition."

Kefu's wife suffered "very, very serious" lacerations to her arms, while his 21-year-old son suffered wounds to his arm and back and his 18-year-old daughter suffered cuts to her hand and arm, Fleming said.

According to Fleming, Kefu and his family were awoken by noises in their house and were threatened when the home invaders demanded that they hand over car keys.

Queensland Police say they were called to a "Buena Vista Avenue home at around 3 a.m. in relation to four people, a 47-year-old man, a 46-year-old woman, a 21-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman who were injured by three intruders who were allegedly attempting to steal their car."

According to Fleming, neighbors were able to apprehend the invaders, one of which was armed with a knife.

The suspects allegedly had an axe, a knife and a machete.

Police say two other family members who were also in the home were unhurt.

"The wounds are significant and my understanding is that everyone is going to survive, but the trauma, no doubt, will live with this family forever," said Fleming.

Kefu in action during the Tri-Nations test match between Australia and South Africa in 2003.

Police say they have charged a 15-year-old male with attempted murder following ongoing investigations into the alleged burglary and wounding in Coorparoo.

The 15-year-old has been charged with four counts of attempted murder, three counts of assault causing grievous bodily harm and one count each of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, breaking and entering, burglary and deprivation of liberty. He has been refused bail and will appear in Brisbane Children's Court.

A second 15-year-old boy was taken into custody after presenting himself injured at a South Brisbane hospital, while a third is thought to have fled in a stolen vehicle.

"It is very uncommon to have violence to this extreme with injuries to this extreme, but we do know some young people are carrying knives and weapons," Fleming said.

Kefu played 60 tests for the Australian international rugby team between 1997 and 2003, winning the Rugby World Cup in 1999. He began coaching Tonga's national team in 2016.

"Our thoughts are with Toutai and his entire family right now," Rugby Australia CEO Andy Marinos said. "It was shocking news to receive this morning. Toutai is a titan of our game -- a warrior on the field and off it.

"To the Kefu family -- the Australian Rugby community is here for you. We also want to extend that support to others affected as well. The Rugby family is a close-knit one and we always rally around each other when another is in need," Marinos said.
