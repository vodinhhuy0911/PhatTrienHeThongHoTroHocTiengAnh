London (CNN Business) American politicians from both major parties have spent years advocating for an overhaul of the nation's infrastructure.

Those efforts always ended in failure until Tuesday, when 19 Republican senators voted with Democrats to approve a $1.2 trillion package that includes money to improve roads and bridges across the country.

The House must still approve the measure, but investors are optimistic. The Dow and S&P 500 reached record highs on Tuesday after the Senate vote.

Here's the thing: Money could begin to flow to shovel-ready upgrades relatively quickly, but it will take years for bigger projects to get underway. The latter category includes projects like broadband, water systems and railways.

That means the immediate economic benefits will be limited.

"There are typically long delays between appropriations and actual outlays when it comes to infrastructure spending; even though the bill specifies appropriation limits for five years, actual outlays may extend well beyond five years," analysts at Barclays wrote recently.

Barclays said it expects only "modestly stronger" activity in 2022 and 2023 as a result of new infrastructure spending, with the biggest boost to GDP coming in 2024 and 2025. The bank upgraded its 2022 growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%.

The good news is America doesn't have a near-term growth problem, with the economy still benefitting from massive stimulus and the ongoing return-to-work from the pandemic. In fact, the US economy is at risk of overheating.

Reaction: The US Chamber of Commerce said it has been advocating for investment infrastructure for more than a decade.

"Our elected leaders are on the precipice of a historic investment in our nation's crumbling infrastructure. Turning this long-overdue promise into a reality will grow our economy and strengthen our competitiveness for decades to come," the powerful business lobby said in a statement.

So, what will the money be spent on?

$110 billion for roads, bridges and major infrastructure projects

$39 billion to modernize public transit

$66 billion in passenger and freight rail

$17 billion in port infrastructure

$25 billion on airport upgrades

$65 billion to rebuild the electric grid

$55 billion to upgrade water infrastructure

$21 billion on environmental remediation

The list goes on, and my colleagues at CNN Politics have a full breakdown

Progress on infrastructure is one of several developments in Washington that investors should be monitoring this summer and fall.

Early Wednesday, Senate Democrats approved a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, setting the stage for the party to attempt to pass a sweeping economic package that would expand the social safety net.

Oh, and this: Republicans in the Senate say they won't vote to raise the debt ceiling, a mechanism that is a major source of frustration for investors. If Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling, the federal government will likely run out of cash by October or November, risking a disastrous default.

The debt ceiling is a legal limit on how much the US government can borrow, and (so far as we know) unique among developed economies. Remember: Congress has already authorized this spending!

Inflation wiped out America's pay raises

Companies big and small are raising wages to attract workers and hold onto employees as the economy revs back into gear.

But those fatter paychecks aren't going as far, thanks to rising inflation, reports my CNN colleague Tami Luhby

In fact, compensation is now lower than it was in December 2019, when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis by Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University.

The Employment Cost Index — which measures wages and salaries, along with health, retirement and other benefits — fell in the last quarter and is 2% below its pre-pandemic trend, when taking inflation into account.

Not counting inflation, compensation rose 2.8% between March and June, despite the relatively high unemployment rate — a trend that reflects the tight labor market. Job openings are at record-high levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But at the same time, prices are soaring. Gas costs more. Food is more expensive. Car prices are at record levels. The consumer price index rose 0.9% in June and 5.4% over the past 12 months — the largest jumps for each since mid-2008.

How long will the trend continue? Consumer price index data for July, which will be published at 8:30 a.m. ET, could provide clues.

How to pressure companies on climate

Individuals can swap out lightbulbs, slash energy use and reduce plastic consumption. But making real progress on climate requires bold action by the world's biggest companies, report Rachel Ramirez and Alexis Benveniste.

Joeri Rogelj, one of the authors of this week's landmark UN report, said the world requires rapid change on a big scale to avoid catastrophic impacts.

"As an individual, there are things we can do in our own lives, but they won't be sufficient to rise up to the challenge of halting climate change," Rogelj told CNN Business.

"What is really important is structural change — and that can only be achieved through long-term thinking and long-term investments and regulations," he added.

As climate anxiety runs high, Rogelj said there are meaningful ways individuals can put pressure on corporations and policymakers to make rapid, stringent cuts on planet-heating emissions.

"If you have savings, you can reach out to your community and put them in more environmentally friendly goals," Rogelj said. "You can also talk to your decision-makers and let them know that this is an issue that you care about by writing them letters."

London (CNN Business) If there was ever any doubt that individual investors are a powerful new force on Wall Street, AMC Entertainment ( AMC ) CEO Adam Aron may just have silenced the skeptics.

The latest: On the company's earnings call Monday, Aron made it very clear through his choice of words — and downright flattery — that he views retail investors as crucial to the movie theater chain's fortunes

It's not altogether surprising, given that AMC — which had to close all of its cinemas during the peak of the pandemic last year — has been a major beneficiary of the meme stock phenomenon , in which retail investors pour billions of dollars into often troubled companies.

The company posted a loss for the three months ended June, but it was narrower than analysts expected and revenue came in ahead of forecasts.

Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC Entertainment, at one of the company's theaters in Leawood, Kansas.

"In short, AMC crushed it in Q2," Aron said on the call, adopting the Reddit crowd's lingo. Later, Aron highlighted the fact that AMC has implemented some of the "great ideas" that individual investors have "showered" it with, including screening professional sporting events and concerts.

He answered around a dozen questions submitted by individual investors. "Can you guys make the AMC mascot officially a gorilla?," Aaron asked, reflecting the tendency of Reddit investors to refer to each other as "apes." "Would AMC ever consider reestablishing drive-in theaters?," Ryan wanted to know.

By comparison, Aron took questions from just one analyst — down from about six a year ago — blaming time constraints for cutting it short.

The reaction: The stock gained Monday and is up nearly 9% premarket. AMC's newest shareholders raved about Aron's performance on social media platforms such as Reddit afterwards. "Silverback Adam crushed the earnings call. If you're "in this to win this", you should listen to it," wrote one observer on Twitter.

What it means: Individual investors matter and companies are embracing them for good reason.

AMC's stock is up over 1,500% so far this year and it was able to raise $587 million in June as meme traders piled in, even though none of the analysts who cover the company recommend buying the stock and theater attendance remains way below pre-pandemic levels.

Watch this space: Playing to another online crowd favorite, AMC announced that it would start rolling out technology to let moviegoers in the United States pay for their tickets and snacks in bitcoin by the end of the year.

It is also buying up American theaters and plans to open about a dozen new venues in the United States, Europe and the Middle East this year, betting that consumers will return to the movies once the pandemic subsides.

"We fundamentally believe that ours is a future that is bright because there is nothing as magical as seeing dazzling images on a huge silver screen," Aron said on the call.

Companies have nowhere to hide on climate

Businesses that don't have a plan in place to cut their carbon emissions may soon find themselves on the receiving end of shareholder revolts.

What's happening: On Monday, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial era levels and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees — a critical threshold with dire global consequences.

The shocking assessment will only increase pressure on companies to scale up climate action in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.

HSBC HSBC "The science is crystal clear but the response is not. Investors must use their influence to push decision makers to make the bold emission reductions required to limit the most severe consequences of climate change," Wai-Shin Chan, global head of environmental, social and governance research at, told Reuters.

How to retire early

Early retirement has long been seen as the preserve of a lucky few who hit the big time in their 30s or 40s, often with a high-stakes bet on a business venture that turns out to be a major success. That may be changing.

The Financial Independence Retire Early movement — known as FIRE — is a method of living below your means to obtain financial independence as early as possible, my CNN Business colleague Jazmin Goodwin reports.

How it works: FIRE focuses on keeping expenses low and savings high. People pursuing this goal start by picking a "FIRE number," which is the amount of money they need to save to generate enough income to cover expenses without having to work.

Generally, this means saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt.

Bottom line: "Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend," explains Danielle R. Harrison, founder and president at Harrison Financial Planning.

A lead negotiator, Sen. Pat Toomey, put it more bluntly on Monday, describing cryptocurrency as "an issue that has been vexing us." Another lead negotiator, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, called it "such a new subject to so many people in the US Senate."

A last-minute cryptocurrency tax provision was tacked on to the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill last week, which complicated infrastructure negotiations as a bitter dispute emerged over proposed tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions. It also prompted a sharp public outcry over the item's initial language .

The Employment Cost Index — which measures wages and salaries, along with health, retirement and other benefits — fell in the last quarter and is 2% below its pre-pandemic trend, when taking inflation into account. (Wages and salaries are growing at a faster pace than benefits.)

"The hot economy is heating prices more than it is heating wages," said Furman.

Inflation is eroding the wage increases that employers are giving to attract and keep workers.

The index is not subject to the same distortions as other measures, such as average hourly earnings, because it keeps the composition of the workforce constant. The average hourly earnings metric has been swinging during the pandemic as many lower-wage workers lost their jobs initially and are now returning to work

and 5.4% over the past 12 months — the largest jumps for each since mid-2008, according to federal data. The consumer price index rose 0.9% in June and 5.4% over the past 12 months — the largest jumps for each since mid-2008, according to federal data.

Americans are noticing, raising concerns about the higher prices for homes, cars and household goods, such as appliances, according to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers released in late July. Still, they generally view the price hikes as short-term, and their improved finances has greatly reduced their resistance to the increases, Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, wrote in the most recent report.

Differences by industry

Inflation-adjusted compensation is down in most industries, but there is one notable exception: Leisure and hospitality. That industry's employers are scrambling to find workers, resulting in a 1.6% bump in pay and benefits since December 2019, according to Furman's analysis.

But employees of the utilities industry saw their real compensation slide 1% since December 2019. In education and health services, their real compensation slid 0.8%. Manufacturing fell 0.7% and in transportation and warehousing, real compensation slipped 0.6%.

But if the inflation growth rate starts to ease, workers will be better able to enjoy their boost in pay.

"To the extent that inflation is transitory, this dip in real wages is also transitory," said Tim Duy, chief US economist at SGH Macro Advisors, a research firm for the financial industry and policymakers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) The climate crisis is accelerating at unprecedented pace, according to a new United Nations state-of-the-science report. It is "a code red for humanity," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres — and given that the report concludes the entirety of the warming is due to human greenhouse gas emissions, avoiding the worst of its consequences is up to us.

While the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report concludes that humans are "unequivocally" the cause of the crisis, climate experts say the onus of solving it should not rest on individuals' shoulders.

Though we all should do what we can to limit our own greenhouse gas emissions, no amount of individual action — changing lightbulbs, turning up the thermostat or reducing plastic consumption — will address the magnitude of the problem, according to scientists and advocates who spoke with CNN. We need bold, global policies, they said, and lawmakers need to hold industry accountable for its role in perpetuating the crisis.

Joeri Rogelj, a lead author for the UN report's chapter on global carbon cycles, says the world requires rapid change on a big scale to avoid catastrophic impacts.

"As an individual, there are things we can do in our own lives, but they won't be sufficient to rise up to the challenge of halting climate change," Rogelj told CNN. "What is really important is structural change — and that can only be achieved through long-term thinking and long-term investments and regulations."

As climate anxiety runs high, Rogelj said there are meaningful ways individuals can put pressure on corporations and policymakers to make rapid, stringent cuts on planet-heating emissions.

"If you have savings, you can reach out to your community and put them in more environmentally friendly goals," Rogelj said. "You can also talk to your decision-makers and let them know that this is an issue that you care about by writing them letters."

Lisa DeVille, an Indigenous environmental activist from North Dakota, has long leveraged environmental policies to rally her community and participate in public comment hearings about polluting infrastructure. If the climate crisis feels overwhelming, engage in the political process, she said.

"It's good to hear international scientists echoing what most of us can see with our own eyes," DeVille said. "Climate change is real and that it's hurting people in our planet right now today."

Ultimately, big businesses and the fossil fuel industry need to be held accountable, according to Rogelj.

Corporate change took the form of ousted board members this summer when activist shareholders replaced three people on ExxonMobil's board. For the first time in modern history , America's largest oil company faced a credible challenge from an activist hedge fund, Engine No. 1, which was displeased with Exxon's financial performance and what it saw as the company's foot-dragging on climate

The vote was a major milestone in the climate battle. The Engine No. 1 campaign was the first proxy campaign at a major US company in which the case for change was built around the shift away from fossil fuels.

An ExxonMobil petrochemical complex under construction in Texas in July.

The climate crisis poses an existential threat to Exxon, one climate activists argue the company hasn't taken seriously enough. The big oil company has deployed Big Tobacco-like propaganda for decades in an effort to downplay the gravity of the climate crisis , shifting the blame to its consumers and protecting its own interests, according to a Harvard University study published earlier this year that used machine learning and algorithms to uncover trends in more than 200 public and internal Exxon documents between 1972 and 2019.

In response to the study, Exxon told CNN Business in May that "ExxonMobil supports the Paris climate agreement, and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies."

The Harvard study, Exxon added at the time, is "clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies."

Months before the IPCC report was released, the International Energy Agency warned the world it needs to immediately stop drilling for oil and gas to prevent a climate catastrophe. The IEA report nudged companies toward renewables and urged milestones that included immediately stopping new gas and oil projects, halting the sale of new fossil fuel boilers starting in 2025 and increasing electric vehicle sales to at least 60% by 2030.

The IEA also pointed to the economic benefits of focusing on climate change, emphasizing that the annual energy investment would surge to $5 trillion by 2030 from $2.3 trillion in recent years, adding 0.4 percentage points to global GDP growth.

As the focus turns to the world's main greenhouse gas emitters — industrial sectors like agriculture or oil and gas — climate activists are pushing against the idea of individual actions like recycling or eating less meat.

"We need to stop blaming ourselves and start holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for decades of disinformation and political sabotage," Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media, a nonprofit media organization dedicated to the climate crisis.

The concept of an individual having a "carbon footprint" has been emphasized in marketing campaigns designed for BP, for example, to maintain BP's image on climate change in China. In a 2007-2008 document, advertising company Ogilvy summarized the campaign : "BP aims to be seen as an environmentally responsible company and supports efforts to reduce China's climate change impact. Encouraging environmental education among Chinese people is also a priority for BP."

Ogilvy also noted that, at the time, there had "been over 500,000 visits to the website with 400,000 people clicking to calculate their carbon footprint."

"One thing individuals can do is look at what industries are in your backyard that you can really fight against," Maria Lopez-Nuñez, deputy director of the Ironbound Community Corporation, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that focuses on climate and environmental justice, told CNN.

Lopez-Nuñez's organization has engaged with policymakers on pollution issues stemming from a local trash incinerator. The Covanta Essex incinerator in Newark burns nearly 985,000 tons of trash each year, according to the company . Incinerators, which were created due to limited space in landfills, emit greenhouse gas and can aerosolize other hazardous pollutants such as mercury and lead.

Lopez-Nuñez says if you want to take meaningful action on the climate crisis, do some homework on the groups active in your area.

"Find frontline organizations that are in neighborhood, not just the big organizations," said Lopez-Nuñez. "When you don't know what's going on, go find the people that know the issues of your neighborhood, of your cities, of your state."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Amazon is changing its complaint process for returns and will pay customers up to $1,000 for products sold by third-party sellers that caused damage or personal injury.

The company announced Tuesday that it will deal with customer satisfaction itself and go after companies afterward if third parties are unresponsive or unwilling to compensate valid claims. Amazon said the changes begin September 1 for all products sold on its website.

Here's how it works: Customers can contact Amazon's customer service and they will notify the seller of the problem. If the seller doesn't respond, Amazon said it will "address the immediate customer concern, bear the cost ourselves, and separately pursue the seller." If the seller rejects the claim, Amazon said it might step in to help address the problem pay up to $1,000 at no cost to the seller.

"This streamlined process will save time, money, and effort for both customers and sellers," Amazon said about its new "A-to-z Guarantee." That represents a shift from the current process of having buyers contact sellers directly about problems.

In recent years, numerous products sold on Amazon have caught consumers' ire. For example, hoverboards , carbon monoxide detectors and faulty dog collars sold on Amazon have caused problems. That has sparked a lawsuit, called "Oberdorf v. Amazon," that questions if the company can be held liable for damages caused by goods sold by third parties.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@London (CNN Business) The UK government has been warned to stop a massive North Sea oil project or see its hopes of becoming a climate leader dashed as the country prepares to host a crucial environmental summit later this year.

In the coming weeks, Britain's oil regulator could decide whether to green-light the Cambo development near the Shetland Islands, which co-ownersand Blackstone-backed Siccar Point Energy expect to produce 164 million barrels of crude during the first phase of development.

We will know if politicians are listening if the UK government, as hosts of COP who aspire to lead on climate, call time and put a stop to Cambo."

But environmental groups and other activists are furious. They claim that approving the development would damage the environment and undermine claims by the UK government that it's taking bold action ahead of November's 26th UN Climate Change Conference , or COP26, in Glasgow.

"We will know if politicians are listening if the UK government, as hosts of COP who aspire to lead on climate, call time and put a stop to Cambo," said Tessa Khan, a climate lawyer who leads the advocacy group Uplift.

The political fight underscores the challenges facing governments and businesses as they strive to meet net-zero emissions goals aimed at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is essential to maintaining a livable planet.

On Monday, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial era levels, and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees.

Yet the world remains reliant on oil and gas, and companies like Shell are working to provide it. To reach net-zero emissions by 2050, however, no new oil or gas fields can be approved for development, the International Energy Agency warned earlier this year.

"If we reduce the consumption of oil in line with what is needed to reach [the 2050] targets, we will not need to invest in new oil or gas exploration or new coal mining. Very clear," Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, said in a recent interview on Cambo with the UK's Channel 4 . The UK government, he added, should choose to be an "inspiration for the rest of the world."

The Cambo oilfield

The Cambo oilfield is a key project for Shell, which holds a 30% stake, and Siccar Point, which controls 70% of the venture.

"It'll be important for both of them because there are so few developments now [in the North Sea]," said Alexander Kemp, a professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen.

Discovered in 2002, the field could contain over 800 million barrels of heavy crude. Deepwater drilling is expected to start in 2022, with oil production kicking off in 2025 and running until 2050.

"It's a significant size field by today's standards," said Kemp, noting that a more typical development would yield about 20 million barrels, not 164 million.

But the project has stoked the ire of a coalition of environmental advocates, who are ramping up political pressure by highlighting the optics of approving the development so close to COP26. The oil produced will have the same climate footprint as running about 18 coal-fired power stations for a year, Uplift has calculated.

"The proposed new Cambo oilfield is a clear climate contradiction," Jamie Livingstone, head of Oxfam Scotland, said in a statement this month. "If the UK government is to be a credible broker for a deal that can stop the planet overheating when it hosts the COP26 climate talks in November it must intervene in the Cambo case."

The IEA's net-zero roadmap published in May is another flash point. The report plainly states that as of 2021, no new oil and gas fields can be developed in order to reach climate targets. Uplift's Khan said this is "the first major test" since the warning was issued.

A looming decision

The UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is expected to imminently decide whether to allow the development to proceed.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson told local media late last week that the choice is up to the regulator and "no contracts should be ripped up." Greenpeace has said if the OGA moves ahead, it could sue.

The activist group takes particular issue with the government's announcement that it will require new "climate compatibility checkpoints" on future oil and gas licensing rounds to make sure they're in line with the United Kingdom's pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2050. That doesn't apply to Cambo, since a license was already issued in 2001 when exploration of the area began. Greenpeace has called this a deliberate "loophole."

Alok Sharma, the lawmaker appointed by the UK government to lead COP26, did not directly address whether North Sea oil production contradicts UK climate goals when asked by reporters Monday, saying that the government was "going to be very rigorously applying a climate compatibility check" for "future" oil and gas licenses.

Cambo oilfield protestors rally outside a UK government building in Edinburgh, Scotland on July 19, 2021.

There's reason to believe the OGA will push forward with the project, even if it generates backlash.

The agency has emphasized that even under net-zero plans, oil and gas will remain crucial sources of energy for the country, and that it's closely monitoring emissions for all projects to make sure they align with the 2050 goal.

"Oil and gas still make up around three quarters of the UK's energy consumption," Chairman Tim Eggar wrote in the agency's latest annual report. "They are forecast to be needed now and into the future; not just for heating, transport and power generation, but also as a feedstock for manufacturing other materials such as chemicals, medicines and more."

Shell and Siccar Point's role

This position is echoed by those in the oil industry who believe that based on the United Kingdom's ongoing energy requirements, the focus on Cambo is overdone.

"Fields like Cambo meet the UK's energy needs, and producing it here means we can reduce emissions associated with production as much as possible," said Deirdre Michie, CEO of industry group Oil & Gas UK. "A premature ending of domestic production would mean we simply need to import more of it from other countries, at great expense, while losing all control of the environmental standards for how it was produced."

In response to questions from CNN Business, Siccar Point Energy CEO Jonathan Roger said that Cambo would directly create 1,000 jobs in the United Kingdom, and that the oilfield will be built using "modern, low-emission equipment and manufacturing processes and be electrification ready, with the potential to be powered by renewable energy when that's feasible."

Shell emphasized that its oil production peaked in 2019 and is expected to continue to decline until 2030.

"We're already investing billions of dollars in low-carbon energy," a company spokesperson said. "But the world will still need oil and gas for decades to come in sectors that can't be easily decarbonized. Targeted investment in oil and gas will ensure we can supply the energy people will still rely on, while funding the rapid growth of our low-carbon businesses."

But like the UK government, industry players are walking a tightrope.

There are, of course, business considerations at play. The United Kingdom is one of nine core markets that Shell has identified for energy exploration and production. In a report to investors, the Anglo-Dutch company estimated average investment returns of 20% to 25% for similar projects across its portfolio.

Siccar Point said investment in the Cambo project will total about £1.9 billion ($2.6 billion) and £140 million ($194 million) has already been put up. It declined to comment on expected returns.

Meanwhile, investors are asking more from oil companies as they increasingly weigh environmental and social concerns — as are the courts.

In May, a Dutch judge ordered Shell to slash its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels in a landmark climate decision. That would require the company, which is currently targeting a 45% reduction in carbon intensity by 2035, to speed up its transition plan.

Shell is appealing the ruling, which it says risks shifting demand to suppliers that are less concerned about reducing their emissions impact. But the Cambo debate reveals the firm's tough road ahead.

On one hand, Shell wants to drum up confidence in plans to make its business greener. And yet, at its core, it's still a corporation that produces oil and gas. That's not going to change anytime soon.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) A federal judge ruled on Monday that Linda Fairstein — a former prosecutor who was part of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office when it tried the criminal case against the young men who became known as the "Central Park Five" — can sue Netflix, producer and director Ava DuVernay and writer Attica Locke, for her portrayal in the miniseries "When They See Us."

"When They See Us" tells the story of the "Central Park Five" — five teen boys of color who were wrongly convicted of taking part in the rape and beating of a woman who had been jogging in Central Park in 1989.

Fairstein claims she was defamed because her portrayal was inaccurate. The suit was first filed in March of 2020 . Fairstein was played by Felicity Huffman in the series.

"The series portrays [Fairstein] as the architect of various theories of the Five's guilt, and through the concluding scenes of the series, she remains persuaded of their involvement in the face of countervailing evidence," U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel noted in his ruling. "Fairstein alleges that nearly every scene depicting her is a fabrication that presents her in a false and defamatory light."

Netflix had argued that its series used dramatic license that was protected by the First Amendment. But Castel ruled that Fairstein could sue because her depiction in five scenes could be defamatory.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Retiring early might seem like an impossible financial goal. But with the right plan in place, it can be done.

Financial Independence Retire Early -- or FIRE -- is a method of living below your means to obtain financial independence and security as early as possible.

"The mentality behind the movement is where one strives to live life on their own terms and to get off the proverbial hamster wheel where you are dependent on your employer and have the freedom and security to do so," said Danielle R. Harrison, founder and president at Harrison Financial Planning.

That could mean having the financial freedom to change careers, work less or travel the world.

So what exactly does the FIRE movement entail? Here's everything you need to know.

What is FIRE?

The concept of FIRE is based on the notion that retirement is determined by a financial number and not by a person's age. It focuses on keeping expenses low and savings high. That means usually saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of your annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt.

"FIRE involves a shift in perspective regarding money and work, prioritizing what is most important to your work-life balance, and making decisions not dictated by the need to earn money but the ultimate goal of financial freedom," said AnnaMarie Mock, a certified financial planner and wealth adviser for Highland Financial Advisors.

People looking to pursue FIRE typically start by picking what's called a FIRE number, which is the amount of money you'd need to have saved to generate enough income to cover your expenses without having to work.

To determine your FIRE number, start off by figuring out your yearly expenses, excluding savings and taxes.

From there, calculate how much savings you'll need to generate that much income without having a paycheck.

One rule of thumb, known as the 4% rule, says that retirees can safely withdraw about 4% of their savings a year without running out of money. That means saving 25 times your current annual expenses could last indefinitely with regular 4% yearly withdrawals.

For example, if your annual expenses are $50,000 per year, you would need at least $1,250,000 ($50,000 x 25) saved when you retire.

You can also take a more conservative approach by saving 28 to 33 times your current expenses, and take only 3% to 3.5% withdrawals.

From there, try an online calculator to determine how much to save and when you can reach that early nest egg number.

Starting as early as possible comes with many advantages. After all, getting a head start on your savings and investments gives your money more time to compound. But even though retiring early requires various sacrifices when it comes to saving and spending, the perks can be rewarding.

"The biggest perk of FIRE is independence," said Kevin Chancellor, a certified Social Security claiming strategist and financial adviser. "If your budget is still sustainable then you have the freedom to travel, be involved in your kid's school activities, start a side business or hobby, and spend more time doing what you want to do rather than what you need to do."

Reaching the magic number

Many people think they don't earn enough to be able to retire early. But there are several methods of reaching FIRE that could help them retire faster than they think.

When making the decision to retire early, you should expect to make some significant lifestyle changes. Those changes could be as big as increasing your streams of income or as small as cutting your own hair. It all comes down to either reducing how much you spend or boosting how much you save -- or both.

"Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend," said Harrison.

One way to do that is to drastically slash expenses and live a more frugal and lean lifestyle, which is often the quickest way to FIRE. Known as "Lean FIRE," this typically means having a lower target number for your nest egg and living more modestly in retirement.

Those who aren't interested in pinching pennies and have higher-than-average expenses can still retire by increasing their income.

Some ways to achieve "Fat FIRE," as it's known, could involve negotiating a higher salary , finding a higher paying job, accumulating sought-after skills, working a side-hustle or owning rental properties. Often, those pursuing Fat FIRE will either choose to work in higher paying professions or take longer to reach their larger savings goal.

Some people who want to retire sooner can pursue another method often called "Barista FIRE." In this scenario, you can quit your full-time day job once you've stashed away enough retirement savings to grow into a nice nest egg in a few more years without having to add funds. But rather than ceasing work altogether, you work a part-time job, pursue a less lucrative dream career or take on freelance projects in order to cover basic living expenses, all the while allowing your long-term retirement savings to grow until a more traditional retirement age.

Is FIRE right for me?

Another thing to consider is how you'll spend your time without filling your days with a paid job.

For example, will you pursue hobbies, volunteer or travel more? Without a plan in place, you might find that FIRE isn't all you'd hoped it would be.

"For anyone retiring, it is important to know what you are retiring to. This is even more important for those looking to retire early," said Harrison. "Figure out what is going to give your life meaning and purpose, so your retirement years can bring you joy."

On Friday, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of the American company's efforts to stop its rival Reliance from buying Future Retail, a local, cash-strapped retailer.

The e-commerce firm founded by Jeff Bezos had been trying to stop the deal since it was announced last year, and in October, Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) had ordered a temporary halt on the $3.4 billion deal.

Future Group had raised questions about the validity of the Singapore court's order in India, but the country's Supreme Court ruled Friday that it is enforceable.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New Delhi (CNN Business) The coronavirus pandemic appears to have given an unexpected boost to a small — but influential — cohort of India's working women.

While theeconomy has been battered by Covid-19 educated women inmiddle-to-senior positions have seen job opportunities rise in the last year, recruiters in the country told CNN Business.

They attribute the shift to the trend of working from home that many companies have embraced during the pandemic.

"'Flexible' used to be a bad word for recruiters," said Neha Bagaria, founder of online jobs platform JobsForHer. "It really took the pandemic to gain an acceptance for work from home roles."

A recent survey by her team of more than 300 companies in India found that women accounted for 43% of middle-to-senior management roles in 2020, a jump of more than 20 percentage points from the previous year.

That flexibility might not last forever, however, as many companies around the world roll out plans to return their workers to the office, at least part time.

But the uptick noted by JobsForHer and others has given companies an insight into the policies that might work should they want to encourage gender diversity.

Stay remote, stay productive

Even though India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and its women are more educated than ever before, they aren't joining the workforce. According to the World Bank, women comprised just over 20% of India's total labor force in 2019, down from about 26% in 2005 . In the United States, that number was about 46% in 2019.

From restrictive cultural norms to office harassment, there are many reasons why highly skilled Indian women might choose to stay at home.

But over the last decade, the government and corporations have been trying to encourage more women to join the workforce.

times an emerging country has implemented gender quotas to encourage diversity, according to the In 2013, India's market regular mandated all publicly traded companies to appoint at least one woman to their boards of directors. That marked one of the firsttimesan emerging country has implemented gender quotas to encourage diversity, according to the Harvard Business School Review

Since 2017, the country has also mandated 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, which is more than richer countries such as the United States or Japan.

Despite those efforts, the participation of women in the workforce remains dismal.

The pandemic, however, has shown employers that remote work can be just as effective as being in the office. This policy has also encouraged more women to re-enter the job market after taking a break because of caregiving responsibilities, among other reasons, recruiters said.

"In 2021, the number of women actively exploring job opportunities has gone up by 89% vis-a-vis 2020," Aditya Mishra, founder of Ciel HR Services, told CNN Business, based on an analysis of his staffing agency's data on middle and senior level hiring.

A service employee working in Delhi and living in Noida works from home.

"Even though there has been a muted growth in the job market, we observed that companies across sectors have gone on to hire 21% more women than the previous year," Mishra added.

briefly Overall, unemployment numbers in Asia's third largest economy remain high due to the pandemic-related slowdown, which pushed the countrybriefly into recession last year.

Some companies launched initiatives designed to attract women who want to work remotely. Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, rolled out a program this year to hire women for entry level jobs — in areas ranging from software to finance — from small towns in India that wouldn't require them to relocate — even after the pandemic subsides.

"This was a talent pool we did not have access to earlier," said Shalini Nataraj, the global head of human resources for Maersk's Global Service Centre.

The company registered an 11-percentage-point increase in the number of women leaders hired in India this year from 2019, she said. The firm also recorded a spike in applications from women last year, after it started asking its women employees to draft job descriptions.

However, Nataraj admitted that the company still has to do more to address the gender pay gap.

Maersk did not have further data on the topic. But according to a 2018 survey published by the career website Monster , India's overall gender pay gap was 22.5% that year.

Still a long way to go

While a sliver of educated women in India have found more job opportunities, the majority of working women — especially those lower down the economic ladder — were hit hard by last year's economic turmoil.

The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab has been studying the impact of the pandemic on workers from some of India's poorest states. In a report on young migrant workers from the states of Bihar and Jharkhand, the researchers found that Covid-19 pushed men out of salaried work, and women out of the workforce entirely.

"They [women] had this one chance of working. Now they are back home with their families and being pushed to get married," Clément Imbert, associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick and one of the researchers, told CNN Business.

For thosewho have stayedemployed, the additional burden of domestic duties and childcare has led to an enormous amount of stress.

Some Indian working women are luckier in this respect than their western counterparts, according to Bagaria of JobsForHer.

"Women in India have more family support," she said.

Many Indians live in extended families with in-laws, or parents, and have more relatives to help look after children. It is also cheaper to hire live-in domestic workers in the country than it is in the West.

While companies have seen the benefits of gender diversity at the middle and top, "nobody is hiring a CEO by saying, 'Never come to my main office,'" said Ashutosh Khanna, senior client partner at management consulting firm Korn Ferry. "They will eventually have to make the move."

For now, women are enjoying the wiggle room they have. Bhuvana Subramanyan was hired by staffing company Randstad India as chief marketing officer last August, after an entirely virtual interview process. Even with her new responsibilities, she said she still has time for "simple pleasures," such as daily yoga practice.

"I am not getting stuck in traffic jams anymore," the Bengaluru resident told CNN Business. The southern Indian city is notorious for its painfully gridlocked roads, which have taken a horrifying toll on productivity and health of workers

Apart from more "me-time," Subramanyan, 47, said work-from-home during the pandemic has been empowering for women employees.

"Virtual calls have democratized conversations," she said. " You now have the opportunity to unmute yourself and talk."

"India is a tough market to operate in, but if you are building to succeed in India, you are already exceptional," Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal wrote in a blog post Friday. "We are going to relentlessly focus on 10 years out and beyond, and are not going to alter our course for short term profits at the cost of long term success of the company."

While Indian stock markets have been trading near all-time highs, Zomato's listing was a big test of investor appetite for loss-making tech startups. Zomato reported revenue of 19.93 billion rupees ($266 million) for the year to March 31, 2021, and a loss of 8.16 billion rupees ($109 million).

The country has a ton of so-called unicorns — tech startups valued at more than $1 billion — but none of them had ever gone public in India or overseas before.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@London (CNN Business) In India, the country with the world's second-highest number of Covid-19 cases, a handful of hospitals has started to use robots to connect patients with their loved ones, and assist healthcare workers on the frontlines of the pandemic.

Bangalore-based Invento Robotics has designed three robots to carry out tasks ranging from disinfecting surfaces to answering patient questions and enabling video consultations with doctors.

Of the eight the company has so far deployed, the most popular model is Mitra, which means friend in Hindi and costs around $10,000. Using facial-recognition technology, the robot can recall the names and faces of patients it has interacted with. Mitra can roam around a hospital independently, helping patients connect with family and doctors via its cameras and a video screen attached to its chest.

"Mitra can be the nurse's or doctor's assistant, take readings and vitals, remind them of medications," says Balaji Viswanathan, CEO of Invento Robotics.

He says the human-like robot engages with patients and gains their trust. "It may sound ironic but we are using robots to bring humanity to hospitals," he tells CNN Business.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) " The Suicide Squad ," a new, R-rated superhero film from Warner Bros., opened to an estimated $26.5 million at the North American box office this weekend. That number came in under industry expectations, which projected the film to make around $30 million. The movie took in $72.2 million worldwide, according to the studio.

So does that mean the film starring Idris Elba, John Cena and Margot Robbie as the devilishly crazy Harley Quinn was a flop? Not exactly.

As we've seen so much this summer , it's getting increasingly difficult to gauge success at the box office. Theaters are still trying to find their footing after the pandemic ravaged their business, and offering blockbusters at home via streaming has skewed the metrics even further.

That said, "Suicide Squad" is a big-budget superhero film by director James Gunn, who also directed Marvel's incredibly popular "Guardians of the Galaxy." His newest film also earned great reviews from critics ( 92% score on Rotten Tomatoes ) and stars well-known actors, so box office expectations were high going into the weekend.

But several factors may have dampened turnout. For starters, "The Suicide Squad" opened as concerns about rising Covid cases from the Delta variant are growing. Those fears may have scared some consumers away from wanting to sit indoors with strangers for two hours. But it's still too early to tell if the rise of the variant and the revived Covid restrictions — such as the CDC again recommending people wear masks indoors — had an impact.

Comscore SCOR Another reason the film may have missed expectations is that it's a follow-up to 2016's "Suicide Squad." That film was poorly received by fans and critics alike, despite making $747 million globally, according to. The 2021 film includes some of the same characters and actors from the 2016 version, and is less of a sequel and more of a second try. In the end, the sour response to the original film and confusion over this one's connection to it may have been a difficult sell for moviegoers.

Although any one of these reasons could be to blame for the humdrum opening of "The Suicide Squad," it's likely a mixture of all of the above.

At the end of the day, it's not 2019 anymore, and the box office isn't the only way to judge if a film is a hit or not. Streaming is now the focus in Hollywood, so although the movie came in light at the box office, at least compared to the high expectations, it still could be considered a success for bringing attention — and possibly subscribers — to HBO Max. But without clear streaming viewership metrics, it's hard to say for sure.

Now Hollywood and theaters look to the rest of the summer to see how the box office will do, how audiences will continue to react to the streaming revolution, and what effect, if any, the rise of the Delta variant will have on ticket sales overall.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) The hottest new reality show isn't set in a house, on an obstacle course, or on the Jersey Shore. Television producers are betting on a new location: the International Space Station.

Two reality television shows are in the works that would offer a first for viewers by taking them inside the ISS, as a member of the public will be awarded a multi-million dollar experience to space as the grand prize on both. The Discovery Channel is considering "Who Wants to Be an Astronaut" while a competitor, "Space Hero," is hoping to land somewhere else.

The "Who Wants to Be An Astronaut" premise is simple and relies on traditional reality television tropes. Here on Earth, contestants will vie for an all-expenses-paid trip to live on the ISS for eight days. The as-yet unknown "variety of extreme challenges" are designed to determine which competitors have what it takes to be a real astronaut, and passage to space will be provided by Houston-based space broker Axiom Space. While NASA hasn't confirmed that Axiom Space will even be able to secure a seat on a commercial rocket, Discovery is confident in its plans. The media company has even enlisted former astronaut Mike Massimino's consulting services.

Unlike most astronauts, Massimino is no stranger to filming for entertainment purposes in space. While on a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope in 2009, he personally shot footage on the ISS for the Hubble documentary, using IMAX cameras to give viewers a close-up and realistic look at what goes into the process of repairing the telescope. "A lot of our training is what we call Photo TV training," the astronaut said. "And that's just to share the experience with the rest of the world to get documentation of the planet."

Massimino envisions a future where more people with special, non-astronaut skills -- like filming -- are trained for missions. "Hopefully we'll get better movies out of it, and better entertainment ... that's what I'm hoping for," he said.

But a typical Earthly film crew can't be recreated in space. The ISS is narrow and cramped; it wasn't built with big cameras in mind. "You can't have a whole crew. You're not going to be able to launch 50 people to the space station," said Massimino.

That said, the space station started construction in 1998 and since then, advancements in camera technology and a reduction in barriers to space travel have broadened the scope of what is possible on the station. "Years ago, this really wasn't an option. There really wasn't any opportunity for people to do this, for people to participate in so many different ways ... And it's not just NASA astronauts. So that's why I think we're seeing a lot more interest because more people are able to participate," Massimino added.

"Who Wants to Be an Astronaut" is entirely U.S. based, but "Space Hero" is attempting to bring a global component to the TV-in-space sector. Creators Deborah Sass and Thomas Reemer, hailing from England and Berlin respectively, have been business partners for years, and they have a plan to make sure that space travel isn't limited to countries that already have a stake in the ISS.

The privately-funded "Space Hero" plans to start with 24 contestants from around the world. "Twelve men and twelve women, twelve from underdeveloped countries and twelve from developed countries," says Sass. "And they will be put into a Space Village, kind of like the Big Brother house, but with wearable technology and biometrics testing."

While in the 'Space Hero' house, activities and challenges will narrow down the list of candidates until only one person remains. Naturally, the global audience will be encouraged to vote for their favorite would-be astronaut. Reemer, a founding partner and Co-CEO on the project, predicts that the demand for an astronaut from lesser-known countries is there: "There is Nigeria with two hundred million inhabitants, never had an astronaut. That's where the hunger comes from. India, the last astronaut from India was 1985... It means something to be the first astronaut of your country."

Traveling beyond the ISS, with the participation of multiple countries seems like a moonshot right now, but the minds behind the global reality show have already started reaching across borders to foster relationships with other space agencies. Space Hero claims that multiple agreements have already been forged internationally, along with already securing a seat for space passage with Axiom Space, slated for early 2023.

NASA is seemingly on board with the expansion of uses for the ISS. Former Senator Bill Nelson, who was recently sworn in as NASA administrator, is open to different uses outside routine research.

"As we go into space, we want to encourage entrepreneurs to do new things. And to utilize the extraordinary zero G of space to do all kinds of science, as well as entertainment," he said.

But will these out-of-this-world shows ever arrive on your screens? Maybe. Regulatory hurdles will create some difficulty. In 2019, NASA stated that it would be open and able to handle two space tourism missions per year, but NASA guidelines and regulations require those missions to use a U.S. spacecraft. That complicates timing, as private and public companies vie for the sought-after spots.

"Who Wants to Be an Astronaut" is now currently taking applications through its online portal. Space Hero's application will open on December 21st, 2021.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection — the ruling Chinese Communist Party's disciplinary watchdog — said Thursday that the Cyberspace Administration of China, the internet regulator, has shut down 1,300 fan groups, disabled 4,000 online accounts, and removed more than 150,000 "toxic" remarks in a recent crackdown against "unhealthy" celebrity fan culture.

"The chaos in celebrity fan clubs, exposed by the 'Kris Wu' incident, reflects that bad fan culture has reached a critical moment that must be corrected," the agency said, adding that "fan club" culture is "crazy" and "devil-possessed."

"We must cut off the black hand of the capital — and curb the wild growth of the entertainment industry, " the agency said.

The government's criticism of misused capital and the entertainment industry echoes its broader clampdown on the private sector . As President Xi Jinping increasingly emphasizes the ruling Communist Party's dominant role in every aspect of China's economy and society, regulators have targeted tech, education and other businesses with fines and restrictions. They've blamed private capital for everything from contributing to risks to data security and education inequality to threatening social stability.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Mike Richards, who is in line to become the new host of "Jeopardy!," is defending himself against allegations that he mistreated colleagues at another game show.

At the same time, he is also confirming has been asked to "consider hosting the show."

Richards, who is currently the executive producer of "Jeopardy!," said "no final decisions have been made" about the next host. "Discussions with me and other potential hosts are still ongoing," he wrote in an internal memo Monday morning.

A spokesperson for Sony, the production company behind the game show, shared the memo.

The appearance of Richards picking himself to succeed Alex Trebek has generated some backlash in the days since Variety first reported that he was in "advanced negotiations" to take over the show.

Richards noted in his memo that "the choice on this is not my decision and never has been."

Indeed, CNN Business reported last week that the ultimate decision-maker is Tony Vinciquerra, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment.

"Throughout this search, Sony's top priority has always been to continue the incredible legacy you and Alex built," Richards wrote Monday. "As you know, Alex always believed the game itself and the contestants are the most important aspects of the show, and that will continue to be the guiding principle as the decision is finalized."

The main thrust of Richards' memo was to counter recent stories about his reputation.

The Daily Beast, for example, wrote last week that "multiple women sued 'The Price Is Right' during Mike Richards' tenure as executive producer, and their stories paint an unsavory picture of Alex Trebek's presumptive successor."

One of the lawsuits alleged that Richards had a hostile reaction when one of the models on the game show, Brandi Cochran, became pregnant.

Cochran sued in 2010. The case was eventually settled in 2016.

According to the lawsuit , when "Cochran revealed that she was carrying twins," Richards "put his face in his hands. He asked her twice, in an annoyed tone, 'Twins? Are you serious? ... You're serious?' After that, Cochran was booked to work less often and was repeatedly taken out of acts she would have appeared in before."

Richards challenged those assertions and others on Monday. "I want you all to know that the way in which my comments and actions have been characterized in these complaints does not reflect the reality of who I am or how we worked together on 'The Price is Right,'" he wrote. "I know firsthand how special it is to be a parent. It is the most important thing in the world to me. I would not say anything to disrespect anyone's pregnancy and have always supported my colleagues on their parenting journeys."

"Jeopardy!" has been on the air this year with guest hosts in the wake of Trebek's death last November. Richards, who has years of past TV hosting experience, was one of the fill-ins, along with stars like Anderson Cooper, Robin Roberts and LeVar Burton.

Joe Buck, the Fox Sports host, is guest-hosting this week, the final week of new episodes in this television season.

Sony will need to appoint a new host very soon since the next season of "Jeopardy!" is about to enter production ahead of a September premiere date.

Richards ended his memo by saying "it is truly an honor to get to work with all of you to produce this amazing show, and I look forward to the days ahead as we get back into production."

The robots — named Tom, Dick and Harry — were developed by Small Robot Company to rid land of unwanted weeds with minimal use of chemicals and heavy machinery.

The startup has been working on its autonomous weed killers since 2017, and this April launched Tom, its first commercial robot which is now operational on three UK farms. The other robots are still in the prototype stage, undergoing testing.

Small Robot says robot Tom can scan 20 hectares (49 acres) a day, collecting data which is then used by Dick, a "crop-care" robot, to zap weeds. Then it's robot Harry's turn to plant seeds in the weed-free soil.

Using the full system, once it is up and running, farmers could reduce costs by 40% and chemical usage by up to 95%, the company says.

But there are a few not-so-conventional parts of this bar, too. Its white, tile-clad entrance doubles as a "laboratory" where its mixologists experiment with new flavors, and at the back, a "fermentation room" houses jars of home-brews.

It's all part of a broader concept -- from drinks to furniture -- built around reducing waste and minimizing carbon emissions.

"What we do here is a bit different from other bars and restaurants in Hong Kong," says Agung Prabowo, who co-founded the bar in November 2020 with long-time business partner and fellow mixologist Roman Ghale, and their wives, Laura Prabowo and Katy Ghale, respectively.

Not even six months into operations, the bar debuted at #30 on Asia's 50 Best Bars 2021 list and won the Sustainable Bar Award.

Describing itself as Hong Kong's first "closed-loop bar," Penicillin is working towards zero waste and hopes to inspire other venues to do the same.

A culture of convenience

Also the brains behind The Old Man, Asia's best bar 2019 , veteran bartenders Agung and Roman have witnessed first-hand the waste in the hospitality industry during their combined four decades of experience. Their goal at Penicillin is to get as close to zero waste as possible, says Roman.

Hong Kong isn't the easiest place to start a green business; it has a culture of convenience that is creating a sustainability crisis.

In 2019, just 29% of Hong Kong's nearly 5.7 million metric tons of waste was recycled -- and it appears to be a downward trend. Government data shows that Hong Kong's recycling rates have fallen over the past decade, which means while less waste was produced, the amount going to landfill still increased by 21%.

For the team at Penicillin, the goal is to turn single-use culture on its head, and the team is constantly looking for new ways to reuse, recycle and minimize waste. Lemons, for instance, are squeezed for their juices, and the remaining pulp, seeds and skin are separated to be brewed into sparkling lemon "wine" in the bar's fermentation room, or dried for cocktail garnishes, says Agung.

From the cocktails to the furniture, Hong Kong bar Penicillin gets creative to reduce waste and minimize carbon emissions.

"We have to think twice before we put anything in the rubbish bin," he says. "You can collect things for the next ingredient, rather than buy it new."

It's not just the drinks -- designed by architecture firm Collective, sustainability has been built into the foundations of the bar with furniture and fittings made locally from recycled materials.

Trees uprooted during the 2018 Typhoon Mangkhut have been turned into tables and finished with recycled aluminum soda cans, while the LED wall lights are rescued tubes from Hong Kong's iconic neon street signs. Every detail, from the recycled-paper business cards to the custom-made recycled-cotton uniforms, has been carefully considered.

"There's actually fun ways to do sustainability," says Agung.

An eco-spirit solution

Penicillin isn't the only business working to clean up the drinks industry. While bars and restaurants around the world are trying to recycle and reduce waste, many of the industry's most unsustainable elements are in the manufacturing and transportation of alcohol.

That's where Singapore startup EcoSPIRITS saw a gap in the market. Its closed-loop distribution system processes premium spirits direct from distillers into its EcoTOTE, a refillable 4.5-liter, tamper-proof bottle. Bars can then refill their branded spirit bottles on-site, and once the tote is empty, it gets picked up when the new order arrives.

This eliminates the need for new, carbon-intensive branded glass bottles to be created, says EcoSPIRITS founder Paul Gabie.

"You're not only reducing costs for the supply chain; the venues are getting the same spirit at a lower cost," says Gabie. "You have this very powerful, quantifiable reduction in physical waste and CO2 footprint, and those are easy propositions for the industry."

EcoSPIRITS claims its process can save 90% of the CO2 footprint of packaging and delivering spirits, which helps the bottom line, too. Gabie estimates bars save between 10 to 25% on spirits, as manufacturers save during production and distribution -- meaning they can offer venues a more competitive price.

Penicillin is one of the nearly 700 bars in the Asia-Pacific region working with EcoSPIRITS, helping them save 150 grams of carbon emissions per cocktail, according to Penicillin. One of its drinks -- "One Penicillin, One Tree" -- actually gives back to the environment, with a tree planted in Borneo for each one purchased.

A community effort

While some businesses are reluctant to adopt sustainable solutions because of the perceived expense, Roman says setup costs are comparable to any other bar, with more potential for long-term savings. "People are always talk about sustainability costing a lot, but actually it's not," he says. "It's time-consuming though -- you need to have a lot of self-discipline."

Collaborating with local businesses, the bar is extending its sustainability mission to the community, such as reusing avocado pits from a Mexican eatery as ice cubes. Dan Hodge/CNN

Penicillin is now trying to include the community in its sustainable solutions through collaborations with local businesses -- which includes collecting oyster shells from a local seafood restaurant to redistill with whiskey for cocktail tinctures, and reusing avocado pits from a Mexican eatery as ice cubes. They are now also making soaps and hand sanitizers in-house with waste alcohol and lemon peel, says Agung.

The team hopes that others in Hong Kong's food and beverage industry will be inspired to make positive, sustainable changes.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Americans living in high-risk Covid states are starting to shy away from restaurants, malls and airports as the Delta variant rapidly spreads.

And real-time economic indicators suggest the Delta variant i s slowing the recovery in some of the hardest hit sectors, even though the impact is not yet being felt nationally.

The findings show how even 18 months after the pandemic erupted, Covid is still calling the shots in today's economy — especially in states with lower vaccination rates.

"The next stage of the recovery requires consumers to leave the home, go on vacation, go to stores, restaurants and malls," said Stuart Kaiser, strategist at UBS. "The fact they are showing less willingness to do that is a negative indicator."

Restaurants, more than almost any other industry, have already been crushed by the pandemic. A staggering 90,000 US eateries have closed permanently or long-term during the pandemic, according to estimates by the National Restaurant Association.

Reservations and foot traffic slow

Restaurant reservations slumped last week in states struggling with the latest Covid-19 wave.

Last week, Jefferies found, restaurant reservations on OpenTable fell 20% below the same point in 2019 in five high-risk Covid states: Alabama, Idaho, Louisiana, Miss and Wyoming. That's a big reversal from early July when reservations in those states were 10% above 2019 levels. Florida — another state grappling with rising Covid-19 infections — also saw a drop in restaurant reservations.

Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, called the restaurant trend a "yellow flag" for the economic recovery.

"Our high frequency data is suggesting that the rising Covid wave of infections is now impacting economic activities," UBS strategist Ajit Agrawal wrote in a note to clients late last week.

Foot traffic at quick service restaurants nationally was down about 25% last week from 2019 levels, according to an analysis provided to CNN Business by research firm InMarket. That's a significant shift from the week of July 4, when foot traffic was up 35% compared with the same period in 2019.

'One step forward and two steps back'

The worry is that these trends could delay the badly needed recovery of the restaurant industry.

There are still 1 million fewer restaurant jobs than before the pandemic, although the sector has added back jobs in each of the last three months. About 40% of small restaurant owners said they couldn't cover their rent in July, according to a survey by Alignable.

"It's like one step forward and two steps back with this pandemic," said Carlos Gazitua, president of Sergio Family's Restaurants, which owns 13 locations throughout South Florida.

There was a "little softness" in restaurant sales last week, he added, especially in communities with older populations. However, he said overall sales haven't taken a hit because delivery and takeout orders are up.

Gazitua, who also serves as a director on the executive committee for the Florida Restaurant & Lodging Association, said there has been a welcome uptick in employees who want to get vaccinated.

"If you don't feel safe going to a restaurant, we're not doing our job and we're going to lose sales," he said.

Warning signs for malls, air travel

Malls, another part of the economy still reeling from Covid, are also getting squeezed by the Delta variant.

As of last week, national mall foot traffic stood at just 53% of 2019 levels, according to InMarket. That's a sharp reversal from the week of July 4 when mall foot traffic was 4% above the same point of 2019.

InMarket found similar declines in customers heading to auto dealers, big-box stores, drug stores, furniture retailers, grocery stores and home improvement retailers. All now stand well below the same point of 2019.

Another potential trouble spot: Air travel.

As of July 3, domestic air travel, measured by tickets issued by US travel agencies and online booking companies, stood at just 3% below 2019 levels, according to the CNN Business Economic Recovery Dashboard . However, domestic air travel has since slowed and as of July 23 was down 22% compared with the same point in 2019.

As of July 23, domestic air travel from Louisiana, a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates, was down 10% compared with two years ago. That number was up 11% compared to 2019 as of July 9. Domestic air travel from Florida experienced a similar slowdown.

"Rising Covid infections seem to be affecting air travel," Agrawal wrote in his UBS report.

UBS also found "softness" in credit card spending for a range of activities, including dining out, home improvement and arts & entertainment.

That's why UBS's Big Data Nowcasting model is downgrading its forecasts for job growth, retail sales and industrial production further below consensus estimates.

"We notice economic activities slowing in the latter half of July, from retail sales, to services spending, to industrial activities, coinciding with the new wave of infections," Agrawal wrote.

The last chapter of the pandemic?

The good news is that the slowdown in consumer activities in high-risk Covid states does not appear to be threatening the broader economic recovery. Economists aren't worried about an imminent recession.

"What's encouraging is these impacts are very, very localized. It's really not showing up on the national level," said Markowska, the Jefferies economist.

That's because the five states with low vaccination rates account for just 3.5% of total US GDP, according to Markowska.

Of course, that's little consolation to the local restaurant owners who are struggling to pay the rent.

Still, there are hopes on Wall Street that this Delta wave will peak quickly, as it has in other nations, allowing the restaurant recovery to get back on track.

"I feel like this will be relatively short-lived," Markowska said. "Two months from now we will hopefully look back and say this was the last chapter in the pandemic, and now the economy can fully reopen."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN Business) Samsung is still betting on a future where smartphones fold in half. But first it must convince users that's a future they want.

At its annual Unpacked event on Wednesday, Samsung will focus on its foldable smartphones instead of its flagship Note devices -- despite lackluster sales for foldable models and a PR crisis in 2019 concerning earlier versions breaking.

announced two new foldable smartphones coming later this month : the Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, a smartphone that opens outward like a book to form a tablet, and the clamshell-like Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, witha design reminiscent of flip phones from the early 2000s. While the company dropped the prices for its third-generation foldables, these products willstill cost buyers at least four figures.

Samsung said the Z Fold3 and Flip3 are slimmer, lighter, more durable and water resistant than its previous foldable models. These improvements follow hiccups in earlier versions that couldn't handle drops, dust and water, and presented significant issues with the screen. The devices also feature new ways to multitask, support for the Note's signature S Pen and an under-screen camera -- yes, a camera that lives under the screen that could someday spell the end of the hated notch.

Even with those updates, Samsung has a long hill to climb. According to data from market research firm Canalys, Samsung shipped just 257,000 foldable phones in the three months ending in June, compared with nearly 58 million non-foldable phones. The company's offerings make up 66% of the total 3.4 million foldable devices shipped since 2019. As Ben Stanton, research manager at Canalys, puts it: "It is still niche ... but Samsung envisions this as a new paradigm for the industry -- with itself at the center."

Samsung also may not have had much of a choice this year. The company has been hit with a reported delay in Note manufacturing due to the global chip shortage./ (A spokesperson told CNN Business the company's decision to focus Unpacked on foldables was unrelated to the shortage.)

The Z Fold3

Samsung touted the Z Fold3 as more durable and dependable than its predecessors. Its 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display is layered to protect against daily wear and tear and features scratch resistant Gorilla Glass. The outer frame is made of 10% stronger aluminum than previous models, and the infamous hinge, where the smartphone folds, is designed with shorter internal bristles to better repel dust and other particles.

Samsung's latest Galaxy Fold model features an under-screen camera.

Those features could be key to building up trust in what is still a new design. In 2019, some early reviewers of its first foldable phone, the Galaxy Fold, reported flickering and broken displays and a screen bulge. Even after its official launch was delayed for months to address the issues, user reviews were mixed.

But at least one big obstacle remains for wider adoption: the price. The new Z Fold3 is $1,799, nearly $200 less than its predecessor but still a staggering sum even compared to other premium devices. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G starts at $799, the Galaxy Note20 starts at $999 and the iPhone 12 Pro starts at $999.

The Galaxy Z Fold3 promises to be a more reliable, durable, dependable product compared to previous models

To help entice buyers, Samsung is taking a risk by trying something new with this product. In addition to the three cameras on the back (a wide angle, an ultra-wide angle and tele-photo lens), the company teased its first ever under-screen camera. The hidden front-facing camera is built under the display so a notch won't get in the way of what a user sees on screen. Considering the technology is still in its infancy, it's possible issues could surface, but Stanton said the Fold3 is the "perfect test bed" for this type of tech because it's more of a prestige device than a mass market product.

The Fold3 also supports S Pen functionality, allowing users to make the most of its massive screen. For example, notes can be taken on one side of the device while doing a video call on the other side, or a to-do list can be checked off while reading emails. The Z Fold3 is available in black, green and silver.

Z Flip3

Foldable displays still lack a solid use case to make them a must-have feature in 2021, but both the Z Fold3 and Z Flip3 have elements that nod to their unique potential.

The Z Flip3, which opens and closes vertically like a traditional flip phone, now comes with a thinner hinge and redesigned cover screen that is four times larger, correcting one of the biggest complaints about the Flip2. It's now easier to view notifications, widgets and messages, and users will have the ability to eyeball their schedule, purchase a coffee via Samsung Pay, check the weather and monitor their daily step count without ever opening the phone.

The Galaxy Z Flip3, which opens and closes vertically, comes with a thinner hinge and redesigned cover screen that is four times larger than the previous model.

Flex mode lets Z Flip3 users take a photo or video from the cover screen. When kept partially folded, users can move a video to the top half of the screen and allow the bottom area to serve as a remote to control the brightness and volume.

Both the Z Fold3 and Z Flip3 include partnerships with Google, Microsoft, and others, so apps better fit the screens. For example, Microsoft Outlook's dual-pane mode for Samsung foldables lets users read a full email while previewing others on the side, similar to a desktop experience.

Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst at Gartner, said much of the success of these products will depend on the apps that developers create to showcase innovative use cases for the extra real estate a foldable screen provides. But convincing developers to spend time creating apps for foldable devices with low user adoption rates will present a challenge.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 makes it easier to view notifications, widgets and messages without opening the phone.

"It's a bit of a chicken-egg dilemma," he said.

The Z Flip3, which comes in cream, green, lavender and black, costs $999 -- or $400 less than last year's model, but nonetheless at the high-end for smartphones.

Smartwatches and wireless earbuds

In addition to foldables, Samsung's wearables lines got a refresh on Wednesday. Its new Galaxy Watch4 and Galaxy Watch4 Classic -- the company's first smartwatches to run on the Wear OS co-created with Google -- promise an even deeper look at a user's health profile.

The Samsung Galaxy Watch4, left, and Galaxy Watch4 Classic, right.

The watches are faster, the display's resolution is crisper and the battery charges faster (the company says a 30 minutes boost will get users 10 hours of battery life). But the real innovation is packed into a new chip with three health sensors. Samsung said the sensors can now assess body composition by measuring skeletal muscle, basal metabolic rate, water retention, and body fat percentage. It also comes with advanced sleep tracking features, such as the ability to monitor snoring.

The Galaxy Watch4, which features an aluminum frame, a sweat-proof sport band and a digital bezel, is available in two sizes, an assortment of colors and starts at at $249.99 for Bluetooth versions and $299.99 for LTE models. The higher-end Watch4 Classic features luxury materials such as stainless steel, and offers a rotating bezel, two size and color options. It starts at $349.99 for Bluetooth versions and $399.99 for LTE models.

Samsung's GalaxyBuds 2 come with active noise cancellation technology, three 3. tips for different sizes and is available in graphite, white, olive and lavender.

Samsung also unveiled its second-generation wireless Galaxy Buds2, its smallest, lightest and most affordable earbuds ($149) to date. Buds2 comes with active noise cancellation, three sizes of soft, flexible tips that users can choose find the most comfortable fit. It's available in graphite, white, olive and lavender.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) If you walked into a grocery store last year , you may have made some unfortunate discoveries: No reduced-fat Jif peanut butter on shelves. Less Progresso soup. Fewer varieties of Smucker's Uncrustables sandwiches available.

All are examples of food that consumer goods manufacturers stopped making in 2020. So unless there was an old jar or can left over, these items and others disappeared from the store. And while it was generally lesser-loved fare that evaporated, depending on how big a fan you were, you may have been sorely disappointed to leave empty-handed.

The good news is that many items that went away are back. The average number of different products sold in grocery stores tracked by Nielsen increased 2.5% to 19,285 items during the 13 weeks ending July 31 compared to the same stretch last year. During that period in 2020, the average number of items at stores declined 4.5% from 2019, according to Nielsen.

At the height of the pandemic last year with restaurants closed and grocery demand soaring, consumer goods manufacturers simplified their supply chains by paring down product offerings and speeding up production lines on their most popular items. This improved companies' ability to meet demand on key goods but meant that consumers had fewer choices on the shelves when they rushed in to stock up on groceries.

Now, companies have shifted back to expanding their variety again to drive sales. "The death of variety that everyone was predicting didn't happen. It has come back in full force," said Krishnakumar Davey, president of IRI's strategic analytics practice. "People are sick and tired of seeing the same products."

Hot sauce and sardines: What's new and what's made a comeback

In order to meet the surge in demand last year, spice maker McCormick "temporarily suspended production of many secondary products to ensure availability of top selling [items]," a spokesperson for the company said in an email.

McCormick MKC has since reinstated all of the items it pulled back on, although it did not say which, and added new lines of Frank's hot sauces, Cholula wing sauces and Grill Mates seasoning blends.

J.M. Smucker SJM last year "temporarily scaled back production" on peanut butter varieties, such as Simply Jif, Reduced Fat and Omega 3. It also cut back on flavors for Smucker Uncrustables — a line of frozen sandwiches and pockets — such as hazelnut, honey, peanut butter and reduced sugar flavors. The company also paused planned product launches.

But Smucker has resumed normal production levels and added those products back. It's now focusing again on product launches, such as recent introductions of Jif Natural Squeeze peanut butter and Smucker's Uncrustables' kids snacks.

General Mills GIS Early in the pandemic,chose to prioritize "producing and maintaining inventory of our most popular flavors while withdrawing items that are important for variety, but would have added short term complexity," said Kelsey Roemhildt, a spokesperson for the company. For its Progresso Soup line, for example, the company minimized the variety from 90 different items to 50. It has since reintroduced those items back to the market, she said.

Some of that has to do with increased demand for packaged food with more people working from home instead of offices.

"It's important that we deliver additional solutions for lunchtime and away-from-home snacking," she said.

Dan Hofmeister, senior vice president of brand marketing at tuna-maker Bumble Bee, said in an email that its item count has grown 36% to 307 different items since cutting down to a low of 225 last year.

"As demand begin to normalize, we began phasing in temporarily suspended" items, Hofmeister said. Bumble Bee has recently launched new lines of tuna snacks and bowls, as well as white Albacore in olive oil and new sardine lines.

Grocery stores also say they are receiving more options from manufacturers to stock their shelves.

SpartanNash SPTN "Manufacturers are starting to dial up again with innovation and product assortments," Lauren DeVol, a spokesperson for, which owns Family Fare, Martin's and other supermarket chains in the Midwest, said in an email.

The company is seeing the most variety expansion in baking, dairy, frozen meals and salty snacks and candy, DeVol said.

"Increased snacking at home is driving the need for innovation as consumers want to try new snacks and treats," she said.

PepsiCo PEP Danone DANOY Other new items that are getting rolled out:recently added Mtn Dew Rise, a caffeinated energy drink the company says is intended for morning consumers, while General Mills has introduced Trix and Cocoa Puff oatmeal cereal and Nature Valley muffins. Bumble Bee launched 3 Quick Catch Tuna Bowls blending tuna, rice, and veggies, and spice-maker McCormick debuted Frank's frozen appetizers and Frank's garlic and mild wing sauces.added Evian+ sparkling water.

All in all, the variety for many staples at the grocery store has expanded.

The average number of salty snacks at stores grew 10.9% during the three months ending July 11 compared to the same period last year, according to the latest data from IRI. The selection of energy drinks increased 11.5%, pre-mixed cocktails jumped 79.2%, and pastry items gained 14.8% during the stretch.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) The Delta variant of Covid-19 is weighing on Southwest Airlines' bottom line.

The carrier said in a regulatory filing Wednesday that customers this month have been booking fewer flights and are increasingly canceling the trips they've already booked. That prompted Southwest to lower its operating revenue estimates for the month to 15% to 20% below what it took in in August 2019. Previous estimates called for a 12% to 17% decline from two years ago.

Southwest LUV said it was profitable in July, but the "recent negative effects" of the pandemic will make turning a profit difficult in the third quarter. The airline expects September revenue will be down 15% to 25% compared to the same month in 2019, but said demand for Labor Day travel "remains healthy, thus far."

Shares of the airline were flat Wednesday.

The warning is a stark turn of events for Southwest, which predicted a few weeks ago that it would be profitable in the third and fourth quarters based of strong booking trends for leisure travel. Southwest's president Tom Nealon said in July that so far "we have not seen any impact from the Delta variant."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Alexi Robichaux is the co-founder and CEO of BetterUp. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

As the CEO of a company that provides leadership coaching, I struggled during the pandemic to find the balance between the positive impact our products and services could make in the world, and managing my — and my employees' — exhaustion. It was clear that it was "go time," but many of us had very little "go" left. Our ability to deliver on all the good we wanted to do in the world was being limited by our own need for well-being.

Today, one of the most common questions I hear from business leaders is: "What can my organization do to help people through this change?" We've all been hit with so much change over the past year and a half that people at all levels have been jolted into rethinking their priorities. We're all asking hard questions about how we spend our time at home and at work. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, there are ways organizations can be more understanding and foster an environment where their people can thrive.

Here's how:

Focus on well-being

We seem to be in a "great awakening" when it comes to mental health, but well-being doesn't just mean "not ill." It means feeling confident, optimistic and able to show up fully in your work and life every day. When we're mentally fit, we have the energy, grace and space to grow and reconnect with everything we love about life.

Suboptimal mental health, even if it doesn't reach the level of clinical mental illness, can still have far-reaching, disruptive effects. Our research shows that 55% of the workforce is languishing, or feeling stuck. However, when employees who are languishing feel supported, their productivity can improve. As leaders, we can buffer the impact of suffering and prevent burnout before it even gets to that point.

Leaders should reframe work to intentionally provide meaning and purpose. When workers feel that their work is highly meaningful, they are less likely to want to leave their jobs.

During the early months of the pandemic, BetterUp donated coaching to health care workers. Supporting those on the frontlines deeply impacted our employees, who were personally experiencing stress, anxiety and change. Our team found a renewed sense of purpose and positivity even with this additional workload, and this helped to transform morale and performance internally.

Walk the talk

One surefire way to disengage employees is if the organization's stated values don't match up with the day-to-day experience of working there. If we as leaders say that we care about managing burnout, fostering inclusivity and investing in people's growth, we need to put policies in place that show those goals are prioritized. A company that says it is focused on productivity shouldn't embrace a culture of meeting-heavy days that don't accommodate for downtime.

For example, at BetterUp we're all about prioritizing personal growth, so we have four paid "Inner Work" days each year when we all step away to spend the day unplugging in nature, taking a class or spending time with loved ones. Additionally, employees get five paid days a year for volunteering. Giving back to others is sometimes the best way to reconnect with ourselves.

Reimagine the role of the middle manager

So much of the conversation has been centered around the hybrid, remote or in-person work model, but the truth is that if you've been building a company in the last 10 years, this has been something we'd all eventually have to face — with or without a pandemic. In a knowledge economy, location doesn't matter as much as having managers who can create a locus of inclusion, culture and performance.

With remote work, managers no longer have the ability to use in-person cues like seeing someone at their desk or seeing them working late at the office to be able to tell if they're working hard. So we have to change the role that middle management plays as they wear multiple hats of leader, project manager, coach and, increasingly, even something akin to a "therapist" to their teams.

Mid-level managers, who typically lead two-thirds of an organization, have a disproportionate influence on the organization's culture. It's crucial to enable middle management to be the catalysts for positive organizational change — whether it's through targeted development programs or through improving lines of communication. We need to equip people managers to be stewards of our values, and empower them to create those boundaries for themselves and their teams.

Avoid the echo-chamber

If we learned anything from this last year, it's that you can't just replicate your company's old policies in a new environment. In-person processes don't map directly onto a fully remote world. The most successful organizations created new practices that took advantage of the possibilities afforded by virtual environments.

Chevron, for example, offered Coaching Circles , which are group coaching experiences led by a BetterUp coach. With Coaching Circles, Chevron was able to support 7,000 employees from around the world with highly relevant topics — like resilience, peak productivity and finding balance — even during the height of the pandemic. (CNN is also a client of BetterUp.)

There obviously won't be one right answer that will please everyone, but by listening to a diversity of perspectives, you can avoid an echo-chamber that will only alienate your workforce. We know that not feeling in control is one of the major causes of burnout. As executives redesign work for a post-pandemic world, one of the most important things they can do is to approach redesigning work in a way that invites their employees to participate, thereby bolstering their sense of agency and control in the work environment.

Ultimately, the pandemic reinforced the importance of talking with people — not talking at them. Honoring the humanity of your people and taking their perspectives to heart can make a workplace where people are empowered and have the agency to co-create the organizational culture. If you speak openly about well-being, listen to your team's needs, and then take concrete action to address what they tell you, you'll be well on your way to not just weathering this pandemic but emerging on the other side better and stronger.

Brides dream of wearing the luxury designer's saris and lehengas, and Bollywood celebrities are frequently spotted in his designs. He created one of Priyanka Chopra Jonas's traditional wedding outfits. And starting this week, consumers will be able to buy Sabyasachi at H&M (HNNMY).

As part of H&M's latest high-low collaboration launching Aug. 12, the collection, called 'Wanderlust,' mixes traditional Indian style with contemporary design. It will make designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee's famed Indian fabrics and prints accessible to wide audiences.

This is H&M's first global Indian designer collaboration. The collection ranges from sequined kaftans for women to printed sets for men, priced up to $299.

Mukherjee had no intention of working with fast fashion. His previous collaborations were with the likes of Christian Louboutin and Bergdorf Goodman.

"A long time ago, I had promised myself that when the time was right, I would make a collaborative (ready-to-wear) line for my consumers, so that I can reach out to the many requests I have gotten over the years to make my creations more affordable," Mukherjee said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Higher prices have been the pandemic recovery 's collateral damage. Even though Washington insists higher inflation may just be temporary, America's prices keep rising — albeit at a slightly slower pace.

The pace of consumer price inflation slowed some in July, but it still remained elevated, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.

While some of the culprits of the past months' inflation spikes, such as used car prices , came back down to earth in July, prices for other items, including food both in grocery stores and at restaurants, went through the roof

This serves as a reminder that the pandemic-era inflation weirdness is still alive and kicking.

The price increases being caused by the reopening of the economy and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks will keep economists and investors, not to mention the Federal Reserve , on their toes.

Price stability is one of the central bank's core mandates, and the pandemic-era inflation jump could force the Fed to rein in its easy money policy sooner rather than later.

Higher food prices, lower used car prices

Core consumer prices, which strip out more volatile components like food and energy, rose 4.3% over the 12 months ended in July, slightly below June's rise. Overall, prices rose 5.4% over the period, flat compared with June when the index hit a 13-year high

In July alone, adjusted for seasonal swings, prices rose 0.5% on the whole and 0.3% without food and energy items, representing a slowdown on both fronts. Overall, it was the slowest pace of increases since February, while the core index advanced at the slowest pace since March. Cost increases for shelter, food, energy and new cars were the major contributors to the index's jump.

The more modest price uptick in July "indicates that the transitory burst of rising prices linked to reopening is fading and that ... core inflation may now have peaked," wrote Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics.

A major driver of the July moderation was the price index for used cars, which was nearly unchanged from the prior month.

This came as a surprise, given that used vehicle prices have soared in the past year as consumers were willing to pay a premium for mobility and new cars were in short supply amid a chip shortage. Over the past 12 months, the used car index is still up nearly 42%, a gain matched only by prices for gasoline.

In other transportation news, the price index for airline fares also fell after rising sharply in past months as the reopening accelerated.

Meanwhile, the cost of dining out jumped 0.8%, registering its largest monthly gain since February 1981, according to the BLS.

Chipotle CMG Shake Shack SHAK Restaurants are raising prices to contend with higher costs of food as well as higher wages to retain employees amid a worker shortage. In June,announced it would raise its menu prices by 3.5% to 4%. Andannounced last week that it will raise menu prices later this year to cope with higher meat, chicken and labor costs.

Eating at home also got costlier: the price index for food consumed at home rose 0.7% — ever so slightly slower than in June but faster than earlier in the year — as the cost of meat, poultry, fish and eggs jumped.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@London (CNN Business) The European Union has announced plans to end the sale of polluting vehicles by 2035, an ambitious goal that would put hybrid cars on the endangered species list and usher in a rapid and dramatic shift to fully electric models.

The European Commission said Wednesday that it wants to require the auto industry to slash the average emissions of new cars by 55% by 2030. A further reduction to 100% by 2035 effectively means that all new cars registered from that year onward must be zero-emission vehicles.

The new 2030 goal would be a significant leap from the current EU target of cutting emissions from new cars by 37.5%, which was only set in December 2018.

The proposed rule changes are part of a much larger package aimed at propelling the European Union towards its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Europe wants to be the first continent to be climate neutral in 2050.

"The fossil fuel economy has reached its limits. We want to leave the next generation a healthy planet as well as good jobs and growth that does not hurt our nature," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) A senior ExxonMobil lobbyist appears to have unwittingly revealed how the oil company uses its political muscle to undercut climate action.

"Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes," Keith McCoy, thelobbyist, said during a covertly filmed job interview recorded by Greenpeace's UK investigative platform.

"Did we join some shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that's true," McCoy said in the video, which was published Wednesday by the UK's Channel 4. "But there's nothing illegal about that. We were looking out for our investments. we were looking out for our shareholders."

The footage seems to corroborate what many suspected all along: Exxon's public support for climate solutions at times conflicts with its work behind the scenes.

For example, Exxon says it's in favor of a tax on carbon even though its lobbyist doubts it will ever get enacted.

"Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans. The cynical side of me says we kind of know that. But it gives us a talking point," McCoy said in the video. "We can say, 'What is ExxonMobil for? We're for a carbon tax.'"

The Exxon lobbyist added that a carbon tax "isn't going to happen" because it would take political courage. "That doesn't exist in politics. It just doesn't," he said.

Exxon condemns statements in video

The report from Channel 4 did not allege Exxon or its lobbyists did anything illegal. After all, plenty of major corporations use campaign donations to shape the laws in their favor.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods responded to the footage by saying the comments "in no way represent the company's position" on climate policy and its commitment to carbon pricing.

"We condemn the statements and are deeply apologetic for them, including comments regarding interactions with elected officials," Woods said in a statement. "They are entirely inconsistent with the way we expect our people to conduct themselves. We were shocked by these interviews and stand by our commitments to working on finding solutions to climate change."

Woods, who became CEO in 2017 after Rex Tillerson stepped down from the helm of Exxon to become President Donald Trump's secretary of state, also said the individuals in the footage "were never involved" in developing the company's positions on the issues discussed.

'He is the kingmaker'

Yet during the video McCoy suggested he's very much involved in Exxon's efforts to influence key lawmakers. The Exxon lobbyist compared the influence campaign to fishing, where the company tries to "kind of reel them in."

"Because they're a captive audience. They know they need you and I need them," McCoy said.

McCoy identified 11 US senators he says are "crucial" to Exxon, singling out Senator Joe Manchin, the moderate Democrat from West Virginia, as particularly important.

"I talk to his office every week. He is the kingmaker," McCoy said, adding that the Democrat is "not shy" about staking his claim early and changing the debate.

Manchin's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Exxon lobbyist is 'deeply embarrassed'

In a LinkedIn post, McCoy apologized to his colleagues at Exxon and friends in Washington.

"I am deeply embarrassed by my comments and that I allowed myself to fall for Greenpeace's deception," McCoy said. "My statements clearly do not represent ExxonMobil's positions on important public policy issues. While some of my comments were taken out of context, there is no excuse for what I said or how I said it."

Asked if McCoy is still employed by Exxon, an Exxon spokesperson declined to comment, adding: "It is a private personnel matter."

Climate activists used the undercover footage to pressure Congress and the White House to move swiftly to address the climate crisis by enacting a bolder infrastructure package than the bipartisan agreement reached last week.

"Companies like Exxon spent decades sowing doubt about the science of climate change. Now it seems their lobbyists worked to deter climate solutions from being included in a potentially planet-saving infrastructure package," Janet Redman, climate campaign director Janet Redman at Greenpeace USA, said in a statement on Thursday.

Another setback for Exxon

Lindsay Meiman, US communications manager at climate group 350.org, said in a statement that the Exxon footage shows how "Exxon's climate lies have spanned from outright denial to puppeteering our government and economy."

The tapes are the latest blow to Exxon as pressure mounts on Washington and Wall Street to address the climate crisis.

London (CNN Business) America's soaring price hikes moderated last month, signaling that inflation may have peaked . But investors should pay heed to another trend: the spread of higher prices across more sectors of the economy .

What's happening: Consumer price inflation remained elevated in July , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Prices rose 5.4% from a year earlier, flat compared with June when the index hit a 13-year high.

On a monthly basis, however, prices rose 0.5% in July, a major slowdown from 0.9% growth in June and the weakest pace since February.

But drill down into the data. While some of the major drivers of previous spikes, such as used car prices , eased last month, the cost of other goods, including medical care, housing and food in grocery stores and at restaurants, climbed.

"The annual rate of inflation has seemingly peaked, but the details show a broadening out of price pressures," chief international economist at ING, James Knightley wrote in a note to clients. "This indicates inflation is likely to be more persistent and pervasive than predicted by the Federal Reserve."

S&P 500 SPX Dow DJX For now, investors remain sanguine. Theandnotched fresh all-time highs on Wednesday and yields on 10-year US Treasuries fell as traders bet the inflation data will take pressure off the Fed to hike interest rates and rein in asset purchases sooner than expected.

Economics 101: The latest inflation reading doesn't change the fact that America's "stimulus fuelled economy is booming," according to Knightley. "Demand is outpacing the supply capacity of the economy given the scarring that the pandemic has caused as evidenced in production bottlenecks and labour shortages," he said.

Competition for workers is placing upward pressure on wages, while record low levels of raw materials supply, order backlogs and extended delivery times are adding further stress to supply chains.

"Costs are increasing throughout the economy and the strength of demand means that companies have a sense of more pricing power [than] they have experienced in years," Knightley added.

See here: Data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses shows that the proportion of companies raising prices and expecting to raise them further in coming months is at a 40-year high. "As such, imminent major declines in inflation look unlikely," Knightley concluded.

Even the White House is worried about rising prices. On Wednesday, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called on OPEC+ to increase oil production in order to curb high gasoline costs.

"President Biden has made clear that he wants Americans to have access to affordable and reliable energy, including at the pump," Sullivan said in a statement, adding that the US government is "engaging with relevant OPEC+ members on the importance of competitive markets in setting prices."

Up Next: With a growing number of senior Fed officials making the case for pulling back bond purchases, all eyes will be on the Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming later this month.

Airlines are not out the woods yet

Air travel has picked up in the United States and Europe following the rollout of vaccines, but risks remain elevated for battered airlines desperately trying to recover from the pandemic.

Southwest Airlines LUV The latest:warned Wednesday that the Delta variant of Covid-19 will make it difficult to turn a profit in the third quarter. In a regulatory filing, the carrier said customers have been booking fewer flights in August and cancelling trips they had already booked.

The development marks a stark turn of events for Southwest, my CNN Business colleague Jordan Valinsky reports. The company predicted just a few weeks ago that it would be profitable in the third and fourth quarters based on strong bookings for leisure travel.

But things can change quickly in the pandemic economy. At the beginning of July, domestic air travel, measured by tickets issued by US travel agencies and online booking companies, stood at just 3% below 2019 levels. A few weeks later on July 23, it was more than a fifth below the same point in 2019, according to the CNN Business Economic Recovery Dashboard

Delta blues: In the latest sign of how the Delta variant is weighing on the recovery, the International Energy Agency on Thursday downgraded its outlook for oil demand for the remainder of the year, in part due to the "worsening progression of the pandemic."

After surging in June to a level almost three times the seasonal norm thanks to increased mobility in North America and Europe, global oil demand "abruptly reversed course" in July, the Paris-based body said in a report.

Art auction will test appetite for alternatives

Investors hunting for more creative places to park their cash than the stock market will soon have an opportunity to deploy some serious dough.

Auction alert: Eleven Pablo Picasso artworks with a combined top estimate of over $100 million are hitting the auction block this October, my CNN colleague Jacqui Palumbo reports

Part of MGM Resorts' sizable art collection, the pieces have been on display in Las Vegas for over two decades at a Michelin-starred French and Spanish eatery called Picasso in the Bellagio.

Sotheby's is organizing the sale, which forms part of MGM's attempts to reposition the gambling mecca as a "broader art destination," according to Brooke Lampley, the auction house's chairperson.

Investor insight: Wealthy individuals who've saved vast sums of money during the pandemic have been stashing their cash in some unusual investments, such as high-end spirits and trading cards. The Picasso auction will provide yet more insight into investor appetite for alternative assets.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Just one day after America thought it was getting some relief on inflation, a new report showed we're not out of the woods just yet.

Producer price inflation, which measures the prices US producers receive for their goods and services, rose 7.8% over the 12 months ended in July. That was more than economists had expected and marked a new record high since the Bureau of Labor Statistics first began calculating the index in November 2010.

The two apparently contradictory data points are "a mix that will keep inflation concerns alive even as economists will continue to expect a slowing in monthly price gains into year-end," economists from Action Economics wrote in a research note to clients.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) The United States Postal Service really wants to get your holiday packages delivered on time. So it wants to start charging more.

The postal service is requesting a temporary price increase on a variety of mail services for the peak holiday season to offset rising delivery costs. The price increases, which range from 25 cents to $5 per package, would go into effect on October 3, 2021 and last through December 26, 2021 for individuals and businesses on mailings including Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express and First-Class Package Service, according to a USPS statement

The Postal Regulatory Commission still has to approve the higher rates.

In 2020, USPS implemented a similar temporary rate adjustment during peak holiday season in anticipation of heightened demand and extra shipping costs. However, the postal service still struggled to keep up with holiday demand last year thanks to a historic amount of packages and rising employee Covid-19 cases.

In December 2020, packages were "up to the ceiling" in Philadelphia, local American Postal Workers Union president Nick Casselli told CNN.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.

The US presence in Afghanistan, often lamented as the "forgotten war," is front of mind right now. The lead story on the NYTimes.com home page is "Afghanistan collapse accelerates as 2 vital cities near fall to Taliban." CNN's live updates page is titled "US to send troops to help evacuate personnel in Afghanistan." And the troop deployment was the lead across all the network nightly newscasts on Thursday evening. ABC's David Muir: "The State Department saying today this is not an evacuation, but at this hour, that's exactly what this looks like."

On the ground

A small number of correspondents for Western news outlets are in Afghanistan and are giving voice to the citizens there. For example, CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward filed a report from Kandahar last weekend. Flash forward a few days, and she says "the wedding hall we visited... is now under Taliban control."

Ward reported from Kabul on Thursday and described pleas for help from Afghans who worked with the US coalition and now fear Taliban retaliation. "I'm getting messages every hour now" from concerned individuals, she said, with one man even threatening to stand in front of the US Embassy and set himself on fire if he doesn't hear back about his paperwork soon. "There's absolutely a sense of palpable fear and near-panic in the capital right now," Ward said.

The CBS and NBC nightly newscasts also carried live reports from Kabul. "The mood here is grim," Roxana Saberi said on CBS. On NBC, Kelly Cobiella interviewed a former interpreter for the US military who fears for his family. "Thank you and stay safe," Lester Holt told Cobiella.

Dreaded images

Megan Stack, a contributor to The New Yorker, is my guest on this week's "Reliable" podcast . As we recorded the episode on Thursday, new headlines kept crossing the wire about the Taliban taking control of Herat, the country's third largest city.

In the episode, we discussed Stack's recent article about the Pentagon's "de-facto press blackout" during the Afghan withdrawal this summer. Stack also analyzed the Taliban's advances and the fear of a "Fall of Saigon" moment. "It is possible that we will end up seeing people, in fact, getting evacuated by helicopter off the roof of the embassy, which is exactly the image that came out at the end of Vietnam and which has haunted the US through this whole withdrawal process," she said.

>> Pentagon officials "know that any photograph that looks sort of unvictorious, that looks like 'giving up' and kind of quitting — which, of course, is in fact what the US is doing — it's also something that might be useful to some foreign adversaries," she added. "It's useful for Taliban propaganda..."

>> Stack also reflected on two decades of Afghan war coverage: "I found it very difficult to reconcile how little the US public does seem to understand or engage with the extent of what's happened and what our government has done. I find that very jarring, especially because I gave so many years of my life and I have friends who died covering those stories, and it's sort of frustrating. I feel like people have done great coverage over the years and it just hasn't quite penetrated."

Then versus now

This is the beginning of Jeanne Bourgault and Ahmed Rashid's guest essay for The New York Times: "Twenty years ago, Afghanistan was an information desert. Under the Taliban, there were no independent media outlets. There were no female journalists. There was no public debate. The voices of ordinary people were silenced and sidelined. Taliban edicts served as 'news.'" But "over the next two decades, that completely changed," they wrote . "Today, vibrant networks of radio, television and online media reach all 34 provinces." They described how the international community "can help Afghans preserve their media."

Along those same lines, Committee to Protect Journalists exec director Joel Simon penned a Washington Post op-ed urging the US to intervene to save the lives of Afghan journalists. Otherwise, he wrote, "an entire generation of reporters will be lost." It already seems to be happening...

Prayers and fears for Afghan journalists

Due to the Taliban's advances, "over 90 media outlets have closed down and concern for the safety of the country's journalists has increased levels," VOA reported on Wednesday.

An anonymous female journalist in northern Afghanistan penned this chilling piece for The Guardian after the Taliban took control of her city: "Last week I was a news journalist. Today I can't write under my own name or say where I am from or where I am. My whole life has been obliterated in just a few days."

"All my female colleagues in the media are terrified," the anonymous journalist wrote. She said "all I can do is keep running and hope that a route out of the province opens up soon. Please pray for me."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Baseball celebrates the myth of its rural roots tonight when the New York Yankees meet the Chicago White Sox in a game adjacent to the field in rural Dyersville, Iowa , population 4,000, where the iconic 1989 movie "Field of Dreams" was filmed.

Fans are paying record amounts to attend the game, with most who bought tickets on the secondary market spending more than $1,400 to attend.

The prices are by far the highest average price ever for a regular season game, and have only been topped by a handful of World Series games, such as Game 4 of the 2016 World Series between two championship-starved teams as theCleveland Indians met the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field in Chicago. The average ticket price on the resale market that night was a record $3,500 on StubHub and $4,200 according to its rival SeatGeek.

StubHub says the average for Thursday's game on its site is $1,400, while SeatGeek says the average price of tickets sold on its site is $1,557.

Tickets have a face value of either $375 or $425, and were sold to fans in Iowa and White Sox season ticket holders who won lotteries for the right to buy about 8,000 seats at the temporary stadium in Dyersville, Iowa.

"There are several factors, including the tight supply of tickets available on the resale market," said Chris Layden, spokesperson for SeatGeek. "And every seat is about the same. There's no nosebleed seats. Sometimes you'll see the average price be really high but you can still pay a third of that and get in the door for a cheap seat. But that's not the case this time."

The game was originally planned to be played last year but was canceled because of the shortened, fanless baseball season.

The two teams involved are also adding to demand. The White Sox, whose home is a four-hour drive away from Dyersville, are in first place at this time of the season for the first time since 2012. And their opponent Yankees are one of the best-drawing road teams in baseball year-in and year-out.

"This has a whole life of it's own," said Adam Budelli, head of partnerships and business development at StubHub. "Adding in the fact that it's two marque teams, it's a perfect storm for this event."

Other baseball ticket prices are up too

But it's not just this game drawing higher prices and higher demand for tickets. Attendance comparisons to 2019 are difficult because, for much of the season, there have been restrictions on how many seats most stadiums could sell because of Covid.

An aerial photo taken with a drone shows the baseball field at the Field of Dreams movie site in Dyersville, Iowa.

But, as is the case with so many items seeing large price increases this year, limited supply and pent-up demand translated into higher resale prices

SeatGeek says the average price of baseball tickets sold on its site this year has been $81, up 40% from the $58 average in 2019, the last time fans were allowed to attend regular season games. StubHub's figures show a 33% increase for baseball tickets.

Fans are hungry for live events in all the sports, as well as for attending concerts and other events said Budelli.

"People want to get out there, whether it's baseball, concerts, or other live events, they're ready to go back with friends and family," he said.

The movie's celebration of baseball

The site of the movie has attracted a regular but modest stream of fans since the film came out. Attendance is normally free, as fans can play catch or sit in the small wooden bleachers on the original field. Thursday's game is being played on a different field nearby. Given its remote location, the field often has only a handful of fans visiting at any one time, except when buses arrive.

The sky-high prices are a stunning contrast to the prices discussed in the movie.

The film, based on W. P. Kinsella's 1982 novel "Shoeless Joe," is a mythical tale of a farmer, Ray Kinsella, played by Kevin Costner, who builds a baseball field on his farm. A voice he alone hears tells him "If you build it, he will come." He decides the voice is referring to the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson, a White Sox great from a century ago who was banned for life from the game when his teammates threw the 1919 World Series. And once he builds the field the ghost of Jackson and other players do arrive to play baseball on the field.

When Costner's character is at risk of losing the farm because of the lost crops he's not growing, his friend and daughter convince him that fans will pay to visit and gain peace from communing with baseball.

"People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll arrive at your door as innocent as children, longing for the past," predicts his friend played by James Earl Jones. "Of course, we won't mind if you look around, you'll say. It's only $20 per person. They'll pass over the money without even thinking about it: for it is money they have and peace they lack."

"They'll pass over the money without even thinking about it. For it is money they have and peace they lack." James Earl Jones' character in Field of Dreams

Jones' character's speech that follows is well known to many baseball fans as he explains their love of the game.

"The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball," he said. "America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game: it's a part of our past, Ray. It reminds of us of all that once was good and it could be again."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Administrators and career service leaders at some of the nation's top historically Black colleges and universities, also known as HBCUs , say recruitment of their students and graduates by major corporations has dramatically increased since the police murder of George Floyd more than a year ago.

Public outrage spread globally after the widely viewed video of Floyd's death at the hands of former officers in Minneapolis circulated in May 2020. That motivated many Fortune 500 companies to do more to improve racial equity in the United States, including bolstering the ranks of Black Americans working in Corporate America.

Since then, HBCU leaders say they've been flooded with millions of dollars in donations from major companies as well as billionaire philanthropists like MacKenzie Scott Michael Bloomberg and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

The schools' leaders caution that it's too early to say with certainty how many more Black college graduates are actually getting hired by major companies, but so far they've seen a substantial rise in the number of internships and job interviews provided by major brands.

"In my 24-year career in higher education, all in career services, I cannot recall a time when recruitment efforts at HBCUs have been this high and have stayed this high," said Seana Coulter, director of the center for career development at Morgan State University, an HBCU in Baltimore.

Apple AAPL Bank of America BAC She says MSU's online job portal for students saw a 263% increase in employer logins between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, with major companies likeand Estee Lauder reaching out for the first time ever.

"We had a 73% increase in the numbers of events hosted by employers over the same period of time," Coulter said. "We saw a surge in organizations wishing to recruit from Morgan's campus all stating they were diversifying their workforce. The surge has not stopped. It's just been a constant flow ever since it's started. I would say it's been record numbers."

Coulter also began serving as co-chair of the National Association of Colleges & Employers' HBCU affinity group in January of 2020 before stepping down in July. She says most of the group's estimated 130 members, who serve as administrators and career service staffers at a wide swath of the nation's 107 HBCUs, have seen a sharp rise in corporate engagement and outreach over the last year.

"All of us were talking about how we could best handle the volume," Coulter said. "One of the biggest conversations has been how can we connect them better with the academic departments."

A building on Howard University's campus is pictured in this August 7, 2020 photo.

At Howard University, career outreach from major corporations has increased "100%" over the last year, according Debbi Jarvis, the school's senior vice president of corporate relations.

"It's doubled," Jarvis told CNN Business earlier this month. "They actually want to engage with students, even virtually, to increase their pipeline and be deliberate about it."

The median full-time starting salary for Howard grads is now about $72,680 , according to the school's latest exit survey for graduating students.

JPMorgan Chase JPM Procter & Gamble PG Accenture ACN Microsoft MSFT Facebook FB Google GOOG Howard says, Deloitte,, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Co. rank among the top 25 companies that recruit at the university. That list also includes, Apple and, which has a tech partnership with the school.

The added corporate engagement for Howard has helped it recruit more high school graduates and increase enrollment, according to Howard University provost Anthony Wutoh.

"In my 25-year experience with Howard University, this is the most significant interest that I've seen corporations demonstrate in Howard students," Wutoh told CNN Business on Monday. "Our efforts to build partnerships and programs that benefit Howard students have led us to this unprecedented time in history where even more corporations are realizing the value of a Howard education."

Prairie View A&M University, an HBCU in the Houston metro area, saw a 56% rise in the number of companies participating in its spring virtual career fair. The number of companies participating in the school's fall semester career fair jumped from 122 in 2019 to 233 in 2020, according to Munir Quddus, professor of economics and dean of the college of business at the school.

Charles Schwab SCHW TD Ameritrade AMTD IBM IBM Quddus estimates that corporate outreach has increased 20% to 25% over the last year from companies likeand.The school also has received a major rise in contributions from companies like Chevron and Halliburton.

"We've definitely seen an uptick," Quddus told CNN Business. "Companies are not just interested in hiring more students, but also in building partnerships and providing internships."

Graduates from less-prominent HBCUs are also being interviewed more, according to Nicole Tinson, CEO of HBCU 20x20, a nonprofit that connects black college grads with top companies.

Tinson says her organization has been more helpful for graduates from less-famous HBCUs, like her Dillard University alma mater in New Orleans.

The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill — which still needs to be passed by the House — has more than $100 billion dedicated to addressing climate change , from sweeping programs that address extreme weather to electric school buses.

Part of this is $25 billion in funding to the DOE for demonstration projects via public-private partnerships, which will include Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. The Wall Street Journal first reported the donations.

Breakthrough Energy's Catalyst program hopes to accumulate up to $15 billion to fund "climate smart technologies" through public and private financing across different industries. Gates has frequently stated the ultimate goal is to reach a net-zero carbon emission economy by 2050.

The DOE-sponsored projects that Catalyst will help to fast track include sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen, which could provide power without fossil fuels. Other projects direct air capture, which would capture carbon dioxide straight from the atmosphere, and long-duration energy storage.

California-based Perfect Day uses fungi to make dairy protein that is "molecularly identical" to the protein in cow's milk, says co-founder Ryan Pandya. That means it can be used to make dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.

"We were interested in the question of what is in milk ... that gives it incredible versatility and nutrition that is somehow missing from the plant-based milks," says Pandya.

Perfect Day has assembled the gene that codes for whey protein in cow's milk, and introduced it into a fungus. When the fungus is grown in fermentation tanks, it produces whey protein, which is then filtered and dried into a powder used in products including cheese and ice cream — which are already on the shelves in the United States and Hong Kong.

"[It's for] people who still love dairy, but want to feel better about it for themselves, for the planet, and for the animal," says Pandya.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Taipei, Taiwan (CNN Business) As China steps up military pressure on Taiwan, the self-governing island is preparing for the next big frontier of warfare: crippling cyberattacks.

Taiwan's head of cybersecurity told CNN Business this month that it is using dramatic measures to guard against technological vulnerabilities — including employing roughly two dozen computer experts to deliberately attack the government's systems and help it defend against what Taiwanese authorities estimate are some 20 million to 40 million cyberattacks every month.

Taiwan says it has been able to defend against the overwhelming majority of attacks. Successful breaches number in the hundreds, while only a handful are what the government classifies as "serious."

But the enormous number — and where Taiwan thinks they're coming from — has compelled the government to take the issue seriously, according to Chien Hung-wei, head of Taiwan's Department of Cyber Security.

"Based on the attackers' actions and methodology, we have a rather high degree of confidence that many attacks originated from our neighbor," he told CNN Business, referring to mainland China.

"The operation of our government highly relies on the internet," Chien said. "Our critical infrastructure, such as gas, water and electricity are highly digitized, so we can easily fall victim if our network security is not robust enough."

Cyberattacks are a growing global threat . And while China is far from the only country to be accused of orchestrating such attacks, Beijing this week is facing intense scrutiny from the West on the issue.

On Monday, the United States, the European Union and other allies accused China's Ministry of State Security of using " criminal contract hackers " to carry out malicious activities around the world, including a campaign against Microsoft's Exchange email service in March.

The coordinated announcement has illustrated the Biden administration's priorities in defending cybersecurity, after serious vulnerabilities had been reported in major American sectors, such as energy and food production.

Chien said Taiwan suspects that state-backed hackers were behind at least one major malware attack on the island last year. In May 2020, CPC Corporation — a government-owned refiner in Taiwan — was hacked and left unable to process electronic payments from customers. The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau accused a hacker group linked to China of carrying out the attack.

China has repeatedly denied launching cyberattacks against Taiwan and others. In a statement to CNN Business, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the island's accusations "groundless and purely malicious." China's Taiwan Affairs Office also criticized Taiwanese authorities for using cyberattacks to smear the mainland as a "habitual trick," and to shift the public's focus away from the island's recent Covid-19 outbreak.

And after China was accused by the West earlier this week of launching a massive, global hacking campaign, the country blasted the claims as "groundless."

"We strongly urge the United States and its allies to stop pouring dirty water on China on cybersecurity issues," Zhao Lijian, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, said on Tuesday. "China firmly opposes and cracks down on cyberattacks of any kind, let alone encourages, supports or indulges them."

Tensions with China

Taiwan and mainland China have been governed separately since the end of the Chinese Civil War more than 70 years ago. While the Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan, Beijing considers the island to be an "inseparable part" of its territory and has repeatedly threatened to use force if necessary to prevent the island from formally declaring independence.

In recent years, China has stepped up its military pressure on Taiwan. In June, the country sent over two dozen warplanes near the island, prompting Taiwan to alert its air defenses. That was the largest number of warplanes sent to that zone since Taiwan began keeping records of such incursions last year. Beijing has also released military propaganda warning Taipei to " prepare for war " as it establishes stronger ties with the United States. (Analysts say the flights likely serve several purposes for China, including as a demonstration of the strength of the country's military and as a way to gain intelligence it needs for any potential conflict involving Taiwan.)

Experts have voiced concerns not just about the prospect of military warfare, but cyber warfare, too.

Earlier this month, US-based cybersecurity company Recorded Future alleged that a Chinese state-sponsored group has been targeting the Industrial Technology Research Institute, a Taiwanese hi-tech research institution.

Recorded Future said it found that Chinese groups have been targeting organizations across Taiwan's semiconductor industry to obtain source codes, software development kits and chip designs. It based its claims on evidence it compiled using a method called network traffic analysis, which examines such traffic to detect security threats.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to questions about that analysis, but accused Taiwanese authorities of inciting anti-China hatred and increasing cross-strait conflicts.

Preparing for risks

In April, the US Department of Justice declared 2020 the " worst year ever " for extortion-related cyberattacks. And the first half of 2021 saw a 102% increase in ransomware attacks compared to the same time period last year, according to cybersecurity firm Check Point Software.

Allen Own, CEO of Taiwanese cybersecurity company Devcore, said hackers can often be categorized into two groups: those who are working for profit, and those who are stealing information of national importance.

He said many countries — including the United States, China, Russia and North Korea — have assembled formidable "cyber armies" to either obtain intelligence or infiltrate another country's infrastructure, or defend against attackers that might do the same to them. That kind of power highlights the need for Taiwan to boost its own capabilities.

"In information security, many people say that World War III will happen over the internet," he said.

Taiwan says, meanwhile, that it has been attuned to these types of risks for years.

In 2016, the Executive Yuan — Taiwan's highest administrative organ — set up the Department of Cyber Security to mitigate security risks.

President Tsai Ing-wen at the time declared cybersecurity a matter of national security. This May, she announced the creation of a new digital development ministry, which will supervise the information and communication sector with a focus of protecting critical infrastructure, according to Taiwan's official Central News Agency

In an exclusive interview with CNN last month, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu accused China of using military intimidation , disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks to undermine the Taiwanese population's trust in their own government.

"They want to shape Taiwanese people's cognition that Taiwan is very dangerous, and Taiwan cannot do without China," he said. "[But] Taiwan has some very good capability in dealing with cyberattacks. And that is because of our long experience dealing with the cyber activities initiated by the Chinese side."

Chien, the Taiwanese cybersecurity department leader, said the self-governing island has been subject to tens of millions of attacks monthly, a trend the government has recorded for at least the last few years

But he said Taiwan has been able to defend against most attempts and serious breaches resulting in stolen data or paralyzed services numbered about 10 over the last year.

Chien declined to go into specific details about those attacks, and was willing only to cite successful hacks of Taiwan's education system, which resulted in student data being stolen.

Tsai Sung-ting, CEO of Taiwanese cybersecurity solution provider Team T5.

Even if a cyber intrusion is resolved, such attacks can have long-term consequences because of the kind of information that attackers can gain access to, according to Tsai Sung-ting, CEO of Team T5, a Taiwanese cybersecurity solution provider.

"We frequently observe that after they compromise an organization, the first thing is to steal the emails and documents," he said. "So even after you clean the infection this time, they may come back next month or a few months later. So I will say the threat is persistent."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN Business) The most critical moment in a ransomware negotiation usually comes long before the victim and the hackers discuss a price.

By the time the two sides start talking, the hackers have already gained significant control of a company's network, most likely securing access to sensitive account data, business contracts, and other key details of an organization. The more they steal, the greater the leverage they have.

The only way for the victim to regain some ground, cybersecurity experts say, is to come armed with information about how much the hackers have really stolen and knowledge of the attackers' past negotiating tactics.

That's where professional ransomware negotiators Tony Cook and Drew Schmitt come in. Together, working for the cybersecurity firm GuidePoint Security, the two have negotiated dozens of ransomware payments on behalf of organizations held hostage by cybercriminals. Based on that experience, they've developed sophisticated profiles of many of the cybercriminal groups they've dealt with to help gain an edge at the bargaining table.

Some threat actors, such as the Ryuk ransomware gang that's known for issuing astronomical payment demands , struck so often at one point that Cook said he started to suspect he was dealing with the same person on multiple occasions.

"If you know how they typically operate, that helps tip the scales in your favor a little more," said Schmitt. "There is a fair amount of strategy that happens before you get to the negotiation table."

The FBI and cybersecurity experts strongly discourage paying off ransomware attackers, mostly because it encourages further attacks. "They know that you already made the decision to pay," said Lior Div, founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Cyber Reason, "and now it's, like, to make another decision to pay is easy."

But a string of high-profile attacks this year has led to some eye-popping payments. When Colonial Pipeline was hit , prompting a precautionary shutdown of operations that caused fuel shortages nationwide, it agreed to pay the cybercriminal gang DarkSide $4.4 million in cryptocurrency. Meat supplier JBS Foods paid $11 million to resolve a ransomware attack by the group REvil. And the same ransomware gang demanded $70 million to unlock all the devices it claimed had been hit in an attack on Kaseya, an IT services provider that indirectly supports countless small businesses such as local restaurants, accounting firms and dentists' offices.

In 2020, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, ransom payments, typically made in cryptocurrency, totaled the equivalent of $416 million, more than four times the 2019 level. And the firm has confirmed more than $200 million worth of payments so far this year.

The virtual negotiation table

A ransomware negotiation rarely results in a ransom demand completely going away. But a successful encounter can mean the difference between paying hundreds of thousands of dollars and paying millions, Cook and Schmitt said.

"Sometimes you can only go down just $10,000," said Cook. "It really depends on what the actor perceives that they have and the negotiation tactics to get things done."

As soon as a victim decides to pay a ransom and reaches out to its attacker, it starts a clock that often leads to the release of an organization's hacked materials if the two sides can't quickly come to a deal, they said.

Negotiations happen fast. Many ransomware groups communicate with their victims using online chat tools and instant messaging. The tools are made to be easy to use, because, after all, the criminals are running a business, too. They have an incentive to make the negotiation and payment process as quick and easy as possible, to maximize profits.

Because so many cybercriminal groups operate from foreign countries, chatroom negotiations make heavy use of Google Translate, Schmitt said. Terse, one-word or one-sentence messages from the hackers in broken English are the norm. Despite the language barrier, many bargaining encounters are wrapped up within 10 to 15 exchanges.

That's why it's so critical for hacked companies to quickly investigate their own systems before they finalize a ransom payment. Victims need to be able to credibly claim, "Whatever you think you have, it's not worth that much money," Cook said. And victims can't say that unless they have a good grasp of what they've lost control over.

That argument can still backfire if the hackers know they've obtained truly sensitive data — like trade secrets or financials — that a company can't afford to have released publicly. In some cases, ransomware attackers realized companies were refusing to pay because they could just restore data from backups, according to Div of Cyber Reason. So before encrypting the data, attackers look for sensitive information -- "your customer list, intellectual property, nasty emails, whatever might embarrass you," he said -- and then threaten to publish it if the victim refuses to pay.

If that's not enough, Div said attackers can contact a company's customers to ratchet up the pressure on them to pay.

The 'double-edged sword' of cyber insurance policies

As ransomware attacks have increased, so has demand for cybersecurity insurance.

Cybersecurity insurance is now a multibillion-dollar industry, according to Morgan Wright, chief security advisor at the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne. Cyber insurance is increasingly sophisticated, giving companies a one-stop shop for hacking response. Insurance companies contract with massive teams of lawyers, technical and forensic experts and, yes, negotiators to help victims manage and recover from a ransomware attack.

"The minute you file a claim — just like a consumer, if you file a claim with Geico — it's out of your hands at that point," Wright said.

The frequency of ransomware claims has increased by 150% since 2018, according to AIG, one of the nation's largest insurance companies and a leading provider of cyber insurance. And ransom claims accounted for one in five cybersecurity insurance claims last year, according to an AIG fact sheet.

What a company may pay for cyber insurance depends partly on how many times an organization has been hit in the past, along with other actuarial data, Wright said.

"If I have poor cyber hygiene, my rates are going to be much, much higher than a company that has good policies," he said.

But cyber insurance can also be a double-edged sword, according to Karen Sprenger, COO and chief ransomware negotiator at LMG Security. "We're starting to see where the attackers go through the data and look for cyber insurance policies to see what the deductible is and to understand how much coverage they have." Sprenger said she has seen cases where attackers then used that information to push for higher ransoms.

The best remedy, of course, is not being in the situation to begin with. Preventing ransomware attacks is relatively straightforward, cybersecurity experts say. Ensure your software is up to date, require that your employees use multi-factor authentication, use firewalls and monitor your network to catch unauthorized internet traffic, and establish cybersecurity incident protocols.

But too many organizations still lack the skills to implement even these basic precautions, said Ed Amoroso, CEO of cybersecurity firm TAG Cyber.

"This skills shortage pervades everything," he said. "It's in every sector. There's not enough people that know how to do this."

And that's why negotiators like Cook and Schmitt keep fielding calls for help. Between the two of them, they've now dealt with 75 cases — and counting.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@That's typically how we think of addressing a crime. But as some ransomware victims may now be discovering, that process is much more complicated when the criminal is on another continent and the crime takes place virtually.

And it's not just REvil. Hackers with links to Russia are believed to have been behind the high-profile SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline attacks. Moreover, recent ransomware attacks onand VPN firm PulseSecure have been linked to hackers in China.

Ransomware gangs have extracted payments worth millions of dollars in recent months and REvil is now demanding $70 million for a decryptor tool following its attack on Kaseya. US authorities generally discourage companies from paying ransoms, on the grounds that doing so only emboldens cyber criminals.

Bringing them to justice, however, is a more complex process involving a web of local, federal and even international authorities. The process can take years, with no guarantee of a successful outcome. And during that time, the number of ransomware attacks only continues to grow.

Tracking them down

Prominent hacker groups such as REvil are often quick to take public credit for their attacks, but tracing the actual individuals behind those groups and their whereabouts can be incredibly difficult.

Cybersecurity experts recommend that impacted organizations contact local law enforcement and the FBI. Other federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team often get involved early in the process , too.

In April, the US Department of Justice launched a ransomware task force after what an agency memo described as the worst year ever for those types of cyberattacks. The goal is to unify efforts across the federal government to pursue and disrupt ransomware attackers.

"The hackers' groups are part of organized criminal rings and often operate remotely and in a decentralized fashion," Beenu Arora, cofounder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Cyble, told CNN Business. "These actors often deploy intermediaries to communicate with each other," he added.

The private companies that are most often victims of these ransomware attacks can be blindsided about "who actually attacked them" because of the sophisticated nature of the attackers, according to Anup Ghosh, CEO of Fidelis Cybersecurity and a former researcher at the Department of Defense.

"Unlike a physical attack where you can do identification, in cyberspace it's very difficult to do attribution with certainty," he said.

Cross-border chases

If the ransomware attackers are based in a different country, as they often are, that requires US officials to pursue international cooperation and diplomacy that can further slow down and complicate the prosecution process.

"The major challenges in bringing international hacker groups to justice are having to conduct foreign operations through additional layers of bureaucracy of our international counterparts," said Bret Fund, head of cybersecurity at the Flatiron School. "This includes less access to on-the-ground resources to investigate, gather intelligence and support the prosecution across borders."

If that's not enough, some countries also use access to cyber criminals as a diplomatic bargaining chip, according to Bryan Hornung, CEO of cybersecurity firm Xact IT Solutions.

"Russia sees cyberattacks... as a way to sow discord and give the US and democracy a black eye," Hornung said, pointing to Russia's stated willingness to extradite criminals only if the United States reciprocates.

The code behind REvil's attack was written in such a way that it avoids Russian or related languages, according to a report by cybersecurity firm Trustwave SpiderLabs, which was obtained by NBC News . The firm said this is likely designed to avoid running afoul of local enforcement in the countries they operate in.

The Biden administration is stepping up its effort to finalize a government-wide strategy on how to respond to ransomware attacks, with the National Security Council working to coordinate a plan of action in recent days, according to officials and experts involved in the discussions. Another meeting on the subject is expected to take place next week between US and Russian officials, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.

President Joe Biden confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin about the scourge of ransomware attacks during a summit in Geneva last month, a meeting he referenced again over the weekend shortly after the Kaseya attack.

"[If] it is either with the knowledge of and/or the consequence of Russia, then I told Putin we will respond," the president said Saturday.

Extradition

After the attackers or hacker groups are located and prosecuted overseas — often with the help of law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol — the next challenge is to bring them back to the US justice system.

Those extraditions can often take years, with US authorities having little control over the process and timeline. Both Burkov and Nikulin, for instance, were sentenced more than five years after their initial crimes were said to have taken place. In Burkov's case, the extradition process alone took nearly four years.]

"The United States works with foreign authorities to locate wanted persons and then to request the extradition of the person," the Department of Justice explains on its website . "However, the extradition case is handled by the foreign authorities in the foreign courts. Once the extradition request is submitted to the foreign government, the United States does not control the pace of the proceedings."

While there is a greater push to cooperate on cybersecurity issues from the United States as well as other countries, coordinating those responses is turning into a race against time as new ransomware attacks continue to take place by the week, if not by the day.

"You can think of this as closer to organized crime, and the kind of task force that you've seen in the past against organized crime," said Ghosh. "It takes a long time to really map these criminal gangs, understand their heads and take them down, and requires cooperation of other countries, so those are longer timelines."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Big Oil is not pleased with the White House's push this week for more crude from OPEC and its allies.

The American Petroleum Institute, the powerful lobby group that represents the US oil and gas industry, is arguing President Joe Biden should be working to boost oil production at home before looking overseas.

"You'd think the first place you would go would be American producers, rather than OPEC, which literally held this country hostage for decades because they were our top supplier," API President Mike Sommers told CNN Business.

In response, a White House official stressed the importance of "reliable and stable energy markets at this critical moment" in the global recovery from the pandemic.

"President Biden has made clear that he wants Americans to have access to affordable energy, including at the pump," the US official told CNN Business.

Goldman Sachs: Biden's OPEC+ outreach unlikely to work

The national average price of gasoline stands near a seven-year high at $3.18 a gallon, up from $2.18 year ago, according to AAA . Higher energy prices are a reflection of supply failing to catch up with surging demand as people fly and drive more now that many have been vaccinated.

OPEC and its allies like Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, continue to hold back supply they took offline at the onset of the pandemic. They've only gradually added barrels.

The Biden administration on Wednesday called on OPEC+ to do more to combat elevated energy prices. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement that OPEC+ "must do more to support the recovery."

It's worth noting that Biden is only the latest US president to ask for help from OPEC — a step that even former President Trump took despite his championing of American energy dominance. (Trump would later take the unusual step of urging OPEC to pump less oil to save domestic oil producers from an historic crash in prices brought on by the pandemic and a price war within OPEC+).

In a note to clients on Thursday, Goldman Sachs strategist said the White House's outreach to OPEC+ is "unlikely" to persuade be effective in the short term. The Wall Street firm cited concerns about weakening demand caused by the Delta variant.

Fossil fuels crackdown

The API, which has a vested interest in domestic energy production, said unleashing US oil producers would be a better solution.

ExxonMobil XOM Chevron CVX "We have this strategic advantage of an energy revolution — that started under President Obama. We should be doing everything we can to encourage production in the United States," said Sommers, whose group representsand other major US-based oil companies.

And Sommers criticized the Biden administration for its regulatory crackdown on the fossil fuels industry.

"The irony sure is thick," Sommers said. "We're talking about an administration that really for the first eight months in office did nothing but try to restrict American development of oil and gas."

On his first day in office , Biden immediately moved to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, placed a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic and revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline , a controversial project that wasn't scheduled to begin transporting Canadian oil until 2023 at the earliest.

"I'm not saying what Biden has done in the first eight months is the only reason we are seeing high prices today," Sommers said. "There's no question there are significant market forces at play."

Sommers conceded that the leasing pause, which the API strongly opposed, is not impacting today's prices. Instead, he said, that move — along with the cancellation of the Keystone XL added regulatory uncertainty that will discourage future investment in domestic energy.

Why US oil producers aren't coming to the rescue

But regulation is not the only reason US oil production has been somewhat slow to rebound from the pandemic.

After burning through insane amounts of money last decade, oil companies are under enormous pressure from Wall Street to be more retrained and share profits with shareholders. They're in no rush to come to the rescue.

"This has been an underperforming asset class," Sommers said. "There is fiscal discipline occurring in the oil patch today. The focus is on returning money to investors who lost a lot of money in the past decade, particularly in 2020."

Of course, the Biden administration's tougher approach on the oil-and-gas industry is being driven by a sense of urgency around the climate crisis — especially after four years of gutting environmental regulations during the Trump era.

The International Energy Agency warned in May that the world needs to stop drilling for oil and natural gas right now to prevent a climate catastrophe.

The White House official stressed that gas prices are lower today than they were for most of the first half of the decade and are in line with 2018 — the middle of the Trump administration.

"But we have to stay vigilant," the official said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Americans are extremely worried about the Delta variant and the spike in Covid-19 cases. A key survey of consumer confidence plunged in August below where it was in April 2020 when the first Covid-19 outbreak slammed the brakes on the US economy.

The University of Michigan said that its influential consumer sentiment index plunged 13.5% from July to August and hit a level of 70.2. That's the most bearish reading for this measure since December 2011.

The drop was so precipitous since last month that the University of Michigan has recorded only six bigger monthly drops in the index's nearly 50-year history, including a more than 19% plunge in April 2020 and 18% drop in October 2008 during the height of the Great Recession and Global Financial Crisis.

"There is little doubt that the pandemic's resurgence due to the Delta variant has been met with a mixture of reason and emotion," said Richard Curtin, the surveys chief economist.

"Consumers have correctly reasoned that the economy's performance will be diminished over the next several months, but the extraordinary surge in negative economic assessments also reflects an emotional response, mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end," he added.

its rival, SpaceX, has already completed development and testing of its own crewed spacecraft. The Starliner is a gumdrop-shaped capsule meant to house astronauts and ferry them through space after launching atop a rocket. The vehicle is years behind its planned entry to service, and myriad issues and delays during the development process have been a black eye for Boeing. Meanwhile,its rival, SpaceX, has already completed development and testing of its own crewed spacecraft.

Boeing was slated to repeat an uncrewed test flight of Starliner earlier this month after several major software issues plagued its first attempt in December 2019, leaving the spacecraft unable to dock with the ISS and forced to make an early return to Earth.

After more than a year of working to solve those issues, a new slate of problems was discovered when the spacecraft was rolled out to its launch pad earlier this month and began going through pre-flight ground checks. The issues involved 13 valves in the spacecraft's propulsion system, which were not opening on command as they must before liftoff, according to the company. After attempting to fix the issue on site at NASA's launch facilities in Florida, nine of the 13 valves began working again.

But Boeing disclosed Friday that it still hasn't identified the root cause of the issue, though the company said it was likely related to moisture — possibly from the humid Florida air — leaking into the propulsion valves. The company also disclosed additional problems with abnormal temperature readings. The company will need to return the Starliner spacecraft to a Boeing factory, signaling a potentially expensive months-long delay before it can proceed with the crucial test.

World food prices have soared by 31% over the past year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Supply shortages caused by extreme weather is one of several factors behind this food inflation.

"There's no doubt that changes in weather patterns are impacting our food supply," said Jennifer Bartashus, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence who covers retail staples and packaged food.

Robert Yawger, a 35-year veteran of the commodities industry, is no stranger to price booms in agriculture. But unlike prior booms, this one isn't being driven by typical factors like emerging market demand or a weak US dollar.

"In the past, it wasn't that there was a climate catastrophe rallying everything at once," said Yawger, executive director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities. "I've never seen anything like this -- where everything is bid to the moon at the same time."

Severe weather events have contributed to natural catastrophe losses of $40 billion during the first half of 2021 alone, according to Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance company. That's the second-highest amount on record.

Of course, not all extreme weather is caused by the climate crisis.

For example, some shifting weather patterns could be caused by La Nina , according to Rosenzweig, the Columbia professor who is also senior research scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

Worker shortages, rising transportation costs

And the rise in food prices can be driven by multiple factors -- some of which have nothing to do with climate change.

For instance, some food inflation is being caused by a shortage of workers, including in the agricultural sector amid the pandemic and Trump administration's crackdown on immigration. Transportation costs are also high because of elevated oil prices and a shortage of truck drivers. That's not to mention elevated packaging costs.

"I've been in the industry for 38 years and this is the highest we've ever seen inflation go up in our company," said Orlando Olave, senior director of operations at New York supermarket Morton Williams. "It's incredible how many things are going up now."

93% of wheat in poor condition in Washington State

Wheat prices are going up in part due to "concerns over dry weather and crop conditions in North America," according to the UN food agency . Specifically, droughts in Canada and the Northwestern part of the United States have wiped out wheat crops.

The most recent crop report published by the USDA found that just 11% of spring wheat across six US states is in good to excellent condition. That's down from 69% a year ago.

In Washington State, a staggering 93% of the spring wheat is in poor or very poor condition because of droughts, according to the Drought Monitor.

"It's been cooked. Day in and day out they're getting temperatures they've never seen before," Yawger said.

'Complete crop failure'

More than 95% of the Western part of the United States is currently in some level of drought.

"Droughts have caused some farmers to stop growing some crops altogether -- complete crop failure," said Rosenzweig.

An historic frost in Brazil is threatening coffee crops and driving up prices.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . A report issued by the group this week found that droughts that may have only happened once a decade, now happen 70% more often around the world.

Chris Field, a professor who studies climate change at Stanford University, worries about how droughts and water constraints in California and the West will impact America's supply of nuts, fruits and vegetables.

"So far, we have not seen widespread food price increases for American consumers," Field wrote in an email. "But, as extremes become more common, the risk becomes more and more real."

Coffee and sugar prices on the rise

But it's not just warm conditions impacting food supply.

The deep freeze in Texas earlier this year caused at least $600 million in agricultural losses across the Lonestar State, according to research from Texas A&M University. That included the loss of livestock, citrus and vegetable crops.

Severe frost has damaged coffee crops in Brazil, raising fears of a severe decline in production.

Unfortunately, these climate-driven crop problems are only going to add to the sticker shock gripping America.

"If demand remains the same, or even grows as restaurants open, but supply is constrained, that will naturally translate to higher prices that are paid ultimately by the consumer," said Bartashus, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.

Even before the unusually cold temperatures in Brazil, US retail coffee prices were on the rise in part because of droughts in Brazil. The average price of ground coffee hit $4.75 per pound in April, the highest level in nearly six years , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Although coffee prices have since retreated, the frost in Brazil threatens to reverse that. The impact to consumers may not be immediate because of the way major companies buy coffee beans (and other commodities).

Starbucks SBUX said last month that customers won't be forced to spend more on coffee because the company buys coffee beans ahead of time and locks in prices.

There's little doubt, at least in Yawger's mind, that climate change is to blame for the simultaneous impact to various crops.

"The chance all of these pieces would move in an anti-harvest way would be one in a million," he said. "The evidence is overwhelming that it is a change in weather."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Lamborghini has unveiled a brand new $2.6 million supercar with a very familiar name: the Countach.

The original Lamborghini Countach, unveiled as a concept car at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971, made the Italian automaker world famous. The new Countach, unveiled at an event during Monterey Car Week in California Friday, celebrates the 50th anniversary of that debut.

In many regards, the new Countach is a direct descendent of the original. It has a V12 engine, directly behind the two seats. And, like every Lamborghini sports car since the Countach, it's shaped like a low-profile wedge.

The shape of the new Lamborghini Countach was inspired by the 1971 Countach prototype.

There's one very big difference, though. This new Countach is a hybrid. It's not a plugin hybrid but, as the car drives, it stores power in a supercapacitor that can provide some additional power to the wheels during hard acceleration. At low speeds, it also provides power between gear shifts to help smooth the uncomfortable surging and bucking that can come from Lamborghini's aggressive racecar-style transmission.

Supercapacitors are more expensive than batteries and they are not as good as batteries at storing energy for long periods. But they can store more energy per cubic centimeter than batteries and they can absorb and release energy more quickly.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hong Kong (CNN Business) China's worst coronavirus outbreak in a year has authorities taking dramatic measures to stamp out new infections. But while locking down cities, canceling flights and suspending trade may bring the virus back under control, those actions risk stalling an already precarious recovery .

The country's latest struggles began as the Delta variant of Covid-19 swept through China in late July, quickly spreading to more than half of its 34 provinces and regions and leading to more than a thousand confirmed cases.

While the numbers of cases remain small by comparison with recent surges in infections in the United States and Europe, China has aggressively revived its "zero-Covid" strategy.

It has isolated some cities, closed down entertainment venues, canceled flights and rolled out mass testing as it tries to contain the spread — measures not seen at this scale since the beginning of the pandemic last year. Some trade at a major container port near Shanghai was even suspended this week after a worker tested positive for the virus.

Those drastic moves have already prompted some economists to slash their growth projections for the world's second largest economy.

Goldman Sachs analysts forecast China's GDP to grow by just 2.3% in the third quarter from the previous quarter — dramatically lower than the 5.8% increase they originally expected.

"With the virus spreading to many of China's provinces and local governments reacting swiftly to control the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, we have begun to see softening in national aggregate data," the analysts said in a research report earlier this week, adding that they expect services like travel, catering and entertainment to be affected.

Still, despite the anticipated slump in the third quarter, the Goldman analysts still expect the recovery largely to remain intact this year. For all of 2021, they expect China's economy to grow 8.3%, slightly lower than a previous estimate of 8.6%.

Other economists, though, have also warned of a hit to growth.

China has implemented "strict individual mobility restrictions" to better enforce its "zero tolerance" policy, analysts at JP Morgan wrote in a research note earlier this week. They forecast economic growth to halve to 2% in the current quarter, compared with a previous estimate of 4.3%. They also cut their 2021 GDP growth forecast to 8.9% from 9.1%.

"We expect the situation can be brought under control in the next several weeks, but the epidemic control procedure will dent consumption and services tentatively," they added.

Morgan Stanley analysts, meanwhile, cut their China GDP growth forecast to 8.2% for 2021 last week, also saying that the outbreak would affect consumption growth and dent service sector hiring.

Further disruption is possible

Beijing is expected on Monday to release more information about the economic recovery — including consumption, industrial production and investment — which should offer more clues about China's economic recovery.

Those figures aren't likely to be comprehensive, since they only cover July data and will omit whatever impact the virus has had through the first couple of weeks of August.

But there are other recent signs that the resurgence of the virus, along with the measures China is taking to contain it, could cause disruption.

On Wednesday, authorities shut down Meishan terminal in Ningbo-Zhoushan port — the world's third largest container port — after a dock worker tested positive for Covid, according to the local government . The port handles goods that would fill around 78,000 20-foot containers every day. The Meishan terminal accounts for around a fifth of the port's volume.

36,000 20-foot containers every day. Even after that port reopened in June, it operated below capacity for a while, creating a shipping backlog that will take weeks to clear. The problems there echo a lockdown that Chinese authorities imposed in May on Yantian, a critical port in southern China that can handle36,000 20-foot containers every day. Even after that port reopened in June, it operated below capacity for a while, creating a shipping backlog that will take weeks to clear.

"This was one of the immediate risks that we'd seen emerging in China as the pandemic situation has deteriorated," said Nick Marro, lead analyst for global trade at the Economist Intelligence Unit, in a research note on Thursday.

"The global trade and logistics environment is already in a pretty fragile state, particularly given all of the challenges we've seen over the spring and early summer," he added. "Interruptions to trade not only pose problems for shipping and consumers, but also manufacturers who rely on critical imported components."

Other challenges

Delta variant-fueled lockdowns aren't China's only problem right now.

The country is also battling with surging inflation and growing debt risks.

High producer inflation is troubling news for China's businesses and the country's economic recovery. It means that the The producer price index — which measures the cost of goods sold to businesses — increased 9% in July from a year earlier, matching the highest level in nearly 13 years seen in May High producer inflation is troubling news for China's businesses and the country's economic recovery. It means that the rising costs of raw materials are now more aggressively cutting into company profits, and could force them to control costs by slowing down production or even shedding workers.

Debt risks are another concern. China's corporate bond defaults climbed to 62.59 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) in the first half of the 2021, the highest level for the same period on record, according to Fitch Ratings.

A sweeping regulatory crackdown on private businesses that Beijing wants to keep in check has also upset investors and shaken market confidence.

Those recent regulatory measures on sectors ranging from tech and finance to education have wiped out more than $1 trillion in market value from some of China's most valuable companies, according to Goldman Sachs.

And analysts at JP Morgan said the clampdown, particularly in tech and education, "will not only lead to disruption in tutoring business, but also lead to rising unemployment and drag on the recovery in income growth." They added that the country's ban on for-profit tutoring alone could affect millions of jobs.

Data showed that China's borrowing drastically slowed last month, indicating that businesses and individuals may be reluctant to invest or spend, which could lead to reduced employment, less consumption, and slower growth.

Chinese banks only extended 1.08 trillion yuan ($167 billion) in new yuan loans last month, down nearly 50% from June, according to data released by the People's Bank of China last Wednesday.

A broader measure for financing, including loans offered by nonbank institutions, totaled 1.06 trillion yuan ($164 billion) in July, also down sharply from 3.67 trillion yuan in June.

The slowdown likely reflected "weak credit demand amid tightened regulations" on property, consumer credit and the ability of local governments to borrow, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.

London (CNN Business) Disney shares are up more than 5% in premarket trading after the entertainment giant added more steaming video subscribers than Wall Street expected and reported a strong recovery for its theme park business .

But the company still can't escape the coronavirus pandemic.

shares have gained less than 1% this year, badly trailing the S&P 500 index, which has increased by more than 20% since January 1. Disney may struggle to make up that ground until the pandemic recedes.

Video gains: Disney+, the company's streaming service, could stand to gain more subscribers if the Delta variant keeps people at home. The service grew to 116 million subscribers in the quarter ended July 3, exceeding the 112 million figure that Wall Street analysts expected.

But the company's massive theme park and movie businesses remain exposed to the coronavirus, and their recovery could be slowed or reversed by the more contagious Delta variant.

"We did not anticipate nor did I think anybody the resurgence of Covid with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace," CEO Bob Chapek told analysts on Thursday.

Chapek was responding to a question about how Disney would handle the release of its next two potential blockbusters, "Free Guy" and "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings."

Both films will spend 45 days in theaters before heading to Disney+, a departure from the strategy the company used for "Black Widow," which was released simultaneously in theaters and on the streaming service.

Chapek said that Disney can't change its plan for "Free Guy" because of promises made when the film was acquired, while distribution commitments prevent last-minute changes to the rollout of "Shang-Chi."

"The marketplace is rapidly changing," Chapek added. "But at some point, you've got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we're going to do, and that's where we ended up on 'Shang-Chi' and 'Free Guy.'"

Another problem: Disney's decision to release "Black Widow" on its streaming service prompted a lawsuit from star actress Scarlett Johansson, who has sued the company, saying the strategy reduced her compensation.

In this file photo, guests wear masks at Walt Disney World in Florida.

Theme parks also remain vulnerable to Delta.

Revenue from Disney's parks division increased by more than 300% in the most recent quarter to $4.3 billion, and Chapek said bookings continue to show strong demand.

But one of the company's biggest parks, Disney World, is located in Florida, a Delta variant hot spot. And other tourism companies have issued warnings about Delta, including Southwest Airlines and Airbnb.

Disney World and Disneyland are already requiring employees and guests to wear masks and face coverings once again when indoors.

Investors are ready to reward Disney for the progress it's made. But with Delta continuing to spread, it's too soon to say the company is out of the woods.

'Lord of the Rings' leaves New Zealand

Middle-Earth is moving from New Zealand to the United Kingdom, reports my CNN Business colleague Diksha Madhok

Amazon Studios announced Thursday that it is moving the filming of the second season of its highly anticipated, and extremely expensive, "Lord of the Rings" series to the United Kingdom.

"The shift from New Zealand to the UK aligns with the studio's strategy of expanding its production footprint and investing in studio space across the UK," Amazon said in a statement.

The first season of the series is being produced in New Zealand at a cost of nearly half a billions US dollars and is set to debut on September 2, 2022 on Prime Video.

Remember: Nearly two decades ago, Peter Jackson's "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy, which won 17 Academy Awards, was largely filmed in New Zealand and showcased the country's natural scenery.

New Zealand is not pleased about Amazon's decision.

"The Amazon Studios' decision in no way reflects the capabilities of our local film industry or the talents of the people who work in it. This is a multinational company that has made a commercial choice," Economic Development Minister Stuart Nash said in response.

Nash said that Amazon was spending more than $460 million in New Zealand to produce the first season. He said that following the decision to relocate production, the government would pull some financial incentives that had been awarded to Amazon.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Airbnb had a blockbuster second quarter, with revenue soaring nearly 300% and topping expectations. But it also reported some bad news: The company is worried about the Delta variant's impact on consumers' future travel plans.

The company benefited from more people taking vacations in the spring and summer, but Airbnb says the next few months could be extremely bumpy. Shares of Airbnb fell nearly 2% in late morning trading Friday on the company's warning.

"In the near term," Airbnb said in its earnings letter to shareholders, Covid and new variants including Delta "will continue to affect overall travel behavior, including how often and when guests book and cancel." As a result, Airbnb's future bookings "will continue to be more volatile and non-linear."

Airbnb did try to reassure investors that it believes the impact will be temporary, however. And the company also said in its shareholder letter that it expects third-quarter revenue to be its strongest on record.

Analysts are currently forecasting that Airbnb will report revenue of nearly $1.9 billion in the third quarter, up from sales of $1.3 billion in the second quarter.

She is author of "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices From the Internet Underground." The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and dogecoin, have dominated the news cycle in recent months. Meanwhile, the rise of another type of digital currency has gotten far less attention: central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Unlike bitcoin, CBDCs are issued by governments and are basically digital versions of an existing national currency. But instead of holding it in your wallet, you store it on your phone.

CBDCs could become more commonplace sooner than you'd think. According to the think tank Atlantic Council , 81 countries, which account for over 90% of the world's gross domestic product, are exploring a digital currency, and five countries have already launched one. And there will be more to come. According to a survey by the Bank for International Settlements, countries representing one-fifth of the world's population may well issue a digital currency in the next few years.

Leading the race is China's digital yuan , which has already been trialed in over $5 billion worth of transactions. The US, by contrast, is still in the research phase. The House Committee on Financial Services recently had a hearing on the promises and perils of CBDC, in which several witnesses called on the US to be more proactive. Julia Coronado of MacroPolicy Perspectives called on the US to take a "leadership role" on CBDCs . "Failing to act now will leave the US on the outside looking in," added the Atlantic Council's Julia Friedlander.

In other words, if America waits too long, it could miss a chance to shape the future of digital money.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Monterey, California (CNN) Audi's latest concept car, the skysphere, will be able to drive itself, the company claims. But the real hook is that, as it changes from human driving to self-driving, the body of the skysphere expands by 10 inches from end-to-end.

The concept car's long hood extends forward and the steering wheel and pedals fold away. The driver's side of the dashboard, really a glass display panel, and the gear selector also pull away, creating a more comfortable space for the driver to relax.

All this is possible because the skysphere is an electric car powered by a motor that's mounted behind the seats. That means there's not much under the hood to get in the way as the front end moves forward and backward.

The Audi Skysphere's grille is actually an LED light display.

In its self-driving mode, the skysphere acts like a touring car, an elegant two seater designed for fast comfortable long distance travel. A longer wheelbase -- the distance between the front and back wheels -- is good for road trips because it can give the car a more stable feel on the highway. And without a steering wheel or pedals, the driver can stretch out, relax and enjoy the scenery.

In regular human driving mode, it's more like a sports car. The much shorter wheelbase can give the car a quicker, more responsive driving feel. The car also lowers on its suspension almost a half inch closer to the ground. When put in its sports car mode, a steering wheel unfolds from underneath the dashboard and a set of pedals moves into position in the driver's footwell.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN) Gone are the days of running to the ATM in order to get cash to tip your server or hair stylist. If cash was going out of style before the pandemic, consider its reputation ruined by infection concerns that have pushed consumers toward cashless alternatives — especially when it comes to tipping.

Apps like Venmo, Cash App and PayPal let users easily facilitate peer-to-peer payments. And Apple and Google both have their own digital payment and wallet services.

But while cashless tipping may be a consumer convenience, does it benefit service workers who have traditionally relied on cash tips?

Bigger tips as a matter of convenience

Digital payment systems often give customers the option to select a pre-calculated tip which, according to several companies that offer these services, often result in larger tips.

For example, digital payment company Square allows merchants to select between a "smart tip" or a custom tip. When smart tip is turned on, transactions of less than $10 offer four tipping options: No Tip, $1, $2 or $3. For a transaction of $10 or more, the available tipping options are: No Tip, 15%, 20% or 25%. The custom tip setting allows businesses to select their own options.

Another cashless payment service, Youtip uses QR codes to facilitate digital tipping and offers similar pre-calculated options for users called "Quick Tips." After scanning a QR code, users are prompted to either enter a tip amount or select a "Quick Tip" option, which is a fixed amount set by the system or the business.

According to the company's data, over 70% of tips processed through the system are either a "Quick Tip" selection or higher, Sarah Taveprungsenukul, Youtip co-founder and chief commercial officer, told CNN Business.

youtip, a digital payment service made specifically for cashless tipping, offers users "Quick Tip" options with pre-calculated tips.

One lodging business that adopted Youtip's system reported that it saw housekeeping tips rise from an average of $14 to $21 with the implementation of the QR codes and customized "Quick Tip" prompts, according to Youtip's data.

Tippy, another digital payment service, has seen similar increases. Originally created for the beauty industry, Tippy's data shows that not only are people tipping more often when its cashless system is used, but the average tip has increased 11% since early 2020.

"We're encouraging people to tip more because we're doing the calculation for them," Terry McKim, Tippy's founder and CIO, told CNN Business.

Cashless options are also changing tipping norms, encouraging tips for workers who don't usually receive them, like fast food servers or fitness instructors, according to Taveprungsenukul.

"Tipping is everywhere and even the places where it isn't, maybe it should be," she said. "We're working with a lot of groups, for example in quick-serve restaurants, where they're implementing our solution."

The downsides of cashless tips

Despite the convenience of cashless payments and tips, some service workers still prefer cash. For example, some workers don't have access to the banking tools necessary to accept and process digital payments, Clara Wheatley-Schaller, political director at Workers United NY NJ, told CNN Business.

"With anything that is cashless tipping, that would be the main concern: making sure the money is accessible and going directly to the worker," she said.

More than 80% of workers represented by Workers United, which represents a variety of service workers, experience some kind of wage theft, according to the union's survey data. When customers add tips on their credit card, the money doesn't always go directly to the worker. Those tips might get cut due to processing fees, for example. Because of this, some workers don't trust that they're getting all their cashless tips. Handing cash directly to a worker is the safest way to ensure they are getting the entirety of their tip, Whetley-Schaller said.

D. Taylor, president of Unite Here, a union representing workers in the hotel and food service industries, has observed that workers benefit when there are pre-calculated tip options. But he said the union has struggled to find solutions that make cashless tipping easy for both the consumer and the worker. Most digital payment companies take a cut of the tips paid through their services, and it can be hard to ensure that tips are going to the intended workers, Taylor said.

Tippy, for example, said it charges businesses a flat annual rate of $300 for the use of its services. And, instead of charging workers processing fees for using its software, the service charges the customer leaving a tip a fee for use of the system. Similarly, Youtip applies a service fee to the person paying the tip, but businesses have the option to cover that fee for customers.

Another issue with digital tipping: taxes. While both cash and digital tips are taxable, cash is self-reported, so it's easier for some payments to remain under the table. But, as tipping on credit cards has grown more popular in past years, paying taxes on tips is "old news," Taylor said.

For workers who are used to taking cash tips without always reporting them, digital tipping might actually alleviate their tax concerns. Although they'll have to pay taxes on their tips, using digital payment services can increase tips enough to offset the cost of taxes, said David Tashjian, Tippy's CEO and president.

Adapting to a cashless economy is "not even a question of interest. It's going to happen," Taylor said. "The real question is how can the fruits of [a worker's] labor be rewarded? And how is that done in a way that they are the beneficiaries of it as opposed to someone taking a cut that had nothing to do with their labor, but just developed an app?"
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN Business) During a pandemic that upended lives, broke routines, and mothballed most forms of in-person activities, a funny thing happened in the entertainment business: The drive-in theater saved the cinema . But while it might have been dismissed as another anomaly in a year full of unusual economic blips, the renewed interest in drive-in theaters looks like it's here to stay.

Last year, from late-March through mid-August, drive-ins generated 85% of North American box office revenue (and some weeks contributed north of 95%), according to Comscore data provided to CNN Business. During that same period in 2019, drive-ins accounted for just 2.9% of box office revenue.

And although films and people have started to return to brick-and-mortar cinemas (albeit at far lower levels than before), drive-ins are showing that they have staying power. Through the first 30 weeks of 2021, they're still gobbling up a greater share of box office revenue than they did pre-pandemic: averaging 6.2% of weekend box office dollars this year versus nearly 1.9% for the first 30 weeks of 2019, Comscore data show.

A view of the Miami Screening of the HBO Documentary Film 'Revolution Rent' at Nite Owl Drive-In Theater on June 10, 2021 in Miami, Florida.

"Naturally, the attributes of the multiplex did not work well within the confines of the pandemic, but consumers hungry to get out of the house found the drive-in to be the perfect solution to a question that no one had even thought to ask just a year before," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, which tracks global box office data.

"The old-fashioned and often marginalized drive-in theater must now be recognized as one of the saviors of the [cinema] industry," he said.

There are indications that the added exposure jumpstarted an outdoor cinema rally: Long-forsaken drive-ins are being dusted off and spruced up; pop-ups are proliferating in cities; the concept is gaining momentum overseas ; and new takes on the classic are launching.

In the limelight

In 1958, drive-ins topped out at more than 4,000 locations nationwide, according to Kerry Segrave's chronicle of the industry, "Drive-in Theaters: A History from Their Inception in 1933."

Those ranks were culled following the emergence of television and, later, the arrival of cable, VHS, the cinema multiplex, digital innovation and rising land values.

Now, fewer than 350 fixed-screen drive-in locations are sprinkled across America, mostly in rural communities where land is in greater abundance and light pollution is minimal.

Prior to last year, those highly seasonal outdoor outfits contributed a mere sliver of the movie exhibition business.

In 2019, during peak summer months, drive-ins accounted for fewer than 6% of all theaters in North America and about 4% of overall box office returns, Comscore data show.

An aerial drone view shows a temporary drive-in movie theater at the Rose Bowl stadium on July 4, 2020 in Pasadena, California. July fireworks were canceled that year due to COVID-19 concerns.

The pandemic flipped the script. For June through August 2020, about 21% of North American movie theaters in operation were drive-ins, and those fixed-screen outdoor cinemas had 70% of the box office revenue.

Indoor spaces and public gatherings became ill-suited for the preservation of health and safety against the deadly coronavirus. However, the open-air drive-ins with built-in physical distancing from vehicles had more favorable attributes.

"The world has become attuned to drive-ins in a way it hasn't in decades," said Ross Melnick, an associate professor in the University of California -- Santa Barbara's Department of Film and Media Studies.

Bob Lallky, 24, of Scottsdale, Arizona, saw his first-ever drive-in movie last year when he watched "The Greatest Showman" at a shopping center pop-up screening.

Being able to maintain physical distance from others while enjoying a favorite movie in the comfort of a car was an experience Lallky would like to repeat.

"I hope that they would put a permanent drive-in option close to me," he said. "It's something different."

New arrivals

Entering 2020, the drive-in industry had reached a point of equilibrium, said Nick Hensgen, owner of driveinmovie.com , which tracks and maps drive-ins of the present and past.

in 2020, which would make for a very good year in a business that's seen its numbers shrink to about 305 in 2019 from 499 in 1999, The drive-ins that remained were popular, well-maintained and successfully adapted to the digital transition, he said. He added that one or two drive-ins were expected to openin 2020, which would make for a very good year in a business that's seen its numbers shrink to about 305 in 2019 from 499 in 1999, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association

Ten ultimately did open last year, at least nine more have opened so far this year, and several more are in the works, he said.

In Loudon County, Tennessee, a new arrival features a modern twist that its operator hopes could serve as the future of the concept.

The centerpiece of the LoCo Drive-In is a 35-by-63-foot Samsung video board, a jumbotron with the capabilities of allowing for both daytime and nighttime showings of movies, live sports and other events.

"It's an idea I've had in my head for 25 years," Gordon Whitener, owner of Loudon Entertainment LLC, said in an interview with CNN Business. "While [the Covid-19 pandemic] didn't drive it, it certainly motivated me to get on with it."

His plan is to erect more of the video board drive-ins across the country -- perhaps another 10 to 15 in the next five to 10 years.

In Oklahoma's Green Country, efforts are in the works to resurrect the Tee Pee Drive-In, a long-abandoned drive-in located along an Ozark Trail section of US Route 66.

Existential threats

It's too early to know what consumer behaviors may stick when the pandemic wanes or ends, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry advisor for consumer research firm NPD.

"Drive-ins will see a slight resurgence, as small opportunities will arise for people to open them and offer them as movie options again, but not on a huge scale," he said via email, adding that brick-and-mortar theaters will adapt as well. "But on the other side of the equation is the investment so many have made in subscriptions to premium channels offering up first-run movies. If the industry continues to run down that path, theaters will have a hard time competing."

Attendees arrive to watch the movie "Grease" at a pop-up drive-in theatre at Bucktown Marina Park on May 22, 2020 in Metairie, Louisiana. With indoor theaters in many places closed due to coronavirus, drive-in theaters saw a rise in attendance.

Tamara Charm, a McKinsey & Company senior expert and co-author of the B2C Sentiment Surveys , said 75% of consumers surveyed by her organization said they expect their pandemic-level online streaming spending to continue even past the pandemic.

The activity in 2020 has been a tough act to follow for many drive-ins, said filmmaker April Wright, who directed the documentary, "Going Attractions: The Definitive Story of the American Drive-in Movie."

Now, in the second summer of pandemic, fixed-screen drive-in operators are facing a host of challenges, notably a lack of films from studios; competition from other attractions and digital streaming; gummed up supply chains; hiring challenges; and unruly customers, she said.

"I think there was certainly a level of difficulty to run a drive-in and keep a drive-in going in this day and age," she said. "When you start adding all these complications and levels of difficulties, [drive-in operators] are worried."

Some operators are closing up shop and others are cashing out while the industry's at a high, Wright said, adding she's seen a stark increase in the number of drive-ins landing on the sales block.

Wright said she's hopeful that the added attention on drive-ins will help people value unique and communal aspects of society.

"As we lose places like [drive-ins], I do think it's having an impact on us," she said. "I think it does make us better as a culture and as humans when we have places to gather."

Staying power

Some drive-ins have come back from the dead, and others like The Mahoning Drive-In Theater in Leighton, Pennsylvania, successfully fended off threats that would have surely doomed the fan-favorite haunt.

In what were a tense couple of weeks, pleas from the Mahoning's operators and public outcry put the kibosh on plans that would have replaced the drive-in with a solar farm . Now, the Mahoning's operators are in talks with the property owner to purchase the land, Mark Nelson, the general manager, told CNN Business.

The Mahoning Drive-In Theater entrance in Leighton, Pennsylvania.

Built in 1948 and opened the following year, the Mahoning "hasn't changed a tremendous lot" since. The 1949-era projector runs 35 mm films reel to reel via Simplex E7 projectors onto a gargantuan 110-foot screen. Inside the vintage cinderblock snack bar, there's a chow line for the food and vinyl records, VHS, DVDs and other memorabilia for sale. One notable modernization: The audio is broadcast via FM transmitter as opposed to the boxy speakers that would dangle inside the car window.

"Last year, the pandemic hurt a lot of drive-ins," Nelson said. "They were forced to go retro, diversify with live events and play movies they wouldn't normally play."

For the Mahoning, however, retro hits right in its wheelhouse.

A night at the Mahoning, known for showing retro classics, schlock horror flicks and creature features, is a full spectacle : The trailers and intermission reels are themed to the movies playing that night; customers often dress up in character; and production designer J.T. Mills creates intricate artistic sets to accompany the films.

Customers seen dressed up in character pose in an artistic set accompanying a film at Mahoning Drive-In Theater in Leighton, Pennsylvania in late August 2020.

The septuagenarian saw some of its biggest attendances ever during the pandemic, Nelson said.

"Every night, there are multiple cars we've never seen here before," said Susan Haaheim, whose grandfather opened the Parma Motor-Vu in 1953.

Although drive-ins like the Parma Motor-Vu were fortunate enough to keep the projectors running during the pandemic, 2020 wasn't smooth sailing by any means.

"What really saved us in 2020 was we started getting people asking about private events," she said.

That included 13 graduations, a slew of company parties and gatherings like the Idaho Wine Commission's "UnWined at the Drive-In," an event that brought Boise resident Molly Lenty, 42, back to her first drive-in movie in years.

"Being away from the city lights, you're truly out under the stars," Lenty said.

Boston Beer Company SAM The PepsiCo-owned soft drink is partnering with theto make "HARD MTN DEW," a sugar-free canned beverage with 5% alcohol by volume. In a press release, the companies said they paired together because they "understand the importance of delivering new, breakthrough innovations to address the changing tastes of drinkers."

"HARD MTN DEW" comes in three flavors, including original, watermelon and black cherry. They will hit shelves in early 2022. Boston Beer said the boozy beverage will be "marketed to adults of legal age and merchandized consistently with other alcohol beverages."

HARD MTN DEW will hit shelves in early 2022.

Last month, Boston Beer, which also produces Truly Hard Seltzer, said the boozy seltzer fad was starting to fade and that the entrance of new brands is causing consumer confusion. That news sent shares spiraling 30% and its stock hasn't recovered. (The stock was down roughly 2% Tuesday.)

Boston Beer CEO Dave Burwick said at the time that the company "overestimated the growth of the hard seltzer category in the second quarter and the demand for Truly, which negatively impacted our volume and earnings for the quarter and our estimates for the remainder of the year."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) As more Americans get vaccinated , states across the country are lifting their pandemic restrictions. That means that one popular relief measure — the allowance of to-go cocktails at restaurants — is either expiring or continuing, depending on where you live.

The National Restaurant Association counted about 26 states — most of the ones that permitted to-go cocktails during the pandemic — that have opted to allow the practice to continue. Georgia and Texas , for example, made to-go cocktails permanent this spring. Colorado has extended its allowance until 2025, and others like Massachusetts and Virginia stretched the allowance to next year.

But others took a different route. On Thursday, New York officially ended its state of emergency . And with it, beloved cocktail deliveries.

It's one of a small number of states that have let the provision expire or are still deciding on how to proceed. Pennsylvania's provision also expired, but lawmakers may reinstate it.

Cocktails are for sale to go at Dudley's bar and restaurant in Manhattan.

In its statement explaining the move Wednesday, the New York State Liquor Authority said the state's legislature "failed to permanently codify the ability of restaurants to offer alcohol to-go."

Though bills have been introduced to allow NY restaurants to serve alcohol to-go moving forward, the legislature failed to enact them before the end of session. Because of that, "all temporary pandemic-related suspensions and directives, including privileges allowing bars, restaurants, and manufacturers to sell drinks to go, will end after June 24th," the agency said.

Advocates of the program were dismayed by the news.

"This is such a lifeline for the industry," Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurants Association, told CNN Business. "It was during the height of the pandemic. And it continues to be now."

It may seem like restaurants are whole again: Diners are flocking back to restaurants, and some have reported that sales are back to pre-pandemic levels. But "restaurants are hurting still, and have suffered so much over the past 15 or 16 months," Whatley said. "There's so much debt from the past year that we need every tool available to us to help us get fully past the pandemic."

Bar owners react

Dante started serving bottled cocktails during the pandemic.

In New York City, once the epicenter of the pandemic, bar owners were surprised by the abrupt change.

"We had no notice," said Linden Pride, principal at the world-renowned bar Dante. The bar has been selling bottled cocktails that customers can add to their home bars, Pride, the bar's co-owner, said. Dante also partnered with other New York institutions, such as the Barclays Center and restaurant operator Jean Georges. Now, the bar still has hundreds of stickers, bottles and other inventory. "It allowed us to connect to our community in a way that we hadn't been able to do before," Pride said.

Dante encouraged customers to buy the remaining bottled cocktails in an Instagram post on Thursday. "Make the most of these last 24 hours and stock up on signature Dante cocktails," the post said. Commenters expressed dismay. "So sorry to lose this fab option," one wrote. "You got us through the lockdown and all the stress. This is devastating news," said another.

Other bar owners are also scrambling.

"It's still an important lifeline for us," said Marva Babel, who owns the Brooklyn bar Ode to Babel along with her sister Myriam. Babel and her team started serving to-go cocktails early in the pandemic. They developed a weekly cocktail menu, posted it on social media on Thursdays, and hand-delivered flasks filled with the cocktails over the weekend.

"Literally me, my sister, my husband and my friends would drive around the city delivering it to our patrons," Babel said. "People really appreciated the effort," she said. "That saved us. And I think, because of that we became even more popular."

Once Ode to Babel reopened its doors, customers were still asking for the bottled cocktails. So Babel decided to keep the option. Now, she has $6,000 to $7,000 worth of inventory, and she's not sure what to do with it. "For small businesses like mine ... it's a lot of money," she said.

Karl Franz Williams, who owns 67 Orange Street, a cocktail bar, is also facing unknowns ahead.

"We were counting on a percentage of our revenue coming from the cocktails, and now, that's not happening next week," he said. Williams said takeout drinks now represent about 5% of sales. That slice is helpful as 67 Orange Street recovers from the pandemic. "We were counting on all of our revenue sources to get us through," he said.

Plus, Williams noted, some people are still not comfortable eating in restaurants. "There's not 100% confidence," he said. "For a lot of people, there's still caution."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) Hard seltzer sales are surging but competition continues to grow, so Truly Hard Seltzer is using some star power to help the brand break through.

The boozy beverage has signed British singer Dua Lipa to a multi-year sponsorship deal that puts the three-time Grammy Award winner front and center of its largest-ever marketing campaign. Truly's flavor portfolio has blossomed to nearly 30, ranging from iced tea to fruit punch, so it has enlisted the multi-talented singer to reflect its diverse selection.

The ad campaign is called "No One Is Just One Flavor" and begins with a 30-second TV commercial during this week's "Saturday Night Live." Directed by celebrity photographer David LaChapelle , the partially animated commercial features Lipa exploring a "joyous world full of flavor" and is set to her hit song "Physical." Phrases related to Lipa's other traits, like being bilingual and a dog mom, also appear in the ad.

"There's so many parts of us that make us unique and many parts of me that people don't know about," Lipa told CNN Business in an exclusive interview.

"I want people to know there's more to me than being a singer," she said pointing to her multinational roots of being born in the United Kingdom to Kosovar Albanian parents. Her music also transcends genres, which is often a mix of disco, house and '80s pop.

Lipa added that that she only partners with brands she likes and that the campaign feels inclusive and authentic. Perhaps the biggest perk of the partnership is the "special package" of Truly beverages she gets sent to London, where she resides, because it's not yet sold there. Her favorite flavor is mango lemonade and notes she's only a "weekend drinker."

Don Lane, Truly's vice president, told CNN Business that the ad campaign shows Truly isn't a "one trick pony" and that it's leader in innovation, pointing to its growing list of flavors that towers over their competitors.

"Our drinkers are looking for variety in everything they do, including their taste in flavors," he said. "We've all been stuck in quarantine for the past 15 months and what the world needs right now is to let go and have fun. Hard seltzer should be the sidekick in those experiences."

Lane declined to say how much the campaign costs, but said it was "huge." Truly has previously advertised on TV, but this campaign is bigger because it includes out-of-home and digital ads as well as a social media aspect with an Instagram filter that Lipa will use in front of her 66 million followers.

Choosing Lipa was a "really careful decision," Lane said, adding that they picked her because of her young and devoted fan base. "She's really connected with our target audience: She's youthful, she's joyous and she's more than meet than eye," he said.

Lipa will be the brand's most famous face during the summer, which also includes a group of social media influencers. The first part of the campaign will culminate this fall with a "Truly Inspired" virtual concert that's curated by the singer and will feature a performance from her. Fans can also enter to win a VIP experience for the in-person portion of it.

Sales keeps growing

Boston Beer SAM Owned by Sam Adams' parent company,, the seltzer brand has catapulted over its beers and is now the company's top-selling brand. The company has regularly beat analysts' earnings expectations in recent years because of Truly's sales strength, firmly placing it as the country's second top-selling brand behind competitor White Claw.

Together, the two brands capture about 75% of the hard seltzer market, according to Nielsen. However, their leads is in a perilous position as more rivals enter and expand their offerings, including new options from Molson Coors, Constellation Brands and Anheuser-Busch. (Just today, Bud Light Seltzer released a new variety pack combining its lemonade and iced tea flavors.)

"The category is a promiscuous because people like to try different things and there's no better place to do that than with Truly," Lane said. That has sparked the company to continuously pump out new flavors and even a high alcohol version.

Truly has an advantage with that strategy according to Laurent Grandet, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. In a recent note, he predicts that Truly's sales will grow 110% this year. Truly's new flavors are "faster-growing, bolder-flavor alternatives" that "should help reduce the share gap with White Claw," he wrote.

For Lane, he sees a lot of Truly's success mirroring that of Lipa's.

"She's a massive star on the rise similar to how Truly is rising," he said. "We're ascending, and she's ascending and we thought that's a match made in heaven."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN) The heads of some of the largest minority business advocacy groups on Capitol Hill are praising key elements of the latest infrastructure bill , which is currently being debated in the House after passing with bipartisan support in the Senate on Tuesday.

"This was a win for us in a big way that may not necessarily be known by most people," US Black Chambers of Commerce president and CEO Ron Busby Sr. told CNN Business.

Busby's organization advocates on behalf of 143 Black chambers of commerce in the United States and a total of 380,000 Black business owners in the US, Canada and parts of Africa. It's one of several national groups that have spent most of the year pushing lawmakers and the Biden administration to include provisions in the infrastructure package to help Black, Hispanic and Asian-American entrepreneurs.

As a result of their lobbying, the final version of the Senate bill includes a bipartisan amendment that would make the Minority Business Development Agency a permanent part of the federal government and expand its budget from $42 million to $110 million, according to a copy of the measure obtained by CNN Business.

What is the MBDA and why does it matter?

Jess Morales Rocketto, civic engagement director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, (left), and Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, listen as President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting with Latino leaders in the White House on August 3, 2021.

The MBDA is one of the only federal agencies focused exclusively on developing and advocating for minority-owned businesses. The Nixon administration established it in 1969 as a division of the US Department of Commerce. Because its creation was never authorized by Congress, the agency has been required to ask the presiding US President for new funding each year.

"We believe as a separate agency, it'll be given more power to support minority businesses without feeling like it's a foster child, if you will, or less of a priority," Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told CNN Business.

The infrastructure bill's MDBA amendment would expand the agency's geographic reach by granting it resources to open regional offices and rural business centers. Those facilities would be administered through historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions, or MSIs, according to the office of Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, who co-sponsored the measure with Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.

Cardin said the MBDA is one of the federal government's best tools to address the historic barriers to small business ownership faced by minority entrepreneurs.

Studies show small business owners of color have been disproportionately impacted by both the Covid-19 pandemic and the widespread shut downs of nonessential businesses.

The pandemic also exacerbated preexisting inequalities between White and non-White business owners.

"We wanted to increase the resources going into this agency so we can get more entrepreneurship in minority communities," Cardin told CNN Business. "For our economy to perform at the level it needs to, we need everyone to have opportunity in this country."

The Senate infrastructure bill's MBDA amendment would also give financial assistance for both public and private sector development, provide additional grants to nonprofits that support minority business enterprises, and create a new program to promote entrepreneurship at HBCUs and MSIs.

What else does the infrastructure bill do for minority entrepreneurs?

The bill also includes provisions that would break up large infrastructure projects into smaller contract deals and allow minority-owned businesses to make exclusive bids on those projects to ensure greater racial equity, according to Busby.

Minority business owners have historically been systemically excluded from securing often lucrative federal contracts for infrastructure work, such as building bridges and highways, according to a 2016 MBDA report.

That's due in part to the limited size and scale of most minority-owned construction companies and other service providers as well as the burden of financing up front operating costs. Busby says federal contracts typically delay payment until after jobs are completed, which can take months if not years.

"The government is notorious for paying late," Busby said. "It's one thing to get a contract. It's a whole other thing to get paid."

That unbundling of large project contracts is the most critical aspect of the bill, according to Susan Au Allen, president & CEO of the US Pan Asian American Chamber Of Commerce. Allen says the senate bill could help restore the number of minority-owned businesses to their pre-pandemic levels and beyond, but emphasized that strong oversight is needed to ensure its policies are executed properly.

"If there are teeth to ensure open and fair implementation of the legislation and accountability, it could accelerate minority businesses to their pre-Covid-19 growth trajectory, and greatly increase the number of minority businesses in the marketplace," she said.

Obstacles ahead

The infrastructure bill is already facing an uphill battle in the House. Progressive Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have vowed not to support their own version of the measure unless it is coupled with a House version of the Senate's $3.5 trillion budget resolution bill , which Democrats passed with a 50-49 party-line vote on Wednesday.

But Democratic moderates in the House have threatened to withhold their support for the budget resolution until Pelosi allows a vote on the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.

Cardin said he expects the stalemate to last until September after House committees have had a chance to work on the budget resolution.

"Those who are saying we must have one before the other, we'll have that opportunity," he said.

It's also an open question as to whether the infrastructure bill's minority business proposals can survive both political and constitutional scrutiny, according to Busby.

In June, a federal judge in Wisconsin issued a temporary restraining order blocking the US Department of Agriculture from issuing payments to Black farmers under a policy established in the $1.9 billion stimulus bill signed by President Joe Biden in March.

That debt relief program was designed to help socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers who have historically been "subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities," according to a House code

The judge's order was issued after a group of White farmers known as the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed a lawsuit challenging the program. Busby said he expects the infrastructure bill will face similar judicial challenges if signed into law in its current form.

"Yes I believe it will be challenged, but that's nothing new," he said. "We've always been ready for the fight and many times we win the fight."

Cardin said he expects the infrastructure bill's minority business owner provisions will survive, pointing out the courts also have a long history of supporting federal policies such as Affirmative Action that are designed to help disadvantaged groups.

"We've had preferences in our laws for decades to try to provide opportunities for underserved communities," Cardin said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@(CNN) Bugatti announced that it will be making a production version of its concept car called the Bolide, an 1,800-horsepower, 16-cylinder track-only supercar with a top speed of over 300 miles per hour. And this will likely be the last gasoline-powered car the French automaker will build.

Bugatti said the Bolide will be built for just 40 paying customers. Each one will cost at least €4 million, the equivalent of $4.7 million.

Bugatti will help arrange driving sessions on a track for those who buy a Bolide.

The Bolide — a name that comes from French slang for "very fast car," according to Bugatti — was designed solely for track driving, not for use on public roads. It has a modified version of the huge 8.0-liter, 16-cylinder engine found in Bugatti's Chiron, the brand's core model.

The official horsepower of the Bolide will be lower — just 1,600 — because Bugatti rated the production car engine using 93 octane fuel, which can be purchased at roadside gas pumps, instead of the 105 octane racing fuel the concept car was rated for. Since the Bolide can be driven only on race tracks, though, it is likely it will often be filled with racing fuel and could attain the higher horsepower.

Designed for optimal aerodynamics, the Bolide is a little over three feet high, which is about a foot shorter than the Chiron. To get in, occupants must sit on the door sill and put their legs inside before sliding over into the seat.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Washington, DC (CNN) Don't expect any 200 mph trains that rival Europe and Asia's best, or even cheaper fares.

Transportation experts think the infrastructure bill could be the start of a turning point for the disadvantaged state of US rail travel . But the bill doesn't change the fallout of Americans looking past rail for generations. Deep barriers remain to rail travel thriving in the US as in other leading nations.

Attention on passenger rail increased with the election of President Joe Biden. He has long had the nickname "Amtrak Joe" for his regular rail commutes back to Wilmington to take care of his two sons after his first wife and one of his children were killed in a car crash. He was also involved in an Obama-era push for high-speed rail.

Passenger and freight rail receive $66 billion in the infrastructure bill the Senate passed last week. But the details are still up for negotiations in the House before the bill hits Biden's desk.

Regardless, any number close to $66 billion will be a large infusion of cash for an industry that's watched its competitors — road and air travel — receive overwhelmingly more government aid. Rather than compete on a level playing field with other transportation modes, American passenger rail has had to fight off attempts from multiple presidents to slash its funding.

"Amtrak was set up to fail," Robert Puentes, CEO of the Eno Center for Transportation told CNN Business. "It wasn't designed to last as long as it has."

Which means that money has to be spent now just to bring it back to its baseline.

Most new funding will be for maintenance, rather than the futuristic high-speed trains that riders in Europe and Asia have enjoyed for decades. The White House has said there are 5,000 rail cars and thousands of miles of track, signal and power systems in need of replacement. Amtrak has said it needs $38 billion to reach a state of good repair in the Northeast corridor.

"This is an improve the status quo bill," said Jim Mathews, CEO of the Rail Passengers Association. "Passengers won't have to bring Velcro and duct tape to repair their own train cars."

Amtrak passengers walk through Union Station in Washington on Tuesday, June 1, 2021.

A world-class railroad remains out of reach

Rail advocates, including Biden, have long touted the vast potential they see in passenger rail.

"You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high-speed train," Biden said earlier this year. He's also spoken of the potential of trains going 220 mph between Atlanta and Charlotte, or making trips between DC and New York in 92 minutes if three curves along the route are straightened.

Train travel can make getting around the US safer, greener and more efficient, advocates say. Rail travel has less environmental impact than other ways of getting around. Rail also has a better safety record than motor vehicle travel.

But the full potential for world-class rail will still be unmet even with the additional spending. California's ongoing high-speed rail project has been estimated to cost $100 billion, a single project far exceeding the infrastructure package's entire new investment in rail.

lags a spurt of rail investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s, The White House calls the new funding the largest federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak in 1970. But when considering inflation and population growth, itlags a spurt of rail investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute.

The $66 billion, which is mostly for Amtrak, will likely lead to more frequent service and more stops nationwide as well as new equipment. Choke points on the Northeast corridor, in Baltimore and New York, may be relieved, paving the way for faster trips.

Amtrak praised the investment in a statement, but also called on Congress to make sure it gets on-time performance and preference from the host rail lines that its trains run on. Amtrak risks delays and inconveniences because the freight railways can give top priority to their own trains, while Amtrak trains wait their turn.

Passenger rail improvements could be thwarted by freight railroads that own much of the tracks that Amtrak operates on, according to Mathews and other rail experts. They point to the $2 billion invested to upgrade Amtrak service between Chicago and St. Louis. Technology was installed so trains could run at 110 mph, which would cut about an hour off the trip. But safety technology that track owner Union Pacific installed isn't suited for trains going over 90 mph.

Short-lived boost, long-term issues

There's also a risk that Amtrak's improvements will be short-lived, as the new funds run out in five years.

Joseph C. Szabo, who led the Federal Railroad Administration until 2015, cautioned that rail has long seen investments in fits and starts, and will continue to be disadvantaged until it has predictable, dedicated funding, like roads and aviation.

"It's always been treated somewhat as a stepchild," Szabo said.

The rail industry was dominant in the 19th century, and created America's first big businesses. But rail fell out of favor in the 20th century in America, and was seen as antiquated. Henry Ford, inventor of the Model T, once predicted that some up-and-coming nations like China would entirely skip rail and build highways and cars instead. (Ford's prediction didn't materialize, and China now has the largest high-speed rail network in the world.)

Private rail companies struggled to turn a profit on passenger rail service in the mid-20th century. They were hindered by federal government regulations that set prices, and could force railroads to continue to operate unprofitable routes. The US government heavily subsidized rail's competitor, highways, with the largest public works project in history, the Interstate Highway System. Rail travel couldn't compete. After the large railroad company Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970, the US government created Amtrak to preserve passenger rail service. Passenger rail wasn't profitable, so private companies wanted no part in it.

Even a president with the nickname "Amtrak Joe" is proving not to be enough to overhaul the status quo.

Demand for leisure is expected to outstrip business travel coming out of the pandemic, as many companies continue with remote working. High levels of excess savings , particularly among wealthy households, are also expected to boost spending on travel.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hong Kong (CNN Business) Major international airlines are scrambling to reroute flights away from Afghan airspace as the country falls to the Taliban, disrupting passenger services to India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.

United Airlines UAL On Monday,, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates and Flydubai all announced changes to flights to or over Afghanistan, saying that they would monitor the situation as chaotic scenes unfolded at the main airport in Kabul, the nation's capital.

"Due to the dynamic nature of the situation, we have begun routing affected flights around Afghanistan airspace," a United Airlines spokesperson said in a statement early Monday morning local time, adding that it would continue to work closely with authorities to "determine how we continue service to markets impacted."

The changes affect United flights to India.

Virgin Atlantic also said that it would reroute its upcoming services to India and Pakistan after "the latest situation reports in Afghanistan." Starting Monday, the carrier's flights to the cities of Islamabad, Lahore, Mumbai and New Delhi, which usually fly over Afghanistan, will be diverted to avoid the country's airspace.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York (CNN Business) As Taliban forces seize control in Afghanistan, global news outlets are struggling to stay safe and continue reporting. But local journalists could be at greater risk.

The Committee to Protect Journalists has warned that Afghan journalists face extreme dangers amid the Taliban takeover. On Sunday, the militants took control of the presidential palace in Kabul after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.

Suspected Taliban fighters killed an Afghan radio station manager in Kabul last week, according to Reuters , intensifying fear among journalists in the community.

Afghan journalists, particularly women, are "absolutely petrified," CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward told CNN's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter on "Reliable Sources" Sunday. "They've been doing bold and incredible reporting for many years, and now there's a very real fear that they might face retaliations for that or that certainly they won't be able to do their work anymore."

At least three female Afghan journalists have been murdered this year, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), while one was shot dead by a gunman in December 2020.

With futuristic speed, Afghanistan is being sent back in time, to what is often called a "dark age" of Taliban domination. The Afghan population is bearing witness with digital age tools, which means the heartache and terror is just a click away, filling cell phone screens and TV sets, if the world wants to see.

While there were relatively few sources of video as Kabul fell to the Taliban on Sunday, there were endless posts on social media:

-- When Afghanistan's ousted president Ashraf Ghani fled the country, acting defense minister Bismillah Mohammadi issued a tweet cursing him. Ghani later wrote a post on Facebook to justify his decision.

-- Former president Hamid Karzai also used FB to communicate with citizens. He posted a video message wishing for peace while standing with his daughters.

-- Rumors of the Taliban's presence in Kabul rocketed across social media platforms as journalists posted videos of the US helicopter evacuation effort. Other videos showed traffic jams along major arteries and emptied-out neighborhoods elsewhere.

-- "Pro-Taliban social media accounts showed video clips of what they said were large numbers of insurgents arriving in pickup trucks to provide security for Kabul," the WSJ's Yaroslav Trofimov reported

-- Trofimov also shared one of the most up-close views of the evac from what appeared to be a military helicopter landing zone. He captioned it "The end."

-- Late-night videos from the airport, on Snapchat and other platforms, showed absolute chaos. In one video , people were seen climbing into a US Air Force transport plane. Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi posted pictures from the tarmac.

-- Amna Nawaz of PBS wrote about texting with sources in Kabul who "couldn't get to the airport. They're holed up in what they hope are safe spaces."

-- Beyond Kabul, "Afghan government officials were shown in video footage accepting a handover of power to their Taliban counterparts in several cities," the NYT reported

Sign of the times

Former NYT and WSJ reporter Quentin Hardy, now the head of editorial for Google Cloud, called it a "sign of the times: Choppers on the roof, the president has fled -- and the telecoms are fine. The besieged are interviewed on Internet calls, the insurgents post videos to social media."

When I interviewed Megan Stack four days ago, she predicted this. She said we'd see a ton of "citizen journalism and decontextualized cell phone videos" as the Afghan government crumbled. Phones are the difference-maker since 2001, she said, when there were practically "no computers in Afghanistan."

What remains to be seen: How, if at all, will the proliferation of smart phones and social platforms affect Afghanistan's next chapter? Will the Taliban clamp down on this technology and stop Afghans from telling their own stories? Disturbing stories have already tricked out of some Taliban-controlled provinces. CNN's Sam Kiley has a closer look at what "an Afghanistan under the Taliban look like" in this CNN.com analysis...

It all happened so fast

WaPo's Dan Lamothe wrote : "On Monday, the Washington Post published a scoop that U.S. intelligence officials had revised their assessment of Afghanistan to say that Kabul could fall in 90 days. Some said it could fall in 30. That was six days ago."

The Taliban's seizure of Afghanistan was, many analysts said, shocking but not surprising. It was widely expected, but not so soon. Maybe this was a failure of imagination as well as a failure of American intelligence. When I sat down in the CNN anchor chair just before 11am ET, the international desk moved an URGENT that said "Taliban have entered Kabul." So we began the hour with the news of the Afghan government's collapse. We ended the hour with Kylie Atwood's reporting that the US flag was down at the embassy. It all happened so fast...

Afghan journalists are "absolutely petrified"

That's what Clarissa Ward told me during one of her live reports from Kabul on Sunday. She said Afghan journalists, particularly women, are "absolutely petrified" by the Taliban takeover. "They've been doing bold and incredible reporting for many years, and now there's a very real fear that they might face retaliations for that or that certainly they won't be able to do their work anymore."

While we were speaking live on CNN, I was inundated with emails and tweets from viewers who were worried about Ward's safety. So I asked her about that. She said CNN's crews in Afghanistan are being "exceptionally cautious," and will leave if necessary. But "for so many Afghans, that's simply not an option," she pointed out. "They're here, they have to stay, they have to live with the consequences of this next chapter." Alexis Benveniste has more here...

-- CPJ's Sonali Dhawan reports that the Taliban "invaded the homes of at least two female journalists in Kabul today. One managed to escape, one is unreachable."

-- In a memo to staffers , NYT publisher AG Sulzberger said "we are doing everything we can to try to get our staff, former staff and their families out of harm's way as soon as humanly possible... Please keep our colleagues and their families in your thoughts and prayers."

Newfound anonymity for Afghan women

The Guardian has been publishing astonishing essays by Afghan contributors. This one is by a female resident of Kabul who now insists on anonymity for obvious reasons. On Sunday, she wrote, "all I could see around me were the fearful and scared faces of women and ugly faces of men who hate women, who do not like women to get educated, work and have freedom."

Newfound attention for the "forgotten war"

The US presence in Afghanistan has been a footnote for so long. Too long. Now it's suddenly the top story. As CNN's Nick Paton Walsh observed , "The kind of tragic, urgent attention Afghanistan is getting now is very clearly the result of the spectacular and exhausted inattention it got for about the last 9 years."

I wonder if viewers and readers feel a sort of confused whiplash. Or if they feel anything at all. Kate Brannen of Just Security asked , is this "the first time in 20 years the American public is showing any interest in Afghanistan?"

I said on CNN that I perceived that the American people "accepted" this defeat, so to speak, years ago. I was most struck by what Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War vet and Democratic lawmaker, said on Twitter on Saturday. "What I am feeling and thinking about the situation in Afghanistan, I can never fit on Twitter," he wrote. "But one thing that is definitely sticking out is that I haven't gotten one constituent call about it and my district has a large Veteran population."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hong Kong (CNN Business) China's economic recovery is slowing down — and it's not just the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 that has economists and government officials on alert.

Chinese officials on Monday released new data on industrial production, investment and retail sales for July showing signs of weakness in the economy. Growth in industrial production was the slowest it has been in 11 months, rising by 6.4% from a year ago. Car production was slammed by the global shortage of semiconductors.

Growth in retail sales in July was the weakest it has been all year, while investment in fixed assets also missed economists' expectations.

"The spread of the virus and natural disasters have affected the economy in some regions, and the economic recovery is still unstable and uneven," said Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), at a press conference in Beijing on Monday. Along with the latest coronavirus outbreak, catastrophic flooding swept through central China last month, killing more than 300 people . Widespread damage and disruption has also caused direct economic losses totaling nearly $21 billion, according to government statistics released this month.

The flareup of Covid-19 likely contributed to at least some of the slowdown in retail sales toward the end of July, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Every night before bed, Anushka Sachan whips out her phone to log into an app.

"It kind of becomes a habit," said the 20-year-old Hong Kong University student. "Before sleeping, I'm just like, 'Okay, check in.'"

The platform Sachan is using belongs to a Chinese brand called Shein — pronounced "She In" — which has rapidly attracted a global army of teen fans on TikTok.

The company is a mysterious online shopping upstart that has made headlines recently for surpassingin app downloads in the United States, and creating a cult following for its fast fashion apparel sold all over the world. Some experts even say it's beating stalwarts like Zara and H&M at their own game, by making items more quickly and being more digitally savvy with customers.

"They're making fast fashion look slow," said Erin Schmidt, a senior analyst at Coresight Research, a global advisory and research firm specializing in retail and technology. "They've changed the model."

Sachan checks the Shein app daily for the same reason many others do: to get points. The more you get, the more you can save on purchases. Shein awards them to customers for everything from opening the app to watching live streams and entering outfit design contests.

"It is pretty addictive," said Sachan, describing the experience as similar to playing a mobile game.

Shein's ability to lure users to its platform is one of its main ingredients for success, along with its hyper-fast production process, bargain basement pricing and data-driven product offerings.

"I just stopped buying from H&M when I started using Shein," said Sachan, who often scours the site for new accessories and once scored a necklace for 9 Hong Kong dollars ($1.20).

"Because I was getting the same things that I saw at H&M, but like, for cheaper."

A rising star

Shein was born under a different name — ZZKKO — in China, where it was started in 2008 by Chris Xu. The experience he gained as a marketing and search engine optimization consultant would later prove instrumental in creating the site's powerful algorithm, according to Coresight Research.

At first, the company only sold wedding dresses, said Schmidt. It later branched out to general womenswear, adopting the name "Sheinside." In 2015, the company rebranded again, saying it wanted a name that was easier to remember and search for online.

Fast forward to the pandemic, which has helped Shein generate explosive growth and become one of the few Chinese consumer brands to win global acclaim. As of last October, it was the world's largest online-only fashion company, as measured by sales of goods under the company's own brand, according to Euromonitor International. The research firm declined to provide further information, saying that the finding was part of a proprietary project.

Shein competes with Zara and H&M for customers who want the latest trends for less, and all three companies sell their own branded goods. But the two longtime heavyweights also run brick-and-mortar stores, cater to a wider customer base and sell at slightly higher prices.

Shein's more direct competition comes from the likes of British fast fashion retailers Boohoo and ASOS, which concentrate most of their firepower online, target young female shoppers and tend to offer more affordable items.

In the first half of this year alone, Shein's app racked up more than 81 million downloads around the world. In mid-May, it overtook Amazon as the most installed shopping app in the United States across the App Store and Google Play combined, according to analytics firms App Annie and Sensor Tower.

Amazon has regained its crown, although "daily installs between the two apps since then have largely remained close," said Craig Chapple, a mobile insights strategist of Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Sensor Tower.

In recent months, Shein "has really exploded onto the scene," said Schmidt. "Everybody wants [to know] everything that they possibly can about Shein."

They may be disappointed. For all its success, the company is notoriously reclusive, with little known about its inner workings despite its stature as one of China's most valuable privately-held businesses. As of last August, Shein had a valuation of $15 billion, according to PitchBook. By this summer, that had doubled to as much as $30 billion, with annual revenue reaching $10 billion, Bloomberg reported in June, citing unidentified sources.

Backers of the firm include marquee investors, such as Sequoia Capital China and Tiger Global. Shein declined requests for an interview, and did not respond to a request for comment on specific details for this story. Sequoia and Tiger Global declined requests for an interview.

A tight spot

Shein positions itself firmly as a global business, with an emphasis on distribution: It ships to more than 220 countries or territories. Its website has no mention of its backstory or even where it's based, stating only that it is "an international" firm. In recent months, that has led to some suggestions that the retailer deliberately downplays its Chinese roots amid rising biases and political controversy.

"Given the current climate of geopolitical tensions, it can ... make sense for Chinese entities to lay low," said Matthew Brennan, who writes about Chinese mobile technology and is the founder of research firm China Channel. "They just want to do business. This is something that they don't want to have to deal with. And so I don't think we can blame Shein for taking that option."

The murkiness, however, can be off-putting. Some customers, such as Sachan, have expressed concerns over the firm's lack of transparency around how it produces its goods — and sells them at a low cost — as well as where it sources its materials.

Experts note that the company's approach also makes it difficult to verify its reportedly impressive numbers, though they say that other metrics, such as app downloads, are often solid indicators of a brand's reach, if not sales.

Lightning-fast fashion

Shein has made a name for itself by blitzing social media users with its affordable and trendy clothing catering to young women, including $6 crop tops and $9 minidresses. Similar to Boohoo and ASOS, the company relies heavily on influencer marketing, teaming up with internet stars and celebrities like Katy Perry and Nick Jonas to expand its reach.

The brand is especially popular with Gen Z shoppers on TikTok, where it has become a trend for users to post $1,000 Shein "hauls," or large purchases. That kind of buzz comes on top of Shein's affiliate marketing programs, which reward influencers handsomely for spreading the word about its products.

The company is also savvy about keeping users on its platform. Last September, it held a virtual fashion show exclusively on its app, which likely helped it pick up more users, noted Lexi Sydow, head of marketing insights at App Annie. Grammy-nominated singer Ellie Goulding was among the performers.

"They're just so far ahead in terms of user experience," said Brennan. "They mix together media and entertainment into the experience, and user-generated content and reviews."

One of its key differentiators, however, is a concept that analysts are calling "real-time retail."

They say that Shein has come up with an in-house algorithm that trawls the web — including its own massive customer database — to find out what fashion items are trending on search, and what people are responding to on competitors' websites.

That data is then used by the design team to develop new items, according to experts. Even in the whirlwind of fast fashion, Shein is prolific: It drops as many as 500 fashion products a day, while Boohoo releases that many over a week

Shein has also managed to take advantage of China's manufacturing prowess, allowing it to cut down on lead times significantly. Researchers estimate its production schedule is as short as three to seven days, compared to the average span of three weeks disclosed by players like Zara.

That's because Shein's suppliers use the company's back-end software, allowing them to get immediate information on user clicks and orders, according to experts.

"They've integrated their systems with their factory," said Schmidt. "Based off of what is trending, like, what clicks, what sells, what starts to trend ... the algorithm goes to the factory and says: 'Start ordering material, start producing.' So they've essentially cut out all of the middlemen."

Alibaba BABA Other Chinese players have also invested heavily in smart manufacturing. Last year, for example, rolled out an AI-powered processing system to help small businesses streamline the apparel production process.

Shein is also careful to hedge its bets, only making small batches of each item until demand is proven.

"If a design sells out quickly, Shein places a large order of the product," according to a Coresight Research report . "If it does not sell out quickly, Shein sells the remaining pieces and abandons the design."

There are sustainability concerns. Like other fast fashion retailers, Shein is eschewed by some customers who worry about the environmental impact of its production processes, while others say the prices are too good to pass up. Sachan, for her part, cited considerations about waste and overconsumption as one reason she now tries to shop less on the app, even as she feels compelled to log in each day.

Changing the game

There's one huge market Shein doesn't have a major presence in: mainland China.

The company hardly markets itself in its home country for various reasons, starting with the headache of having to compete with Alibaba, the longtime industry leader.

"It's not lucrative for them to sell in China," said Schmidt. "[And] these products that would seem cheap to us are not as cheap to [consumers] in their home country."

Instead, Shein concentrates on exports, naming Europe, the United States, Australia and the Middle East as key markets. Shein does not publicly break down what its top markets are.

It has recently also seen momentum in Latin America, with app downloads in Brazil skyrocketing 988% in the 12 months to June, compared to the previous year, according to App Annie.

The brand also remains a fan favorite in India, although its platform was booted out of the country last summer amid a crackdown on dozens of apps. Last month, it returned to India through Amazon's Prime Day shopping festival, leading to excitement among customers.

In some ways, Shein's rise could be compared to that of TikTok, according to Brennan, who authored the book "Attention Factory: The Story of TikTok and China's ByteDance."

"I see so many similarities," he said, reflecting on how the short video app was regarded before it became a global sensation.

"It was viewed as something that was just for Gen Z. It was sort of viewed as frivolous entertainment ... I think the competitors were looking at it similarly, and not taking it as seriously as they should have. And I'm sure that platforms like YouTube and Instagram much regret that now."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dan Schulman is the CEO of PayPal. Robert F. Smith is the CEO of private equity firm Vista Equity. Rich Lesser is the CEO of Boston Consulting Group. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.

Amid the national reckoning over racial inequality, corporations and foundations across the country have pledged roughly $11 billion to support causes that promote racial equity. Yet to date, only about half of that promised amount — roughly $5.8 billion — appears to have translated into real investments in the many organizations that are working day in and day out to create lasting change in communities of color. This slow pace of investment must be addressed if we are to successfully tackle the urgent and pervasive challenges before us.

The reasons for the lagging rate of real-world contributions have become increasingly clear. On the one hand, companies have struggled to decide where to funnel their investments given the breadth of the problem and the sheer number of organizations. Companies have also faced difficulties in measuring the success of their commitments in the short term, as results can sometimes take years to come to fruition.

Complicating things further, nonprofits and other organizations have had a difficult time navigating the vast landscape of available resources and making the social connections necessary to obtain funding, according to a recent report . All these issues are compounded by an ingrained mistrust of large corporations in communities that have so often gone overlooked.

To reduce friction, bolster trust and maximize the impact of commitments, corporations should lead the way by developing new models for partnering with groups — and other likeminded companies — that support and promote racial equity.

Here's how:

Take a holistic, long-term approach

Rather than attempting to pinpoint one or two individual causes or groups to support through a one-time investment, companies should take a holistic approach and spread their investments over a range of pressing issues that they plan to champion over several years.

Making long-term commitments to a variety of causes, instead of one-and-done contributions to a select few, provides companies the opportunity to develop meaningful relationships with many different advocacy organizations. It also enables companies to gain a deeper and more complete understanding of how seemingly discrete social justice issues intersect, and, in turn, makes them smarter and more informed sponsors.

Take the racial wealth gap , for example, where the average white family has roughly 10 times greater wealth than the average Black family. A one-off donation to a community development financial institution (CDFI) serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged community might temporarily help some minority business owners and entrepreneurs more easily access capital. But a more holistic approach would be to make additional investments in organizations that solve related problems contributing to the wealth gap — such as disparities in homeownership, which limit generational wealth creation, or inequities in health insurance coverage, which saddle families with steep medical bills and debt.

One example of a holistic approach in action is The Southern Communities Initiative (SCI), which is a consortium of companies we launched earlier this year to tackle some of the most endemic problems facing communities of color in the South, where almost 60% of all Black Americans live.

Together, we're tackling a host of urgent challenges — from a dearth of education and workforce development opportunities, substandard housing, health inequities, the vast gap in access to digital tools, limited access to capital and major physical infrastructure failures.

On the issue of wealth creation, we're partnering with CDFIs to help them secure federal and other funding to better support minority businesses; working with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to address vast racial disparities in education; and we're launching new partnerships with leading organizations across target communities — such as Prosper Birmingham, the Greater Houston Partnership and the Urban League of Louisiana — to facilitate coordination across the southeast region.

Break down silos

It's clear that no one company can solve the most consequential racial justice issues of our time on its own, but too many companies have gotten into the habit of going it alone when it comes to corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Companies should aim to break down these silos and establish partnerships with other companies that share similar CSR goals and principles. This collaborative approach creates opportunities for CSR teams from different companies to collectively bring far more expertise and experience to a joint project. It also makes it possible to tap into each other's networks in the worlds of CSR. For example, one company's CSR team might have worked in a certain geographic region or advocacy area that another company is less familiar with, and vice versa. Bringing those worlds together can go a long way.

At SCI, we're hoping our partnership can provide a blueprint that others can follow. Our three founding companies — PayPal, Vista Equity Partners and Boston Consulting Group — collaborate and seek perspective and guidance from each other on every decision we make. And we're creating opportunities for our nonprofit partners to work together.

Track data metrics

Corporations should establish clearly defined metrics for every project that measure the impact of their racial equity efforts. In the case of expanding access to digital tools, for instance, metrics might include the number of laptops provided or the number of internet subscriptions donated. Corporations should also implement consistent reporting standards, whether that's in the form of a real-time dashboard or quarterly progress report.

At SCI, we are using the data we collect to prepare a racial equity metrics report that tracks the progress we're making on a quarterly basis. We are also implementing an opensource database to monitor and track key stats and metrics so we can see where our efforts are succeeding and where we need to double-down.

This will help in tailoring approaches by region, too. Companies will learn which programs are worthy of investment based on their previous record in delivering change to other communities.

Combatting systemic racism and solving these entrenched problems in our society will not happen overnight, but these issues need to be addressed to bring about a more equitable society. This is a pivotal time to make a lasting difference. Everyone can play a role in turning billions of dollars in commitments into real and lasting improvements.

London (CNN Business) It's a tough moment to predict the future of the travel industry. Just look at Airbnb's stock.

What's happening: The company had a huge second quarter , with revenue soaring nearly 300% as spring and summer bookings jumped. But shares remain almost 30% below the all-time high they hit in February.

Some of the apprehension may come from Airbnb's rich valuation. The home-sharing startup is now worth $96 billion, which Bank of America points out is 13 times the bank's estimates for 2022 revenues.

But the company is also in limbo due to uncertainty about the outlook, a problem made worse by the spreading Delta variant.

Deutsche Bank noted Monday that cases have now been rising globally for eight consecutive weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Australia and China are among countries that have recently tightened restrictions to try to stem a rise in infections.

Airbnb explicitly outlined its concerns in a letter to shareholders that accompanied its latest results.

"In the near term, we anticipate that the impact of Covid-19 and the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus, including the Delta variant, will continue to affect overall travel behavior, including how often and when guests book and cancel," the company said. As a result, it continued, future bookings "will continue to be more volatile and non-linear."

Another warning: The University of Michigan said Friday that its influential consumer sentiment index plunged 13.5% from July to August, hitting a level of 70.2. That's the most bearish reading for the measure since December 2011.

"There is little doubt that the pandemic's resurgence due to the Delta variant has been met with a mixture of reason and emotion," said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.

Hyatt H Step back: The travel industry is still doing its best to plan for the future. announced Sunday that it's buying Apple Leisure for $2.7 billion.

The move is a bet on the future of luxury travel, which has been recovering more rapidly. It will double Hyatt's global resort footprint, and expand the company's presence in Europe by 60%.

Airbnb, meanwhile, is still projecting that third-quarter revenue will be its strongest on record. Long-term stays at its properties by remote workers as the Delta variant delays the return to the office are poised to help its business.

"The company noted several positive trends that could continue post Covid, including longer stays and a growing percentage of bookings for non-traditional travel," Bank of America's analysts wrote in a research note.

Yet the advent of highly infectious coronavirus variants makes it hard to say with confidence whether a strong summer season will continue into the fall — dampening investors' enthusiasm.

China's economic recovery is slowing down

China's economic recovery is losing steam — and it's not just the spread of the Delta variant that has economists and government officials on alert, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.

The latest: Chinese officials on Monday released new data on industrial production, investment and retail sales for July showing signs of weakness in the economy.

Growth in industrial production was the slowest it's been in 11 months, rising by 6.4% from a year ago. Car production was slammed by the global shortage of semiconductors.

Remember: Along with the latest coronavirus outbreak, catastrophic flooding swept through central China last month, killing more than 300 people. Widespread damage and disruption has also caused direct economic losses totaling nearly $21 billion, according to government statistics released this month.

Investor insight: The data triggered a fallback in global stocks Monday, ending a 10-day winning streak for shares in Europe. Big global banks have already slashed growth forecasts for the third quarter in China and revised down full-year estimates.

But when India announced its coronavirus lockdown in March 2020 — the toughest in the world at the time— his companyundertook the enormous challenge of enabling hundreds of thousands of employees to work from home almost overnight.

Simply figuring out how to ship office equipment was a tough task. "So the first and foremost thing was working with the government to say, 'Allow us to run trucks by which we will be able to move things to our employees,'" Subramaniam, the COO of TCS, told CNN Business.

"We had to go and talk to our customers and get their nod as well, because contractually, we are expected to perform the work only from an approved location," Subramaniam said.

TCS employs more than 500,000 people. It declined to reveal how many of them are based in India, but it says it is the country's largest private employer. And like most other large companies in Asia's third largest economy, TCS had hardly ever experimented with remote work before the pandemic.

But within three weeks of India's lockdown taking effect last year, 96% of TCS staff were working remotely. The company says the model has worked so well that it never wants to go back.

The company, which has a stock market value of $166 billion, now predicts that by 2025, no more than 25% of its employees will need to work from the office. Rival IT services firm Infosys, which employees over 250,000 people, is also planning to switch to a hybrid model after the pandemic.

That kind of shift could have major implications not just for India's massive IT industry, but the country's entire economy.

Productivity and sustainability

But, companies have been surprised by the positive impact working from home has had on efficiency and the diversity of the workforce. In some large enterprises, the number of women in leadership roles has Before the pandemic many Indian bosseswere suspicious of remote working because of productivity concerns, recruiters told CNN Business. But, companies have been surprised by the positive impact working from home has had on efficiency and the diversity of the workforce. In some large enterprises, the number of women in leadership roles has risen significantly during the pandemic —thanks to the flexibility provided.

TCS believes it can boost productivity by 25% by embracing more remote work, Subramaniam said.

"Many of our employees feel that they have found a solution to their work-life balance," he added. "So, when you are happy, naturally, your productivity is better."

Like the rest of the Indian economy, TCS suffered in the months following the 2020 lockdown, as its net profit slumped nearly 14% in the June quarter, compared to the same time in 2019.

But profits have started to bounce back. Last month, TCS reported a 32% jump in net income in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same time last year.

"Every commitment that we made to our customers ... was executed," Subramaniam said, adding that even while working remotely, the firm added nearly 60 new clients and hired nearly 45,000 people.

The company also hopes to contribute to a cleaner environment by working more from home.

cities — including Mumbai, where TCS is headquartered. According to a paper by think tank India has some of the world's most congestedcities — includingMumbai, where TCS is headquartered. According to a paper by think tank IDFC Institute , an average Mumbai resident "wastes 11 days a year stuck in traffic." Most of the world's top 30 polluted cities are also located in India.

TCS believes that having most of its employees work remotely could reduce its global carbon footprint by 70% by 2025, compared to a decade earlier.

"The environment has become a lot cleaner" already over the last year, said Subramaniam.

"We are getting some new neighbors," he added. "I'm seeing birds that I've not seen in my life."

Infosys — which after TCS is the second largest IT company in India — said most of its employees want to switch to a hybrid model. The company plans to have two-thirds of its staff in the office at any given point — on a rotation basis — while the remainder can work from home, according to Richard Lobo, head of human resources at Infosys.

Unlike TCS, Infosys does not have a timeline for implementing its plan yet, but Lobo does not see the company returning to its old way of functioning. "I sincerely hope we don't go back fully," he told CNN Business. "If we go back, we would have lost all the learnings of remote [work]," he added.

The office economy

Should working from home become standard practice for even more major Indian employers, some recruiters and government officials warn that kind of migration away from the office could have serious consequences for other industries.

"It is not particularly good news for infrastructure companies, and other business sectors, such as travel and food, which flourish when people work from offices," said Aditya Mishra, founder of staffing agency Ciel HR Services. He added that such a shift could affect the livelihoods of janitors, florists, security guards, electricians and others who depend on people committing to office life.

In America as well, local economies are struggling as more people choose working from home. When employees commute to offices, they spend on everything from train tickets to lattes, and that kind of economic activity is essential for service-based sectors.

Subramaniam of TCS acknowledged that the concern about mass remote work is a "valid point," because for every IT job that is created in the country, four to five other jobs — in sectors ranging from food delivery to transport — are also created.

Small towns may benefit

A more widespread shift to a working from home model could also lead to redistribution of wealth in other ways, according to Mishra, the recruiter.

If executives can perform high-paying IT jobs from a wider variety of locations, that may "improve quality of life in smaller towns in India," he said.

A fundamental shift in where a company's workforce is based, though, may require companies to reconsider things like pay and benefits offered to their employees.

"We've got to think through all of this," said Subramaniam, when asked whether people would be paid the same if they worked in a smaller city, rather than in places like Mumbai or Bangalore.

Mishra also believes that other IT rivals may suffer when it comes to "attracting good talent," if they do not offer the kind of flexibility that TCS is planning.

But investors looking for cryptocurrency exposure through an ETF have another option: a new mining ETF that debuted Tuesday.

Investment firm Viridi Funds launched a fund that plans to focus on companies with ties to the business of mining bitcoin — the process of solving complex mathematical puzzles with fancy hardware to generate new bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies

So the Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol of RIGZ , will primarily own North American mining companies and other tech firms with ties to cryptocurrencies that aren't using as much electricity.
