By trade, I’m an omnivore. The only food rule I follow is that I eat everything, because anything can lead to deliciousness. Maybe it’s goat meat on the bone, cooked low and slow and served in a dark pool of its own cooking juices. Maybe it’s a bloomy wheel of cheese made from cashew milk, dense and creamy in the middle. If it’s good, I want it, and then I want seconds.

But when I cook at home, what I want more and more of is vegetables. Right now, this instant, I want long, skinny tongues of charred eggplant dressed in soy sauce and maple syrup, over rice. I want bright tomato pulp puréed with bread and olive oil, right from the lip of the bowl. I want a big pile of lettuce leaves filled with Hetty McKinnon’s sweet and spicy tofu larb.

When the weather cools down? I want a hot pot of winter greens and chewy noodles in miso broth. I want my favorite toor dal with whole boiled peanuts. I want sweet-edged, wrinkly roasted root vegetables over heaps of cheesy polenta, swimming in olive oil.

I don’t know exactly when my appetite became so intensely focused on vegetarian foods in my own kitchen. It happened slowly, then all at once, like a custard thickening on the stovetop. I revised my food shopping, and my home cooking followed, branching out and expanding. I went back to old, favorite cookbooks that included meat and fish only occasionally, or not at all, like “River Cafe Cook Book Green,” by Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers, and “Classic Indian Vegetarian Cookery,” by Julie Sahni.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There are ample signs that a resurgence has begun. Tables are packed at restaurants and bars across the city. Many places have expanded their capacity with new outdoor seating, thanks to the city’s Open Streets and Open Restaurant programs.

“It feels like every day is a weekend,” said Simone Tong, the chef of Silver Apricot, in the West Village. “The energy is back.”

With commercial retail rents in New York City at record lows, some restaurants are signing new leases. There have been 1,713 new restaurant permit applications from Jan. 1 through July 2, according to figures from the city health department (which also include renewals for existing restaurants).

Still, in 2019, the number of applications for roughly that same period was 2,388, and many owners say they’re a long way from the old normal.

“People think that because restaurants are allowed to be at 100 percent, and when they go into the restaurants, they’re full, that everything is fine,” said Jeffrey Bank, the chief executive of Alicart Restaurant Group, which owns Carmine’s and Virgil’s Real Barbecue. “And clearly it is not.”

The damage the pandemic has already done is coming into focus. Just before the state shut down indoor dining in March 2020, New York had more than 27,000 restaurants, according to the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The department doesn’t yet have current figures, but Yelp, which tracks restaurant openings, shows there are now about 2,000 fewer. The city had 173,500 restaurant employees in June, a 38 percent drop from the 280,000 who were working in December 2019, according to the New York State Department of Labor.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Starches — legumes, tubers, grains, to name a few — are a motley bunch. But one thing they share is how they strike a delicate balance between firm and plump, and, well, dried out or mealy when cooked. One starch, though, is sturdy enough to withstand a little overcooking and can be prepared at any stage of ripeness: the gloriously versatile plantain.

Maximizing plantains’ qualities requires treating them slightly differently when they’re green and firm, and when they’re spotted yellow and black. In each form, they’re easy to work with and hard to ruin. Plantain-loving cooks among us know that you can use them in all manner of ways: in savory soups and stews, as a side dish to proteins, and as vessels for dips and sauces.

Plantains and bananas have similar appearances, and their names are sometimes used interchangeably. In fact, plantains are occasionally referred to as “cooking bananas.” But to call a plantain a banana is a bit of an oversimplification.

Think of plantains as a subcategory of banana. They’re genetically similar, thanks to selective propagation over thousands of years. And, like bananas, plantains grow in tropical and subtropical climates across the globe, ensuring that they are always in season and making them a crucial ingredient in cuisines across West Africa, South and Central America, India and the Caribbean. But the main differences between the two are that plantains are starchier than bananas, not as easily peeled and usually not eaten raw. Rather, they shine when cooked.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The three were also made with entirely different grapes. The Broc was primarily valdigué, a variety once called “Napa gamay” in California, along with some zinfandel and trousseau. The Tiberio was made entirely of montepulciano, while the Trinquevedel was a blend of Southern Rhône grapes, including 60 percent grenache, 18 percent cinsault, 5 percent syrah, 5 percent mourvèdre and, interestingly, 12 percent clairette, a white grape.

This blend might seem to account for its garnet color. While some basic rosés are indeed made by blending a little red wine with a white, the small percentage of clairette in the blend argues against the method.

Instead, as has been traditional in the Southern Rhône, the white is used in a red blend to add freshness. As with the other two wines, the color was achieved by macerating the red grapes with their skins just long enough to reach the desired shades.

Beyond color, origin and production, the wines differed quite a bit. The Broc was bone dry, lightly spicy, tangy and fresh. It was just 11 percent alcohol, the kind of wine you could drink for refreshment at the beach or by the pool. This fit in well with the popular conception of rosés as simple, easygoing wines, although I would say the Broc was a superb example.

The Trinquevedel was entirely different. It was rich and powerful at 14.2 percent alcohol, with a floral aroma. On the palate it was more earthy and mineral than fruity, with depth and dimension.

The Tiberio was likewise bigger and more serious than the Broc at 14 percent alcohol, but with more acidity than the Trinquevedel. It seemed to combine tangy, juicy flavors of red fruits with a chalky minerality.

I felt as if I could offer all three wines at a single dinner party. The Broc would be the aperitif, with hors d’oeuvres. The Tiberio could go with the midcourse. It was light enough for shellfish yet juicy enough to stand up to something heartier, like roast chicken. Meanwhile, the Trinquevedel seemed sturdy enough for a veal roast or Umbrian-style rabbit or chicken alla cacciatora.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Pekin’s importance to this community was evident on July 20, when about 100 people gathered in the alley behind the restaurant to honor Mr. Wong. The memorial, long delayed because of Covid, began with a ceremony renaming the alley Danny Wong Way.

J.P. Gallagher, the chief executive of Butte and Silver Bow County (at right in top photo), said in his dedication that he couldn’t recall the first time he ate at the Pekin. “My dad brought me up here when I was still being carried by my mom,” he said. “But I remember the very first time I stuck my hand into the hot mustard.”

Many of the well-wishers who attended the ceremony and after-party were back at the Pekin when it reopened the following night. A line formed in the hallway for one of the coveted orange-walled booths — a regular occurrence since the restaurant fully resumed indoor dining in June, said Shannon Parr (below), a veteran server. “Ever since Danny’s passing, it’s been crazy busy,” she said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In a twinkling black dress with feathery sleeves and high heels, Paris Hilton is in the kitchen making a steak dinner with her mother and sister. Before they arrive, she digs a spoon into a tin of caviar and gives a bite to her dog. Flakes of 23-karat gold stick on her fingers as she adds it to homemade truffle butter.

“It’s not the most practical cooking outfit, but I like to cook in style,” she says as the feathers from her outfit drift all over the kitchen counter.

Ms. Hilton doesn’t pretend to know how to cook. On “Cooking With Paris,” her new six-episode cooking series on Netflix, she’s not afraid to make messy mistakes. The program is the latest in a recent wave of cooking shows, like “Selena + Chef” and “Amy Schumer Learns to Cook,” hosted by celebrities who lack culinary experience.

“I love cooking,” Ms. Hilton says in the introduction to her show, which was released in full on Wednesday. “But I’m not a trained chef, and I’m not trying to be.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Roosevelt Island, which perfectly but rather anonymously bisects the East River, has been home to a number of hospitals over the years. Soon, however, it will dispense a different kind of medicine.

Graduate Roosevelt Island, which opened in June and is the only hotel on the island, will in mid-August open Panorama Room, a sprawling, glass-enclosed cocktail lounge on its 18th floor. The high-ceilinged space has 168 seats and a huge red-marble bar with stools on all sides. It also has views that — even in a city that specializes in views — can safely be called unique. The Queensboro Bridge looms over the north side of the bar. The southern vista takes in Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan and a good length of the East River and all its boat traffic.

“We wanted to create the idea of a lighthouse up here,” said Med Abrous, a New York native and Los Angeles hospitality entrepreneur who, with his partner Marc Rose, runs the bar. “Your connectivity to the water is undeniable.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ms. Nelson represents one part of an increasingly visible community. While many younger Black people didn’t grow up going to the woods to “shop,” they have learned about lesser-known fruits such as serviceberries and the common cold remedy burdock root through books or the internet.

Whether they’re herbalists, Great Migration grandbabies in search of Southern roots, shoppers slashing their food budgets, the only Black kid who went to 4-H camp back in the day, or home cooks who want to dazzle guests with a backyard-berry crostata, they’re often contending with conflicted histories of disconnection from the land — and a present in which they don’t always find nature a sanctuary.

The idea that Black people just don’t do the outdoors developed over time and centuries of dispossession, said Justin Robinson. An ethnobotanist, farmer and cultural historian in Durham, N.C., he rejects the term “foraging” and its practice as anything new to Black Americans and humans in general. He believes the word separates the world into a disturbing cultivated-versus-wild binary that doesn’t reflect reality.

“It’s just what we do,” he said. “It’s life!”

Mr. Robinson links his love of the land and his work to the warm childhood years he spent following his two farmer grandfathers and the adult years he spent unconsciously replicating one of their gardens. But he knows that Black American history is also a series of profound land-related ruptures, starting with enslavement and forced agricultural labor on territory inhabited by — and taken from — Native peoples. The slave master’s meager rations turned the enslaved into naturalists out of both necessity and opportunity.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Chicken is easily the most searched for ingredient on New York Times Cooking, and it stands to reason: It’s economical, it’s widely available, it’s better for the climate than other meats. And it’s endlessly adaptable, a blank canvas for all sorts of preparations and vibrant, delicious seasonings. In the cold weather months, that means cozy soups, braises and burnished roasts. But in the summer, grilling becomes the method of choice, as it gets you out of a hot kitchen, and adds a layer of fire-kissed flavor and texture to the otherwise mild-mannered meat. You can always salt the dickens out of chicken, grill it well and get tasty results, but if you’re looking for something a bit more exciting, here are 13 of our favorite grilled chicken recipes that will keep you busy and full through September.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As long as the restaurant business is examining its assumptions about the way it operates, maybe it is time to ask whether experience in famous kitchens is overrated.

The thought has been on my mind since I started eating at Cadence, a vegan restaurant in the East Village. The chef is Shenarri Freeman, and Cadence is the first professional kitchen she has run. Her longest stretch as a cook was the four years she spent working at a nightclub in Washington that is better known for the musicians it books. In 2019, Ms. Freeman, a vegan, enrolled in a new program for “plant-based, nutrition-minded cooking” at the Institute of Culinary Education. This spring, shortly before she graduated, she opened Cadence, one of 10 eating and drinking places owned by Ravi DeRossi’s Overthrow Hospitality group.

Like the others, Cadence keeps a vegan kitchen. Ideas are laced throughout the menu, including ideas about whether soul food dishes that traditionally wallow in animal fats by the bucketful can be made without them, and whether lasagna can be called Southern. But there’s nothing cerebral about the experience of eating at Cadence. When I am there, I tend to sit and wonder what would happen if I requested recipes for everything on the menu.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Red blends are popular right now, and I’m not speaking of classical blends like Bordeaux, Châteauneuf-du-Pape or Chianti.

When people refer to red blends today, they are generally using a marketing term for popular category of mass-market red wines, often quite sweet, that happen to blend several red grapes.

Rarely, however, do we think of white blends. Possibly that’s because the most popular mass-market whites are all varietal wines, including chardonnay, pinot grigio, sauvignon blanc and moscato.

Even more discerning wine consumers tend to think of varietal whites, whether the rieslings of Germany, the chardonnays of Burgundy or the chenin blancs of Vouvray. The classic white blends may not be as numerous or as illustrious as among reds, but I can think of plenty.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cuong Pham, the founder and chief executive of Red Boat, a Bay Area company, wants customers to use its fish sauce for pastas and vinaigrettes, not just in East Asian dishes. But because it is usually placed in the ethnic aisle, he said, it limits perceptions of the ingredient’s uses.

Mr. Pham said the aisle seems to exist more for those looking to find ingredients new to them than for the communities whose cuisines are represented there.

That aligns with the ethnic aisle’s original purpose: to serve returning World War II soldiers who had tasted foods from countries like Italy, Germany and Japan while abroad. But while many of the European foods eventually migrated out of the section, most of the foods from other parts remained. (Conversely, some grocery stores in countries like France and Colombia have “American” aisles, with products like peanut butter, mayonnaise, boxed cake mix and barbecue sauce.)

Errol Schweizer, who was the vice president of grocery at Whole Foods Market from 2009 to 2016, said the ethnic aisle is part of “a legacy of white supremacy and colonialism” built into the framework of the grocery business — starting with the low wages paid to hourly workers, who are often people of color, and the lack of diversity among store buyers.

He said he and other employees frequently talked about eliminating the ethnic aisle at Whole Foods; but they couldn’t persuade the company to make such a major overhaul.

That didn’t stop them from making sure every aisle — not just the ethnic one — included diverse flavors and ingredients, he added, or from improving the section, known as the “global flavors aisle,” by increasing the variety of countries represented and finding more purveyors of color.

A spokeswoman for Whole Foods said, “The same brand may have some products grouped for meal building in our global flavors aisles and other products with salty snacks, cookies, or in our specialty department,” and added that the goals of the strategy are to “provide customers with ideas for using the product and to make it easy to find.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Vietnamese rice cake known as banh chung is typically begun at least a day in advance, by soaking sticky rice in water. The next day, a large green leaf is spread with the successive layers that will make up the cake: some soaked rice, cooked mung beans, marinated pork and finally more rice. This is wrapped in the leaf and tied into a neat bundle that will be boiled as long as necessary; several hours is not unusual.

As the banh chung cooks, the flavor of the leaf (phrynium in Vietnam, usually banana in the United States) and the filling will travel so that the outer rice will taste leafier and the inner rice will be meatier. The recipe, said to have been revealed to a Hung dynasty prince in a dream, is customary in Vietnamese homes during the Lunar New Year. It is made outside the holiday, too, but banh chung is not likely to appear on anyone’s list of the top 10 fast weeknight dinners.

It is, though, a staple on the menu of Banh Vietnamese Shop House, on the Upper West Side. The two versions there, one with pork and one without, are carved into slabs and fried, a treatment often accorded to leftover rice cakes. This may well push the banh chung timeline into a third day.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“High on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America,” the Netflix show that explores the roots of African American cuisine, has been renewed for a second season, the streaming service announced Tuesday.

Hosted by the food writer Stephen Satterfield, the show is based on “High on the Hog: A Culinary Journey From Africa to America,” a book by the culinary historian Dr. Jessica B. Harris. The first season, which premiered in May, mirrored the first half of the book, tracing the roots of ingredients, like okra from West Africa, and exploring Black foodways in places like Texas.

Fabienne Toback, an executive producer on the show, said that the new season would likely explore the second half of Dr. Harris’s book. The show will continue to focus on systemic racism and could explore the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on race and the restaurant industry, Ms. Toback said. Release and production dates are still to be determined.

“Part of the reason that we were so attracted to the project is that everyone eats, everyone loves food,” said Ms. Toback, who produced the show with Karis Jagger. Ms. Toback added that “High on the Hog” has opened viewers’ eyes to the history of Black food and the challenging circumstances that brought ingredients to the United States.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WHAT DO YOU FEED A KING, dulled to every luxury beyond want? In the city-state of Venice in 1574, the young Henry III, then king of Poland and en route to becoming king of France, was welcomed with a banquet, just another in the hundreds of his life. But when he reached for his napkin, it shattered, a handful of dust. The whole setup was fake — the drape of tablecloth, the platters and knives. All were molded out of a powdered sugar paste likely made with rose and orange blossom water and tragacanth, a resin from a plant indigenous to the Middle East and Asia: the yields of trade and Western expansion. A year before, Venice had ended a war with the Ottoman Empire by grudgingly ceding Cyprus, the site of its cane plantations, and the price of sugar was high. To waste so much of it was a show of power. It hardly mattered, then, that this was a feast of nothing, too sweet to eat. The pleasure lay in the surprise, the beautiful lie.

For centuries, the West has delighted in the treachery of food in disguise, from the intricate sotelties of the Middle Ages, presented to aristocrats between dinner courses — a pastry stag, say, with an arrow in its side, which when plucked let loose a gush of bloodlike claret — to the grand edible monuments and landscapes erected for public festivals in Italy in the 16th through 18th centuries, with swooping arches of bread and cheese crowned by suckling pigs and mock trees hung with fruit and haunches of game. Part of the entertainment was inviting the public to ransack the displays and scrabble for mouthfuls among the ruins, while nobles of the court applauded from afar: a literal hunger games. These fever dreams were meant to evoke the mythic Land of Cockaigne, a utopia that first entered European literature around the 13th century, where custard rained down from the sky, roofs were tiled in bacon and garlic-roasted geese and stewed larks, tasting of cloves and cinnamon, flew straight into your mouth — where no one, highborn or low, had to suffer to make a living to ease their hunger. It was a fantasy of abundance at a time when, for much of the population, food was no certainty. (Inevitably, a disapproving tone crept in, and by the 16th century, Cockaigne was a cautionary tale of gluttony and sloth.)

Centuries later, we’re still mesmerized by these little duplicities, the more so in our compulsively visual culture, where food is increasingly consumed without actual eating, experienced through a screen. Between or even in lieu of meals, we sate ourselves on the theater of ever-proliferating TV cooking shows while trawling Instagram for brightly staged still lifes of brimming-over burgers and neon macarons. This disembodiment was exacerbated during the pandemic, when many restaurants were forced to shut down and dining with anyone beyond immediate family — eating as occasion, as opposed to mere sustenance — all but ceased. What a happy distraction, then, when last summer, BuzzFeed’s Tasty shared a video on Twitter that opened on a close-up of a knife looming over a red Croc sandal with its bulbous toe box. There was barely a moment for the viewer to register the banality of the shoe before the knife, wielded by a black-gloved hand, cut it brusquely in half, revealing layers of yellow and pink cake.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.

Newsletters have a history even longer than newspapers, and email is several decades older than the web. Despite this lengthy pedigree, email newsletters are having a very buzzy moment — and here at The New York Times, we’re striving to bring even more depth, ambition and scale to our lineup.

This summer marks 20 years since The Times published its first newsletters. We started off in 2001 covering technology, books and finance, among other topics. Some of those newsletters are still thriving, in various incarnations, as part of a portfolio that reaches some 15 million people every week — a number that has surged over the last two years. Flagships such as The Morning and DealBook serve as a destination for readers and a crucial gateway and guide to our journalism, while offering original reporting and analysis.

As the editorial director of Times newsletters, I’ve been thinking with my colleagues about what comes next. How can we break new ground in the inbox and deliver sophisticated coverage of the topics that our readers care about most?

Newsletters are already a core part of our subscriber experience: Nearly half of our subscribers engage with a newsletter every week. This week, we’re pulling back the curtain on a new kind of Times journalism: more than 15 newsletters that will be available only to our subscribers. The goal is to continue developing the inbox as a destination for our journalism, and to add value to a Times subscription.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Todos los centros de investigación que participaron en el proyecto estudiaban los índices metabólicos con un método considerado como el criterio de referencia: el agua doblemente marcada (DLW, por su sigla en inglés). Este método consiste en medir las calorías que se queman mediante el seguimiento de la cantidad de dióxido de carbono que exhala una persona durante sus actividades diarias.

Los investigadores también contaban con datos como la altura y el peso de los participantes, así como de su porcentaje de grasa corporal, lo que les permitió observar los índices metabólicos fundamentales. Por supuesto, una persona de menor tamaño quemará menos calorías que una más grande pero el grupo se preguntó si, al controlar el tamaño y el porcentaje de grasa, sus metabolismos presentaban diferencias.

“Estaba claro que no sabíamos cómo influye el tamaño del cuerpo en el metabolismo ni cómo influye el envejecimiento en el metabolismo”, aseveró Pontzer. “Son aspectos básicos fundamentales que uno pensaría que se solucionaron hace cien años”.

Una de las conclusiones principales es que, en todas las personas, el metabolismo es distinto en cuatro etapas diferentes de la vida.

— En la infancia y hasta el año de edad, la quema de calorías alcanza su punto máximo y se acelera hasta un 50 por ciento por encima del índice de los adultos.

— A continuación, desde el primer año hasta los 20, el metabolismo se ralentiza de manera gradual en alrededor de un 3 por ciento al año.

— De los 20 a los 60 años, se mantiene estable.

— Y, a partir de los 60, disminuye un 0,7 por ciento al año.

Una vez que los investigadores calcularon el tamaño del cuerpo y la masa muscular de las personas, tampoco encontraron diferencias entre hombres y mujeres.

Como era de esperarse, aunque los patrones del índice metabólico se mantienen para la población, varían entre las personas. Algunas tienen índices metabólicos un 25 por ciento por debajo de la media para su edad y otras tienen índices un 25 por ciento más altos de lo esperado. Sin embargo, estos valores atípicos no modifican el patrón general, que se refleja en los gráficos que muestran la trayectoria de los índices metabólicos a lo largo de los años.

Los cuatro periodos de la vida metabólica representados en el nuevo trabajo muestran que “no hay un índice constante de gasto energético por kilo”, señaló Redman. El índice depende de la edad. Esto va en contra de las suposiciones que ella y otros miembros de la comunidad científica de la nutrición han mantenido durante mucho tiempo.
