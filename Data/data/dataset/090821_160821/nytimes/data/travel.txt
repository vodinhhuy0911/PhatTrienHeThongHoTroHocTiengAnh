South Wales, Wales

“ You’re in a place set apart. ”

Over the last 20 years I’ve traveled to South Wales about seven or eight times with my wife, and later our children, to visit family in a town near Swansea called Mumbles. (The name is a corruption of the French word for “breasts.”) It sits at the edge of the Gower Peninsula — a beautiful wild place that offers expansive beaches, medieval castles, hilltop trails, horses that graze near Stone Age ruins and picture-book villages with friendly pubs serving Sunday roasts and local ales in dark-wood booths.

Mumbles is homey and welcoming, yet we never saw tourists there. The roads are so small and narrow that getting from one place to another feels like it’s much farther than you actually travel.

Punctuated by weddings, births, graduations, anniversaries and deaths, our trips represented different stages in our lives. But each trip also seemed less like a visit to relatives in the old country than an escape to a secret, beautiful place that only we knew.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A light rain fell as I fought through a sea of masked fighters for a glimpse into the center ring. From a few feet away, I watched as two local fighters struck at each other with their bare fists.

Thousands of spectators stood in the stadium bleachers surrounding the fighting pit, their eyes following every move. Cheers erupted when one of the fighters was struck down in one clean blow. Bleeding from his lip, the winner threw his fists in the air celebrating victory before embracing his opponent in a hug.

It was Christmas Day, and high in the Peruvian Andes, the annual Andean fighting festival known as the Takanakuy was underway.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Leafy, informal and eager to chat, Chapel Hill regularly ranks among the best places to live in the United States, and a visit that concentrates on the downtown area, the university campus and neighboring Carrboro — so close that it feels like an extension of Chapel Hill — quickly reveals why.

Downtown Chapel Hill

Franklin Street, Chapel Hill’s main drag, has a few notable mainstays, including the homey, wood-paneled Carolina Coffee Shop and Sutton’s Drug Store, a diner-cum-pharmacy that has a devoted local following; both establishments have been around for nearly a century.

A number of other shops and cafes have come and gone over the years, but one recent arrival seems likely to stick around: Epilogue Books Chocolate Brews, which opened in 2019 and is already expanding (109 East Franklin Street, Suite 100). An independent, Latinx-owned bookstore and cafe, Epilogue offers a curated selection of books, including from local authors, L.G.B.T.Q. authors and authors of color — with plenty of handwritten staff recommendations to help you make your choice. Take a break at the on-site cafe, which serves up fresh pastries, empanadas and churros, as well as high-end coffees, teas and thick Mexican hot chocolate. You can either sit in the colorful front seating area under the gaze of Frida Kahlo or grab a table on the sidewalk outside. The new section of the store, which will sell used books, is scheduled to open this summer.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The impact of the current fires is uneven across the Western states. Tourism boards have tried to communicate this to potential visitors who may be deterred by news reports.

Allison Keeney, a spokeswoman for Travel Oregon, the state’s tourism commission, said that “wildfires in one location often have no impact outside a limited area and rarely cause major travel disruptions. This is the case with the fires happening right now, which are located in remote wildland areas.” She added that the state has implemented tools visitors can use to track air quality before or during their stay.

In Washington, the scenic Walla Walla Valley “has seen very minimal, if any, tourism impact from smoke related to fires,” said Justin Yax, a spokesman for the area’s tourism board.

“If anything, the Walla Walla Valley has seen an uptick in visitation in recent years when other popular wine regions were dealing with the effects of wildfires and smoke,” he said, referring to California’s Sonoma, Napa and Santa Barbara counties, which in recent years have been hit hard by fire.

But in the Methow Valley, which is also a tourism reliant region, two nearby fires have prompted an evacuation in several towns. The mayor of Winthrop, Wash., called the fires “a season-ending event for tourism” at a community meeting in July.

After Sun Mountain Lodge evacuated its current guests, the resort called those with upcoming reservations to encourage them to rebook for later in the year and blacked out availability online through Aug. 31. The resort is temporarily closed.

In Montana, Maria Caputo, the manager of Lamplighter Cabin & Suites in the state’s capital of Helena, said that she’s had numerous guests call to cancel their reservations this month because of the smoke.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@We watched in silence as the two orangutans, a mother and her child, prepared themselves for an encroaching rainstorm.

While the air grew thicker, the mother — whom the local guides had nicknamed Minah — led her child toward the canopy and into a nest she had built earlier that day. Then, collecting vines and leaves, she wove an umbrella out of the foliage and held it devotedly over her daughter.

Thunder shook the ground, spooking a pair of giant hornbills, who honked indignantly. The haunting call of gibbons echoed across the canopy.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Making things even more complex is the fact that the rules frequently change. In Spain, nighttime curfews banning people from being outside between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. were reintroduced in some spots last week, including Barcelona.

“If you’ve come here to party then it could be disappointing, but if you are here for the food, beaches and cultural activities then the restrictions don’t really affect you,” said Mallory Hill, 37, a banker from Seattle, who is traveling around the Catalonian region for the next two weeks with family.

“What’s scary is how quickly the cases are going up here and the trend of vaccinated people getting sick. But there’s also a lot of misinformation and conflicting advice so it’s hard to decide whether we should stay or go all the way back home,” she said. “It looks pretty bad everywhere.”

Even some official advice can be contradictory. On July 26, the U.S. State Department issued a series of “do not travel” advisories for Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Britain because of a rising number of coronavirus cases in those countries, raising the warning level to a 4, the highest. But just days after that warning, the British government announced that fully vaccinated Americans could visit without having to quarantine.

Visiting Britain can also be challenging, because it uses a complex “traffic light” system that determines restrictions based on which country you are traveling from. The list also changes every three weeks, or earlier, depending on the status of the coronavirus in each destination.

So while Americans coming straight from the United States don’t have to quarantine, if they first visit France, they would be required to quarantine for 10 days and take multiple tests because of concerns over the prevalence of the Beta variant in that country.

Going from Britain to the countries of the European Union isn’t any easier. A growing number of countries in the bloc have imposed additional measures for travelers from Britain, including PCR tests and quarantine, because of the high rate of the Delta variant in Britain. All visitors traveling from Britain to Italy must present a negative Covid-19 test before departure, quarantine for five days upon arrival, and present another negative test at the end of their isolation period.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In June, the European Union officially recommended its member countries reopen their borders to American tourists after more than a year of tight restrictions. The United Kingdom also placed the United States on an “amber” list, and on July 28, said fully vaccinated travelers from the U.S. would be allowed entry to England and Scotland without quarantining upon arrival starting Aug. 2.

But residents of Europe’s Schengen area — spanning 29 countries, city-states and micro-states — as well as those in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are still barred from traveling to the United States, unless they are a U.S. citizen or they spend 14 days before arrival in a country that is not on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s prohibited list. Certain family members are also exempt.

The restrictions were first put in place in March 2020. Although President Donald J. Trump briefly ordered an end to the ban on European travelers during his last week in office, President Biden quickly rescinded the move.

Discussions about when to resume inbound travel have been opaque. In late June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was too soon to say when the United States would lift travel curbs for European Union citizens.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@So-called “Freedom Day” in Britain, which last Monday marked the government’s lifting of all remaining coronavirus requirements, was a far cry from the blithe liberty that many locked-down British residents had dreamed of for the past year. Nearly 40,000 new coronavirus cases were recorded in the 24 hours before the anticipated day, while hundreds of thousands of people received a notification on a government tracing app, asking them to self-isolate for 10 days because of possible exposure to the virus.

On the same day, vaccinated Britons who had escaped across the English Channel to France, to enjoy new privileges of quarantine-free travel, were abruptly informed that they would have to self-isolate when they returned home, regardless of their vaccination status. It was the second time British authorities had swiftly reversed course: In June, just weeks after letting British travelers freely travel to Portugal without quarantining upon their return, they changed the rules because of concerns about the prevalence of the Delta variant. Thousands of British residents rushed to Portuguese airports trying to get back home before the quarantine rule went back into effect.

Now the chaos of the past week has left many people in Britain feeling anxious, overwhelmed and confused over how to spend the rest of their summer. Travel operators and industry professionals are also exasperated at the constant uncertainty after more than a year of unprecedented job and revenue losses.

“It’s obvious that this government doesn’t want anyone to travel abroad, so they’ve made the system as unpredictable, stressful and confusing as possible so that people are left with no choice but to stay put,” said Penelope Stenham, an interior designer from London who specializes in vacation home design in Spain and Portugal.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The problem with the map is that case counts are changing rapidly and may surge in your local community before the map has changed colors. Even if you’re certain you’re living in a highly vaccinated community with very low case counts, it makes sense to consider the case counts and vaccination rates in nearby communities as well, because people — and viruses — cross state and county boundaries all the time.

Most experts agree that you don’t need to wear a mask outdoors if you’re not in a crowd and have plenty of distance (at least six feet) from people whose vaccination status isn’t known. It’s still risky to attend a packed outdoor concert, but if you do, wear a mask.

“I would still suggest wearing a mask if you are indoors with people whose vaccination status you don’t know, especially if you will be within a few feet of them for any amount of time, or if you will be in the room for a long period of time with those people,” said J. Alex Huffman, an aerosol scientist and associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Denver. “I don’t wear a mask indoors in all situations now, because I’m fully vaccinated, but I put my N95 mask on whenever I go into indoor public spaces.”

Should I upgrade my mask?

You will get the most protection from a high-quality medical mask like an N95 or a KN95, although you want to be sure you have the real thing. A KF94 is a high-quality medical mask made in Korea, where counterfeits are less likely. If you don’t have a medical mask, you still get strong protection from double masking with a simple surgical mask under a cloth mask. A mask with an exhale valve should never be worn, since it allows plumes of viral particles to escape, and counterfeit masks may have faulty valves that let germs in.

You may want to pick your mask based on the setting. A cloth mask may be adequate for a quick trip into an empty convenience store in an area with high vaccination rates. But a higher-quality mask makes sense during air travel or in a crowded grocery store, especially in communities where vaccination rates are low and case counts are high. Masks with straps or ties around the back of the head seal more tightly than masks with ear loops.

“All the mitigation efforts we used before need to be better to hold off the Delta variant, and this includes masks,” Dr. Huffman said. “I strongly encourage people to upgrade their mask to something with high filter quality and something that fits tightly to their face. The No. 1 factor, in my opinion, is to make sure the mask is sealed well all around the edges — over the nose bridge, by the cheeks and under the chin. So any mask that fits tightly is better than almost any loosefitting mask.”

What’s the risk of hanging out with my vaccinated friends and family?

Vaccinated people are at very low risk when they spend time, unmasked, with their vaccinated friends and family members. “I don’t think mask-wearing is critical,” Dr. Huffman said. “If you are indoors with a small number of people you know are vaccinated, wearing a mask is low on my list of worries.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@People who need to renew their passports immediately will not be allowed to book last-minute appointments online, the U.S. State Department announced on Thursday.

Those last-minute appointments, which are meant for people with urgent travel needs, can now be scheduled only by phone, the department said.

The reason for the change? It is meant to solve “the problem of third parties booking all available appointments using bots, and then selling them to applicants with urgent travel needs,” the department said in a statement posted on its website. Some appointments sold by third parties cost as much as $300, USA Today reported.

The department said the change was “temporary” but did not indicate when booking those appointments online may resume.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Although vaccination requirements are set by countries, not airlines, airlines are not allowing passengers to check in for international flights without first verifying whatever documents are required, including vaccination records and virus tests.

What that means logistically depends on the airline — and sometimes the airport. Passengers on Delta Air Lines flights, for example, will have their documents verified in-person by a check-in agent and again by a gate agent before boarding. United Airlines passengers are cleared for check-in after the necessary documents are verified in person or online at United’s Travel-Ready Center, an online hub that tells confirmed ticket-holders what’s required, based on their destination. (The digital option allows carry-on die-hards to get a boarding pass without an in-person check at the airport.)

Depending on a multitude of factors, including where you’re going and how airports are set up, you should also expect to produce proof of vaccination at other touch points along the “getting there” part of the trip, including at customs and immigration after landing.

There are a bunch of new digital health pass initiatives that verify and store vaccination records and test results, including one from Clear, the biometrics company. Digital passes provide another layer of safeguard and allow you to easily show proof of vaccination when asked, whether it’s by a check-in agent at an airport or a host at a restaurant where indoor dining is reserved for vaccinated patrons. But because digital passes are nonstandardized at this point, and are accepted at a venue’s discretion, it’s important to always have your physical card when traveling, as well. Treat it like a passport or driver’s license; as in, something you would never leave home without and something you’re asked to routinely pull out on command while traveling.

In addition to vaccination records and test results, many international destinations are also requiring that health declaration forms be filled out before arrival. The Delta Discover Map is a handy online tool for keeping the dizzying mess of what’s required, and where, straight.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dear Tripped Up,

My husband and I are both fully vaccinated, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that we’re good to travel — with some modifications, of course.

But I am faced with a dilemma. Alaska, where we live, has been on the forefront of vaccinations. But until everyone we might encounter on a trip has been vaccinated, I am struggling with the idea of getting on a plane unless it’s absolutely necessary. On the other hand, I realize that tourism-reliant destinations badly need help right now.

How can I think reasonably about the following questions: Can I travel — and should I travel — if I know there’s some chance, however small, that it could endanger others? And if I do travel, how can I ensure I’m keeping other people as safe as possible? Jackie

Dear Jackie,

With the news that vaccinated Americans may be able to travel to Europe this summer, the question of “We can, but should we?” is certain to be top of mind. And the decision fatigue is real, especially when you’re trying to weigh the public health and ethical elements of traveling.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@United and other airlines’ policies have evolved, and will continue to do so, with the pandemic. With 2021 well underway, Consumer Reports and U.S. PIRG, a public-interest advocacy nonprofit, called on 10 domestic airlines last week to ensure their vouchers can be used into 2022.

In addition to the official rules, Mr. Keyes said, “Most airlines have had informal policies to grant extensions to customers who called in and proactively asked for one. Though you shouldn’t be a jerk about it — honey attracts more flies than vinegar — you should be proactive, explain why you’re not comfortable traveling under the current circumstances and ask.”

CRUISE LINES

When the pandemic hit, most air travelers fell into two camps: Those whose flights had been canceled by the airline, and those who voluntarily canceled their tickets. Cruisers were given no such choice: The industry came to an all-out halt last March, after several coronavirus outbreaks were linked to cruises. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a no-sail order, and most ships have been bobbing emptily ever since. Cruisers, in turn, got either cash refunds or future cruise credits, the industry’s version of vouchers or merchandise credits.

Although the C.D.C. order was lifted in October, cruising still remains largely on pause, and most major cruise companies have preemptively canceled their sailings well into this year while they get their health-and-safety protocols up to snuff. In the meantime, policies about future cruise credits remain flexible.

“We’ve seen the concept evolve since the start of the pandemic, and cruise lines are giving people a fairly long lead in terms of expiration dates,” said Colleen McDaniel, the editor in chief of Cruise Critic, a leading cruise news and planning website. “They’re leaving room for people to sail when they’re comfortable. It also helps navigate the continued pause in the industry — with no definitive end date and cruises continuing to be canceled, it leaves some leeway.”

On Carnival Cruise Line, an industry powerhouse with a fleet of 24 ships, travelers who opted to receive a credit, rather than a cash refund, have through April 2023 to sail.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Or as Christopher J. Nassetta, the president and chief executive of Hilton, put it on an earnings call last month, “People have to meet.”

Leisure travel has come roaring back this summer. But the airline and hotel industries long depended on business travel for a substantial portion of their revenues because those customers, who often made their plans at the last minute, could be counted on to pay more for seats and rooms. Now that the pandemic has upended the notion that travel is necessary to do business, the question is how much it will resume, even when Covid is brought under control.

Even the experts who were most optimistic about the prospects for business travel a month or so ago have begun to temper their forecasts. The quick change was captured by a survey of 1,200 American travelers that Destination Analysts, a market research firm in San Francisco, conducted from July 21 to 23. Among business travelers, it found, nearly 25 percent expected the “coronavirus situation” to worsen in the next month, a jump from under 14 percent two weeks earlier. Conventiongoers’ personal health concerns also rose, while their confidence in their ability to travel safely fell.

The U.S. Travel Association said in late July that it continued to forecast “a modest return of business travel over the coming months, so the increase in cases has not materially affected our view.” It said it now expected that business travel would “only achieve 50 percent of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.”

Scott Graf, global president of BCD Meetings & Events, said that in light of the spread of the Delta variant, “we’ll likely see some cancellations or certainly meetings being pushed out by weeks or months.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CAP DE CREUS, Spain — Of all those wishing a swift end to the pandemic, few have reasons as obsessed with the olfactory as Ernesto Collado, an actor turned fragrance maker whose workshop sits in a village in the northeast corner of Spain.

The pandemic brought masks, which severed humanity from its sense of smell, “the sublime which is right here,” as Mr. Collado calls it. And it brought the possibility that the virus could leave him unable to smell anything, which had happened to him briefly years ago and caused a kind of existential crisis.

Then there was the future of his smelling tours, which he pioneered in his native Catalonia, and which, for a time, had seemed under threat as well.

Si Dalí pintó relojes derritiéndose con estos mismos paisajes de fondo, Collado ha hecho del olor de este panorama su arte. Cosecha heliantemos, un arbusto mediterráneo de pétalos blancos y hojas perennes. Hace tinturas de hinojo marino, una planta comestible de punzante aroma salado que recuerda al mar.

Mezcla estos y otros olores para producir Cala, la fragancia que comercializa.

Las algas podridas que recoge de la orilla del mar y la resina prensada del lentisco, un árbol mencionado en Don Quijote de la Mancha, también son parte de su búsqueda de aromas locales.

“Sus fragancias te golpean aquí”, dijo Juan Carlos Moreno, un perfumista aficionado, y se golpeó fuerte el pecho.

Moreno cuenta que lloró la primera vez que olió una de las fragancias de Collado. Era Muga, un olor que, según sus materiales publicitarios, podrían causar “sentir el zumbido de las abejas y la silenciosa sexualidad del romero, la siempreviva, el tomillo y el cantueso”.

Ernesto Collado creció escuchando a su abuelo José Collado Herrero contar relatos sobre perfumes. Collado Herrero formuló uno de los perfumes más vendidos en España a principios del siglo XX. Pero el nieto primero se hizo conocido como actor televisivo y director de teatro.

El momento clave fue cuando Collado empezó a experimentar fantosmia, una condición también conocida como alucinación olfativa. Perdió la capacidad para oler todo excepto un único aroma desagradable que parecía invadirlo todo, incluso a sus hijos.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2015, the independent Canadian filmmaker Dianne Whelan set out on what is now known as the Trans Canada Trail, a nearly 17,000-mile recreational trail that spans green paths, roads and waterways from the Atlantic to the Pacific and north to the Arctic Ocean. On Aug. 1, in the company of her parents, partner and friends, Ms. Whelan, 56, walked the last few feet to become the first person to complete the continuous trail (minus a few spur trails) that links all three oceans by land and water. She plans to produce a documentary, “500 Days in the Wild,” detailing her six-year experience.

As the director of documentaries on the base camp of Mount Everest and an expedition in the Arctic, Ms. Whelan had experienced extreme climates. But the Trans Canada Trail proved a test of her mental and emotional strength, as well as her physical perseverance, including encounters with bears, paddling thousands of miles solo and eating incalculable quantities of oatmeal. Until the pandemic, her journey included stops along the way, often in Indigenous communities, where she collaborated with other artists. For the last year and a half, she’s done it alone, with the help of her partner, Louisa Robinson, who supplied provisions.

A few days before finishing the trail, she hauled her canoe on shore on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia, where she is normally based, just north of Vancouver, to talk about her adventure. The following are excerpts from the conversation, edited for clarity.

What made you decide to do the entire trail?

As a storyteller, I really loved the metaphor of the trail being this umbilical cord that connected us all. When I left, I thought everything we need to know we had forgotten as a culture, at least in Western culture. That somehow, we had lost our connection to the web of life and to the future. I called it an ecological pilgrimage.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is developing plans to require all foreign travelers to the United States to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, with limited exceptions, according to an administration official with knowledge of the developing policy.

The plan, reported earlier by Reuters, will be part of a new system to be put in place after the current restrictions on travel into the country are lifted, but officials have yet to determine when that might be done.

President Biden has been under pressure for months to ease restrictions on people wishing to travel to the United States, particularly as other countries, including Britain and Canada, relax their measures.

But White House officials have said in recent days that there is no plan to lift current restrictions anytime soon, in light of the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.

$1.8 MILLION (1.5 MILLION EUROS)

This semidetached, four-bedroom stone villa is in Lepetane, a coastal village just north of the town of Tivat, in southwest Montenegro.

The 2,443-square-foot villa, built in 1820 and renovated five years ago, sits across a local road from the Bay of Kotor, a mountain-ringed tourist haven that spills into the Adriatic Sea. Its “cocoon” design within a historical facade blends traditional Montenegrin construction with contemporary architecture and modern interior design solutions, said Boris Darmanovic, the brokerage manager at Montenegro Sotheby’s International Realty, which has the listing.

The architect “brought an unexpected amount of light into the house,” Mr. Darmanovic said, using metal bridges to link sliding glass doors in the second-floor bedrooms to the exterior walls. “It’s not typical for these houses.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Market Overview

Hungary, the landlocked Central European nation of hills and plains with about 10 million residents, saw home prices double in the decade between 2010 and the first quarter of 2021, with only two other European Union countries (Estonia and Luxembourg) outpacing it in that growth, according to Eurostat, using data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.

“In Budapest, it was an even bigger increase,” said Gabor Borbely, director and head of business development and research at the CBRE brokerage, in Budapest. “That’s coming, obviously, from a much lower basis, so Hungary is among the cheapest markets in the European Union. If you compare Budapest to Prague or Warsaw — which are similar size, similar purchase power, similar geography — the residential prices are still much lower. In some instances, it’s 40 to 50 percent cheaper to buy in Budapest than in Prague.”

The global pandemic, which is currently largely under control in Hungary after peaking in late 2020 and again this past spring, halted that decade-long price surge in Budapest. Home prices fell a couple of percentage points in 2020 before rebounding earlier this year to their 2019 levels, Mr. Borbely said.

Budapest’s residential market was hit harder by the pandemic than the rest of Hungary, with international buyers disappearing and domestic buyers moving away. As in other countries, many residents decided to buy homes in regions outside of the capital, particularly in resort areas, brokers said.

“Potential buyers are increasingly open to considering properties in the outskirts of bigger cities or those located in the country,” said Karoly Benedikt, the head of marketing, public relations and analysis at Budapest-based agency Duna House.

The changes in consumer behavior have driven up home prices by 10 to 20 percent in some areas outside of Budapest, and even more at Lake Balaton, a 48-mile-long freshwater lake about 50 miles west of Budapest, Mr. Borbely said: “Definitely, the gap between the capital city and the regional markets is narrowing, which is something really unique we haven’t seen for the last two decades.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Camille Walker’s troubles with Southwest Airlines began well before her trip to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in July when her direct flight from Louisville, Ky., was changed to a connecting flight through Atlanta. It became a nightmare when she tried to return from vacation and her departure was pushed back 24 hours. The flight boarded, only to sit on the runway for hours. Assuming she’d miss her connection, Ms. Walker, who works in marketing, found a Delta Air Lines flight she could connect to, but a flight attendant said many passengers were making connections and that the airline would take care of them.

Instead, once she arrived, she said Southwest blamed the weather and disavowed responsibility. Ms. Walker asked to be put on the Delta flight; Southwest refused. When she tried to book it herself, it was sold out. Frantic to get home to attend a friend’s funeral, she tried to book a rental car, but could only find a monthlong rental for $2,000 that had to be returned in Atlanta. She booked an airport hotel. In addition to missing the funeral, the fiasco set her back about $1,000 — for which the airline has offered a $200 flight voucher.

“If you don’t have enough pilots, don’t sell that many flights,” she said.

Ms. Walker is among thousands of passengers who have experienced delayed or canceled flights since June when airlines began to struggle with surging demand, seasonal storms and worker shortages.

In July, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking platform, airlines canceled up to 3 percent of their flights; the normal figure is less than 1 percent. On-time rates, normally close to 80 percent, fell to between 60 and 70 percent. (Airlines dispute the figures; American, for example, said it canceled about 1.5 percent of its flights in July and its on-time arrivals rate was nearly 77 percent.) The statistics are even worse for Spirit, which canceled up to half its departures in early August.
