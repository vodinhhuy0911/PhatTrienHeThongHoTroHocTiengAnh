HONG KONG — A Chinese court on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of a Canadian man convicted of drug trafficking, one of several legal cases that have driven a diplomatic rift between Beijing and Ottawa.

The Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, was initially sentenced to 15 years in prison. But in 2019 he was handed a death sentence in a one-day retrial, one month after the Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, an executive with a Chinese telecommunications equipment company.

The court’s ruling on Mr. Schellenberg’s appeal came as Ms. Meng’s case in Canada was entering a critical phase. She is fighting an extradition request from the United States on fraud charges.

The arrest of Ms. Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei, sharply increased tensions between Canada and China. Shortly after Ms. Meng was arrested, two Canadians — the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and the businessman Michael Spavor — were detained in China on charges of espionage. They were tried in March and are awaiting verdicts.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KABUL, Afghanistan — The families flooded out of northern Afghanistan by the thousands, standing for hours in overcrowded buses and cramming into taxis to escape the Taliban’s swift advance.

By Monday morning, many had arrived at a makeshift shelter in Kabul, the country’s capital. They huddled together, recounting how they had watched bombs ravage their neighborhoods while running battles consumed the streets outside.

The Taliban’s relentless march across northern Afghanistan has sent panic rippling across the country, as Afghans watched a region that was once the heart of resistance to the southern Taliban insurgency collapse at a terrifying pace. In just four days, the insurgents have seized five provincial capitals across the north and one in the southwest, and they continue to press on in their brutal offensive.

The Taliban’s breakthrough victories have further stoked fears that the insurgents could envelop Kabul, and have shattered many Afghans’ last hopes that government forces could somehow reverse the onslaught. With the Taliban encroaching on Kabul — a bastion of government control amid the insurgents’ onslaught — many fear that no corner of the country will be spared.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Security forces have tried to hold them off as other provincial capitals have fallen elsewhere, including Kunduz, the largest city to be captured by the Taliban. In the last four days alone, insurgents seized six capitals, opening a bloody new chapter in the war and further revealing how little control the government has over the country without the backing of the American military.

The insurgents are desperate to capture Kandahar, as the Taliban first took root in its neighboring districts in the 1990s before seizing the city itself and announcing their emirate. And the government is desperate to defend Kandahar, a symbol of the state’s reach and an economic hub essential for trade to and from Pakistan through its checkpoints, bridges and highways.

On a warm evening earlier this month, both Afghan and Taliban flags flew atop a nearby mountain, a Buddhist-turned-Islamic shrine cut into its side — the clearest marker of Kandahar’s western front line.

To the east of the mountain, a mix of Afghan army, commando and special police units were desperately trying to hold the city, despite being exhausted, underfed and underequipped.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@At 1.5 degrees of warming, scientists have found, the dangers grow considerably. Nearly 1 billion people worldwide could swelter in more frequent life-threatening heat waves. Hundreds of millions more would struggle for water because of severe droughts. Some animal and plant species alive today will be gone. Coral reefs, which sustain fisheries for large swaths of the globe, will suffer more frequent mass die-offs.

“We can expect a significant jump in extreme weather over the next 20 or 30 years,” said Piers Forster, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds and one of hundreds of international experts who helped write the report. “Things are unfortunately likely to get worse than they are today.”

Not all is lost, however, and humanity can still prevent the planet from getting even hotter. Doing so would require a coordinated effort among countries to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by around 2050, which would entail a rapid shift away from fossil fuels starting immediately, as well as potentially removing vast amounts of carbon from the air. If that happened, global warming would likely halt and level off at around 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report concludes.

But if nations fail in that effort, global average temperatures will keep rising — potentially passing 2 degrees, 3 degrees or even 4 degrees Celsius, compared with the preindustrial era. The report describes how every additional degree of warming brings far greater perils, such as ever more vicious floods and heat waves, worsening droughts and accelerating sea-level rise that could threaten the existence of some island nations. The hotter the planet gets, the greater the risks of crossing dangerous “tipping points,” like the irreversible collapse of the immense ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica.

“There’s no going back from some changes in the climate system,” said Ko Barrett, a vice-chair of the panel and a senior adviser for climate at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But, she added, immediate and sustained emissions cuts “could really make a difference in the climate future we have ahead of us.”

Lukashenko, the brutal and erratic ruler of Belarus, summoned his acolytes, docile members of the media and a few independent journalists on Monday to present his version of reality: The tens of thousands of Belarusians who rose up in mass protests against his disputed re-election last year were a clueless minority, he said, manipulated by the insidious West seeking to cleave his country from Russia.

He insisted that his actions were not only justified, but had actually preserved world peace.

“Today, Belarus is the center of attention of the whole world,” he proclaimed in the course of an eight-hour news conference in his vast, marble-floored Palace of Independence. “If we had shown weakness during the protests,” he asserted, it would have precipitated a new world war.

While Mr. Lukashenko has worked hard to support his view of events, it is widely dismissed as nonsense by Belarusian activists, Western governments and independent analysts. In fact, they say, after blatantly stealing the election he ordered his law enforcement agencies to crack down on protesters using violence unseen in Europe for decades.

Since then, he has driven hundreds of opposition leaders and others into exile, scrambled a fighter jet to force down a commercial plane carrying an opposition activist, and silenced independent media outlets by jailing entire newsrooms. He has paid several visits to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, seeking financial help to buoy his country’s sanctions-stricken economy.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PARIS — A church volunteer awaiting trial in an arson incident last summer at a 15th-century cathedral was arrested on Monday after confessing to killing a Roman Catholic priest in the Vendée region in western France.

The suspect, who had a history of psychological problems, walked into a police station Monday morning in Mortagne-sur-Sèvre, a city in Vendée, to report the killing overnight of the priest whose body was discovered later by the police, prosecutors said.

The priest, the Rev. Olivier Maire, 60, was head of the Montfortain religious order, with whom the suspect had been staying.

The killing was not politically motivated, prosecutors said. But the identification of the suspect — a 40-year-old Rwandan named Emmanuel Abayisenga, whose application for asylum had been rejected and who had been facing deportation from France when the cathedral was set on fire last summer — immediately fueled criticisms of the country’s immigration laws by conservative and right-wing politicians.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden’s presidency raised expectations among many Cubans of a return to the Obama days, when the United States sought to bury the last vestige of the Cold War by restoring diplomatic relations with Havana and calling for an end to the embargo.

Instead, Mr. Biden is taking an even harder line on Cuba than his predecessor, President Donald J. Trump, who tightened restrictions on travel and financial transactions.

The island became an early foreign policy crisis for the Biden administration after Cubans poured into the streets to denounce their authoritarian government and the food and medicine shortages exacerbated by the pandemic. The rare act of rebellion was quashed with the biggest crackdown on dissent in a generation.

The White House imposed new sanctions against Cuban officials in the past few weeks in response to the arrest of hundreds of protesters who took to the streets in cities across the island nation on July 11. Mr. Biden also asked government experts to draw up plans for the United States to unilaterally expand internet access on the island and has pledged to increase support for Cuban dissidents.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@NAIROBI, Kenya — A decade after South Sudan gained independence amid much hope and fanfare, the country’s path to lasting stability remains fragile as infighting tears at the shaky coalition governing the world’s youngest nation.

Over the weekend, clashes within one faction in the national unity government may have left as many as several dozen people dead, according to officials. The flare-up of violence inflamed long-simmering divisions and raised concerns about the future of the tenuous peace agreement signed three years ago by rival ethnic factions led by the country’s president and vice president.

Now, just over 10 years since the people of South Sudan voted overwhelmingly to separate from Sudan after years of repressive rule, the question is whether leaders of the long-warring factions within South Sudan can bridge their differences and build a future together.

The need for undivided and undiverted leadership is great: the nation currently faces a dire humanitarian crisis with millions of people struggling to get enough food, tens of thousands displaced by severe flooding and a rise in coronavirus cases while few vaccines have been delivered.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In a letter sent to a representative of the families before the presidential election last fall, Mr. Biden had said he would direct his attorney general to “examine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended, and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.”

Mr. Biden had referred to a Trump-era decision that kept the documents classified on the grounds that they contained state secrets, and said his own administration would “work constructively on such cases.”

Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The organizers of the statement last week calling for Mr. Biden to release the documents said they were unsure how many victims were represented by its more than 1,600 signatures. Each name belongs to either a close relative of someone whose death was caused by the attacks, a person who became severely sick as a result of them or a survivor, they said.

The Biden administration’s decision to review the classified documents was the latest development in a nearly two-decade odyssey for some of the families. They have pushed four American presidents, with little success, to release more information about Saudi involvement in financing the attacks.

The 9/11 Commission found “no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded” Al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks. But the commission’s phrasing left some to speculate that there might be evidence of involvement by other, lower-ranking officials.

An investigation last year by The New York Times Magazine and ProPublica found that F.B.I. agents, who secretly investigated Saudi connections to the Sept. 11 attacks for more than a decade, had discovered circumstantial evidence of such support but no smoking gun.

The families were stunned in 2019 when William P. Barr, who was the attorney general under President Donald J. Trump at the time, declared in a statement to a federal court that documents relating to the attacks should stay classified to protect national security.

Pero, añadió, la reducción inmediata y sostenida de las emisiones “podría hacer realmente la diferencia en el futuro climático que tenemos por delante”.

El informe, aprobado por 195 gobiernos y basado en más de 14.000 estudios, es el resumen más completo hasta la fecha de la ciencia física del cambio climático. Será un punto central cuando los diplomáticos se reúnan en noviembre en una cumbre de la ONU en Glasgow para discutir cómo intensificar sus esfuerzos para reducir las emisiones.

Un número cada vez mayor de líderes mundiales, entre ellos el presidente de Estados Unidos Joe Biden, han respaldado el objetivo de limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5 grados Celsius, aunque las políticas actuales de los principales países contaminantes siguen estando muy lejos de alcanzar esa meta. Los diez mayores emisores de gases de efecto invernadero son China, Estados Unidos, la Unión Europea, India, Rusia, Japón, Brasil, Indonesia, Irán y Canadá.

El nuevo informe no deja lugar a dudas de que el ser humano es responsable del calentamiento global, y concluye que prácticamente todo el aumento de las temperaturas medias globales desde el siglo XIX ha sido impulsado por las naciones que queman combustibles fósiles, talan los bosques y cargan la atmósfera con gases de efecto invernadero como el dióxido de carbono y el metano, que atrapan el calor.

Según el informe, los cambios climáticos que se han producido hasta la fecha casi no tienen parangón en la historia de la humanidad. Es muy probable que la última década sea la más calurosa del planeta en 125.000 años. Los glaciares del mundo se están derritiendo y retrocediendo a un ritmo “sin precedentes en al menos los últimos 2000 años”. Los niveles atmosféricos de dióxido de carbono no han sido tan altos en al menos dos millones de años.

The report attributed essentially all of the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th century to humans burning fossil fuels, clearing forests and loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat.

It has prompted outrage among vulnerable countries, whose leaders demanded that richer powers immediately reduce their emissions and help fund preparations for a perilous future.

Nations have delayed curbing fossil fuels for so long that they can no longer stop global warming from intensifying over the next 30 years, though there is still a short window to prevent the most harrowing future, a major new U.N. report has concluded.

Humans have already heated the planet by roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius since the 19th century, largely by burning coal, oil and gas for energy. Total global warming is likely to rise around 1.5 degrees within the next two decades.

Nearly 1 billion people worldwide could swelter in more frequent life-threatening heat waves. Hundreds of millions more would struggle for water because of severe droughts. Some animal and plant species alive today will be gone.

A coordinated effort to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by around 2050 would likely cause global warming to level off at around 1.5 degrees Celsius, preventing far greater perils.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On Monday the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific body convened by the United Nations, released a major new report concluding that the world cannot avoid some devastating impacts of climate change, but that there is still a narrow window to keep the devastation from getting even worse.

The report, based on the analysis of more than 14,000 studies, is the clearest and most comprehensive summary yet of the physical science of climate change. It lays out what the climate was like in the past, what it’s like now and what it will be like for decades to come. And it shows how humans can affect future climate through actions they take — or don’t take — now to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases.

Here are five takeaways from the report:

Human influence has unequivocally warmed the planet.

This report is the sixth assessment of climate science by the U.N. group, and unlike previous reports, this one dispenses with any doubt about who or what is responsible for global warming. “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” the report says in its very first finding.

Observed increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since 1750 can be directly tied to human activity, largely the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels as the world became industrialized. Those emissions have increased greatly over time and continue today, as the world grows even warmer. And the impacts are being felt in every region of the world.

But as the insurgents have carried out their sweeping military offensive this summer, they have pushed deep into northern Afghanistan.

Now, they have seized six cities in recent days, five of which are in northern parts of the country. And experts fear that if government forces are unable to stop their advances in the north, Afghanistan’s capital is more vulnerable than ever.

“The north is strategic for the Taliban, because they believe if they can capture these non-Pashtun areas, then they can easily take control of the south and the capital, Kabul,” said Ramish Salemi, a political analyst in Kabul.

“If Ms. Meng is released to go home to China, then you could see a fairly quick resolution for Spavor and Kovrig,” he said. “It’s been a drip, drip, drip process of constant pressure.”

The specifics of the charges against Mr. Spavor are unclear. The court in Dandong said in a one-sentence statement that he was guilty of obtaining state secrets and illegally passing them to an unnamed foreign recipient. Mr. Spavor may not have to serve out his full sentence; the court said that he would be deported, though it gave no details about the timing.

Canada’s ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, who traveled to Dandong to attend the hearing, later told journalists that the prosecutors had accused Mr. Spavor of taking pictures “around airports or those places where one should not take photos” in China, including of military aircraft. Mr. Barton also said he had met with Mr. Spavor afterward, and that he had said he was in good spirits.

David Meale, the chargé d’affaires at the United States Embassy in Beijing, condemned the prosecutions as “a blatant attempt to use human beings as bargaining leverage.”

The Chinese government has denied that Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig are being kept as political hostages. In demanding Ms. Meng’s release, Chinese officials have repeatedly described the executive as a victim of American overreach.

Unless voters get to record their choice on paper ballots, which the current system doesn’t allow, Mr. Bolsonaro has warned that the 2022 election could be suspended.

“An election outside those parameters is not an election,” Mr. Bolsonaro told supporters during a recent rally in the southern city of Florianópolis, calling on his base to prepare to “fight with all the weapons.”

A government report on Tuesday detailed the missteps that contributed to the tragedy, including insufficient medical resources, communication failures and a lack of proper oversight. But activists and politicians said the proposed changes didn’t go far enough to address the fundamental failures in an immigration system they describe as opaque and capricious.

The nearly 280-page document describes the series of events that led to the death in March of the 33-year-old Wishma Rathnayake, who had been detained for overstaying her visa. While the report said her death was the “result of illness,” it noted the possibility that her health was affected by several factors, “making it difficult to concretely determine the cause.”

The report outlined areas for reform, mainly centered on improving medical care by hiring more doctors and improving staff members’ training on assessing detainees’ physical and mental condition. The report did not assign blame to any individuals, nor did it address some of the more systemic issues with the immigration system.

The three cities — Pul-i-Khumri, roughly 150 miles north of Kabul in Baghlan Province; Farah, the capital of the western province of the same name; and Faizabad, in remote and rugged Badakhshan Province — were the seventh, eighth and ninth to be overrun by the Taliban in less than a week. There, as in other fallen cities, witnesses and defenders described twinned crises of low morale and exhaustion in the face of unrelenting pressure by the insurgents.

The rapid Taliban victories have been a devastating blow to President Ashraf Ghani’s government, and to the military and police forces that the United States and its Western allies spent years and billions of dollars training to stand against the Taliban. And the losses are coming just three weeks before American troops are to complete their final withdrawal from the country, leaving a modest force behind to defend the U.S. Embassy.

The question of whether the Afghan forces can even successfully defend Kabul, the national capital, has become an urgent one, with heavy fighting now going on in or around every one of the country’s other most populous cities.

President Abdelmadjid Tebboune tweeted that the soldiers saved 100 people from the fires in two areas of Kabyle, the region that is home to the North African nation’s Berber population. Eleven other soldiers were burned fighting the fires, four of them seriously, the Defense Ministry said.

Prime Minister Aïmene Benabderrahmane later said on state TV that 17 civilians had lost their lives, bringing the total death toll to 42. He provided no details.

The Kabyle region, about 60 miles east of Algeria’s capital, Algiers, is dotted with difficult-to-access villages. Some villagers fled, while others tried to hold back the flames themselves, using buckets, branches and rudimentary tools. The region has no water-dumping planes.

Gran Bretaña sufre una crisis de violencia contra las mujeres que se ha agravado durante la pandemia. Pero menos del dos por ciento de los casos de violación y el ocho por ciento de los casos de abuso doméstico denunciados a la policía en Inglaterra y Gales son procesados, incluso cuando las denuncias están aumentando.

La nación se conmocionó a principios de este año cuando un agente de policía confesó haber raptado, violado y asesinado a Sarah Everard, una ejecutiva de mercadeo de 33 años que fue secuestrada mientras caminaba hacia su casa en el sur de Londres. El crimen puso de manifiesto la vulnerabilidad que sienten muchas mujeres británicas y su preocupación porque la policía y la fiscalía no las protegen.

El Parlamento aprobó recientemente una nueva legislación sobre maltrato doméstico. Pero cambiar las políticas y la opinión pública ha sido difícil durante décadas. Los errores y las oportunidades perdidas por la policía suelen permanecer ocultos.

El caso de Espirito Santo se ajusta a ese patrón. Su muerte en Grantham, una ciudad comercial en el condado inglés de Lincolnshire, mayoritariamente rural, recibió poca atención externa y se consideró una tragedia, no un escándalo. La investigación sobre su muerte está en el limbo. La policía de Lincolnshire —un pequeño cuerpo que cubre una amplia zona con una población escasa, pero a menudo necesitada— se negó a conceder una entrevista, al igual que la Fiscalía de la Corona.

Pero una investigación de The New York Times deja al descubierto la escalada de abusos que denunció Espirito Santo, ofrece una visión poco común de los errores policiales y plantea dudas sobre la decisión de los fiscales de retirar la acusación de homicidio. El Times obtuvo un informe confidencial de 106 páginas elaborado por la Oficina Independiente de Conducta Policial, un organismo oficial de control, sobre la gestión del caso por parte del cuerpo de Lincolnshire.

But more than how he looks, it’s other people’s stories about how the test seems to be misleading that has Ms. Macdonald convinced that someone should step in to save Geronimo.

Bob Broadbent, a veterinary surgeon in Gloucestershire who has worked with camelids since 1986, said that he has seen more cases of bovine tuberculosis “than I would care to remember” over the years. He has also been examining Geronimo regularly over the past three years and in his opinion, he said, the test is flawed and Geronimo does not have tuberculosis.

Defra’s bovine tuberculosis test involves more than just a blood test; it requires an injection of “tuberculin” as “a primer” 10 to 30 days before the test, Dr. Broadbent said. He believes that while this may not create problems in cattle, it sometimes creates false positives in alpacas. Essentially, the result is positive because the test detects the tuberculin — not because they actually have tuberculosis.

In a statement, the Environment secretary, George Eustice, countered that Geronimo has tested positive not once but twice, using a “highly specific and reliable test.”

Another two provincial capitals, Farah in western Afghanistan and Pul-i-Khumri in the north, all but fell to the Taliban on Tuesday, local officials said, the seventh and eighth cities to be overrun in under a week.

The Taliban had been encroaching for a while on Farah city, the capital of the province with the same name. The province has been a focal point for its offensive operations in the country’s west for years.

A police officer told The Times that government officials had fled to an army headquarters miles outside the city and that the main prison had been breached. The streets, he said, were full of freed inmates.

In the north, the monthslong Taliban stranglehold on the capital of Baghlan Province, Pul-i-Khumri, finally succeeded, forcing government officials to retreat. The city is on the highway connecting the northern provinces to Kabul.

The policy falls short of a mandate, but all new hires filling job vacancies posted on Aug. 14 or later will need to show proof of vaccination.

“We will, of course, have a process for people who want to apply for exemptions and any unvaccinated employee, even those who qualify for the medical or religious exemption, will be required to conduct a weekly Covid-19 test and failure to comply will lead to adverse employment actions,” Ms. Bowser said.

Only 59 percent of city employees have reported their vaccine status, according to the mayor’s office. Of those, 54 percent are vaccinated.

Daily new cases across the city have soared, according to a New York Times database, which also shows that hospitalizations have risen 5 percent and that there were three deaths over the same period.

“That’s how it is, in five minutes, you live or die,” he said, adding, “the fire just changes all the time.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Will the Taliban’s advance affect the U.S. military withdrawal?

The American military presence in Afghanistan is set to end by the end of the month, and the recent string of Taliban military victories has not moved President Biden to reassess that plan, officials said.

Still the escalating violence is a predicament for Mr. Biden, who has toed the line between extracting the United States from the war while insisting that he is not abandoning Afghanistan to the Taliban.

The American withdrawal is already 95 percent complete, official say. But over the past three weeks, as the Taliban pushed their front lines deep into urban areas, the U.S. military has carried out some airstrikes in Afghanistan to try to buy time for Afghan security forces to rally a defense around the major cities under siege.

Administration officials say the Pentagon will likely request authorization from the president for additional airstrikes in the next months, should the key southern city of Kandahar or the nation’s capital, Kabul, appear on the verge of falling.

But on Sunday, as three northern cities fell to the insurgents, the American response was muted. It sent a clear message to Afghan leaders: In no uncertain terms, America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan is over, and the Afghan forces will have to retake the cities on their own, or leave them to the Taliban for good.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Poland’s right-wing coalition government won a narrow victory in Parliament on Wednesday when legislators passed a contentious media bill that could lead to an American-owned television station losing its license.

The passage of the media bill by the lower house came in a stormy and chaotic session of Parliament in which the legislation was briefly postponed by opposition legislators. The government forced a vote to rescind the postponement, bringing cries of outrage from legislators.

The long day of political shenanigans followed the withdrawal from the government of a small coalition partner in a dispute over the proposed new law. The departure of the coalition partner means the government has now lost its parliamentary majority.

The government, led by the Law and Justice party of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, will continue to lead Poland unless it loses a vote of confidence, which would require a vote of two-thirds of the lower house. But the government is wounded and facing dissent from another coalition partner, so may not last until the next scheduled elections, in 2023.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Indonesian Army will stop subjecting female recruits to mandatory vaginal exams, the army chief said in an interview with local reporters this week. Rights groups have long viewed the procedure as a continuation of the invasive and discredited so-called virginity test that is slowly being stamped out in many places.

In an interview on Tuesday, Gen. Andika Perkasa, the army chief, said there would be “no more vaginal and cervix examinations,” and that there would no longer be an assessment of whether women’s hymens were intact.

His confirmation came less than a month after he hinted at the changes in a different statement, setting off celebrations among activists who have campaigned against the practice for years. They said they hoped the move would lead other branches of the Indonesian military to change the procedure.

Latisha Rosabelle, 21, who grew up in Indonesia and started a petition against the practice that garnered nearly 70,000 signatures, said she was “stunned” when she heard the news. “I had been posting stuff online for years,” said Ms. Rosabelle, now a student at Smith College in Massachusetts. “It felt so slow. I was a little bit hopeless.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BERLIN — An employee of the British Embassy in Germany has been detained on suspicion of slipping documents from his workplace to Russian intelligence, Germany’s federal prosecutor said on Wednesday in the latest case of suspected espionage involving agents from Moscow.

The man, who is a 57-year-old British citizen identified only as David S. in keeping with German privacy laws, was detained on Monday in Potsdam and his home and office were searched, the prosecutor said in a statement. The authorities said that they suspected he had been working as a spy since at least November and that he was suspected of handing over documents from the embassy to a member of Russia’s intelligence agency in exchange for an undisclosed amount of cash.

The arrest is the latest in a spate of detentions as German authorities move against Russian agents. Germany’s domestic intelligence service has grown increasingly concerned that Moscow is stepping up its efforts to win over Western collaborators to gain information about the country’s economic, political and strategic positions, as well as those of the European Union.

Much of the focus has been on the threat of cyberespionage after hackers linked to Russia were suspected of breaching the German government’s main data network and the country’s Parliament. But experts in Germany say that Moscow is again employing old-fashioned human contact to gather intelligence.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LONDON — A Scottish judge on Wednesday opened a path to a possible investigation into the purchase of Donald Trump’s two golf courses in Scotland, in a ruling that could force the former president to explain how he funded the deals.

The Scottish government had resisted pressure to demand financial details from Mr. Trump through an “unexplained wealth order,” a powerful legal instrument usually deployed against leading figures in organized crime or drug trafficking.

But on Wednesday a judge ruled that Avaaz, an online campaign group, should be given the right to challenge the government’s rejection of calls for such a move.

Nicknamed “McMafia orders,” unexplained wealth orders were introduced in 2018 to strengthen the government’s armory against organized crime. Those subject to them can ultimately be forced to forfeit their assets if they are unable to explain satisfactorily how they were purchased.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@MOSCOW — The Russian authorities announced a new criminal charge against Aleksei A. Navalny on Wednesday, signaling they would try to keep the imprisoned opposition leader behind bars until well after the country’s presidential election in 2024.

Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement that Mr. Navalny was charged with creating an organization that “infringes on the personal integrity and rights of citizens,” a crime punishable by as much as three years in prison. Mr. Navalny was jailed in January for violating parole and given a two-and-a-half year prison sentence that expires in late 2023.

The Investigative Committee, a powerful law-enforcement body, alleged that Mr. Navalny had broken the law by establishing his Anti-Corruption Foundation, a group Russia outlawed as extremist earlier this year.

“The foundation’s activities involved encouraging citizens to commit illegal acts,” such as attending unauthorized protests, the committee’s statement said.

Fires around the northern parts of Evia, Greece’s second-largest island, have destroyed more than 120,000 acres of pine forest, razed homes and displaced hundreds of people. More than 20 countries have offered assistance in battling the blazes, and the Greek prime minister has declared them “a natural disaster of unprecedented dimensions.”

A record-breaking heat wave that has touched temperatures of up to 46 degrees Celsius, or 115 degrees Fahrenheit, has also set off wildfires in Sweden, Finland and Norway, in yet another episode of extreme weather brought on by the man-made climate change that scientists have now concluded is irreversible.

Elsewhere in Europe, floods that used to come once in a millennium in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands have killed at least 196 people. Some places in Italy reached more than 118 degrees Fahrenheit this week, while parts of the country were variously scorched by fire, battered by hailstorms or inundated by floods.

Extreme weather: Dozens of people were rescued and others were missing after floods tore through Turkey, submerging roadways and cutting off access to large areas.

But Ms. Hochul, a moderate Democrat from the Buffalo area who has kept a low profile as lieutenant governor, will soon confront a raft of difficult decisions on everything from guidance on mask rules to vaccine mandates.

In her first news conference on Wednesday as the soon-to-be-governor, Ms. Hochul did not say whether she would declare a new state of emergency to respond to rising transmission, as Mr. Cuomo did last year in March at the height of the pandemic, a restriction that was only lifted in late June of 2021.

Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director at the Pan American Health Organization, said that to get the virus under control, “countries need to go further than 20 percent and it is not clear if Covax will offer more vaccines after this 20 percent.” He said negotiations to obtain the vaccines have begun with producers.

The officials did not provide details about how the organization would succeed where Covax has failed, but they said that the organization had decades of experience buying and distributing vaccines on behalf of countries in the region. The countries will have to pay for the vaccines, while Covax has mostly distributed them free to poorer countries.

“There is no path to recovery for any country while its neighbors remain vulnerable and while variants circulate and multiply,” Dr. Etienne said. “We must banish the idea that vaccine inequity is the problem of some countries and not others.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Taliban takeover of Afghanistan?

Since international troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan in May, the Taliban have carried out a sweeping military campaign that has intensified over the past week. The Taliban have overrun nine provincial capitals across the country, most of them clustered in the north.

The victories have stoked fears that the Taliban could take the capital, Kabul. While the administration of President Ashraf Ghani has refused to acknowledge the falling capitals, the acting finance minister has fled the country.

The U.S. military has conducted airstrikes but mostly refrained from getting further involved, making clear that its 20-year involvement in the country was over. President Biden said on Tuesday that Afghan leaders have “got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation.”

Context: After the Taliban emerged in the 1990s, they faced fierce resistance from militia groups in the north known as the Northern Alliance. Even when Taliban fighters took Kabul in 1996, the alliance deprived them of a complete takeover. Now, experts say if the group takes the north, they could take the whole country.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He said there were indications that the nurse might be against vaccines.

A police investigation found that the nurse had shared social media posts criticizing the government’s pandemic restrictions.

The criminal investigation is focusing on accusations that the nurse’s switching of the initial vial resulted in saline solution being injected instead of six vaccine doses. But the police now say there is a credible chance that the nurse intentionally substituted vaccines on other occasions while working in the laboratory of the Friesland vaccination center. She was responsible for preparing vaccine syringes.

Officials have not said whether they plan to charge her with any crime. A lawyer representing the nurse told the German news service DPA that she had switched just one vial.

The nurse, who has not been charged with any offense, admitted in April that she had refilled a broken Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine vial with a saline solution, in an episode that she described as an accident.

Unable to pinpoint exactly which vials had been compromised in April, the authorities invited 117 people to take antibody tests. They also offered additional vaccine shots to another 80 who had been to the center for second doses.

Banks, shops and malls were allowed to reopen, and buses and trains were operating at half capacity. That followed the reopening of the garment industry, a mainstay of the economy, two weeks ago.

And while health experts feared that the lifting of restrictions would worsen the outbreak, the effect of the restrictions on people’s livelihoods in Bangladesh has been devastating. The pandemic has pushed at least 24.5 million into poverty, according to an April study.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The surrenders seem to be happening as fast as the Taliban can travel.

In the past several days, the Afghan security forces have collapsed in more than 15 cities under the pressure of a Taliban advance that began in May. On Friday, officials confirmed that those included two of the country’s most important provincial capitals: Kandahar and Herat.

The swift offensive has resulted in mass surrenders, captured helicopters and millions of dollars of American-supplied equipment paraded by the Taliban on grainy cellphone videos. In some cities, heavy fighting had been underway for weeks on their outskirts, but the Taliban ultimately overtook their defensive lines and then walked in with little or no resistance.

This implosion comes despite the United States having poured more than $83 billion in weapons, equipment and training into the country’s security forces over two decades.

Building the Afghan security apparatus was one of the key parts of the Obama administration’s strategy as it sought to find a way to hand over security and leave nearly a decade ago. These efforts produced an army modeled in the image of the United States’ military, an Afghan institution that was supposed to outlast the American war.

Her niece Viviana Pappalardo, 23, who also worked on the farm where they also grew oranges and grapes, said she was worried about the future.

“People don’t understand that the damage is everywhere,” she said, hoping that the extreme temperature in her town, and the fact that “people could feel it on their skin,” would serve as a wake-up call.

“All of us who work in this sector, in agriculture, understand it,” she said. “And we are the base of everything. When you take the broad view, Europe is dying.”

But that sense of urgency seemed to fade with the high heat. By Thursday evening, Floridia’s young people were back at the local pub, down the road from one of Sicily’s best snail restaurants, carousing over beers.

Echoing several other top U.S. officials in recent days, John F. Kirby, a Defense Department spokesman, noted to reporters on Friday that Afghan government forces had numerical and firepower advantages over the Taliban and suggested they should be able to stop the onslaught if only they tried hard enough.

“We will do what we can from the air, but they have the advantage. They have greater numbers. They have an air force. They have modern weaponry,” he said. “It’s time now to use those advantages.”

A day earlier, Mr. Kirby was more explicit. “No potential outcome has to be inevitable, including the fall of Kabul,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be that way. It really depends on the kind of political and military leadership that the Afghans can muster to turn this around.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Still, Mr. Guéhenno said, Western democracies “must not adopt a doctrine of indifference to the plight of other people.’’

Afghanistan was never a particularly vital interest for Europe to begin with. NATO went to war there 20 years ago only to show solidarity with the United States after 9/11.

But the suddenness of Afghanistan’s collapse is another reminder of what can happen when Europe outsources decisions to Washington.

NATO countries let the Americans call the shots in Afghanistan, even if they complained about a lack of consultation. For NATO, the mantra was always “in together, out together.” Once President Biden decided to pull the plug, NATO troops also began leaving at speed; there is little appetite for returning.

Europe’s main worries now are a new flow of Afghan migrants and a new safe haven for terrorism. But for a long time now, European terrorism has had its roots closer to home, in North Africa and the Middle East and in domestic disaffection.

The Biden administration has other problems, and Europeans want support from Washington on more important issues, like climate change, Russia and China, said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the London research institution.

“Biden will take some hit for lack of consultation with allies and piggybacking on a flawed Trump strategy,” Mr. Niblett said. “But there is a lot more to be gained for American soft power by getting through the corona crisis and focusing on vaccines for the world, than on putting more effort into whether the Afghan government survives.”

Britain is no stranger to political scandals, including one in 2009 over expense claims by lawmakers. But amid the crush of allegations lately, experts worry that the government is lapsing into what the opposition Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has sought to label “Tory sleaze.”

“We are at a dangerous moment, and I think we probably need a bit of a long hard look at it and a conscious reset,” said Hannah White, deputy director of the Institute for Government, a research institute.

“We have a system which is not terribly fit for purpose, a government that does not want to be told what to do by holier-than-thou regulators, and a government which, since the start of the pandemic, has been operating in really exceptional circumstances,” she added.

Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at Nottingham University, said the traditional controls were under strain partly because Britain’s Conservatives were entrenched in power and had been for more than a decade, and partly because of Mr. Johnson’s own personality.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@But Pakistan has leverage that it is not bringing to bear, government officials in other countries say. It still allows Taliban leaders free movement into and out of the country and continues to serve as a safe haven where fighters and their families can receive medical care, they say.

Some critics, particularly in Afghanistan, accuse Pakistan of actively supporting the Taliban’s offensive, saying that the insurgents could not have mounted such a large effort without assistance. On social media, the hashtag campaign #SanctionPakistan has gained popularity in Afghanistan and among the diaspora.

Officials in Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital, have played down the idea that they can influence the Taliban. But the U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said during a trip to India last month that Pakistan must “do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not take the country by force.”

The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, said this month that Pakistan bore special responsibility because of how many Taliban leaders resided within its borders, and that it would be “judged internationally” on whether it was seen to have done all it could to promote a political settlement.

Pakistan’s tolerance of the Taliban has taken a diplomatic toll. Its archrival, India, which is currently presiding over the United Nations Security Council and also seeks influence in Afghanistan, says that logistical, technical and financial support for the Taliban continue to emanate from Pakistan. Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, claimed at a conference last month in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, that 10,000 jihadis had traveled from Pakistan to join the offensive, which Mr. Khan staunchly denied.

Although she was raising her children in one of the most secular countries on earth, Ms. Gul’s illiterate mother was determined to make sure the family would live as if they had never left the Turkish village where she herself had been born.

Regular mosque visits were scheduled, and the mother made sure her two daughters — Ms. Gul has a younger sister — were always veiled. All their friends were Turkish. On weekends Ms. Gul went to a school run by a Turkish-Islamist organization to study the Quran.

For her brother, 21, there were many exemptions to the strict rules imposed on her and her sister, 9. As the book tells it, he was allowed to have girlfriends, and no questions were asked when he went out. Ms. Gul, however, would be constantly tracked by her parents, who would make frequent video calls to her cellphone to see where she was.

At times, her mother would call her a “prostitute” when she wore makeup.

“For men, many rules don’t apply,” Ms. Gul said. “For women their ‘honor’ is more important than their lives, my mother used to say. But for young men it’s fine to play around before marriage. To me that’s a massive double standard.”

The most controversial parts of her book were quickly translated by the Turkish diaspora in the Netherlands. Angry messages from uncles and aunts in Turkey followed not much later, saying Ms. Gul had broken the family honor and insulted Islam by writing steamy sex scenes and mocking Turkish culture.

Ms. Gul’s brother, who requested that his name not be used, said that his family prefers not to react to the issues raised in Ms. Gul’s book for privacy reasons.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is considering dissolving Parliament, perhaps as soon as Sunday, to set Canada on a path for an election in late September. Such a move has been widely anticipated and would signal his confidence that voters will return him to power after three consecutive campaigns.

If called, the election would come less than two years after the previous vote and at a time when coronavirus cases are rising in many parts of the country, leading health officials to declare that a fourth wave is underway. Mr. Trudeau could have waited until 2024 to call an election.

Officials in Mr. Trudeau’s government and his Liberal Party have been told to prepare for the prime minister to request the dissolution on Sunday from Governor General Mary Simon, Queen Elizabeth’s representative as head of state. Their understanding is that the vote will be held on Sept. 20, after the minimum period for campaigning by law.

The final decision on timing rests with Mr. Trudeau, and on Friday it was not clear if it had been made. Mr. Trudeau’s office declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In Alberta, any federal vote in the near future will come on top of municipal election campaigns as well as referendums on Canada’s equalization system and daylight saving time.

While none of the provincial elections were blamed for major outbreaks, a surge in cases caused Newfoundland to switch to mail-in ballots just 12 hours before voters were supposed to visit polls on Feb. 12, and to extend the election period until March 1. Things only got worse after that, with the final results not being confirmed until the end of that month.

Stephane Perrault, the chief electoral officer, has warned that a pandemic vote will likely lead to an enormous increase in mail-in ballots and perhaps a delay of a few days in announcing some results. Canada does not start counting mail ballots until the day after in-person voting to make sure that no one double-voted and to allow people to submit their ballots right up to the closing of polls.

That may leave some close races in limbo. In-person voters will also see changes such as voting at movie theaters because many usual voting spots like schools are currently reluctant to open up to large numbers of outsiders.

For weeks it’s been apparent that an election is coming soon. Mr. Trudeau and his cabinet members have been traveling the country making spending announcements, and the opposition leaders have similarly hit the road.

Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, is more isolated than ever, facing pressure to step aside — and not just from the Taliban. His dominion is shrinking by the day. He governs the capital, Kabul, two other cities in the north and east, and pockets in the interior.

Yet Mr. Ghani is stubbornly clinging to office.

In a brief recorded speech televised early Saturday afternoon, Mr. Ghani promised to “prevent further instability” but did not resign. With Taliban forces having captured Pul-i-Alam, another provincial capital — this one only 40 miles from Kabul — Mr. Ghani said he had begun “extensive consultations at home and abroad” and that the “results” would soon be shared. He said “remobilizing” Afghanistan’s defense forces was a priority.

On Wednesday, he flew to one of his loyalist redoubts, the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, in attempts to rally pro-government forces; the city fell to the Taliban on Saturday night. On Thursday, officials said, he spoke by phone with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III. On Friday, he was said to be leading a national security meeting in the Kabul presidential palace.

“You can see a certain effort to isolate Kabul,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, at a news conference Friday. The move “is not unlike the way they’ve operated in other places of the country, isolating provincial capitals and sometimes being able to force surrender without necessarily much bloodshed.”

“We’re certainly concerned by the speed with which the Taliban has been moving,” he added. “And as we’ve said from the very beginning that this is it still is a moment for Afghan national security and defense forces, as well as their political leadership.”

The Taliban’s accelerated march toward Afghanistan’s capital underlies the urgency for American forces to assist with the evacuation of American and Afghan civilians, including State Department personnel and Afghans who have Special Immigrant Visas that permit them to leave the country for the United States. Three battalions of U.S. troops, or about 3,000 personnel, are being dispatched to Kabul for that effort.

Educators and school staff in both cities will have to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 15. School begins in Los Angeles on Aug. 16 and in Chicago on Aug. 30.

In Los Angeles, district employees will also have to submit to regular virus testing, regardless of vaccination status. In Chicago, staff will be tested weekly until the vaccine deadline. Both systems said there will be an exemption process for those with disabling medical conditions or sincerely held religious beliefs.

California and Illinois are also both requiring everyone to use masks inside schools when they reopen.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@MOSCOW — Russia is expelling a BBC correspondent based in Moscow, Russian state television reported, the first time in years that a high-profile Western journalist has been publicly forced out of the country as part of a political dispute.

The BBC condemned the move to expel the reporter, Sarah Rainsford, while holding out hope that the decision could still be reversed.

“The expulsion of Sarah Rainsford is a direct assault on media freedom which we condemn unreservedly,” Tim Davie, the BBC director-general, said in a statement on Friday. “We urge the Russian authorities to reconsider their decision.”

For now, even with Ms. Rainsford’s expulsion, the BBC will continue to have a presence in Moscow, including an English-language correspondent and a Russian-language operation.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Inside a Las Vegas courtroom last week, renters and landlords battled over evictions that continued at a brisk pace despite a last-minute, two-month extension of the federal protections meant to keep people in their homes.

Vanessa Merryman, 41, was among the tenants ordered to leave her apartment. “I have never been homeless in my life,” she said through tears. “I do not know what I am going to do.”

The federal moratorium on evictions — combined with billions of dollars in rent subsidies — was supposed to avert the scenario of millions of Americans being turned out of their homes after they lost their jobs during the pandemic and were unable to afford their rent.

Yet despite these efforts, many local governments and courts were not sure how to apply the extension, and desperate tenants continued to flood local government websites seeking rental assistance that was usually slow in coming.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mr. Abazovic, who in March visited Brussels to appeal for help from the European Union in refinancing the Chinese loan, added: “They made an incredible deal for the interests of China. For our side, it was a disaster.”

Mr. Djukanovic, who presided over the deal, ruling Montenegro from 1990 until his party’s election defeat last year, dismissed the new government’s complaints as “political noise,” insisting in an interview that China has no interest in meddling in Montenegro’s affairs.

Over his long career, Mr. Djukanovic has thrived by playing off rival powers, aligning first with Serbia under Slobodan Milosevic, and then with wealthy investors from Russia, including tycoons close to the Kremlin. Later, he turned to the United States, which overlooked his past in order to get Montenegro to join NATO, while also reaching out to China, which offered loans that neither American nor European banks thought wise.

He led Montenegro to independence in 2006, making it the last former republic of Yugoslavia to become a separate state.

Now out of power, though he still holds the largely ceremonial post of president, Mr. Djukanovic has presented the ruckus over the Chinese-built highway as another twist in what he views as Russian scheming to assert influence in Montenegro. Pro-Moscow members of Parliament are not represented in the new government, but, out of hostility to Mr. Djukanovic, they generally support it.

Ralph Tedy Erol/Reuters PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — A magnitude 7.2 earthquake violently shook Haiti on Saturday morning, a devastating blow to an impoverished country reeling from a presidential assassination last month and still recovering from a disastrous quake more than 11 years ago. The quake overwhelmed hospitals, flattened buildings and trapped people under rubble in at least two cities in the western part of the country’s southern peninsula. At least 304 people were killed and more than 1,800 injured, according to Jerry Chandler, the director general of the Civil Protection Agency. An untold number were missing. “The streets are filled with screaming,” said Archdeacon Abiade Lozama, head of an Episcopal church in Les Cayes, one of the afflicted cities. “People are searching, for loved ones or resources, medical help, water. ” The disaster could hardly have come at a worse time for the nation of 11 million, which has been in the throes of a political crisis since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated on July 7. The unsolved assassination, a leadership vacuum, severe poverty and systematic gang violence in parts of Haiti have left the government dysfunctional and ill prepared for a natural calamity. Much of the initial information about the quake came via social media postings and phone because of the security dangers in traveling to the affected area, which is at least four hours away by road from Port-au-Prince, the capital. The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck five miles from the town of Petit Trou de Nippes in the western part of the country, about 80 miles west of Port-au-Prince. Seismologists said it had a depth of seven miles and was felt as far away as 200 miles in Jamaica. The U.S.G.S. said it was a magnitude 7.2 quake, more powerful than the 7.0 quake that hit Haiti in 2010, which killed nearly a quarter-million people. The Saturday quake struck in a less densely populated area of the country, but it was impossible to assess the full scope of casualties. Haiti’s embassy in the United States said in a statement that “the Haitian Government believes high casualties are probable given the earthquake’s magnitude.” The Biden administration, the United Nations and private relief agencies that operate in Haiti promised urgent help. aftermath of the 7.2 magnitude earthquake in Haiti 🇭🇹 🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/080yX6P9FJ — 🏝CARIBBEAN CULTURE ⓦ🏝〽️ (@westindimade) August 14, 2021 At least two cities reported major devastation: Les Cayes and Jeremie. Phone lines were down in Petit Trou de Nippes, the epicenter of the quake, and no news emerged immediately from that city, leaving Haitian officials to fear for the worst. A landslide, triggered by the quake, cut off access to the road to Jeremie. Doctors said the two main hospitals in Les Cayes and the main hospital in Jeremie had been overwhelmed. “Many houses fell. Many people are trapped under the rubble,” said Widchell Augustin, 35, from Les Cayes, where he lives. Videos emerged of people still in their pajamas or bath towels, out in the street seeking refuge from their violently trembling homes. Entire three-story buildings were flattened to eye-level; another video showed a group of men sifting through rubble and trying to remove debris to extract someone stuck underneath. Dr. James Pierre, 38, a surgeon working at the general hospital of Les Cayes, also known as the Hospital Immaculée Conception, said the hospital was in need of the most basic supplies, including surgical gloves and intravenous needles. He added that he may be the only surgeon currently operating in Les Cayes, as many of his colleagues returned to Haiti’s capital for the weekend on Friday. He also said that a building housing medical students, hospital interns and two doctors had collapsed, trapping those who were most needed to provide aid. Gabriel Fortuné, a powerful local politician and former mayor of Les Cayes, was among those killed when the hotel he owned collapsed during the quake, according to a local journalist who knew him, Jude Bonhomme.

The latest Haiti earthquake was more powerful than the devastating quake in 2010. A satellite image showing the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone in Haiti in 2010. Credit... NASA The earthquake that struck Haiti on Saturday morning occurred on the same system of faults as the one that devastated the capital, Port-au-Prince, in January 2010. And the previous quake almost certainly made this one more likely to occur. Both quakes struck on an east-west fault line at the convergence of two tectonic plates, large segments of the Earth’s crust that slowly move in relationship to each other. At this fault line, called the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone, the Caribbean plate and the North American plate move laterally, or side by side, at a rate of about a quarter of an inch a year. The 2010 quake was centered about 30 miles west of Port-au-Prince. The quake on Saturday was about 50 miles further west. Area affected by earthquake in Haiti Cap-Haitien Caribbean Sea Lower pop.

Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey who studied the 2010 earthquake, said there was no doubt that it and the one Saturday were linked. “It’s well established that you do have this domino concept,” she said, where the energy released by one earthquake alters the stress patterns elsewhere along the fault line. “But we don’t have a crystal ball that tells us which domino is going to fall next.” Dr. Hough said seismologists had been concerned about a region of the fault zone to the east, closer to the 2010 rupture site. “Now we’ve seen the segment to the west rupture,” she said. She said that the fault ruptured both vertically and laterally. Preliminary analyses suggested that the fault ruptured to the west, which would mean that most of the energy was directed away from Port-au-Prince and toward the more sparsely populated region along the Tiburon peninsula. If that’s the case, then most of the aftershocks that inevitably follow a large earthquake would most likely occur to the west as well. “To the extent that anything could be good news for Haiti, those are good signs,” Dr. Hough said. At a magnitude of 7.2, Saturday’s quake released about twice as much energy as the one in 2010, which was a magnitude-7.0 quake. That quake killed some 300,000 people. Jerry Chandler, head of Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency, said Sunday during a news conference that the latest earthquake had killed at least 724 people. Damage and casualties from quakes depend on many factors besides magnitude. The depth and location of the rupture, the time it occurred and the quality of construction all can play major roles. In the 2010 earthquake, shoddy construction — especially poorly built masonry buildings — was blamed for many of the deaths and injuries. The fault zone extends west to Jamaica, which is also at risk of major earthquakes. In addition to the 2010 quake, the fault zone was most likely the source of four major earthquakes in the 18th and 19th centuries, including ones that leveled Port-au-Prince in 1751 and again in 1770.

Haiti lies in the possible path of Tropical Storm Grace. A satellite image of Tropical Storm Grace, which formed in the eastern Caribbean on Saturday morning. Credit... NOAA As Haiti reeled from a devastating earthquake on Saturday, the threat of another natural disaster loomed over the island. Tropical Storm Grace, which formed in the eastern Caribbean the same morning, was on a path toward Haiti, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was projected to pass over or near Haiti on Monday, the center said in an update on Saturday afternoon, adding that people on the island should monitor the path of Grace, and that tropical storm warnings for Haiti and other nearby islands could be required later on Saturday or on Sunday. Map: Tracking Grace’s Path A map showing the storm’s path through the Caribbean as it heads toward the Gulf of Mexico Over Haiti, the storm could dump four to seven inches of rain, with isolated totals of up to 10 inches, the center said, adding that heavy rainfall could lead to flooding and potential mudslides on Monday and into Tuesday. Before the center’s afternoon update, Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist at the center, said the earthquake could increase the chance of mudslides. “It could have shifted some of the ground and soil, which could make mudslides more common,” he said. Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman for the center, said the storm was not expected to make landfall in Haiti, which means the center of the storm wouldn’t cross over the island itself. However, he said, “rain is centered all around the storm, so the center won’t mean a whole lot.” Grace is expected to strengthen over the next couple of days, and then weaken by Monday or Tuesday, the center said. Grace, which is the seventh named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, follows several days of floods and power outages unleashed this week by Fred. Alyssa Lukpat and

Here is what to know about the Haiti earthquake. The Sacred Heart church in Les Cayes was damaged in an earthquake on Saturday. Credit... Delot Jean/Associated Press What happened? An earthquake of 7.2 magnitude struck Haiti on Saturday morning. It was stronger than the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that devastated the Caribbean country in 2010. The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck five miles from the town of Petit Trou de Nippes in the western part of the country, about 80 miles west of Port-au-Prince, the capital. Seismologists said it had a depth of seven miles. It was felt as far away as Jamaica, 200 miles away. The U.S. Tsunami Warning Center reported a tsunami threat because of Saturday’s earthquake, but later rescinded it. Aftershocks have rippled through the region, the U.S.G.S. said. What is the death toll? Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency said Sunday that at least 1,297 people had been confirmed dead. Among the dead was the former mayor of Les Cayes, Gabriel Fortuné, who was killed when the hotel he owned collapsed during the quake, according to a local journalist who knew him, Jude Bonhomme. What parts of Haiti were affected? Two cities, Les Cayes and Jeremie, located in Haiti’s southern peninsula, have reported major devastation with people caught under rubble and buildings collapsed. Phone lines were down in Petit Trou de Nippes, the epicenter of the quake. No news emerged immediately from that city, leaving Haitian officials to fear for the worst.

But doctors said hospitals were overwhelmed. A building housing medical students, hospital interns and two doctors had collapsed, trapping those who were most needed to provide aid, said Dr. James Pierre, a surgeon at the general hospital of Les Cayes, also known as the Hospital Immaculée Conception. The State Department’s internal assessment of the earthquake was bleak. Up to 650,000 people experienced “very strong” tremors with an additional 850,000 affected by “strong shaking,” leaving thousands of buildings at risk of damage and possible collapse, according to the assessment, shared by a State Department official. What does this mean for the country? This earthquake could not have come at a worst time for Haiti, which never recovered from the 2010 earthquake that killed some 300,000 people and leveled much of Port-au-Prince. The southern peninsula, where the earthquake hit, is also still recovering from Hurricane Matthew, which hit the country in 2016. The country of 11 million is also recovering from political turmoil. Haiti has been in the throes of a political crisis since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated on July 7, and the government is not financially equipped to take care of repairs.

‘The streets are filled with screaming’: Scenes from Haiti after the quake. A home in Les Cayes damaged in Saturday’s earthquake. Credit... Delot Jean/Associated Press Archdeacon Abiade Lozama of a regional Episcopal Church in Haiti was welcoming teachers and parents to discuss plans to return to school on Saturday when the earthquake struck Les Cayes. Everyone ran outside, looking for an open space free of trees or buildings that could collapse. He said he walked from the school to the town center and saw only a handful of houses that did not have damage. “The streets are filled with screaming,” he said. “People are searching, for loved ones or resources, medical help, water.” Les Cayes was hit hard by Saturday’s earthquake, which came about a month after the assassination of Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, forced the country into a political crisis. “People are sitting around waiting for word, and there is no word — no word from their family, no word on who will help them,” he said. “When such a catastrophe happens, people wait for word or some sort of confidence from the state. But there’s nothing. No help.” Archdeacon Lozama had planned for a joyous day to discuss pandemic reopenings but that was derailed. “Today was supposed to be a day of hope, of meetings with teachers and students to plan for returning to school,” Archdeacon Lozama said. In Jérémie, another area hit hard by the quake, the collapse of an old cathedral — a Haitian landmark — was a chilling throwback to 2010, when a cathedral in Port-au-Prince, the capital, was destroyed during an earthquake that has scarred the nation since. That cathedral, which has yet to be restored, is a symbol of the many devastations the country has faced and of the government’s inability to help its own population, one of the most destitute in the world. The main supermarket in Les Cayes collapsed, leaving the population of about half a million with dwindling supplies and worries that eventually there would be looting and fighting over basics like drinking water. The local hospitals — already underfunded — were overwhelmed with casualties. The magnitude-7.2 quake snapped the underground pipes of Les Cayes, flooding the streets. Dr. Fatima Geralde Joseph said she tried to rush over to the clinic where she works to start helping, but she could not cross the flooded streets and eventually had to return home. Others interviewed said there were aftershocks as strong as magnitude 5.2 every 10 minutes, setting off panic among the population. Maria Abi-Habib and

Ralph Tedy Erol/EPA, via Shutterstock When Gepsie Metellus got the news from a cousin on Saturday morning that a powerful earthquake had rocked Haiti, she made a panicked call from her home in Miami to her husband, who had traveled to Port-au-Prince on Thursday for a visit. As she dialed his number, her thoughts returned in terror to the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that devastated Haiti 11 years ago. “It’s taking me back to visions of 2010,” said Ms. Metellus, executive director of Sant La, a Haitian neighborhood center in Miami. “We’re just bracing ourselves, just bracing ourselves for really terrible news.” She was able to contact her husband, who was safe, but for some, the agony of not knowing the fate of their loved ones continued through the day. Members of the Haitian diaspora in the United States spoke on Saturday of making anxious calls to relatives and friends in the Caribbean nation, and U.S.-based aid organizations were struggling to assess the scope of the damage and to connect with their people on the ground. “All circuits are busy — circuits are really, really overwhelmed right now,” said Elizabeth Campa, an adviser with Zanmi Lasante, a health care provider in Haiti, and a sister organization of the Boston-based organization Partners in Health. “We are still trying to desperately get a hold of the staff,” said Skyler Badenoch, chief executive of Hope for Haiti, a U.S.-based organization that works to reduce poverty in Haiti. By Saturday afternoon, the organization had been able to account for 45 of its 60 staff members in Haiti. Of those who reported themselves safe, many had experienced major damage to their homes. Commissioner Jean Monestime of Miami-Dade County said he had fielded calls all day from constituents desperately trying to reach family members in Haiti. “People are still in disbelief that Haiti is experiencing yet another disaster,” he said, adding that he and other Haitian American elected officials were working to organize response efforts. “What the assessment has been so far in terms of casualty and the effort for search and rescue — there’s not much that we are learning as of yet,” Mr. Monestime said. For those watching anxiously from the U.S., the political turbulence in the weeks following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse of Haiti raised additional concerns about the prospect of recovery from Saturday’s earthquake. “All this against the backdrop of a country where gangs are running amok, a country with no functioning government,” said Ms. Metellus, adding, “Everyone’s feeling this collective sense of anxiety, of frustration, of fear, of déjà vu.”

Social media posts from the quake-damaged area of Haiti help convey the disaster’s scope. A damaged building in Les Cayes on Saturday. Credit... Delot Jean/Associated Press With phone lines down and roadways disrupted or gang-controlled, news organizations and emergency officials scrambled to try to gain access to the parts of Haiti damaged by a powerful earthquake on Saturday morning. Port-au-Prince, the capital, is 80 miles west from the quake’s epicenter, near Les Cayes — and some four and half hours away by car. The flight time from Port-au-Prince to Les Cayes is only 30 minutes. News services like The Associated Press tried to get reporters on medical or charter flights to document the state of the stricken region. News photographs and reports began filtering through by Saturday afternoon, but in the interim, social media became a pivotal source of information about the earthquake’s devastation, supplying images and videos. One video being picked up by multiple reporters and media outlets online shows the destruction of multiple houses and buildings as people try to help those that might be caught under the rubble. #NEW: Images reveal mass destruction following the 7.2 earthquake in #Haiti.

Entire three-story buildings were flattened to eye-level. One video showed a group of men sifting through rubble to try to extract someone buried beneath. This is not the first time that social media has filled an urgent news role in the Caribbean. Climate change has caused stronger storms and hurricanes that hit the area with more force, and suffering and paralyzing hits to infrastructure often hit social media first. Social media platforms also have sometimes served as a communications network, where families could connect with loved ones when phone lines went down and learn about relief efforts, according to reporting from The Pulitzer Center. That was true during Hurricane Maria in 2017 and also in 2010, when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, killing more than 220,000 people.

The United States and the U.N. promise to send aid to Haiti. A building in Les Cayes damaged in Saturday’s earthquake. Credit... Ralph Tedy Erol/EPA, via Shutterstock Hours after the earthquake hit Haiti, the Biden administration, the United Nations and private relief agencies that operate in Haiti promised urgent help. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received a briefing on Saturday morning about the Haiti earthquake while they were at a meeting discussing Afghanistan, according to the White House. The president authorized an immediate response, The Associated Press reported, and named the USAID administrator, Samantha Power, as the senior official coordinating the effort. Ms. Power said in a Twitter post that USAID was “moving urgently to respond” and that experts were on the ground assessing damage and needs. In a tweet, the United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, said that the U.N. “is working to support rescue and relief efforts.” There was no outline of what the responses might look like as damage on the ground continues to be evaluated and the death toll continues to rise. “While it will take days to assess the full scale of the damage, it is clear that this is a massive humanitarian emergency,” said Leila Bourahla, Save the Children’s Haiti country director. “We must respond quickly and decisively.” UNICEF, a branch of the U.N., said in a statement that it was working with government and non-goverment organizations to evaluate what was needed. The agency said it has offices in the south of Haiti and staff members on the ground were making assessments in order to prioritize urgent needs and provide assistance to affected populations.

CORE deployed two teams Saturday, one of which is a mobile medical team, according to a statement from the organization. But getting aid to those who need it in Haiti isn’t easy. An influx of foreign aid and peacekeeping forces after the 2010 earthquake appeared to only worsen the country’s woes and instability. The international community has pumped $13 billion of aid into the country over the last decade, and instead of the nation-building the money was supposed to achieve, Haiti’s institutions have become further hollowed out in recent years. The aid has propped up the country and its leaders, providing vital services and supplies in a country that has desperately needed vast amounts of humanitarian assistance. But it has also left the government with few incentives to carry out the institutional reforms necessary to rebuild the country, allowing corruption, violence and political paralysis to go unchecked.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The 10 family members from three generations shared a three-bedroom house in the farming village of Bulus Wetan about 10 miles south of the city of Yogyakarta. Kimi’s father, Mr. Debiyantoro, earned the equivalent of about $190 a month at his hotel job and would have gone unpaid had he taken sick leave.

Kimi had two benign growths on her neck called hemangiomas, which by themselves would not have made her susceptible to Covid. But the treatment she received for them might have left her more vulnerable to the disease.

Her parents didn’t realize she was suffering from Covid until her hemangioma treatment, when the doctor recognized her symptoms.

“I am strong but I didn’t think about Kimi, who was still a baby and had an illness,” her father said sadly. “I only realized this after she was hospitalized.”

When it came time to bury Kimi, other villagers were so fearful of the disease that they blocked the entrance to the cemetery with bamboo poles so she could not be interred there. Upset and angry, her parents buried her on adjacent land owned by a relative.

“I hope it was only the body being rejected and that her soul is resting in peace,” Mr. Debiyantoro said after praying over her grave. “She has a final resting place even though she’s all by herself. We didn’t abandon her.”

Ari Eitan, the vice president of research at Intezer, a New York-based company that specializes in the comparison of codes in different cyberweapons, also said there was a strong link between the tools and methods used in the July train hack and past hacks claimed by Indra.

“They share code genes that were not seen anywhere else but in these attacks, and the files used last July are an updated and improved version of those used in 2019 and 2020,” he said. “Based on the code connections, it’s safe to assume the same group is behind all attacks.”

Indra first surfaced on social media shortly before its first hacking claim in 2019 and has since posted in English and Arabic. It has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks targeting companies linked to Iran and its proxies, like Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.

The group’s Twitter account says its mission is to “bring a stop to the horrors of QF and its murderous proxies in the region,” referring to the Quds Force — the foreign-facing branch of the Revolutionary Guards — and the proxy militias it oversees around the Middle East.

On the day of the train attack, an announcement appeared on electronic timetable boards at railroad stations across Iran saying: “Long delays due to cyberattacks.” The message itself was the work of the hackers and, in a sardonic twist, it advised confused travelers to seek more information by calling 64411, the office number of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

A day later, the Iranian Transportation Ministry’s computer system was also hacked, severely disrupting operations. In both attacks, similar notices popped up on computer screens making clear that it was a hack, though there was no mention of Indra in the claims.

Little known outside France, Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, the clueless hero of the “OSS 117” spy spoof movie series, is part of France’s pop culture. People quote from the films. Students at top universities debate his significance. The films represent a fading imperial power able to laugh at itself, and at its own struggle to adapt to a changing world.

Children are particularly likely to die from Covid in Indonesia. One big reason is poverty. A couple grieving for their daughter in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, last month. The 22-month-old died of Covid-19. Credit... Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times Wealthy countries have gotten used to the idea that children are extremely rare pandemic victims. In the United States and Europe, people under 18 have accounted for about one of every 1,500 reported Covid-19 deaths. But the toll in less developed countries tells a different story. Across Indonesia, for instance, children have fallen victim to the coronavirus in alarming numbers, with a striking increase since June, when the more contagious Delta variant of the virus began taking hold. Researchers point to many reasons children would be more likely to die in developing countries, but many of those factors boil down to a single one: poverty. The pandemic has killed at least 1,245 Indonesian children and the biggest recent jump has been among those under age 1, said Dr. Aman Bhakti Pulungan, head of the Indonesian Pediatric Society. The true rate is impossible to discern, because testing is limited and many Covid-19 deaths have gone uncounted. Still, the pediatric society’s figures suggest that about one of every 88 officially counted deaths in the country has been that of a child. Dera Menra Sijabat , Richard C. Paddock and Read more

The U.S. is preparing a plan to offer vaccine boosters as early as fall. A man waiting to receive his second shot of a vaccine. The first booster shots would most likely go to nursing home residents and health care workers. Credit... Christopher Occhicone for The New York Times With a stockpile of at least 100 million doses at the ready, Biden administration officials are developing a plan to start offering Covid-19 booster shots to some Americans as early as this fall, even as researchers continue to hotly debate whether extra shots are needed, according to people familiar with the effort. The first boosters are likely to go to nursing home residents and health care workers, followed by other older people who were near the front of the line when vaccinations began last year. Officials envision giving people the same vaccine they originally received. They have discussed starting the effort in October but have not settled on a timetable. While many outside experts argue there is no proof yet that the vaccines’ high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization is waning in the United States, administration officials say they cannot afford to put off figuring out the logistics of providing boosters to millions of people. The spotty nature of the nation’s disease-reporting network makes the question of timing even trickier. The effort comes as the nation is gripped by a virus wave driven by the more contagious Delta variant. Hospitals in states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are again swamped with patients, the vast majority of them unvaccinated. The administration is also carefully watching Israel, where some data suggests an uptick in severe disease among older adults who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine early in that nation’s campaign, according to people who have reviewed it. Some officials are concerned that even if a decline in protection merely results in mild or asymptomatic infections, those infected could still spread the virus and prolong the pandemic. Any booster policy decision is fraught, officials said, because the administration does not want to undermine public confidence in what have proved to be powerfully effective vaccines. Nor does it want to overvaccinate Americans when many other countries have yet to even begin vaccination campaigns in earnest, increasing the threat of dangerous new variants that could spread to the United States and evade the vaccines.

Australian state goes into lockdown as Sydney’s outbreak spreads. A coronavirus testing site in Dubbo, Australia, on Friday. Several virus cases have emerged in Dubbo, an agricultural area in the state of New South Wales. Credit... Belinda Soole/Getty Images With a stubborn Delta outbreak in Sydney, Australia, spreading in areas outside the city and in vulnerable Aboriginal communities, New South Wales officials announced a lockdown for the entire state on Saturday along with tightened restrictions for residents of Sydney, Australia’s largest city. The statewide stay-at-home orders, in effect for at least a week, reflect growing concern about virus clusters that appear to have been seeded from Sydney residents traveling outside the city in violation of a lockdown that began there seven weeks ago. Several cases have emerged in Dubbo, an agricultural area, along with a handful in Walgett, a small town about 400 miles from Sydney that has a large and largely unvaccinated Indigenous population. In all, New South Wales recorded 466 new local cases and four deaths on Saturday. Premier Gladys Berejiklian called the case numbers, which were the highest daily total since the pandemic began, an “extremely concerning situation” at a news conference Saturday morning. “The Delta strain is diabolical, and we have to accept and be real about that,” she said. Under the new rules for Sydney that were announced on Saturday, residents will need a permit to travel outside the city. Travel for exercise and essential shopping will be limited to five kilometers — about three miles — from home, and fines for violations that include lying to contact tracers have been increased to up to 5,000 Australian dollars ($3,685). Fines of 3,000 Australian dollars can now be delivered on the spot for breaching a rule that limits outdoor exercise to two people. In smaller centers of population, schools will be closed as of Monday, and for at least seven days only essential businesses will be allowed to operate. With Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, also in lockdown, more than half of Australia’s population of 25 million people is now required to stay at home as the country races toward vaccination for an escape. And the vaccination rate is increasing. At the current pace, 70 percent of Australia’s population over the age of 16 will have received at least the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by Sept. 25, with New South Wales on track to reach that milestone on Sept. 7. About 25 percent of adults are fully vaccinated nationwide and about 50 percent have received a single dose, according to the Australian government. Read more

Oregon and Hawaii, two highly vaccinated states, are seeing their highest case numbers of the pandemic. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, left, visited the Bly Fire Camp on the southern edge of the Bootleg Fire in Klamath County in late July. Credit... Arden Barnes/The Herald and News, via Associated Press Oregon will deploy at least 500 National Guard troops to help its hospitals deal with a flood of coronavirus patients, as the state faces its largest wave of infections in the pandemic, the state’s governor said on Friday. The governor, Kate Brown, said that hospitals were at risk of becoming overwhelmed, with 733 Oregonians hospitalized with severe cases of Covid-19, including 185 in intensive care. The surge comes despite Oregon’s relatively high rate of vaccination, a fact that Ms. Brown noted in a videotaped address. “I know this is not the summer many of us envisioned with over 2.5 million Oregonians vaccinated against Covid-19,” Ms. Brown said. “The harsh and frustrating reality is that the Delta variant has changed everything.” Ms. Brown said that up to 1,500 National Guard members could be deployed to help at hospitals around the state, and that she had reached out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for further support and funding. The highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus has driven infections and hospitalizations to all-time highs in some Southern states, so much so that “pandemic of the unvaccinated” has become Biden administration shorthand for the latest wave. But it has also begun to hammer states with relatively high rates of vaccination, like Oregon and Hawaii. In recent days, those two states have recorded their highest number of cases since the start of the pandemic. The seven-day average of cases in Hawaii has been above 500 for nearly a week, about double the peak the state reached in August 2020. Oregon narrowly surpassed its highest previous average, reaching a seven-day average of 1,540 cases on Thursday, according to a New York Times database. Over the past two weeks, hospitalizations have risen nearly 130 percent in Oregon and 140 percent in Hawaii. This week Ms. Brown announced a statewide indoor mask mandate, which took effect on Friday. Under the new rules, everyone older than 5 needs to wear a mask in most indoor settings; children older than 2 will need to wear them on public transportation. Hawaii has had the country’s fewest reported cases per capita for most of the pandemic. But this week, Gov. David Ige imposed new social distancing and gathering restrictions. Before that, Mr. Ige announced that state and county employees would have to show proof of vaccination by Monday or be tested weekly. The vast majority of people hospitalized with Covid-19 in Hawaii had not been vaccinated, according to a message on Twitter from the state’s lieutenant governor on Tuesday. Also this week, the police in Honolulu arrested two travelers accused of using falsified vaccination cards to avoid the 10-day quarantine that otherwise would have been required when they entered the state. Officials said they had acted on a tip from the community. Although Hawaii has prosecuted travelers accused of violating quarantine rules, this is the first case involving falsified vaccination cards. The travelers in that case face up to $5,000 in fines and up to a year in prison.

Here is how the virus moves through unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. See How Vaccines Can Make the Difference in Delta Variant’s Impact In a Times simulation, we modeled Delta-driven Covid outbreaks in two communities, one with a high vaccination rate and another with a low rate. Their levels of serious illness and death were starkly different. As the Delta variant has grown to become dominant in the United States — now making up almost all new coronavirus cases — and as the average number of new cases has now stayed above 100,000 for a week, many are wondering how to recalibrate their understanding of the risk they face. One way of thinking about that risk — and about the strong protection vaccines still offer, especially against severe disease and death — is to imagine two groups of people who are demographically identical, but with very different vaccination rates. One group has about 20 percent vaccination, as in some of the least immunized U.S. counties; the other, perhaps a workplace that is strongly encouraging its employees to get the jab, is 95 percent vaccinated. In the highly immunized group, the vaccine protects most of the vaccinated against becoming infected with the Delta variant. But some breakthrough infections would be expected, most of them mild or asymptomatic. Infections among the vaccinated would outnumber those among the unvaccinated simply because there were many more vaccinated people to start with. In the recent Provincetown, Mass., outbreak, most of those infected were vaccinated — because the group had a high overall immunization rate. In the group in which few are vaccinated but all are exposed to the virus, most of the unvaccinated would become infected, and most of the vaccinated would not. But in this scenario, outcomes — from the number of people who experience symptoms at all to the number who would become seriously ill or die — look much worse. Read more

A federal judge rules that Biden’s latest ban on evictions can stay in place. Demonstrators protesting evictions in New York this week. Credit... Spencer Platt/Getty Images A federal judge on Friday ruled that the Biden administration’s latest moratorium on evictions in counties where the coronavirus is raging could remain in place for now, saying that she lacked the authority to block such an emergency public health policy. But the judge, Dabney L. Friedrich of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, expressed doubts in her 13-page ruling about the legality of the policy. She said she believed “the government is unlikely to prevail” when the matter returns to the Supreme Court. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention imposed the ban on evictions on Aug. 3 in counties where Covid-19 is surging. The ban replaced an expired, nationwide moratorium first imposed last September to prevent a surge of people crowding into homeless shelters and relatives’ homes, spreading the virus. The new one is narrower because it applies only where transmission rates are high. Still, that category currently covers about 91 percent of counties in the United States. In May, Judge Friedrich had blocked the nationwide moratorium, but the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia Circuit overruled her, and the Supreme Court let that decision stand in June. On Friday, she ruled that the replacement policy was similar enough to the original one that the earlier appeals court ruling controlled the case — for now. “Absent the D.C. Circuit’s judgment,” she wrote, she would immediately block the government from enforcing the new evictions ban. “But the court’s hands are tied.” The Justice Department declined to comment. But in a statement, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said: “The administration believes that C.D.C.’s new moratorium is a proper use of its lawful authority to protect the public health.” The plaintiffs, led by the Alabama Association of Realtors, are expected to swiftly take the case back to the appeals court in an effort to speed its way to the Supreme Court, where five of the nine justices appear likely to agree with Judge Friedrich that the ban exceeds the government’s emergency powers under a broadly worded, but vague, 1944 public health law.

Port-au-Prince, the capital, is 80 miles west from the quake’s epicenter, near Les Cayes — and some four and half hours away by car.

The flight time from Port-au-Prince to Les Cayes is only 30 minutes. News services like The Associated Press tried to get reporters on medical or charter flights to document the state of the stricken region.

News photographs and reports began filtering through by Saturday afternoon, but in the interim, social media became a pivotal source of information about the earthquake’s devastation, supplying images and videos.

Just a month ago, as President Biden defended his decision to end American involvement in Afghanistan, he said a Taliban takeover was not inevitable.

“Do I trust the Taliban? No,” Mr. Biden said. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”

But in the last seven days, the single most stunning week in two decades of war, that military collapsed. Vital cities fell to the Taliban one after another. A sense of panic has taken hold. The Americans, who for years trained the Afghan forces and fought alongside them to hold off the Taliban, are evacuating most of the embassy in Kabul, the capital.

The brutal campaign by the Taliban to recapture the country gained ground earlier this year, when officers in rural outposts began to surrender. It picked up steam almost immediately after American troops began to withdraw, on May 1, and it has only accelerated since.

As the Taliban attacked cities across the country, it was clear that government forces were exhausted, disorganized and, without American support, overmatched. Many cities collapsed without a shot being fired as forces surrendered or fled.

The Afghan government remains in control of just two major cities: Kabul and Jalalabad in the east. On Saturday night, the last major city in the country’s north, Mazar-i-Sharif, fell to the insurgents. Two more provinces, Uruzgan in the south and Zabul in central Afghanistan, are on the verge of collapse.

Here is how the Taliban took over most of the country since the United States started its withdrawal:

The Taliban had agreed, in a February 2020 deal with the United States, to negotiate with the Afghan government over the shape of a power-sharing government and a lasting ceasefire. It also broadly pledged to reduce violence, suspend mass-casualty attacks in cities and not attack American troops as they withdrew.

But there was no real mechanism to ensure that the Taliban honored those commitments.

While the Taliban did refrain from attacking U.S. troops and greatly reduced mass casualty attacks, most of the other pledges have not been met, according to American intelligence and Pentagon assessments.

The Taliban consolidated its control of major highways, levying taxes on motorists. It seized several border crossings and appropriated custom duties. And it intensified an assassination campaign, killing government officials, human rights and civil society activists, police officers, journalists and religious scholars.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@And as the sun set behind the mountains, more Taliban fighters roared into the city on motorbikes, in police pickups and in one American-made Humvee seized from Afghan security forces. On top of a massive Coca-Cola billboard in the middle of a roundabout, the white Taliban flag fluttered in the dusk.

As buildings that once housed diplomats and large international organizations emptied, a group of plainclothes Afghan police officers wandering the Green Zone saw an opportunity. They knocked on the doors at one compound and asked an Afghan man there if the place was empty — it was their time to loot, the police officer told him.

It was only eight days ago that a remote provincial capital, Zaranj, in the far west, became the first to fall to the Taliban. Since then, one provincial capital after another has collapsed as the American-trained Afghan security forces surrendered, deserted or simply stripped off their uniforms and fled. Taliban videos showed militants driving American Humvees and waving M-16 rifles in the conquered cities.

At the Kabul airport on Sunday, two Marines standing on the tarmac acknowledged that they were living a moment of history. A little earlier, they said, they saw someone exit a helicopter while cradling a poorly folded American flag: It had just been lowered from the shuttered embassy compound.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@But privately, Biden administration officials said they were facing a bitter reality of having little to no influence over a peace process that now appears to be little more than a negotiated surrender by a defeated Afghan government.

Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, blamed both the Biden and Trump administrations for what she called the “devastating, catastrophic real-time lesson” of withdrawing U.S. troops from a nation where a tenuous government depended on military assistance. But she had particularly sharp words for former President Donald J. Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who oversaw a February 2020 agreement with the Taliban to end the war.

“They walked down this path of legitimizing the Taliban, of perpetuating this fantasy, telling the American people that the Taliban were a partner for peace,” Ms. Cheney said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“President Trump told us that the Taliban was going to fight terror,” Ms. Cheney said. “Secretary Pompeo told us that the Taliban was going to renounce Al Qaeda. None of that has happened.”

After taking office in January, Mr. Biden decided to stick to the agreement with the Taliban, which Mr. Khalilzad brokered. On Sunday, Mr. Blinken sought to make the case that the deal committed the United States to withdrawing its troops or facing the certain prospect of attacks on Americans in Afghanistan who were already at risk given a dwindling number of security forces who could protect them.

He called the astonishing pace of the Taliban’s nationwide rout “a very fluid situation.”

The last American personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul fled to the capital’s international airport on Sunday, sheltering in what Mr. Blinken described earlier in the day as a small but enduring mission to be located there while leaving behind a sprawling compound, stripped of its American flag, in the heart of Kabul.

Moving diplomatic offices to the airport will allow officials to swiftly depart if under immediate threat, and Mr. Blinken said it would maintain an American presence in Afghanistan as the Biden administration has promised. At the same time, embassy officials urged American citizens who were still in Afghanistan to shelter in place and resubmit paperwork to request help for evacuating instead of showing up at the airport, given reports of gunfire there.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told CNN on Sunday that ensuring the safe evacuation of Americans was “job No. 1” and said the Biden administration was “doubling down” on efforts to help Afghans who had worked for the U.S. government. He bristled when asked why the United States was not better prepared for the evacuations, particularly for Afghans who face Taliban threats for having allied with the United States.

“We have been working this from Day 1, we had to put in place an entire system to deal with this,” Mr. Blinken said. “Unfortunately none of that work was done when we came in, and we had to put that in place.”

Administration officials sought to balance the military’s logistical requirements against the impact that any hasty or dramatic withdrawal of American embassy personnel would have on the Afghan military’s effort to blunt the surging Taliban offensive.

Ordering an evacuation too early could deal a psychological blow that would speed the collapse of Afghan forces and the government in Kabul. But wait too long, military officials warned, and the administration faced a frenzied rush to evacuate thousands of civilians in what would become a bottleneck at the airport, the main lifeline to the outside world.

“Beginning an evacuation contributes to the downward spiral as there’s nothing more symbolic of the U.S. loss of confidence in the Afghan government than closing its embassy,” said Laurel E. Miller, a former top State Department official who worked on Afghanistan and Pakistan diplomacy during the Obama and Trump administrations. “Once you break the glass and pull the fire alarm, there’s no going back.”

Karl W. Eikenberry, a former top commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul, put it this way in an email on Sunday:

“Evacuation of an embassy can be interpreted locally and internationally as abandonment, akin to a military unit fleeing from its position under enemy pressure,” he said. “But at the same time, there is an overriding obligation to protect U.S. Embassy staff and citizens from harm. The Taliban advance was so stunningly rapid, I expect it was difficult to balance these competing demands.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Halfway through the meeting, a shopkeeper pleaded with a Taliban bodyguard to see the mayor. Like hundreds of others, his kiosk had been mostly destroyed by fire during the Taliban’s final push. He said shopkeepers, fearing that what remained of their stores would be looted, wanted the Taliban’s promise that they could return to the market to collect their things safely, Mr. Omarkhil said.

The mayor complied, even providing reimbursement for the taxi and bus fare they spent on moving their goods, according to Mr. Omarkhil.

For the rest of the day, Mr. Elias met with other municipal leaders, trying to get services restored.

At the state-owned water and sewage corporation, he demanded that the water supply be turned back on. When a manager told him that power lines would first have to be repaired, he told the director of the electricity department to compel his employees to return.

At the local health department, the new Taliban director delivered the same message to hospital staff. Insurgent fighters gave water to the health workers and offered 500 afghanis — around six dollars — to each of the hospital guards to pay for dinner that night.

There was some progress. Government trucks began to remove trash from the streets, and workers repaired power lines. But the new normal came with a sense of disquiet.

Nearly every shop in Kunduz was closed. The shopkeepers, fearing their stores would be looted by Taliban fighters, had taken their goods home. Every afternoon the streets emptied of residents, who feared airstrikes as government planes buzzed in the sky. And about 500 Taliban fighters were stationed around the city, manning checkpoints on nearly every street corner.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WASHINGTON — A conference call between members of Congress and the Biden administration’s top diplomatic and military leaders on Afghanistan turned contentious on Sunday, as lawmakers pressed the administration on how intelligence could have failed so badly and how long the military would help hold the Kabul airport.

Lawmakers said the 45-minute call with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken; Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III; and Gen. Mark. A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; was not particularly revelatory.

“It was, I would say, a rote exercise in telling us what we had already learned from the media and social media,” said Representative Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan and a former Army reservist who did conflict analysis in Afghanistan.

But the questioning was pointed and at times contentious, centering on which Afghans the United States would get out and how. Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, who was a State Department official in the Obama administration and a former leader of Human Rights Watch, pressed the top officials on how long the U.S. military would be able to keep the Kabul airport open to charter and commercial flights.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TOKYO — Japan stepped back into economic growth in the second three months of 2021, but prospects for a more robust recovery looked dim as the country grappled with its worst coronavirus outbreak since the pandemic began.

The country’s economy, the third-largest after the United States and China, grew at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent during the April-to-June period, recording a quarterly increase of 0.3 percent. The expansion followed a quarter-to-quarter drop of 0.9 percent in the previous three-month period.

Even as other major economies have roared back to life, Japan’s has been stuck in a cycle of growth and contraction as the country has struggled with a persistent spread of infections that has kept its shops, bars and restaurants under constricted schedules.

Currently, case levels in Japan are at record highs. The country reported almost 18,000 new infections on Sunday, with nearly 4,300 in Tokyo, which entered its fourth state of emergency in July. The declaration has since been expanded to cover the country’s other major economic centers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Zambians were “anxious about the possibility of another five years under such a dysfunctional regime,” said Laura Miti, director of the Alliance for Community Action, a nongovernmental organization based in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, that works on public accountability. That made people even more vigilant in the face of the Patriotic Front’s efforts to sway the election toward Mr. Lungu, she said.

“I think, in a way, the attempts to subvert the election worked against them,” Ms. Miti said. “I think more people turned out.”

Although voter registration was higher in Mr. Lungu’s traditional bases of support, turnout there was lower than in the regions that tended to favor Mr. Hichilema, analysts said. And Mr. Hichilema’s party generally lost by narrow margins in Mr. Lungu’s strongholds, while winning handily the constituencies most favorable to him.

As the first rounds of election results were released, Mr. Lungu issued a statement declaring that the voting was “not free and fair.”

He claimed that violence at polling stations on Thursday had kept his supporters away. Mr. Lungu posted a lengthy thread on Twitter condemning the killings of two of his supporters and railing about the effect that he said it was having on the elections.

Mr. Lungu’s Twitter feed leading up to the voting had been laced with calls for prayer and images of infrastructure projects during his tenure as he sought to portray his re-election as necessary to continue that progress. But that messaging stood in contrast to the everyday realities of Zambians, said Nicole Beardsworth, a lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg who has been in Zambia since early last month studying the election.

“I heard this from a lot of people, that ‘you can’t eat the roads,’” she said. “And what point is a school if you don’t have a teacher, and what’s the point of a clinic if you don’t have medicine? That was really the thing that turned the election against the P.F. and against Lungu.”

En Washington, la velocidad del derrumbe tomó por sorpresa a la gestión de Biden, según funcionarios, y sembró la idea de que Biden pasará a la historia como el mandatario que presidió el último acto humillante de un largo y atribulado capítulo estadounidense en Afganistán.

Ahora los afganos súbitamente enfrentan la posibilidad del absoluto dominio talibán. En las zonas que los insurgentes han conquistado recientemente no hay señales de que se hayan apartado del estricto código islamista y del gobierno por intimidación que caracterizó su mandato en los años noventa.

En el centro de Kabul la gente empezó a cubrir las publicidades y afiches de mujeres en salones de belleza, temerosa de las tradicionales prohibiciones talibanes de mostrar imágenes de humanos y de que las mujeres aparezcan sin velo en público.

LEPUSHE, Albania — Cuando era una adolescente atrapada en una aldea patriarcal y tradicionalista de montaña en el extremo norte de Albania, Gjystina Grishaj tomó una decisión drástica: viviría el resto de su vida como hombre.

No quería que la casaran a una edad temprana y tampoco le gustaba cocinar, planchar la ropa o “hacer cualquiera de las cosas que hacen las mujeres”, así que se unió a una hermandad albanesa que desafía los roles de género a cuyos integrantes se les conoce como burrneshat, o “mujeres-hombre”. Grishaj adoptó un apodo masculino: Duni.

“Tomé una decisión personal y les dije: ‘Soy un hombre y no quiero casarme’”, recordó Duni sobre el momento en que habló con su familia.
