Croatia

We Trade Our Night for Someone Else’s Day

A journalist assigned to write a puff piece about a crime of passion — in which a Croatian teacher fell in love with her Serbian student and murdered her husband — becomes determined to bring justice instead.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s incumbent on the author of a good book to provide an apt title. Would we feel the same way about Faulkner’s “Intruder in the Dust” if it were called, as he once considered, “Malpractice in the Dust”?

“Playlist for the Apocalypse,” Rita Dove’s new book of poems, is among her best. The title makes it leap from the bookcase. It’s about life in what she calls this “shining, blistered republic.”

It’s about the weight of American history, which Dove treats as news we’re still actively metabolizing. It’s about mortality. This book is the first time the poet has publicly acknowledged that she has — and has had for more than 20 years — a form of multiple sclerosis.

It’s about family, food and front porches, too. Dove’s books derive their force from how she so deftly stirs the everyday — insomnia, TV movies, Stilton cheese, rattling containers of pills — into her world of ideas and intellection, in poems that are by turns delicate, witty and audacious. Her sleepless eye for cant, necessary in all good poetry, is a bonus.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@French colonization and Morocco’s struggle for independence, which came in 1956, form the background of the novel, and Slimani dives into the complex identities that emerged from that era. Aïcha, Mathilde’s biracial daughter and an outcast at her Catholic, majority-French school, is based on Slimani’s mother.

For inspiration, Slimani turned to American western movies and the novels of William Faulkner, Carson McCullers and Flannery O’Connor. “There is a lot Moroccans can identify with in Southern literature, from the relationship to nature — at once hostile and sensual — to racial tensions, even if they’re not the same as in the United States,” she said. “I wanted to build my own Alabama.”

Mathilde and Aïcha will be back: “In the Country of Others” is the first installment in a trilogy. The second, which Slimani said last month she was “one scene away” from completing, will focus on her parents’ generation. Her mother was among the first women to practice as a doctor in Morocco, while her father, a former minister of economics, was implicated in an embezzlement scandal and left jobless and in disgrace in the 1990s. (He was jailed briefly in 2002, but posthumously exonerated in 2010.)

His plight deeply wounded the family, and added to Slimani’s teenage detachment from her country. At home, her relatives spoke French and valued women’s financial and intellectual independence, even as Moroccan society at large didn’t: “Everything that happened on the outside went against what I was being taught,” she recalled. Like her parents and many upper-class children from the Maghreb region of northwest Africa, Slimani was then sent to Paris to study. The third book in her planned trilogy will pick up around the time she moved there, in 1999.

She only got to know Morocco better, she said, between 2008 and 2012, when she worked as a journalist for the magazine Jeune Afrique (“Young Africa”), covering the Maghreb and, later, the Arab Spring. “It was wonderful, but I also realized how indifferent the Moroccan bourgeoisie is to the country,” Slimani said. “People know all about France and the United States, but they don’t care what happens two streets away.”

Her reporting on youth and sexuality at the time was a steppingstone to “Sex and Lies,” a nonfiction book she wrote in 2017 about women’s sex lives in the Arab world.

Slimani has made a point of defending women’s rights in Morocco and elsewhere over the years — especially their right to sexual freedom, and to wear what they please. She acknowledges a difficult relationship with her own body. “My editor told me that the word I use most often in my books is ‘shame,’” she said. “In Arabic, we say that someone who is well educated is someone who feels shame.”

By Nawaaz Ahmed

Anyone attempting to understand 21st-century America via its literary fiction might believe that neither religion nor politics plays a significant role in shaping the lives of its inhabitants. Politics with a lowercase p is often at work, but with a capital P almost never; and religion, one might say, is largely the preserve of Marilynne Robinson. It was clear the Trump years would place a new set of demands on the novel, though readers will not immediately recognize Nawaaz Ahmed’s debut, “Radiant Fugitives” — about an Indian American woman volunteering on Kamala Harris’s attorney general campaign in 2010 — as responding to these demands.

The story begins in a San Francisco hospital room, where a newborn, Ishraaq, is narrating the death of his mother, Seema, in childbirth. Seema’s ex-husband, Bill, is pacing outside along with her mother, Nafeesa; while her sister, Tahera, is running through the hospital corridors toward them. From there the novel moves back to Ishraaq’s conception, and explains the arrival of Nafeesa and Tahera in California days before the birth. We learn that Seema has been estranged from her Indian family for years, ever since she came out to them as a lesbian back in Chennai. Knowing that neither Bill nor her new lover, Leigh, can be the support she needs with a baby, a pregnant Seema turns to Nafeesa, who has little time left to live and wants above all to set things right between her two daughters. The sisters’ differences have only widened since Tahera, now living in Texas, sought sanctuary in an austere form of Islam.

Ishraaq’s narration, sometimes addressed to Nafeesa, is mostly a distraction. There is little to distinguish his voice from any third-person omniscient narrative, and you quickly learn not to pay much attention, for instance, as he refers to Seema primarily by name and occasionally as “my mother.” For a while this appears to be a fairly conventional story of a family confronting old rifts and even older loves, its boldest act to give us a deeply religious Muslim character.

That is, until the novel jumps back even further, to 2003, when Seema meets Bill at an Iraq war protest. Ishraaq’s tone becomes more energized, but its intimacy falls away as he follows Seema through a series of political campaigns that culminate in her disillusionment with Obama. Ahmed doesn’t quite manage to tie this disillusionment to Seema’s abandonment by her father, and it’s a relief when the novel returns to just the trio of women.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It took more than a decade, but David Peace has finally published TOKYO REDUX (Knopf, 464 pp., $28), the final volume of one of my favorite crime trilogies. There are no duds in Peace’s body of work: The “Red Riding” quartet depicts the despair and horror of living in proximity to the Yorkshire Ripper murders, while a looser trio of novels (“GB84,” “The Damned Utd” and “Red or Dead”) offers wily social commentary on what ailed and uplifted postwar northern England, sometimes simultaneously.

The Tokyo books, which started with “Tokyo Year Zero” (2007) and continued in “Occupied City” (2010), blur the distance between real and fictional crime, sanity and madness, duty and dereliction. Peace’s aim is to chronicle, in his inimitable, repetition-as-rhythm sentence style, what the American occupation of wartime Japan did to both countries. The answers are dark.

This novel structures its true crime — the mysterious, still-unresolved 1949 death of a railroad company president — around three investigators whose connections to the case have persisted for 40 years. They are all haunted by the murder to varying degrees, and as they look for solace in fiction and in procedure, they only become further ensnared in the muck.

In his best work, as “Tokyo Redux” is, Peace gazes into the abyss, daring readers to stare alongside him.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Given the narrator’s medical and family travails, the book’s general hum of infuriation is apt. But the most memorable passages in “Immediate Family” are the funny parts. These, too, are the moments when Danny is most three-dimensional: when he misses the chance to walk at his college graduation and instead stages a backyard ceremony, with the local newspaper substituting for a diploma. Or when he bashes up the family car and stops at McDonald’s in the dinged vehicle to get his dad a Happy Meal. When the book’s chronic exasperation gives way to affection and hilarity, it’s as if somebody has thrown all the windows open.

“Immediate Family” bills itself as a novel, but it is hard to place it as such. Though it is addressed to Danny, it is not an epistolary novel, nor does it have a formal conceit or a plot. It does not shift perspectives or do much to complicate the narrator’s account of events. There is no world-building, no tears in the space-time continuum. It reads like a long personal essay, with some of the tics of the genre, such as the semi-digested chunks of research that occasionally bob up: a few dutiful paragraphs on the history of transracial adoption, a list of Victorian novels that feature foundling children, a quotation from a PDF by the Child Welfare Information Gateway.

Children who grow up in severely emotionally deprived settings are often hard-wired for defiance and detachment. It is fiendishly difficult to reverse the conditioning of early neglect, which can result in impulsive, conscienceless behavior. Toward the end of “Immediate Family,” Danny begins stealing his parents’ credit card information to make outlandish purchases. He raises funds for a yearlong Christian mission trip, quits after three weeks and uses his donors’ money for a down payment on an apartment. For his sister, a painful choice presents itself. She can accept her brother for who he is, which is a form of giving up. Or she can continue to hope that he will change, which virtually guarantees her ongoing frustration and resentment — these are the emotions that dominate this book. But as anyone who’s ever had a family can attest, they are often inextricable from love.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The slightly directionless, unnamed narrator of Katie Kitamura’s fourth novel, “Intimacies,” takes a job as a translator at an international criminal court. On this week’s podcast, Kitamura talks about the novel, including her realization about the book’s title.

“‘Intimacy’ as a word is something that we think of as desirable, and something that we seek out, in our relationships in particular, but also in our friendships and in all the people that we care about,” Kitamura says. “But I think it’s a plural for a reason, which is that there’s a lot of different kinds of intimacies in the novel, and a lot of them are not desired, they’re imposed on the narrator. It was only when I finished writing the novel that I realized that there are multiple incidents of sexual harassment, sexual intimidation in it, sprinkled throughout. Afterward, I understood it, because a novel is really about power, and sexual harassment is of course about power, rather than desire. So it made sense that there would be these little negotiations and these trespasses and these forced forms of intimacy.”

The acclaimed writer and director James Lapine visits the podcast to talk about “Putting It Together,” his new mix of memoir and oral history about his first collaboration Stephen Sondheim, creating the musical “Sunday in the Park With George.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The title of Rebecca Donner’s astonishing new book is a line by Goethe, from a volume of his poems that had been smuggled into the cell of Mildred Harnack — an American woman who was shackled in a Berlin prison, awaiting her death sentence by the Nazi regime. On Feb. 16, 1943, the day she would be taken to the execution shed and beheaded, a chaplain found Mildred hunched over the poems, scribbling in the margins. The heavy gothic font of the German original was accompanied by the ghostly script of her English translation, written with a pencil stub.

Donner includes an image of that page in “All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days,” a book about Harnack’s life and death that turns out to be wilder and more expansive than a standard-issue biography. (A diligently researched book about Harnack was published two decades ago, by Shareen Blair Brysac, titled “Resisting Hitler.”) Donner is Harnack’s great-great-niece, so this is a family history too. It is also a story of code names and dead drops, a real-life thriller with a cruel ending — not to mention an account of Hitler’s ascent from attention-seeking buffoon to genocidal Führer.

Mildred Fish was born in Milwaukee in 1902; her husband, Arvid Harnack, was German. They met as graduate students at the University of Wisconsin, and eventually settled in Berlin. After Hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933, they started holding secret meetings in their apartment for underground resisters. Mildred was teaching English and found recruits among her impoverished students; by 1935, Arvid had landed a job at the Ministry of Economics, where he was privy to intelligence that he would eventually give to the Soviets. Whether this fateful decision had to do with antifascist expedience or pro-Communist ideology — the Nazis would later call the espionage group Red Orchestra — Donner doesn’t quite decide.

[ Read our profile of Rebecca Donner. ]

Donner pieces together Mildred’s life from fragments, sifting through government archives, interviews, photographs, diaries and letters — though some of those diaries and letters were destroyed, and the most personal items weren’t always revealing. “Her aim was self-erasure,” Donner writes; such effacement was a matter of survival. Several letters show Mildred trying to present a brave face for her worried family back in the United States. Staying meant risking imprisonment and perhaps death; leaving would have meant abandoning Germany to the Nazis. Even at the end of this extraordinarily intimate book, Mildred remains somewhat of an enigma. “Despite her wish to remain invisible,” Donner writes, “she left a trail for us to follow.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cancer mocks D’Aguiar by telling him he’s just interested in getting his name on the front of a book. Cancer calls out “that ridiculous stationary bike of yours.” I’m happy to report that “Year of Plagues” ends on a cautiously upbeat note. Cancer’s had to pipe down.

Grue is a Norwegian writer and academic who owns a shrewd, stern, pared-down prose style. His book details a life spent largely in a wheelchair, though he can walk a bit, while dreaming of freedom of motion and escape from reliance on, and the gazes of, others.

Grue, who is 40, is the child of well-known academics in Oslo. He had a privileged childhood in many ways. He was told when young that his disease was progressive, and that it would only get worse. Thankfully, this turned out not to be true. But he details a childhood spent sitting in cold doctors’ offices shivering in his underwear, wearing painful leg braces at night and trying to fit in.

He fell often, and could not catch himself. For a while, on the playground, he wore a padded blue helmet. He writes, excellently: “There are worse things than hitting your head, one of which is to be a child who is always walking around with a helmet on.”

Grue is married and has a child. His body is weak but he largely lives, as his title has it, “a life like yours.” He writes exceedingly well about his desire not to be too polite, not to be a pushover, while realizing that, as he puts it, “you cannot live in an uninterrupted battle with the entire world.” He is candid about his peppery feelings, his “hostile impulses, discomfort, ill-will.”

Grue is helplessly epigrammatic: “Diagnosis is not fate”; “Even one who is weak may despise weakness”; “The gaze of others is disciplinary”; and, brilliantly, “The search for a higher purpose can also be an attempt to flee.”

“A Life Like Yours” is a quietly brilliant book that warms slowly in the hands. A bonus is the author’s writing about clothing. Grue learns to pay attention to style and cut. He becomes a bit of a dandy.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It isn’t exactly a police procedural either, though one strand of the story follows an Inspector McClusky’s attempt to solve the riddle of why Williams shot Green. That pot doesn’t boil, it simmers. The solution, when it comes, is clever enough but not a profound satisfaction. The mystery is mostly an excuse for Lee to widen his lens, bringing in not only the ambitious McClusky but Bessie Davis, a woman who might somehow be involved. Bessie’s mother was Black and her father Native American. “Born into squalor,” she worked her way to significant wealth as the proprietor of high-end brothels, which counted “some of the great men of the city” as customers. She is perhaps the book’s most vibrant character.

Nor, finally, is this novel’s chief aim the grand re-creation of a historical figure, a life bursting at the seams. There are almost no scenes that involve Green directly planning and executing his most lasting monuments. And he doesn’t exactly warm in Lee’s hands; the book’s accomplishment is less in making us “see” him, like some kind of historical hologram, than in making us inhabit him. As Lee writes, Green was “a very particular man, and perhaps there was a strangeness to his character too, or what might even be described as an emptiness — a quality indefinable, and perhaps nonexistent.” One comes away with a textured sense of this lack of texture; a vision of someone who never comes to confidently act how you might expect someone with his eventual résumé to act. Green remains throughout, to this reader, reminiscent of a nostalgic character in a William Maxwell novel.

Lee repeatedly captures Green’s thoughtful, melancholic nature, including in a scene when as a boy he considers drowning himself in grief after the death of his mother. “There would be better years,” Lee writes. “It would take a long time to swim toward them. He wasn’t sure, at first, that he had the energy. The breakthrough was realizing that there would be days when he did and days when he didn’t, days to avoid the water at all costs and days to dive in, bold.”

When he is 21, Green boldly travels to Trinidad for a year, to work as a supervisor on a sugar plantation. There, Lee writes, he “loses the softer part of his youth.” He has been told the workers there are “newly free,” but instead finds people “enslaved in all but name.” He ends up building a Sunday school, briefly successful before it is brought down by a rumor about his sexuality.

In the penultimate chapter, Lee underscores the sad fate of his subject’s reputation: “There was once a statue made of Andrew Haswell Green, but it was crated up and lost. A laboratory in his name was built on New York University’s Bronx campus, but it became outdated and was torn down.”

Then, in a moving final scene, he brings him back to life one more time. We see him alongside Tilden, touring the construction site of the Brooklyn Bridge, where “shadows cast by the calcium lights seemed to lend a supernatural depth to the thin sound of drills and chains.” A capstone of the book’s tone and method, this brief chapter finds Green caught between worlds and between moods. “In a hundred years, as people crossed the great bridge above, would they imagine all these decades of effort beneath their feet?” he wonders. “Would they remember the dead?”

Lee’s novel artfully wonders whether we might be remembered instead, somehow, for who we were and not what we did.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anthony Veasna So’s witty and sharply expressed short stories are set in the Central Valley — the “valley of dust and pollen and California smog,” where the options for Cambodian American immigrant fathers, ejected from the stories of their lives, boil down this way: “They fixed cars, sold donuts or got on welfare.”

These families have bought the American dream but, as another immigrant, the Serbian American poet Charles Simic, once wrote, it “just hadn’t been delivered yet.”

The parents and grandparents in So’s “Afterparties,” at least, have a minimum of gravitas. They survived the Khmer Rouge genocide, which is no joke, unless they want it to be. One man comments, in the manner of Henny Youngman, that he’s suffered two oppressive regimes, Pol Pot’s and his wife’s.

The new generation isn’t sure where it fits in. Its members clown about being “off-brand Asians with dark skin.” One young woman says, “Forty years ago our parents survived Pol Pot, and now, what the holy [expletive] are we even doing? Obsessing over wedding favors? Wasting hundreds of dollars on getting our hair done?”

Book One

By John Lewis and Andrew Aydin

Illustrated by L. Fury with Nate Powell

If this were a graphic book review it would start out with a drawing of me on a lounge chair holding Congressman John Lewis’s latest graphic memoir, “Run: Book One.” There would be a skeptical look on my face. “Voter suppression in comics?” I would ask while mulling how sketches and snippets of dialogue and made-up words like WHEEEOOOOWWWWWWWW could possibly capture such a sinister and complex period of our history.

By the end, you’d see me in the same spot, a chalice to my lips and a faraway look in my eyes. The skepticism would be gone. I might say something like MMHMM.

Anyone familiar with Lewis’s celebrated “March” trilogy (whose final book is still the only comic to win a National Book Award) knows that graphic novels can handle nuance quite adeptly. This work, most of which was completed by Lewis and his team of collaborators before he died in the summer of 2020, picks up where “March” left off, with the civil rights movement winning important legislative gains in the 1960s but still very much unfinished in its aims. There’s a timeliness to “Run,” a reminder that the efforts to keep prospective voters from casting their ballots that are so much in the headlines these days are nothing new.

It turns out the animus that drives so much of our nation’s history is well suited to this form. One encounters in the arresting artwork of “Run” beady eyes, angry grimaces, looks of anguish and defiance. “Now git!” says the finger-pointing, scowling white man who emerges from a whites-only church in the opening pages to tell a young Lewis to end his protest of the segregated services inside. No need to go on and on about his disdain for those born with more melanin in their skin or his hypocrisy in praying to the Lord while acting devilish.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'm a terrible patient and an impatient nurse. I will take to my bed with a scratchy throat, texting a bossy shopping list to the family member who is unlucky enough to be dispatched to the drugstore on my behalf. (Why is it so hard to find Luden’s cough drops?) But when the tables are turned — for instance, when my husband was recovering from shoulder surgery — I assume a brusque, snappy air, Florence Nightingale overseeing a ward of rowdy soldiers instead of a kind man whose worst offense is playing hockey in midlife.

Accompanied by my own eccentricities, I ventured into EVERYTHING I HAVE IS YOURS (Flatiron, 400 pp., $27.99), Eleanor Henderson’s account of her husband Aaron’s three diseases — as she describes them, “addiction, mental illness and what I have taken to calling, inadequately, ‘chronic illness.’” I wasn’t sure I would have the stomach for Aaron’s bewildering medical conditions (worms are involved; so is skin) or for her forbearance, which is evident from the first page.

Henderson begins in their bedroom in Ithaca, N.Y., where she is trying to coax Aaron to sleep as he writhes in pain from the rashes and boils covering his body. After being sober for four years, he’s chasing a battery of prescription medications with Smirnoff Ice. “He is struggling, crying out, his eyes squeezed shut in pain,” Henderson writes. “I rub his back. I kiss his forehead. ‘It’s OK,’ I whisper. ‘You’re OK.’”

Aaron is not OK, that much is clear. Over the course of the book, spanning states and decades, births of two sons and deaths of parents, he receives diagnosis after diagnosis, each more incomplete and indefinite than the last. Some experts believe he has Morgellons disease (don’t Google it); others blame stress; one acupuncturist and herbalist says Aaron has “too much fire.” There is no clear path to wellness or course of treatment. Family members are loyal but perplexed; the neighbors don’t arrange a casserole brigade. It’s hard to mobilize around a condition that has no name, trajectory or known cause.

Henderson jumps around in time, dipping into her early days with Aaron and then back to the waiting room at urgent care and then to the time she meets her brothers to spread their father’s ashes and Aaron can’t be there. You feel for him, but you also worry about Henderson, who bears the brunt of their emotional and financial responsibilities. When she’s recalling the most difficult moments, she lapses into the second person: “After many unbearable hours on the porch, as the sky darkened and you’d both talked yourselves dry, you took him into the bedroom and made peace.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When he is right, he is right with the same intensity. In 2009, he could see the strategy and incentives of the modern Republican Party: “If you have safe Republican seats in a party dominated intellectually by rigid ideologues, then your path of least resistance is total political warfare.” Substitute “rigid commitment to Trump” for “rigid ideologues,” and you have the same dynamic today.

It’s hard for anyone to read Sullivan’s words and not feel provoked. However, he is no troll. He does not write for the purpose of inflicting pain. And even his most passionate arguments are thoughtfully delivered, deeply rooted in his philosophy and faith.

In one of the most interesting (and likely most contentious) essays in the book, Sullivan addresses head-on what was probably the most controversial moment of his career. The book contains his open letter to Ta-Nehisi Coates in response to continued criticism of Sullivan’s decision, many years ago, to publish an excerpt from Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray’s “The Bell Curve” in the pages of The New Republic.

His letter isn’t an apology for his previous work. Not exactly. A writer’s “core loyalty,” Sullivan says, “must be to the truth as best as he can discern it.” At the same time, however, he both articulates this loyalty and laments it. He walks his way through the friends he’s lost and the people he’s hurt — in the “Bell Curve” controversy and the many controversies before and since — and he even wonders if his Christian faith is compatible with the work he does.

In the end, he asks Coates “for forgiveness; not as a writer, where good faith and honesty alone matter, but as a friend and human being, where empathy counts.”

The last person to argue that Sullivan has always been right in both substance and tone is Sullivan himself. He puts his own mistakes on the page. He places them in his own curated collection of essays. It’s an act of remarkable humility in an age when humility is often derided as weakness.

But the essay collection is no compendium of wrongs. Sullivan at his best is very powerful indeed. He could see the looming threat of American authoritarianism. In 2005 he wrote this prescient warning: “An ideologically polarized country, in which one party uses big government for its own moral purposes and the other wields it for its own, is not one that can long maintain a civil discourse.” The consequence? “Politics becomes war.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Just as the self-congratulatory domestic narrative centers on the ineluctable expansion of freedom ‘from sea to shining sea,’” Bacevich writes, “so, too, the narrative of America abroad emphasizes the spread of freedom to the far corners of the earth.” America’s account of its foreign policy, he notes, is “even less inclined than the domestic narrative to allow room for ambiguity and paradox,” and it excludes “disconcerting themes such as imperialism, militarism and the large-scale killing of noncombatants.” He finds a dissonance between windy rhetoric and harsh reality even in “the good war” 80 years ago, which was by no means so good for all Americans, or all countries.

Starting in 1942, Bacevich reminds us, Frank Capra made “Why We Fight,” a series of seven government-sponsored documentary movies that gave “a greatly simplified account of the origins of World War II” and described “a people deeply devoted to liberty and equality for all.” An addendum to those movies was called “The Negro Soldier,” and quite evaded the grotesque irony that America was fighting a war against the most hateful racial tyranny in history with a rigorously segregated Army, with that “Negro soldier” mostly kept in menial roles.

And maybe World War II has distorted the American perspective ever since. When President Biden speaks of “the strength and audacity that took us to victory in two world wars,” he forgets that the United States entered those wars belatedly (and in the second case involuntarily), and it succeeded largely thanks to the ordeals endured by others. The first war against Germany was won by the blood sacrifice of the French and British Armies, the second by the blood sacrifice of the Red Army, with American casualties modest by comparison, and the crucial American contribution in both cases financial. Since then, when has the United States actually won a war? From the stalemate in Korea to the latest failures it’s hard to see any clear victory.

What Americans have failed fully to recognize is what might be called the impotence of great might. In the heyday of the Cold War two vast superpowers faced each other, each armed with an immense array of nuclear warheads. It seemed that no other country could possibly prevail against either. But what actually happened? The Americans were humiliated in Vietnam by one ragtag peasant army and the Russians were humiliated in Afghanistan by another. And in both cases the effect on national self-confidence was grievous. The Afghan adventure destroyed the morale of the Red Army before precipitating the collapse of the Soviet Union, and by the 1970s the U.S. Army in Vietnam could have been described in the words an 18th-century English general used of his own army, “in a state of licentiousness which must render it formidable to everyone but the enemy.”

Some of Bacevich’s points are the sharper for being personal: Recalling the atrocious use of defoliants in Vietnam, he adds ruefully that “the high incidence of prostate cancer among Vietnam veterans (myself included) has been traced to their probable exposure to Agent Orange.” “After the Apocalypse” is offered, he says, “not for my own contemporaries but for those who will inherit the muddle we have made.” And what a bunch we contemporaries are! Compare us with our predecessors. In my own country, every prime minister from 1940 to 1963 — Churchill, Attlee, Eden and Macmillan — had formerly served as an infantry officer in the Great War, whereas in 2003 we were taken into the Iraq war by Tony Blair and a government of more than a hundred ministers, not one of whom had ever performed any military service whatever.

By Andrea Wang

As a child, I read every book I could get my hands on from the children’s section of the Brooklyn Public Library, starting with A and working my way through to Z. But much as I loved Anne Shirley of Green Gables, Jo March, Harriet the Spy and Nancy Drew, a part of me was searching for another Chinese American girl like myself. I didn’t find her. So it was with pleasure that I read Andrea Wang’s debut middle grade novel, “The Many Meanings of Meilan.”

After seventh grader Meilan Hua’s beloved grandmother dies, a family fight erupts that results in Meilan, her parents and her grandfather moving from Boston’s Chinatown to rural Ohio. They are “like the water in the Niagara River — rushing away from the source of our strength and dropping over the edge only to splash down in some strange place.” The only Asian American in her new school, Meilan never imagined there could still be places like this, where she is “one drop of paint on a white canvas.” She is promptly renamed Melanie without her consent by the principal, whom she sees as a fox demon, and becomes a “new-made creature, this Melanie, half this and half that, half here and half nowhere at all.”

Wang (whose picture book “Watercress” taps similar themes) creates a rich imaginary world for her heroine. Even as Meilan navigates microaggressions and racism in addition to the usual trials facing a new student entering an insular community, her inner landscape is populated by a Chinese phoenix, a tree spirit, a snake sprite. When she realizes there are several homophones of her Mandarin name, she adopts them, fracturing her identity into Mist, who knows how to be invisible; Basket, the carrier of her parents’ dreams; and Blue, who acknowledges her true thoughts and emotions. It is only at the end of the book that these variations “spin and weave together, coalescing into a shimmery human-shaped form. A me-shaped form.”

Throughout, I delighted in the ways Meilan is both Chinese and American. A typical packed school lunch consists of “thick slices of pork belly cooked in soy sauce on a bed of white rice.” Her mother spouts wise aphorisms such as “Trees desire peace, but wind never stop.” On the first anniversary of Meilan’s grandmother’s death, the family cooks a ritual feast to honor her spirit. And yet the book that means the most to Meilan is one she’s assigned in English class: Ursula Le Guin’s “A Wizard of Earthsea,” in which Ged (the wizard) makes himself whole by naming his shadow and knowing his true self.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@THE LAST CUENTISTA

By Donna Barba Higuera

The world is ending. It’s 2061 and a solar flare has pushed Halley’s comet onto a collision course with Earth. Only a handpicked group of scientists, builders and politicians can escape the ticking time bomb of a planet, on luxury spacecrafts. Much to her relief — and deep survivor’s guilt — Petra Peña; her brother, Javier; and their two supersmart scientist parents are selected. They expect to be put into hypersleep for the 380-year journey, kept alive by multiple generations of caretakers, or “Monitors,” until they reach their new planet.

If you think sending a group of traumatized Monitors into space, isolating them and giving them great responsibility and great power over others’ lives might lead to an authoritarian regime, you’re right. When Petra wakes nearly 400 years later, she finds that the Monitors have become the “Collective,” a utopian (read: dystopian) society that has eradicated all difference and conflict. They’ve also eradicated the past, by erasing everyone’s memories. Well, almost everyone’s. Thanks to a malfunction, Petra’s remains intact.

“The Last Cuentista,” by Donna Barba Higuera (whose debut novel, “Lupe Wong Won’t Dance,” was a Pura Belpré honoree), certainly veers into the dark end of middle grade fiction, with brainwashing, “purging” (murder, though always off-page) and, yes, the destruction of our entire planet. But it doesn’t dwell in the darkness, preferring to give its readers healthy doses of hope, wonder and page-turning action.

The premise is exciting. The world-building is simultaneously grounded and imaginative: A brief reference to “the great pandemic from back in the ’20s” anchors us in time; glimpses of water butterflies and alien chinchillas spark awe; descriptions of the Collective are specific enough to feel chillingly realistic. And like any dystopian novel worth its salt, this story has a lot to say about power, peace and the danger of a worldview — or dogma, a word the narrative helpfully introduces to young readers — that seeks to bury the past and decimate difference.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Do you see your poetry as having evolved over the course of your career? In what ways?

I don’t like to look back at what I’ve done; unlike Yeats, who was notorious for tweaking earlier poems, I try not to revise a poem once it’s appeared in a book. But when I was compiling my “Collected Poems,” the entire trajectory of my artistic life was laid out before me: I couldn’t avoid it. How fearless those early poems were! P.C. issues, sensitivity and discretion be damned: If the poem called, I answered, bold and clear. And the surrealism! There were elephants walking through a Midwestern neighborhood, Jefferson’s statue stalking the reflecting pool. After those stark dreamscapes, the poems became more lyrical; then narrative crept in — first as a frame, then a container that became more and more pliable, like a vase in constant re-contouring on the potter’s wheel. Writing a novel led to more elasticity in the poems, a loosening of the line. My musical training — cello, viola da gamba, classical voice — manifested in longer lines, loopier syntax; when my husband and I started taking ballroom dance lessons, the poems learned to relax into song, became more buoyant — at least, that’s my hope!

If you were to write something besides poetry, what would it be?

Plays. Without a doubt, I would be a playwright. My brother and I wrote radio plays when we were tweens. My father would hook a mic to the stereo system and we’d abscond to the kitchen to broadcast each freshly brewed concoction, our all-suffering parents listening from the living room as we plowed through implausible plot twists using exclamatory dialogue and deploying the obligatory sound effects, courtesy of the kitchen faucet — waterfalls and rushing rivers figured heavily in our story lines. I think I read as many plays in high school as novels; thanks to that early exposure to Shakespeare, I read theatrical scripts as easily and voraciously as poetry. Decades later I had the rare good fortune of seeing my one and only full-length play, “The Darker Face of the Earth,” premiere at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. There are few thrills more intense, or more terrifying, than to sit in the darkened theater as the stage lights rise on one’s work. I find creating a play akin to writing poetry in many ways; the strictures of both forms appeal to me. The main reason I haven’t written more plays is a lack of time — plus, frankly, the collaborative aspects that accompany the original creation. Writing the script is exhilarating; dealing with directors and producers and set designers and actors, not so much. It’s frustrating to relinquish control of the text to interpretations or representations that may possibly alter the original intent; but a play needs to be produced in order to come alive, a process that involves compromises and budgets and effective teamwork — mechanisms that are anathema to the introvert in me.

What books do you find yourself returning to again and again?

I mentioned Dante’s “Inferno” but not the equivocating “Purgatorio” or his “Paradiso,” which kind of plods along. James Merrill’s “The Changing Light at Sandover” is a modern-day “Inferno” that delights me more each time I return to its Ouija-driven Valhalla of characters. Boccaccio’s “Decameron” — another welcome exercise in pandemic reading. The Icelandic saga of “Grettir the Strong,” which I read aloud to my husband a number of years ago as we circumnavigated Iceland in a motor home during a nightless midsummer week, then revisited the choicer passages a few months later, back in Iceland during the daylight-deprived December solstice. It’s an amazing epic — as revenge-driven as the Greeks, with fight scenes rivaling today’s superhero action films; but there’s a little “Phantom of the Opera” in the mix. (Grettir is a foul-tempered hulk who can slay a boatload of men, then bust a rhyme about his deeds; but he’s also plagued by an undeserved curse and becomes a hunted outlaw who’s afraid of the dark, doomed to a peripatetic and lonely existence.) Bleak, modernist stuff! And yet revisiting that litany of betrayals and cruelties never fails to stir my spirits.

What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?

Poetry, of course. Literary fiction. Mysteries. The German Novelle. Drama. Nonfiction has to be not only enlightening, but beautifully written. I avoid philosophy, abhor economics. I grow impatient with memoirs, but that’s probably because I’m currently hip-deep into writing my own.

How do you organize your books?

By genre, then alphabetically by author. There are designated shelves for my former students’ works — again, alphabetically by author, but the genres are mixed.

What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?

“High Fashion Sewing Secrets.” “Return of the Bunny Suicides.” “Star Wars Origami.”

Do books serve a moral function, in your view? How so?

I don’t see how they could not. If we identify and interact with characters, even if we despise them or deplore their ethics, we have entered into a moral arena; their actions invite moral judgments. To empathize with a protagonist whose beliefs and customs are different from ours is to see the world from another’s viewpoint — and that kind of intimate understanding definitely serves a moral function.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Spencer Ackerman’s barnburner of a new book, “Reign of Terror,” reminded me of that moment in 2015 (remember then?) when Donald J. Trump descended his golden escalator to announce his long-shot candidacy for the highest office. Instead of starting with the usual heartwarming clichés about the country’s better angels, Trump came out swinging, declaring that the United States was in trouble: “When was the last time the U.S. won at anything?”

It certainly hadn’t been winning any of the wars it had been fighting for more than a decade. Ackerman contends that the American response to 9/11 made President Trump possible. The evidence for this blunt-force thesis is presented in “Reign of Terror” with an impressive combination of diligence and verve, deploying Ackerman’s deep stores of knowledge as a national security journalist to full effect. The result is a narrative of the last 20 years that is upsetting, discerning and brilliantly argued.

Ackerman, who has been a correspondent for outlets like Wired and The Guardian, shows how Trump clearly understood something about the post-9/11 era that the professional political class did not. Waging endless war — on Afghanistan, on Iraq, on terror — yielded nothing so definitive as peace or victory, and instead simply fueled a “grotesque subtext” to which Trump proved to be remarkably attuned. He may have changed his positions on this or that conflict willy-nilly, but Trump, Ackerman writes, never wavered on one key point — “the perception of nonwhites as marauders, even as conquerors, from hostile foreign civilizations.”

“Reign of Terror” begins with a prologue titled “The Worst Terrorist Attack in American History” — a phrase that for years had referred not to the 9/11 attacks but to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. In the immediate aftermath, Muslims were blamed. Newspaper columnists started railing against foreigners and immigrants. The actual culprit, Timothy McVeigh, had been an avowed white supremacist, though you wouldn’t have necessarily known it from the media reports at the time, which kept emphasizing McVeigh’s “survivalism.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the months following its October release, Mr. Cuomo’s book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Pandemic,” became a source of financial and ethical headaches for Crown. Sales were surprisingly weak for a title that Crown had invested in heavily, with fewer than 50,000 hardcover copies sold, according to NPD BookScan. Promoting the book became challenging, as Mr. Cuomo was mired in investigations that battered his public image, including allegations of sexual harassment from several women. In March, Crown made an attempt to distance itself from the governor, saying that it had canceled plans for a paperback version and would no longer promote the book.

Following Mr. Cuomo’s resignation announcement on Tuesday, questions remained about whether Crown will pay the remainder of his advance. The governor’s tax records and other financial disclosures, which were released in May, showed that he received the bulk of his advance, $3.12 million, in 2020, and expected to receive the remaining $2 million in installments over the next two years. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said around that time that the governor netted about $1.5 million for the book after taxes and expenses, and that he donated $500,000 to the United Way of New York State for its Covid-relief program.

David Drake, the president of Crown, declined to comment, saying “we never comment on contractual matters or financial arrangements with any of our authors.” Robert Barnett, the lawyer who represented Mr. Cuomo in his book deal, declined to comment.

Both the New York attorney general’s office and the New York State Assembly’s judiciary committee have been investigating whether ethics rules were violated when government employees worked on Mr. Cuomo’s book. Staffers helped with tasks such as typing notes or printing and delivering drafts to the Executive Mansion, where Mr. Cuomo lives. His top aide, Melissa DeRosa, who announced her resignation on Sunday, joined video meetings with publishers and helped Mr. Cuomo edit drafts of the book.

The governor was granted permission to author the book by the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics. The commission barred Mr. Cuomo from using state resources, including help from government employees, to work on it. The Assembly’s inquiry is part of its broader impeachment investigation, the fate of which remains unclear now that Mr. Cuomo has resigned.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@THE REPUBLIC OF FALSE TRUTHS

By Alaa Al Aswany

Translated by S. R. Fellowes

Alaa Al Aswany’s latest novel begins with an Egyptian general waking up punctually, with “no need of an alarm clock,” for the dawn prayer, which he performs with feelings of “deep and genuine humility.” He spends the rest of the morning overseeing the torture of a political prisoner, though his heart isn’t really in it. He’s worried about his daughter, a medical student who has been posting videos on Facebook that show the police brutalizing civilians.

Aswany’s opening is a clever riff on the most celebrated novel in Arabic literature, Naguib Mahfouz’s “Palace Walk” (published in 1956), which also begins with a character waking in the night “without having to rely on an alarm clock.” But it’s a risky move too, since all allusions invite comparisons and these aren’t always in Aswany’s favor.

Like Mahfouz’s novel — and like Aswany’s best-known work, “The Yacoubian Building” — “The Republic of False Truths” is a panoramic fiction with a large cast of characters: generals and schoolteachers, factory managers and chauffeurs. Both novels take aim at the hypocrisies of power, especially the patriarchal kind, and show how political crises can divide families along generational lines. The climax of Mahfouz’s story is the 1919 revolution against the British, while Aswany’s novel centers on the occupation of Tahrir Square in 2011.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AMERICAN ESTRANGEMENT

By Saïd Sayrafiezadeh

The first sentence of “Audition,” the opening story of Saïd Sayrafiezadeh’s excellent new collection, is the kind of thing story writers pray for while fending off their agents’ pleas to finally just write a novel. It’s an entire world compressed into a dense instant. Just try not to get pulled in: “The first time I smoked crack cocaine was the spring I worked construction for my father on his new subdivision in Moonlight Heights.”

The story’s 19-year-old protagonist is an aspiring actor who dreams of moving to Los Angeles, but is instead trapped in “the soft, downy repetitiveness” of a midsize city and the living wage he earns from his father. It’s the ’90s: “Seinfeld” and Michael Jordan loom over everything, serving as potent symbols for the combination of overstimulation and banality that defined the era (and, in the story’s casually cosmic scope, every era). The narrator accepts an offer to “party” from a fellow construction worker, who educates him in the art of purchasing cartons of black-market cigarettes and preparing and smoking crack. The story’s structure resembles that of a sestina, the same elements — Jordan, Seinfeld, aluminum foil, Chore Boy and baking soda — recombining in different configurations throughout to dizzying effect. I’ve taught it to writing students numerous times since it was first published in The New Yorker in 2018, in an attempt to disprove truisms about “rising action” and characters “needing to change.” I would, I’m trying to tell them, prefer that the future of American fiction be more like this story.

“American Estrangement” is Sayrafiezadeh’s second collection — the first was the vivid, deadpan War on Terror-era story cycle “Brief Encounters With the Enemy” — and he writes with a veteran’s swagger and discipline. Nothing here feels obligatory or tossed off; instead, the collection joins a list that includes Leonard Michaels’s “I Would Have Saved Them if I Could,” Lorrie Moore’s “Like Life” and Charles D’Ambrosio’s “The Dead Fish Museum” as a second book of stories that exceeds and expands upon the promise of the first, confirming the writer as a major, committed practitioner of a difficult form.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Séraphin Turihamwe, the sharp-witted protagonist of Ngamije’s debut novel, “The Eternal Audience of One,” is bursting with teen angst when we first meet him in hot and dusty Windhoek, Namibia. The son of Rwandan exiles, he feels doubly alienated, desperate to lose his virginity — there’s a comically failed attempt — and escape his humdrum life in this culturally barren land. “By the time Séraphin reached university, he was determined to be a citizen of the world,” Ngamije writes. “His heart was a library of longings, his mind a hive of buzzing trivia.”

Flash-forward to the present: Séraphin is in his final year at an elite law school in Cape Town in the late aughts and the center of a circle of friends from across Africa who call themselves, ironically, “The High Lords of Empireland.” In Cape Town he finally feels “the cramped corners of his being relax and stretch as he filled out his skin.” He is now much more sexually experienced, too, rotating through a series of hookups and heartbreaks, and a regular at various local hot spots.

Despite the book’s title, though, this is essentially a choral novel, where the adventures, banter and text messages of the “High Lords” take center stage, exposing the sexual and racial politics of an ambitious new generation making their way in South Africa’s “Rainbow Nation.” Even Séraphin’s internal voices are a cacophony, as he obsesses over his relationships and playlists, not to mention run-ins with racist doormen and cops. This is a novel of youthful anxiety and dreams — written at a lively, chatty pace — that poses an eternal question: What will happen after graduation?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The story increases speed once Ramadan arrives in the Middle East. While the first half of the book, the portion set in New Orleans, spans nearly 13 years, the second half takes place over a long weekend. This section of the book follows Ramadan from New Orleans to Turkey to Syria on his quest to find Mustafa. Ultimately, over the course of the book, Ramadan meets a host of memorable characters and visits various locations around the world, from the New Orleans Superdome, crowded with evacuees in the immediate aftermath of Katrina, to the Hagia Sophia stuffed with tourists.

If this all sounds like a bit much, that’s because it is. But Edwards holds readers’ attention with his attention to language and his skill at quick, yet rich, characterization. As the plot rips along, Edwards plays the characters straight, rather than for laughs, and in the process, he presents characters who are often able to overcome their pain or mistrust of others and do the right thing. Ramadan and the people around him respond to the dire situations they face as overwhelmed people often do: by doing the best they can.

Even with so much plot happening, Edwards is adept at callbacks and uses the earlier settings and plot points to arrive at greater meaning. More than once, as young Ramadan tries to make sense of his circumstances, he recalls the words of someone who was kind to him and repeats those words as mantras that guide him. “It’s so easy,” he tells himself, echoing a phrase he learns from a tarot card reader, which, to Ramadan, becomes a lesson that the obstacles in his path are not as formidable as they appear. “Everything depends on how hungry we are,” becomes another motto, this one picked up from Mama Joon, who explains to Ramadan that it will require great effort on his part to pursue any of his dreams. As basic as some of these mantras are, they bring comfort to Ramadan and potentially the reader, who may be reminded of the clarifying power of a simple idea.

Edwards, a critically acclaimed writer who has received both a Guggenheim fellowship and a Whiting Award, hasn’t published a book-length work in nearly two decades. His new book was worth the wait. In “Ramadan Ramsey,” Edwards has written an ebullient, picaresque novel. Despite the darkness Ramadan encounters, he focuses on the few friendly people who support him. He decides at the relevant points to lean into positivity rather than negativity — and not only overcomes the adversity of his narrative, but transcends it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This lack of a distinct self is evident throughout the novel. In social settings, Mrs. March mimics the words of a former professor, passing off his ideas as her own. At restaurants, she allows her husband to order for her, intimidated by the menu. Among the few times she asserts herself is via an imaginary friend, Kiki, a double whose function seems to be to give voice to things that Mrs. March cannot. All of this is exemplified by Mrs. March’s signature mint gloves — a Christmas gift from her husband and a color she would never have dared to choose but that she prizes because she imagines others “assume her to be the kind of carefree, confident woman who would have selected such a bold color for herself.”

Behind closed doors, however, she frequently falls into bouts of self-loathing, leering at herself in the mirror as she assesses her “dented” stomach, “sagging belly” and gut “scratched with stretch marks.” It is ultimately this insecurity, this absence of self, that makes the prospect of a possible connection between her and Johanna terrifying, as it would mean everyone “would see inside her,” the “wickedest of all violations.”

Feito works hard to make sure readers know that there is something amiss in this character’s fragile mind, inviting us to question which of Mrs. March’s experiences are real and which the product of psychosis. There are phone calls from people whose voices she does not recognize, asking for Johanna. There are cockroaches in her bathroom. There is a newspaper clipping about a missing girl that Mrs. March finds hidden in her husband’s notebook and on which she begins to fixate; the girl was from the town where her husband goes hunting with his editor. And there is her growing suspicion that everyone is talking about her, about Johanna and how they are one and the same. Thoughts of Johanna consume Mrs. March to the point that, in one particularly telling scene, upon being reminded of Johanna’s character’s fictional status, she demands to know: “Then why does it feel like she exists and I don’t?”

The most compelling examples of Mrs. March’s fractured identity come when Feito breaks away from the claustrophobic Upper East Side. Determined to discover the connection between her husband and the missing girl, Mrs. March ventures on a trip to the town, where she breaks into a cabin owned by her husband’s editor and interviews people who knew the girl, insinuating herself into the girl’s home and bedroom, and eventually ending up in a strange embrace with the girl’s boyfriend. For the first time, we witness Mrs. March acting rather than being acted upon — something that is so out of character that even she is flummoxed by her decisions. This deviation from her usual pattern allows us to see her slow loss of grip on reality in a new way, without the repetitive is it real or isn’t it tactics, which makes the novel all the more intriguing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The decision in the 1938 Supreme Court case, between the University of Missouri and a Black law school applicant named Lloyd Gaines, also left states a glaring loophole; the chief justice’s opinion, Harris writes, “did not take issue with the separate clause of separate, but equal.” Black students had to be allowed to attend graduate school at a state university if no equivalent options were available at a local Black college. As a result, Missouri had to integrate the law school at its flagship university or build a legal curriculum at Lincoln University, a Black college 31 miles away. The state jumped at this chance to keep alive the “traditional policy of separate education.” It had 90 days to set up what took the university 90 years to build. There are head starts. And then there are handicaps. Some distances are hard to make up, even if moving with all deliberate speed.

“The State Must Provide,” however, is about more than inequities in higher education. It is a meditation on racism and inequality in America. The unequal lives of Black people were and continue to be further damaged by the unequal treatment of Black students in higher education. To fully understand just how unequal, we must look beyond the classrooms and courtrooms. Counties and country roads were equally decisive locales. Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, who in 1949 became the first Black student at the University of Oklahoma law school, knew this reality. During her yearslong legal fight to gain admission, she lived in Oklahoma City, 20 miles away. Even after she was admitted, it was impossible and desperately unsafe for her to live near campus. Norman, Okla., like a number of college communities, was a sundown town, where Black people faced legal action, physical abuse or both if discovered after dark. It was not until January 2020 that the city of Norman would condemn and apologize for its status as a sundown town, which lasted into the 1960s.

Harris’s writing is as refreshing as it is haunting. His sobering account of Gaines, a sharecroppers’ son who became the lead complainant in the 1938 Supreme Court case, conveys the toll of uplifting the race. His efforts set the nation one step forward toward equality, helping to strike down discriminatory policies in higher education. But it also set a family and community back. After struggling with unemployment, doubt and fear of harm, Gaines vanished in March 1939, just months after the court ruled in his favor. His disappearance remains unresolved. With great compassion, Harris reminds us that the N.A.A.C.P., whose lawyers represented Gaines, did not just lose a complainant. “I am just a man.” These were the last words Gaines’s mother read in her son’s hand. Calls to mothers when Black children are at their most vulnerable seem to reverberate through the generations. Gaines’s picture may now hang at the University of Missouri law school and a building may bear his name, but he never got his day on campus.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When, years later, it is Mathilde’s turn to ask Amine’s baby sister, Selma, to acquiesce to a conventional, loveless life she doesn’t want, Mathilde subsequently wonders how she’s become that kind of woman: “the kind that encourages others to be reasonable, to give up, to choose respectability over happiness.” Is this change in Mathilde a sign of assimilation, a survival instinct, a resigned submission? Or is Mathilde staking her right to the Moroccan home she has adopted, exercising the entitlement that comes from learning a foreign way of life? As Fatima Mernissi, the Moroccan feminist scholar, once said: “There is only one way to relate to the stranger, you can shoot him, or try to dominate him by understanding his own culture, and this is the only way to win.”

Image Leila Slimani Credit... Catherine Helie at Editions Gallimard

Early on, Mathilde decides to fast for her first Ramadan, and “her husband was grateful for this show of respect for their rites.” But gradually, she feels she’s “becoming a shadow, a nameless, genderless, ageless being,” and, referring to their daughter, rebukes Amine: “Don’t tell me that you intend to raise Aïcha as a submissive woman!” She is quick to point out that the Moroccan nationalists themselves “make a direct link between the desire for independence and the need for women’s emancipation.” After all, she reminds him, his daughter was named in tribute to Lalla Aïcha, the sultan’s daughter, a fiery women’s rights activist.

The fragmentary nature of the novel, like refracted light, allows us multiple points of entry into the characters’ lives. In her early letters home to Irène — her “authoritarian sister who had always treated her like a child and often taken pleasure in publicly humiliating her” — Mathilde hides her estrangement and alienation, inventing adventures and exoticism to become the heroine of her own story. At the hairdresser, her interracial relationship suffers merciless public ridicule (“The white woman and the darkie. The giantess and the dwarf”). Publicly, Amine exudes pride in having been willing to die for France, but, alone, he “would shut himself away in silence and brood over his cowardice, his betrayal of his people.” A white French wife four inches taller than he is only deepens his shame. Aïcha, a mixed-race misfit, is also isolated, bullied by her peers. The war heightens her anxieties, and she finds solace in the Christian prayers she learns at her French school.

For all their domestic strife, Amine and Mathilde have a genuine bond when it comes to the nationalist uprising around them: the attacks on French colonizers’ farms, the formation of white defense organizations in response. “They both belonged to a camp that didn’t exist,” Slimani writes of their shared response to violence, their “compassion for both the killers and the killed.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Like any love object worth writing about, the sisters are elusive — the most relevant census documents are not yet publicly available, and “Morris” is a despairingly common surname — so Klam is forced to cast a very wide net. She goes to St. Louis; she goes to Romania; she hits up libraries, museums, historical societies, archives (the book sometimes reads as a kind of frenzied paean to local record-keeping); she hires a lawyer; she hires a research assistant; she visits a psychic. It’s easy and pleasurable to follow Klam wherever she goes. She has a light touch, and is unpretentious, self-effacing, quippy; she is the kind of obsessive who’s fun to listen to.

There’s a strain of mawkishness and cheap pathos I could have done without, and the quips can wear thin, but those are minor sins; you roll your eyes and continue reading. Less forgivable is Klam’s tendency to succumb to a kind of speculative sentimentality — for example, divining what sort of father George Morris was by gazing at the photographs he took of his children. I get the impulse: Klam is trying to relate to her relatives, to humanize them, but the whole reason we’re here is to excise the imagined bits of the story, not add your own; she is, in effect, remythologizing them. Similarly, consulting a psychic, however interesting, is emphatically not a means of unsnarling historical truths.

Still, the overall effect is lovely. As the rumors and myths are pruned and the gaps filled in, the Morris sisters emerge and differentiate themselves, and Klam, movingly, is there to meet them.

The Attack on Big Government and the Remaking of American Liberalism

By Paul Sabin

When you’re a household name for 56 years, you acquire more than one reputation. Ralph Nader has three.

Nader first came to public attention in 1965 when he published “Unsafe at Any Speed,” a best seller that said auto companies were building dangerous cars. That’s Nader the consumer advocate. Nader leveraged his fame into a network of nonprofit government watchdog groups staffed by idealistic young “Nader’s Raiders” recruited from top universities. That’s Nader the public citizen. In 2000, having concluded the two major parties were really “one corporate party wearing two heads and different makeup,” Nader waged a third-party presidential bid and took enough Florida votes away from Al Gore to cost him the election. That’s Nader the spoiler, still reviled by many liberals for making George W. Bush president.

It’s past time to put this grievance to rest. Gore’s defeat (by a mere 537 Florida votes) was so narrow that it can be attributed to any stray breeze. Paul Sabin, a professor of history at Yale, suggests in “Public Citizens” that if you want to blame a Democratic debacle on Nader, consider President Jimmy Carter’s defeat in 1980, even though Nader wasn’t a candidate that year.

“Public Citizens” is an elegantly argued and meticulously documented attempt to place Nader within the liberal tradition. Sabin’s thesis is that Nader the public citizen was a principal architect of the adversarial liberalism that succeeded New Deal liberalism. Birthed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, adversarial liberalism was defeated in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan, whose antigovernment message (Sabin argues) acquired legitimacy partly through Nader’s spirited attacks on the federal government. “It was as if liberals took a bicycle apart to fix it,” Sabin writes, “but never quite figured out how to get it running properly again.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In February 2020, James Patterson flew to Nashville to visit Dolly Parton.

She was a fan of his “Alex Cross” thrillers, and he had a proposal for her: Would she work with him on a novel about an aspiring country singer who goes to Nashville to seek her fortune and escape her past?

Parton loved the idea. Two days later, she sent Patterson notes on the plot — along with lyrics for seven new songs that she wrote, based on the story.

“She didn’t want to get involved in something just to put her name on it. She really wanted to be involved,” Patterson said in an interview on Wednesday. “She’s not going to do something if she doesn’t think she’s going to do it well.”

In March, Little, Brown plans to publish “Run, Rose, Run,” a collaboration between Patterson and Parton, in print, e-book and audio editions. The novel, about a young singer with a dark secret that inspires her music, draws on Parton’s experiences in country music.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Early in the book, we revisit the era of medieval farmers, who, Burkeman says, didn’t even think of or experience time as “an abstract entity — as a thing.” Nature and necessity provided a rhythm for days and tasks, and they simply followed that rhythm. But then somewhere along the line (hashtag capitalism?) “time became a thing that you used,” a resource that you could feel bad about mishandling. Burkeman wants to “prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place.” (He enjoys italics.)

One of the ways to do this is to exercise a Buddhist-like detachment and acceptance. “The world is already broken,” Burkeman writes, and so is the possibility of your making the most of your time. In the face of the tyranny of choice, you can find freedom (and presumably stress relief) in understanding that “you’re guaranteed to miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer.”

He lost me a little when he wrote about time being a “network good,” something that’s best optimized among groups of people in order to “socialize, go on dates, raise children, launch businesses, build political movements, make technological advances” — but that’s only because, aside from socializing, I don’t really want to do any of those things.

No contemporary guide to time management can ignore the need to ignore our phones, and Burkeman pauses to acknowledge the attention plague. After describing his use of Twitter, he says he’s “now in recovery.” (In addition to Twitter, I’ve spent a not insignificant portion of the prime of my life playing various anagram games on my phone. You?)

In the end, some of Burkeman’s advice (“focus on one big project at a time,” “keep a ‘done list’”) seems disappointingly traditional, given how good he is at puncturing his genre’s pieties. As another example, he is withering on one page about the mindfulness mandate to “be here now.” (“It’s like trying too hard to fall asleep, and therefore failing.”) Then, near the book’s end, he counsels us to “pay more attention to every moment, however mundane.”

But part of the pleasure of reading Burkeman is that you assume he would happily point out these same reversals and contradictions. His tone is not confident or hectoring; he’s in the same leaky boat we’re in, just trying to stop things up where he can.

Despite my airport habits, there are things I want to accomplish in this life. And some of Burkeman’s modest suggestions about how to prioritize things, without simply adding stress about prioritizing things to life, seem well worth trying. And in addition to whatever help it might offer, “Four Thousand Weeks” is also just good company; it addresses large, even existential, issues with a sense of humor and an even-keeled perspective. I found that reading it — Burkeman might balk at this particular way of describing it — was a good use of my time.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In Dana Spiotta’s new novel, “Wayward,” a woman named Sam buys a dilapidated house in a neglected neighborhood in Syracuse, leaving her husband and her daughter in order to face down big midlife questions.

“She is what we used to call a housewife, a stay-at-home mom,” Spiotta says on this week’s podcast, describing her protagonist. “She has one daughter, she’s married to a lawyer. It’s not an unhappy marriage. I wanted to avoid a lot of clichés with her. I didn’t want it to be an unhappy marriage that was the problem. And I didn’t want him to leave her for a younger woman. I didn’t want her to be worried about her looks. She never thinks about wrinkles or her looks very much in the book. She doesn’t even look in the mirror anymore. She’s not concerned about that.”

What she’s concerned about is living a more honest and purposeful life, and the novel follows her efforts to do that.

Ash Davidson visits the podcast to discuss her debut novel, “Damnation Spring,” set in a tightknit logging community in Northern California in the late 1970s. Davidson describes how the book was partly inspired by her parents’ memories of living in the area.

By Tim Lockette

Geographically, Lisa Rives lives on a lake in a small Alabama town. Emotionally, she lives in that unsettling landscape of teenagers who have realized the world is a messed-up place. Lisa’s parents fight a lot and she suspects her dad is having an affair with a co-worker. Her former-beauty-queen mom spouts harmful stereotypes, for example suggesting that Lisa and her father have autism since they clearly have “something wrong” with them. Oh and that lake, around which her town of Beachside was built? It’s “fake.”

The real story begins when Lisa’s friend Preethy begs her to take over as school newspaper editor after Preethy’s friend Jamie resigns to run for student body president. Lisa is reluctant. She’s always been curious about people and current events, but only because she knows the world is dangerous and doesn’t want to be caught off guard. She ends up at the paper’s helm anyway and finds herself assigned to cover the same election that got her the job.

Faced with the task of interviewing candidates, she tells her cool new journalism teacher that one of the would-be presidents, Nolan Ramsey, makes her uncomfortable by constantly talking about how he wants to have sex with her. The teacher responds: “So what? He’s always joking about how he’d like to have sex with me too.” The sexual harassment goes largely unaddressed. Preethy even suggests that Lisa could have had “a pretty OK boyfriend” if she’d agreed to date the candidate instead of writing about him.

Lisa goes ahead with the interviews, asking questions about each candidate’s politics, a topic that historically had been off limits, and inadvertently tips the scale in favor of her harasser. As the power and responsibility of her role begin to sink in, Lisa sets her sights on covering the execution of a local man who’s been sentenced to death. Soon she’s the story, as other media outlets report on her unusual request.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ms. Gul’s truth, written without mercy for anyone involved, shocked her conservative parents who had migrated from rural Turkey to the Netherlands decades ago.

Although she was raising her children in one of the most secular countries on earth, Ms. Gul’s illiterate mother was determined to make sure the family would live as if they had never left the Turkish village where she herself had been born.

Regular mosque visits were scheduled, and the mother made sure her two daughters — Ms. Gul has a younger sister — were always veiled. All their friends were Turkish. On weekends Ms. Gul went to a school run by a Turkish-Islamist organization to study the Quran.

For her brother, 21, there were many exemptions to the strict rules imposed on her and her sister, 9. As the book tells it, he was allowed to have girlfriends, and no questions were asked when he went out. Ms. Gul, however, would be constantly tracked by her parents, who would make frequent video calls to her cellphone to see where she was.

At times, her mother would call her a “prostitute” when she wore makeup.

“For men, many rules don’t apply,” Ms. Gul said. “For women their ‘honor’ is more important than their lives, my mother used to say. But for young men it’s fine to play around before marriage. To me that’s a massive double standard.”

The most controversial parts of her book were quickly translated by the Turkish diaspora in the Netherlands. Angry messages from uncles and aunts in Turkey followed not much later, saying Ms. Gul had broken the family honor and insulted Islam by writing steamy sex scenes and mocking Turkish culture.

Ms. Gul’s brother, who requested that his name not be used, said that his family prefers not to react to the issues raised in Ms. Gul’s book for privacy reasons.

Uncorroborated

To the Editor:

In his review of “Ethel Rosenberg: An American Tragedy” (Aug. 1), Joseph Dorman states that Ethel not only knew of her husband Julius’s spying for the Soviet Union “but aided him at times, including in the recruitment of her brother [David Greenglass] and sister-in-law [Ruth].”

For this claim, Dorman relies on “strong evidence” from Soviet archives. But this “evidence” is problematic at best. It consists of a cable written by a Soviet intelligence agent on Sept. 20, 1944, two versions of which exist. One, intercepted by U.S. intelligence, was decrypted and translated as part of the top-secret Venona project. It says that Julius and his wife recommend Ruth “as an intelligent and clever girl.” The other, a translation of the same cable made directly from the copy in the Soviet archives, does not refer to Ethel at all.

The full texts of both versions are reprinted in “Final Verdict: What Really Happened in the Rosenberg Case,” by Walter Schneir, with a preface and afterword written by me.

Writers in the Kitchen

To the Editor:

When Laurie Colwin, the subject of Lisa Zeidner’s essay (July 25), died in 1992, I was 32. I was 16 years younger than she was, with a baby daughter and a marriage that unbeknown to me was about to implode. She was my friend, even though she never knew it.

I longed to sit with her at her tiny apartment table and eat her famous roasted chicken. Her voice was so conversational, so direct and funny and true; her fictional friends were like the friends I had, loyal and exasperating and there for you through thick or thin. I felt her loss like that of a longtime pen pal, even though our correspondence was one-sided. I came to her food writing after her death, leafing through my mother’s old issues of Gourmet magazine.

The Real History of the Mexican Drug Trade

By Benjamin T. Smith

It was a defining moment for the reluctant trinity of North American nations. Poor Mexico — described by the dictator Porfirio Díaz as “so far from God” — was drawing closer to the United States, Canada and the historic free trade deal that its Harvard-educated president was negotiating.

Then, on a Monday afternoon in late spring, 1993, a Mexican cardinal, dressed in clerical robes, a large crucifix hanging from a chain around his neck, was shot 14 times as he got out of his white Grand Marquis at the entrance to the Guadalajara airport. Mexican investigators concluded that the prelate, Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, had been caught in a shootout between drug lords, including one named Joaquín Guzmán.

Just two weeks earlier, I had moved to Mexico to work as a foreign correspondent for this newspaper; my principal assignment: covering the upcoming North American Free Trade Agreement and reporting on Mexico’s acceptance into the club of developed nations. The brazen attack lasted only minutes, but it abruptly ended the glowing bonhomie that Mexico had enjoyed until then. Besides introducing “El Chapo” Guzmán to the world, the killing made all of us aware of the terrifying power of the cartels.

The initial investigation into the cardinal’s murder was deeply flawed, and the notion of an unlucky crossfire or mistaken identity gave way to sinister theories involving Mexican officials. It’s unlikely the truth will ever be known, but the nexus between drug traffickers and the government has been laid out convincingly in many journalistic and academic works.

A Memoir

By Jan Grue

Translated by B.L. Crook

Taking the title of Jan Grue’s memoir, “I Live a Life Like Yours,” literally, I approached it first by creating a mental Venn diagram, testing the veracity of his titular statement. And indeed, many areas in our lives do intersect: We are both married with children and pursue demanding careers. Moreover, we each bear the weight of a devastating diagnosis and a sobering prognosis. Confronting society’s stigmas and the general aversion to anything other than what is considered “normal,” we struggle to balance others’ expectations and presumptions with our own. To slightly different degrees, we have each accepted the necessity of a wheelchair.

There’s much alignment on the diagram — he does in fact live a life like mine — but this is uniquely Jan Grue’s story, one in which he endeavors to fit his extraordinary shape into an ordinary world. It is a narrative that is compelling, unconventional and powerfully told.

Grue, who holds a doctorate in linguistics and teaches at the University of Oslo, writes matter-of-factly about the vagaries of fate; how for some of us a genetic glitch means we’re assigned paths we surely would not have chosen. Diagnosed as a child with a rare form of spinal muscular atrophy, his early prognosis pointed toward an abbreviated life span. That prognosis, it turns out, was in error. He discovers just after turning 30 that his condition is not progressive, nor certain to kill him. Nonetheless, his affliction is debilitating and disfiguring, and he is preoccupied by the physical reality that he will never have what others have. Striving to reconcile that inequity is at the core of his human journey.

The author’s Calvinist parents, both academics, raised him to be self-sufficient. They were often at odds with Norway’s governmental bureaucracy, a battle passed on to their son when they deemed him old enough to act as his own advocate. “I began to share the work with my parents, the work of being myself in the world, outside my family.”
