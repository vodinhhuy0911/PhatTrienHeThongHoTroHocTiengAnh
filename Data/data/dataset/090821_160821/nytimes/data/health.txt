One day in March of 2020, Rosemary Bily suddenly grew so tired she could barely get out of bed. “She slept a lot,” said her son-in-law Rich Lamanno. “She was wiped out for most of a month.” Ms. Bily, now 86, also developed nausea and diarrhea, along with a slight cough, and subsisted mostly on Tylenol and Gatorade.

A few days later her husband, Eugene Bily, 90, started coughing and became lethargic as well.

Had it not been for a family gathering a few days earlier, the children of the Bilys would not have suspected the new coronavirus. They might have blamed the flu, or simply advancing age. “What we heard on TV was ‘high fever, can’t breathe’ — and they had neither,” Mr. Lamanno recalled.

But about a dozen guests had gathered at a restaurant in Rockville Centre, Long Island, earlier that month to celebrate a niece’s birthday, and one by one most of them fell ill with Covid, including Mr. Lamanno and his wife.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Older adults and people with some conditions that suppress the immune system are routinely given extra doses of the vaccines for influenza and hepatitis B. That experience provides a sound justification for offering additional doses to some older adults and people whose immune responses are muted, said Dr. Balazs Halmos, an oncologist at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.

“Being very proactive makes sense to me,” Dr. Halmos said. “I would love to see the F.D.A. quickly making that stand and maybe following these countries in terms of their proactive approach.”

But other experts are more circumspect. Scientists are still unsure which groups of immunocompromised people will benefit from an extra dose.

“I think you can justify both positions,” said Dr. Helen Boucher, an infectious disease physician at Tufts Medical Center. “Germany is justified in what they’re doing, but I also feel like we’re justified in hanging back because the information is far from perfect.”

Dr. Boucher says she empathizes with patients who are immunosuppressed. But “the bottom line is we need more information,” she added.

That information has been trickling in far too slowly for some Americans.

Deborah Rogow, 70, has multiple myeloma and is worried about the spread of the contagious Delta variant. Ms. Rogow said having a doctor prescribe an additional dose if necessary would have been ideal.

For the moment, she’s on her own, and so Ms. Rogow plans to get a third dose of the Moderna vaccine next week at a pharmacy in Santa Barbara, Calif. The Moderna vaccine is still far from full approval, she noted, but she did not want to get a Pfizer-BioNTech dose without more data on mixing the two vaccines.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As of the week ending Aug. 1, Covid cases among nursing home staff members nationwide were also climbing, to 3,317, with 12 staff deaths reported that week, according to the C.D.C. data.

Staff immunization has been an issue in many states, especially as the highly contagious Delta variant races through regions with low vaccination rates. On Monday, one of the nation’s largest nursing-home operators, Genesis HealthCare, said it will mandate vaccines for staff by Aug. 23, noting “while we would have greatly preferred a strictly voluntary process, our commitment to health and safety outweighs concerns about imposing a requirement.”

Some states and cities, not waiting for the nursing home industry, are imposing their own mandates for vaccinations on long-term care employees or operators may face penalties or additional testing requirements for unvaccinated staff. Massachusetts on Wednesday said all nursing-home staff must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1, while California last week said health care workers must be immunized or be tested weekly for Covid.

San Francisco and Denver have each announced a vaccine mandate for workers in high risk settings, including nursing homes.

New outbreaks in some states, including Florida, Colorado, Indiana and Louisiana, have forced some homes to once again limit visitors and impose other restrictions. The C.D.C. said on Friday that it was monitoring the Delta variant’s infections in nursing homes to see if “additional measures are needed.”

“The bottom line is the vaccine is the No. 1, 2 and 3 thing we have to fight this pandemic, everywhere, but especially in nursing homes,” said Dr. Michael Wasserman, a geriatrician and former president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine, who has reluctantly come to believe mandates are necessary.

So far, the nursing home industry has stopped short of endorsing a vaccination mandate, even as major medical organizations have signed onto calls for the requirement among health care workers, and as more hospitals are requiring the vaccine for employees.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Federal regulators have been under growing public pressure to fully approve Pfizer’s vaccine ever since the company filed its application on May 7. “I just have not sensed a sense of urgency from the F.D.A. on full approval,” Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said in an interview on Tuesday. “And I find it baffling, given where we are as a country in terms of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.”

Although 192 million Americans — 58 percent of the total population and 70 percent of the nation’s adults — have received at least one vaccine shot, many remain vulnerable to the ultracontagious, dominant Delta variant. The country is averaging nearly 86,000 new infections a day, an increase of 142 percent in just two weeks, according to a New York Times database.

Recent polls by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking public attitudes during the pandemic, have found that three of every 10 unvaccinated people said that they would be more likely to get a shot with a fully approved vaccine. But the pollsters warned that many respondents did not understand the regulatory process and might have been looking for a “proxy” justification not to get a shot.

Moderna, the second most widely used vaccine in the United States, filed for final approval of its vaccine on June 1. But the company is still submitting data and has not said when it will finish. Johnson & Johnson, the third vaccine authorized for emergency use, has not yet applied but plans to do so later this year.

Full approval of the Pfizer vaccine will kick off a patchwork of vaccination mandates across the country. Like most other employees of federal agencies, civilians working for the Defense Department must be vaccinated or face regular testing. But the military has held off on ordering shots for 1.3 million active-duty service members until the F.D.A. acts.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The problem with the map is that case counts are changing rapidly and may surge in your local community before the map has changed colors. Even if you’re certain you’re living in a highly vaccinated community with very low case counts, it makes sense to consider the case counts and vaccination rates in nearby communities as well, because people — and viruses — cross state and county boundaries all the time.

Most experts agree that you don’t need to wear a mask outdoors if you’re not in a crowd and have plenty of distance (at least six feet) from people whose vaccination status isn’t known. It’s still risky to attend a packed outdoor concert, but if you do, wear a mask.

“I would still suggest wearing a mask if you are indoors with people whose vaccination status you don’t know, especially if you will be within a few feet of them for any amount of time, or if you will be in the room for a long period of time with those people,” said J. Alex Huffman, an aerosol scientist and associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Denver. “I don’t wear a mask indoors in all situations now, because I’m fully vaccinated, but I put my N95 mask on whenever I go into indoor public spaces.”

Should I upgrade my mask?

You will get the most protection from a high-quality medical mask like an N95 or a KN95, although you want to be sure you have the real thing. A KF94 is a high-quality medical mask made in Korea, where counterfeits are less likely. If you don’t have a medical mask, you still get strong protection from double masking with a simple surgical mask under a cloth mask. A mask with an exhale valve should never be worn, since it allows plumes of viral particles to escape, and counterfeit masks may have faulty valves that let germs in.

You may want to pick your mask based on the setting. A cloth mask may be adequate for a quick trip into an empty convenience store in an area with high vaccination rates. But a higher-quality mask makes sense during air travel or in a crowded grocery store, especially in communities where vaccination rates are low and case counts are high. Masks with straps or ties around the back of the head seal more tightly than masks with ear loops.

“All the mitigation efforts we used before need to be better to hold off the Delta variant, and this includes masks,” Dr. Huffman said. “I strongly encourage people to upgrade their mask to something with high filter quality and something that fits tightly to their face. The No. 1 factor, in my opinion, is to make sure the mask is sealed well all around the edges — over the nose bridge, by the cheeks and under the chin. So any mask that fits tightly is better than almost any loosefitting mask.”

What’s the risk of hanging out with my vaccinated friends and family?

Vaccinated people are at very low risk when they spend time, unmasked, with their vaccinated friends and family members. “I don’t think mask-wearing is critical,” Dr. Huffman said. “If you are indoors with a small number of people you know are vaccinated, wearing a mask is low on my list of worries.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Eating colorful fruits and vegetables may be good for your brain.

A new study, one of the largest such analyses to date, has found that flavonoids, the chemicals that give plant foods their bright colors, may help curb the frustrating forgetfulness and mild confusion that older people often complain about with advancing age, and that sometimes can precede a diagnosis of dementia. The study was observational so cannot prove cause and effect, though its large size and long duration add to growing evidence that what we eat can affect brain health.

The scientists used data from two large continuing health studies that began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in which participants periodically completed diet and health questionnaires over more than 20 years. The analysis included 49,693 women whose average age was 76, and 51,529 men whose average age was 73.

The scientists calculated their intake of about two dozen commonly consumed kinds of flavonoids — which include beta carotene in carrots, flavone in strawberries, anthocyanin in apples, and other types in many other fruits and vegetables. The study appears in the journal Neurology.

The degree of subjective cognitive decline was scored using “yes” or “no” answers to seven questions: Do you have trouble remembering recent events, remembering things from one second to the next, remembering a short list of items, following spoken instructions, following a group conversation, or finding your way around familiar streets, and have you noticed a recent change in your ability to remember things?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“The health needs of children have not been considered a central mission of schools,” Dr. Basch told me. “Yet there’s a clear connection between mental and physical health and the ability of children to learn.” And by not adequately addressing such needs, he said, “society is losing talent.”

Bringing health care to schools

Enter school-based health centers — facilities either in the school itself or nearby that not only tend to acute health issues like cuts and bruises, but also provide a suite of health services including primary, mental and dental care; substance abuse counseling; nutrition education and more. “They bring health care to where the children are, and they’re a very good way to provide health care to children who might not otherwise get it,” said Nicholas Freudenberg, a professor of public health at the City University of New York School of Public Health.

School-based health centers are a cardinal feature of community schools and other public schools that have increasingly recognized how difficult it is for many children to get their health problems adequately detected and treated. Such challenges may be especially acute for those living in low-income urban centers or rural areas. If a parent has to take time off from work or find a babysitter, or if transportation is unavailable or unaffordable to get a child to a medical visit, needed services are too often neglected until there’s a crisis, experts have said.

The nonprofit Paramount Health Data Project, which recently published a report on students’ health conditions in public and private schools in Indiana, found that the more often children visited the school nurse, the poorer their academic achievement on statewide tests, Azure Angelov, the project’s director, told me. The project’s data suggest “that students who are frequent visitors to the school nurse are simply unhealthy and frequently do not feel well during the school day,” Dr. Angelov and colleagues wrote in the report. “This is impacting their ability to learn.”

Although the majority of public schools have at least one full-time or part-time nurse, that’s hardly adequate to care for kids who often have complex and interrelated health problems that can get in the way of learning. For example, a child with poorly controlled asthma may avoid exercise and have trouble sleeping, which is when the brain consolidates memory. In addition to medication and routine follow-up, that child may need dietary and exercise advice and assistance in clearing allergens from the home.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Let your imagination run wild.

One of the most popular mental skills techniques is imagery training, where athletes picture themselves executing key plays — driving a soccer ball toward a goal or reeling off a flawless dive — in the hours, days, weeks and months before a big competition while calling the sounds, smells and atmosphere of competition to mind.

When Dr. Hacker worked with the 2018 women’s Olympic ice hockey team, she had them repeatedly imagine specific moves they’d need to perform in competition. To make this mental rehearsal more realistic, Dr. Hacker sometimes asked players to do it at the arena while wearing their uniforms, gripping onto their sticks, and inhaling the smell of the ice rink — but not necessarily moving their bodies.

Regular practice of this type of sensory-based imagery technique, some studies suggest, can in some cases improve sport performance as much as a similar amount of physical practice — without putting any strain on the body.

If you have an upcoming challenge, like giving a speech, you can use this strategy by imagining yourself reeling off the talk from start to finish, incorporating as many sensory details as you can. What will it feel like to stand on the podium? What kinds of sounds will you hear in the auditorium?

Stress yourself out — on purpose.

Mental skills coaches might also devise “pressure training” regimens that induce the anxiety athletes will face in competition. “I’ve worked with teams where we just pump in this chaotic music during practice,” Mr. Alexander said. “They have to figure out how to work together when they can’t hear the coach’s voice.” Likewise, Dr. Hacker sometimes assigns soccer players kicking drills on an impossibly tiny square of field to get them feeling mentally ready for tough game day ball-handling.

In a small study of college-aged golfers, those who practiced putting under higher-pressure conditions — while being filmed, for example — performed better than those who practiced without any pressure.

To create your own pressure training plan, find ways to ratchet up your stress levels as you prepare. Anxious to nail a crucial work presentation? Do a few practice runs in front of a group of colleagues. Prepping for a tense chat with a family member? Role-play the chat with a friend beforehand — and ask them to make provocative remarks so you can hone your response.

But on a stopover in Amsterdam in late May, Peter Fuchs, 87, was told he could not board his New York-bound flight to attend his great-granddaughter’s christening. The reason: As a European citizen, he was not allowed to enter the United States.

“I felt helpless and broken down,” Mr. Fuchs said in an email from his nursing home apartment in Hanover, Germany.

In June, as the United States made headway in its vaccination campaign, European Union leaders recommended that member countries reopen their borders to Americans, a significant gesture meant to signal what they hoped would be the beginning of the pandemic’s end. They expected to be repaid in kind.

Dow Constantine, the King County executive, and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan joined Mr. Inslee at the news conference to voice their endorsements.

Applications will be considered for “legitimate medical reasons or sincerely held religious beliefs,” the governor said, but not for philosophical objections. Employees will not be able to forego the vaccine and get tested weekly.

Mr. Inslee’s office said that the bill for coronavirus tests would be in the millions of dollars if continued indefinitely and the testing option had not worked well in public facilities like prisons, privately-run hospitals or nursing homes. “We’re past the point where we can test our way to safety,” he said. “They don’t solve the problem.”

Mr. Inslee is using the emergency authority powers he was granted during the coronavirus pandemic to issue the new order, his office said. The state licenses health care workers in private facilities and settings, and the governor said that the same enforcement mechanism that comes into play when a medical error or the wrong medicine is given. “This is a life-and-safety rule,” he added.

Fortunately, my months of indoor pandemic training — “Ted Lasso,” “The Last Dance,” “Sunderland ’Til I Die” — paid off. The rewards of the past two weeks have been myriad, delightful and often astonishing. Britain’s Charlotte Worthington landing a 360-degree back flip to win the women’s freestyle BMX.

For every other organism on Earth, competition is a strictly Malthusian affair: hunt, hide, grow, spawn, repeat. Over evolutionary time that tension has resulted in wondrous morphological adaptations. Velvet worms. Ultraviolet flying squirrels. Electroactive bacteria. Anglerfish and their live-in boyfriends.

Humans might be the first species for which this sort of competition has ceased to matter. (Of course, only a species with a disproportionally large cerebral cortex would dare think so.) So we invented the Olympics, a showcase of human drive at its purest and most niche. Canoe slalom. Hammer throw. Trampoline gymnastics. Table tennis. There’s meta-competition too: new sports rising up, duller ones (croquet, anyone?) going extinct.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WASHINGTON — Novavax, the Maryland firm that won a $1.75 billion federal contract to develop and produce a coronavirus vaccine, said on Thursday that the federal government would not fund further production of its vaccine until the company resolves concerns of federal regulators about its work.

The firm’s disclosure came in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Trump administration agreed to buy 110 million doses of vaccine from Novavax as part of its crash vaccine development program.

Although the company reported in June that its vaccine had an efficacy of 90 percent against symptomatic Covid-19 cases, and 100 percent against severe disease, Novavax has struggled for months to mass manufacture its product. Its vaccine has not been authorized for distribution in the United States, and federal officials said it is unclear when or if it will be.

Four people familiar with Novavax’s operation said the company had been unable so far to demonstrate that its production process met Food and Drug Administration standards. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive contracting issues.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WASHINGTON — The White House, worried that coronavirus vaccination rates among young people are lagging as the school year approaches, is enlisting pediatricians to incorporate vaccination into back-to-school sports physicals and encouraging schools to host their own vaccination clinics as part of a new push to get students their shots.

The initiative, announced on Thursday by Education Secretary Miguel A. Cardona, is part of a broader “return to school road map” aimed at getting students back to in-person learning this fall. School officials around the country are worried that a surge in coronavirus cases, fueled by the highly infectious Delta variant, will threaten the return.

Roughly 90 percent of the country’s educators are vaccinated, Dr. Cardona said during an appearance in the White House briefing room, and the administration sees vaccinating students as essential to keeping schools open. But experts and school superintendents said in interviews that increasing vaccination rates among students may be a slow and uphill battle.

“When you look at a map of the United States and you see those states that have low vaccination rates and high infection rates, those are the areas where superintendents are having problems in getting kids vaccinated,” said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA: The School Superintendents Association, which represents about 13,000 superintendents around the country.

Less simple was the privacy debate that the city reignited.

Vaccine passports, which show proof of vaccination, often in electronic form such as an app, are the bedrock of Mr. de Blasio’s plan. For months, these records — also known as health passes or digital health certificates — have been under discussion around the world as a tool to allow vaccinated people, who are less at risk from the virus, to gather safely. New York will be the first U.S. city to include these passes in a vaccine mandate, potentially setting off similar actions elsewhere.

But the mainstreaming of these credentials could also usher in an era of increased digital surveillance, privacy researchers said. That’s because vaccine passes may enable location tracking, even as there are few rules about how people’s digital vaccine data should be stored and how it can be shared. While existing privacy laws limit the sharing of information among medical providers, there is no such rule for when people upload their own data onto an app.

Local officials in Texas can temporarily require masks, two judges rule. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:15 - 0:00 transcript Dallas County Judge Issues Mask Mandate A Texas judge ordered indoor mask-wearing in the Dallas area after rising coronavirus cases fueled by the Delta variant brought the levels of virus transmission and hospitalizations to those seen during the height of the pandemic. From the date of this executive order, all child care centers and pre-K through 12 public schools operating in Dallas County must develop and implement a health and safety policy. The health and safety policy must require, at a minimum, universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to child care centers and pre-K through 12 schools, regardless of vaccination status, except for children under the age of 2 years. From the date of this executive order, all commercial entities in Dallas County providing goods or services directly to the public must develop and implement a health and safety policy.

Your personal freedom is very important to me and to everyone. But your personal freedom does not extend to hurting your neighbors, particularly at a time of a public health disaster like this. A Texas judge ordered indoor mask-wearing in the Dallas area after rising coronavirus cases fueled by the Delta variant brought the levels of virus transmission and hospitalizations to those seen during the height of the pandemic. Credit Credit... Christopher Lee for The New York Times Two court rulings on Tuesday cleared the way for local leaders who oppose a ban by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, on mask mandates to at least temporarily require face coverings to help curb a rise in coronavirus cases. The first ruling came in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. Masks can now be required in public schools and other public buildings there. Masks will also be required for county and city employees, said Andy Segovia, the city attorney for San Antonio. The chief executive of Bexar County, Judge Nelson W. Wolff, said that the ruling was important because many students who are too young to be vaccinated would otherwise be coming back to school with no protection. The second ruling was delivered by a district judge in Dallas County who said the ban prevented officials from protecting residents during an emergency. “Dallas County citizens will be irreparably harmed” if local leaders cannot require face coverings to stop the transmission of the virus, the judge, Tonya Parker, wrote in the ruling. In light of the decision, Clay Jenkins, the county’s chief elected official, said he planned to issue an emergency order on Wednesday. [Update Aug. 12: The order was issued at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday.] Dallas and San Antonio now join Austin, Fort Worth and Houston in instituting mask mandates in schools. That means the state’s five largest cities are defying Mr. Abbott’s ban for schools. On Tuesday, Texas recorded 20,000 new virus cases, nearly double the number of cases as two weeks ago, according to a New York Times database. Some hospitals in the state are nearing capacity and are bracing for an influx of patients. The intensive care unit at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in Houston is at full capacity, and 63 percent of those patients are Covid cases, CNN reported. While Mr. Abbott remains unmoved as one of the most strident opponents of mask mandates, he did put some restrictions in place in March 2020, such as limiting social gatherings to 10 people and closing some businesses, like gyms. Those that remained open operated at a limited capacity. Last July, as cases surged across Texas, he enacted a mask mandate. The state lifted the mandate this past March, citing the presence of vaccine. This week the governor appeared to acknowledge the growing burden on the health care system. He directed the state Health Department to find additional health care workers from outside Texas to provide reinforcements for overwhelmed hospitals statewide. He also sent a letter to the Texas Hospital Association telling hospitals to postpone elective medical procedures. President Biden has recently criticized the governors of Texas and Florida, two states where virus cases have risen particularly sharply, for their pandemic response. “I say to these governors, please, if you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way for people who are doing the right thing,” he said at a news conference last week. On Tuesday, he encouraged people to get vaccinated as part of their preparation for hurricane and wildfire seasons. Mr. Biden singled out Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi as states with low vaccination rates that are also more at risk from hurricanes. On Tuesday, a temporary mask mandate for students, staff members and visitors to public schools in Dallas went into effect. Brendan Steinhauser, a consultant who lives in a Republican-leaning suburb of Austin, said the rising number of cases had led more people to wear masks. “It is palpable,” he said of his neighbors’ mask-wearing attitude. “I noticed it and it was like, ‘Whoa.’” Correction: An earlier version of this item misspelled the surname of Bexar County’s chief executive.

Oregon’s governor reinstates a statewide indoor mask mandate. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:31 - 0:00 transcript Oregon Reinstates Indoor Mask Mandate to Slow Delta Variant Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said both vaccinated and unvaccinated people must wear masks again indoors starting on Friday. She warned that rising cases driven by the Delta variant could overrun hospitals in weeks. We continue to work to reach Oregonians with information and a vaccine, but it’s clear the current situation requires immediate action to stop the Delta variant from spreading further. That’s why moving forward for the immediate future, masks will be required in all indoor public settings effective this Friday, Aug. 13. Yesterday, we had over 2,300 cases reported, the highest number since the virus first landed in Oregon. Hospitalizations are also at a record high. Across the state, our I.C.U. beds are about 90 percent filled. Some of our hospital regions have fewer than five I.C.U. beds available to start the day. These numbers are because of the Delta variant. These numbers are despite the fact that nearly 73 percent of Oregon’s adults are vaccinated. Modeling from the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Health and Science University project that without new safety interventions, Covid-19 hospitalizations will completely overwhelm our doctors and nurses in the coming weeks. Without safety measures, we could be as many as 500 staffed hospital beds short of what we need to treat patients by September. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said both vaccinated and unvaccinated people must wear masks again indoors starting on Friday. She warned that rising cases driven by the Delta variant could overrun hospitals in weeks. Credit Credit... Kristina Barker for The New York Times Oregon is restoring a statewide mandate ordering both vaccinated and unvaccinated people to use face coverings when gathering indoors. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, a Democrat, said on Wednesday that masks — which will be required starting on Friday — were needed to fight rising caseloads driven by the Delta variant, and that face coverings were a simple tool to help keep schools and businesses open. “After a year and a half of this pandemic, I know Oregonians are tired of health and safety restrictions,” Ms. Brown said in a statement. “This new mask requirement will not last forever, but it is a measure that can save lives right now.” Oregon was the third state to introduce an indoor mask mandate for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, after Louisiana and Hawaii. Washington, D.C., has also reinstated its mask mandate, as have several large cities. While many states brought in mask mandates and other restrictions last year, they have been reluctant to implement such orders again. Two states led by Republican governors, Texas and Florida, have barred mask mandates entirely, though some local leaders plan to impose them anyway. On Tuesday, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said that masks would again be mandated in all of the state’s schools. Oregon has made it through the pandemic with some of the lowest numbers of virus cases and deaths in the country. But new cases have surged in recent days from a daily average of 110 a month ago to nearly 1,300 on Tuesday. With 84 percent of people over 65 fully vaccinated in the state, the rise in deaths has been far smaller, reaching a daily average of six as of Wednesday. But hospitalizations have quadrupled in the past month, with the daily average number of hospitalized patients exceeding 550.

Ms. Brown’s office projects that the state’s hospital capacity could be overrun in the next several weeks if mitigation measures are not in place, leaving Oregon as many as 500 beds short by next month. “When our hospitals are full, there will be no room for additional patients needing care — whether for Covid-19, a heart attack or stroke, a car collision or a variety of other emergency situations,” Ms. Brown said. “If our hospitals run out of staffed beds, all Oregonians will be at risk.” Ms. Brown also said that all employees working under the state’s executive branch would be required to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18, or six weeks after a vaccine receives full approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, a Democrat, announced a similar mandate on Monday.

Hawaii limits gatherings as the Delta variant spreads. Tourists gathered at sunset near the Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station in Hawaii last week. Credit... Megan Spelman for The New York Times After a week in which Hawaii reported more cases than in any other week, Gov. David Ige said on Tuesday that he was reimposing restrictions to try to curb the surge. “Social gatherings will be limited to no more than 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors,” he said at a news conference. Indoor events at bars, restaurants, gyms and places of worship will be reduced to 50 percent capacity, and masks must be worn at all times except when eating or drinking, he said. The measure, which went into effect immediately, came five days after Mr. Ige, a Democrat, ordered all state and county employees to show proof of vaccination by next Monday or face weekly testing. “We know that we won’t see benefits from the increase in vaccinations going up for another six to seven weeks,” he said on Tuesday. “In the meantime, we must take action now in order to slow the spread of Covid-19, especially with the new Delta variant, which has wreaked havoc in our communities.” Hawaii has had the country’s fewest reported cases per capita over the course of the pandemic, but its number of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 has soared from just 40 on July 1 to 246 on Tuesday, of whom 235 are unvaccinated. “That’s a pretty rapid trajectory,” said Hilton Rae­thel, the chief executive of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, a nonprofit that represents hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, home-care companies and hospices. “Hospitals are full, and then you have all these Covid patients. That really stretches our health care system.” Mr. Raethel said that the first of 550 additional health care workers would arrive in Hawaii this weekend from the U.S. mainland. Only one other time during the pandemic has the state needed reinforcements, he said, and that was last September and October. “The numbers tell us that the worst of the surge is in front of us,” he said. The state, with a population of 1.4 million, has a seven-day average of more than 500 reported cases per day and a test positivity rate of 7.3 percent, Mr. Ige said on Tuesday. Eighty-six percent of Hawaii residents 18 and older have had at least one vaccine dose, but only 65 percent are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database.

Also on Tuesday, the singer Stevie Nicks said that although she is vaccinated, she is canceling the shows she was scheduled to perform this year, because of the rising number of cases. “I want everyone to be safe and healthy and the rising Covid cases should be of concern to all of us,” Ms. Nicks, 73, said in a statement on Twitter. “While I’m vaccinated, at my age, I am still being extremely cautious and for that reason have decided to skip the 5 performances I had planned for 2021.” Over the weekend, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival said that it was canceling this year’s event, citing the rise in cases. In June, Bruce Springsteen became the first person to perform on Broadway as some New York City theaters reopened after closing 16 months earlier because of the pandemic. Before his first performance, Mr. Springsteen told ticket holders that they would be admitted only if they showed proof of vaccination.

Saudi Arabia lifts a ban on foreign pilgrims heading to Mecca. Muslim pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba during umrah, in Mecca, in May. Credit... Amr Nabil/Associated Press BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia has resumed allowing travelers from abroad to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, the kingdom announced this week, a new easing of the restrictions imposed last year to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Islamic holy sites. Aspiring pilgrims from many countries can now apply to perform the lesser pilgrimage to Mecca, known as umrah, as long as they can provide proof that they have received a coronavirus vaccine approved by the Saudi authorities, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported on Sunday. The new policy took effect on Monday. The kingdom has approved the vaccines made by Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. Foreigners who have received two doses of either the Sinopharm or Sinovac vaccines can enter only if they have also received a third shot of one of the four approved vaccines. As the pandemic spread last year, Saudi Arabia barred travelers from abroad from the main pilgrimage, the hajj, which attracts millions of pilgrims in normal years, spreading disappointment across the Muslim world. Devout Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to perform the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, at least once during their lives. Last year, only a few hundred pilgrims who were already in the kingdom were allowed to go. Foreign travelers were also barred from this year’s hajj, which was in July. Umrah can be performed at any time of the year. Allowing vaccinated foreign travelers to apply for it represents a step toward restoring the prepandemic status quo at the holy sites. The number of permitted foreign visitors will initially be limited and will increase over time, with the goal of eventually allowing two million pilgrims a month. Other restrictions, including limiting the number of worshipers in mosques and on buses, will also be enforced to decrease the chances of infection. As of Monday, Saudi Arabia had averaged 732 new cases a day over the last week, a 40 percent decline from two weeks ago, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Saudi Arabia still bans direct travel from a number of countries that it has deemed viral threats. Pilgrims from other countries must observe a mandatory seven-day quarantine on arrival. About 29 percent of Saudi residents are fully vaccinated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. Besides having deep religious significance, the pilgrimage is big business and the ban on foreign worshipers hurt companies across the Islamic world that cater to pilgrims. Before the pandemic, Jamal Ali, who works at a Beirut travel agency that specializes in religious tourism, sold a range of packages including plane tickets and hotel stays. The ban on foreign pilgrims cut his income by about 90 percent, he said. He hoped that the resumption of foreign trips to Mecca would be a step back toward normalcy. “We understand that Saudi Arabia is trying to achieve general immunity,” he said. “We are waiting for relief from God, and for this pandemic to end.”

All Washington D.C. public employees will face a vaccine or testing requirement. Public works employees and contractors are among the groups who will need to be vaccinated against the coronavirus or submit to weekly testing. Credit... Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington on Tuesday directed all 37,000 city employees and contractors who work with the city to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, or undergo weekly testing by Sept. 19. The action follows President Biden’s recent announcement that federal workers would face restrictions and requirements, including testing, if they did not get vaccinated. New York, Virginia, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, have made similar moves, while Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State said Monday that most state employees and all health care workers had to be fully vaccinated or risk losing their jobs. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:08 - 0:00 transcript D.C. Mayor Directs City Workers to Get Vaccinated or Face Testing Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington announced that all 37,000 city employees and contractors must be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus or undergo weekly testing by Sept. 19. All employees, contractors, interns and grantees of the government of the District of Columbia will be required to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Full Covid vaccination will be required for all new hires appointed to job vacancies posted on or after Aug. 14, 2021. All covered individuals have until Sept. 19 to be fully vaccinated. We will, of course, have a process for people who want to apply for exemptions, and any unvaccinated employee, even those who qualify for the medical or religious exemption, will be required to conduct a weekly Covid-19 test. We support businesses having rules for access to their buildings and their services, including masks, of course, which is a mandate in the District inside, and vaccines. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington announced that all 37,000 city employees and contractors must be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus or undergo weekly testing by Sept. 19. Additionally, the Pentagon said Monday that it will seek to make vaccinations mandatory for the country’s 1.3 million active-duty troops “no later” than the middle of next month. “We know that we have been very steadfast and successful in crushing this virus in the district,” Ms. Bowser said at a news conference. “And now we’re going to do the same with the Delta variant. The way to do it, however, is to get everybody vaccinated.” The policy falls short of a mandate, but all new hires filling job vacancies posted on Aug. 14 or later will need to show proof of vaccination. “We will, of course, have a process for people who want to apply for exemptions and any unvaccinated employee, even those who qualify for the medical or religious exemption, will be required to conduct a weekly Covid-19 test and failure to comply will lead to adverse employment actions,” Ms. Bowser said. Only 59 percent of city employees have reported their vaccine status, according to the mayor’s office. Of those, 54 percent are vaccinated. Daily new cases across the city have soared, according to a New York Times database, which also shows that hospitalizations have risen 5 percent and that there were three deaths over the same period. Fifty-three percent of all city residents are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. People younger than 12 are not eligible for the vaccine. “What’s driving our increasing cases right now is really that 25-to-34-year-old population,” Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, the director of the city’s health department, said at the news conference. “And we don’t see any meaningful disparities in terms of who are those new cases from a race and ethnicity perspective.” But Dr. Nesbitt added that there was a wide gap in vaccine coverage for that age group, with Black residents having half the rate of coverage as their white and Latino counterparts. “We are also going to do a better job once everybody gets vaccinated and helping to prevent more of these variants from taking over our communities,” she said. The city gives incentives to all city residents, including public employees, who are 12 and older, like a $51 gift card for receive their first dose of the vaccine at one of its three walk-up vaccination sites. And residents ages 12 to 17 get AirPods for being among the first 400 youths to get inoculated at school vaccination sites.

global roundup Germany will stop paying for virus tests for people choosing to remain unvaccinated. A rapid coronavirus test center in Cologne, Germany, in June. Credit... Ina Fassbender/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images BERLIN — After months of offering free coronavirus antigen tests to all residents, Germany will stop subsidizing them for adults who choose not to get vaccinated, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Tuesday. Starting Oct. 11, when the changes take effect, the tests will continue to be available at no charge for people under 18, pregnant women or others who have medical reasons not to get vaccinated. Since March, the country has spent billions of dollars offering at least one free antigen test per resident each week, which has led to a boom of privately run testing stations. Ms. Merkel met with state governors on Tuesday to negotiate the new rules, as infections, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, are increasing, albeit more slowly than in many other parts of Europe. German authorities have also agreed on new rules requiring proof of vaccination, recent recovery or a negative test for certain indoor activities, including going to a restaurant, hairdresser or gym, once the weekly local infection rate surpasses 35 per 100,000 inhabitants. As of Monday, the authorities had registered 23.5 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week nationwide. Currently 55 percent of Germans have received the full vaccination course and 62.5 percent received the first jab, a rate, as Ms. Merkel noted during her news conference, that was no longer among the highest in the European Union. “We now have enough of the vaccine,” she said. “Now we have to promote vaccinations.” In other news from around the world: In June, European Union leaders recommended that member countries reopen their borders to Americans, expecting to be repaid in kind. But nearly two months later, the United States borders remain closed to most European travelers, even those who are vaccinated. European leaders are frustrated and some have even suggested reimposing travel restrictions against U.S. travelers. The White House spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said the policy was intended “to keep the American people safe at a time where the Delta variant is rising.”

Facebook said Tuesday that it had removed a network of accounts based in Russia that spread misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. The network targeted audiences in India, Latin America and the United States with posts falsely asserting that the AstraZeneca vaccine would turn people into chimpanzees and that the Pfizer vaccine had a much higher casualty rate than other vaccines, the company said. Facebook traced the posts to a marketing firm operating from Russia, Fazze, a subsidiary of AdNow, a company registered in Britain. Facebook said it had taken down 65 Facebook accounts and 243 Instagram accounts associated with the firm and barred Fazze from its platform.

Visitors to France who have been inoculated outside the European Union with approved Covid-19 vaccines may now use a national health pass to enter bars, restaurants, cafes, gyms and other indoor venues, the government said this week. The pass is also required for large-scale events like sports games and music festivals. There had been growing concern among non-European Union tourists that they would be excluded from most social activities if their vaccination certificates were not recognized.

Thousands of people flocked to inoculation sites in Manila, the Philippine capital, on Tuesday as reports emerged that unvaccinated people would miss out on welfare payments from the government.

The latest wave of coronavirus infections in South Asia has been complicated by a surge in dengue, a mosquito-transmitted virus that spreads during monsoon season. The rise in cases of dengue — which can have symptoms similar to those of the coronavirus — is adding to the load of hospitals that are already overwhelmed. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are experiencing some of the worst surges in dengue, which in severe cases can be fatal. Dengue outbreaks are also endemic in India, Nepal and Pakistan. Christopher F. Schuetze, Nicholas Casey, Eileen Sullivan, Davey Alba, Jason Gutierrez, Constant Méheut, Aanya Wipulasena and

The Times analyzed data on breakthrough Covid hospitalizations and deaths by state. Serious coronavirus infections among vaccinated people have been relatively rare since the start of the vaccination campaign, a New York Times analysis of data from 40 states and Washington, D.C., shows. Fully vaccinated people have made up as few as 0.1 percent of and as many as 5 percent of those hospitalized with the virus in those states, and as few as 0.2 percent and as many as 6 percent of those who have died. There is still a lot we do not know about so-called breakthrough infections — when fully inoculated people contract the virus. And there is some evidence that these cases are becoming more common as the more transmissible Delta variant surges. While vaccines have done a remarkable job at protecting a vast majority of people from serious illness, the data in the Times analysis generally spanned the period from the start of the vaccination campaign until mid-June or July, before the Delta variant became predominant in the United States. Data on less serious breakthrough infections is not widely available, though it is possible those cases are rising. Data was not available for several states in which the virus has been surging, including Florida and Missouri. Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that fully vaccinated people accounted for less than 3 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations nationwide and less than 1 percent of virus deaths. But last week, the agency noted that those figures did not reflect new data involving the Delta variant and said it was actively working to update them. Only about 50 percent of people in the United States are fully vaccinated. Looking at how many hospitalizations and deaths have involved fully vaccinated people is a common but crude measure of how well the vaccines are working. As more people get shots, the percentage of hospitalizations and deaths among fully vaccinated people should rise. This may seem counterintuitive, so it’s important to understand why. In a state with a high vaccination rate, a higher percentage of breakthroughs may simply reflect that fully vaccinated people are a bigger chunk of the population, or that there are few hospitalizations and deaths overall. Imagine a state where just two people are hospitalized but both are vaccinated — breakthroughs would account for 100 percent of the hospitalizations in that state, even though these cases were very rare.

Biden’s ire at Facebook over vaccine falsehoods was fueled by a series of meetings. Andy Slavitt, the White House senior adviser for the Covid Response Team, in May. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times In March, Andy Slavitt, then a top pandemic adviser for President Biden, called Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president for global affairs, and delivered an ominous warning. For many weeks, Mr. Slavitt and other White House officials had been meeting with Facebook to urge the company to stop the spread of misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. Many Americans who declined to get vaccinated were citing false articles that they had read on Facebook, including theories that the shots could lead to infertility, stillborn babies and autism. “In eight weeks’ time,” Mr. Slavitt told Mr. Clegg, “Facebook will be the No. 1 story of the pandemic.” Mr. Slavitt’s prediction was not far off. Roughly three months later, with cases from the Delta variant surging, Mr. Biden said Facebook was “killing people.” Mr. Biden’s comment, which he later walked back slightly, was the culmination of increasingly combative meetings with the company about the spread of misinformation. The meetings have involved the top ranks on both sides. In March, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, called Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, and discussed health misinformation. The White House grew so frustrated by Facebook’s answers in the internal meetings that at one point it demanded to hear from the data scientists at the company instead of lobbyists. Talks between the White House and Facebook continue. But the rift has complicated an already tumultuous relationship just as Mr. Biden faces a setback on tackling the virus. The White House missed its goal of having 70 percent of American adults with at least one vaccination shot by July 4, and the highly contagious Delta variant has fueled a rise in cases since then. Facebook has pushed back strongly against the White House’s criticism, accusing the administration in public of scapegoating the company for the administration’s failure to reach its vaccination goals. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the White House hadn’t given the company enough credit for promoting the vaccines. Zolan Kanno-Youngs and

Vaccine side effects remain rare and are outweighed by benefits of vaccination, the C.D.C. reported. Preparing the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine at a mobile vaccination clinic in Los Angeles last week. Credit... Patrick T. Fallon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For adults, the benefits of the three coronavirus vaccines authorized in the United States outweigh the risks of serious side effects, which remain rare, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been linked to inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may increase the risk of a rare blood-clotting disorder and a neurological condition known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. All of the conditions can be serious, but remain uncommon. These small risks are exceeded by the benefits of the vaccines, which provide powerful protection against disease and death, experts concluded. For instance, every million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that are administered are likely to prevent roughly 1,800 hospitalizations and 140 deaths, while causing 14 to 17 cases of Guillain-Barré and 1 to 2 cases of the blood clotting disorder, according to the paper, which was published on Tuesday. The paper is based on data reported to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. The database contains unverified reports, but researchers confirmed many of the cases used in their calculations, which were initially presented at a July meeting of the C.D.C.’s vaccine advisory group. As of June 30, roughly 12.6 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been given to American adults. As of that date, there had been 100 reports of Guillain-Barré, which can cause muscle weakness and paralysis, a rate of 7.8 cases per million doses. The risk was highest for men between 50 and 64, who developed the side effect at a rate of 15.6 per million doses. As of July 8, there had also been 38 reports of the clotting disorder following the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The disorder, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenic syndrome, causes an unusual combination of blood clots, often in the brain, with abnormal bleeding. The overall rate of the clotting disorder is 3 cases per million doses, though women between 30 and 49 get it at a higher rate of 8.8 cases per million. By the end of June, there had also been 497 reports of myocarditis after the second dose of either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines, a rate of 3.5 cases per million doses. That increased to 24.3 cases per million for men between 18 and 29, among whom myocarditis was most common. Information about all three possible side effects have been added to the vaccine fact sheets given to patients and clinicians. The C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration will continue to monitor reports of adverse events, the report noted.

Moderna plans to open vaccine factories around the world, starting in Canada. An employee in a manufacturing area of a Moderna facility in Norwood, Mass. Credit... Nancy Lane/The Boston Herald, via Associated Press Moderna plans to build a facility in Canada to manufacture mRNA vaccines for the coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, the company announced on Tuesday. The agreement is one of up to 10 such partnerships under discussion in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, including in some low-income countries, Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. With the smooth transfer of technical know-how, any company can learn to manufacture mRNA vaccines, he said. “There is no technology in the world that some people can do somewhere and cannot be done somewhere else.” The factory in Canada is likely to be operational in a couple of years, Mr. Bancel said. Its primary mission is to help Canada, but in a pandemic, the facility may also produce vaccines to help the rest of the world, he said. The manufacturing facility could also use Moderna’s mRNA technology to make vaccines for other respiratory viruses, including seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. “The idea is to really be able to provide a vaccine against all respiratory viruses,” Mr. Bancel said. Global health experts and activists have pushed for vaccine manufacturers to teach companies in low-income countries to make coronavirus vaccines. But some experts have argued that making mRNA vaccines is too complex for most companies to master. In June, a South African consortium established the first Covid-19 mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub, with the aim of training manufacturers from developing countries to produce the vaccines. Moderna announced last week that the protection afforded by its vaccine holds steady for at least six months after the second dose. But company officials said booster shots might still be necessary this fall because of the Delta variant. Experts have said that the data available so far do not support rolling out extra doses, except perhaps for some older adults and for people with weakened immune systems who did not produce a robust immune response after the first two doses. But given the dearth of vaccines in much of the world, the World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on boosters for everyone else till the end of September.

Virus misinformation spikes as Delta cases surge. In Manhattan last month. As the Delta variant spreads, so does pandemic misinformation. Credit... Brittainy Newman for The New York Times In late July, Andrew Torba, the chief executive of the alternative social network Gab, claimed without evidence that members of the U.S. military who refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus would face a court-martial. His post on Gab amassed 10,000 likes and shares. Two weeks earlier, the unfounded claim that at least 45,000 deaths had resulted from Covid-19 vaccines circulated online. Posts with the claim collected nearly 17,000 views on Bitchute, an alternative video platform, and at least 120,000 views on the encrypted chat app Telegram, where it was shared mostly in Spanish. Around the same time, Britain’s chief scientific adviser misstated that 60 percent of hospitalized patients had been fully vaccinated. He quickly corrected the statement, saying the 60 percent had been unvaccinated. But anti-vaccine groups online seized on his mistake, translating the quote into French and Italian and sharing it on Facebook, where it collected 142,000 likes and shares. Coronavirus misinformation has spiked online in recent weeks, misinformation experts say, as people who peddle in falsehoods have seized on the surge of cases from the Delta variant to spread new and recycled unsubstantiated narratives.

Amid a ballooning sexual harassment scandal, Andrew Cuomo says he will resign. A news broadcast in Times Square on Tuesday as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that he would resign, capping a remarkable political fall. Credit... Benjamin Norman for The New York Times ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Tuesday he would resign from office, succumbing to a ballooning sexual harassment scandal that fueled an astonishing reversal of fortune for one of the nation’s best-known leaders. Mr. Cuomo said his resignation would be effective in 14 days. Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, will be sworn in to replace him. She will become the first female governor of New York. The governor framed his resignation as a necessary step given the firestorm of controversy surrounding his continued leadership, including an impeachment inquiry that he referred to as a “distraction” from pressing issues as the state recovers from the pandemic. “Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,” Mr. Cuomo said. “And therefore that’s what I’ll do.” Luis Ferré-Sadurní and

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the past few weeks, the vast majority of the most highly engaged social media posts containing coronavirus misinformation were from people who had risen to prominence by questioning the vaccines in the past year.

In July, the right-wing commentator Candace Owens jumped on the misstatement from Britain’s scientific adviser. “This is shocking!” she wrote. “60% of people being admitted to the hospital with #COVID19 in England have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the government’s chief scientific adviser.”

After the scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, corrected himself, Ms. Owens added the correct information at the bottom of her Facebook post. But the post was liked or shared over 62,000 times — two-thirds of its total interactions — in the three hours before her update, a New York Times analysis found. In all, the rumor collected 142,000 likes and shares on Facebook, most of them coming from Ms. Owens’s post, according to a report by the Virality Project, a consortium of misinformation researchers from outfits like the Stanford Internet Observatory and Graphika.

When reached for comment, Ms. Owens said in an email: “Unfortunately, I’m not interested in The New York Times. The people that follow me don’t take your hit pieces seriously.”

Also in July, Thomas Renz, a lawyer, appeared in a video claiming that 45,000 people had died from coronavirus vaccines. The claim, since debunked, relies on unverified information from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a government database. The baseless claim had been included in a lawsuit that Mr. Renz filed on behalf of an anonymous “whistle-blower,” in coordination with America’s Frontline Doctors — a right-wing group that spread misinformation about the pandemic in the past.

Mr. Renz’s video got more than 19,000 views on Bitchute. The unfounded claim was repeated by the top Spanish-language Telegram channels, Facebook groups and the conspiracy website Infowars, collecting over 120,000 views across the platforms, according to the Virality Project.

In an email, Mr. Renz said his practice had “performed the due diligence necessary” to believe in the accuracy of the allegations in the lawsuit he had filed. “We actually do not believe that the Biden administration is responsible for this, rather we believe that President Biden, like President Trump before him, was misled by the same group of conflicted bureaucrats,” Mr. Renz said.

The venue, Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, “was not willing to comply with the band’s updated Health and Safety standards,” it read.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:15 - 0:00 transcript Dallas County Judge Issues Mask Mandate A Texas judge ordered indoor mask-wearing in the Dallas area after rising coronavirus cases fueled by the Delta variant brought the levels of virus transmission and hospitalizations to those seen during the height of the pandemic. From the date of this executive order, all child care centers and pre-K through 12 public schools operating in Dallas County must develop and implement a health and safety policy. The health and safety policy must require, at a minimum, universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to child care centers and pre-K through 12 schools, regardless of vaccination status, except for children under the age of 2 years. From the date of this executive order, all commercial entities in Dallas County providing goods or services directly to the public must develop and implement a health and safety policy.

Your personal freedom is very important to me and to everyone. But your personal freedom does not extend to hurting your neighbors, particularly at a time of a public health disaster like this. A Texas judge ordered indoor mask-wearing in the Dallas area after rising coronavirus cases fueled by the Delta variant brought the levels of virus transmission and hospitalizations to those seen during the height of the pandemic. Credit Credit... Christopher Lee for The New York Times Two court rulings on Tuesday cleared the way for local leaders who oppose a ban by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, on mask mandates to at least temporarily require face coverings to help curb a rise in coronavirus cases. The first ruling came in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. Masks can now be required in public schools and other public buildings there. Masks will also be required for county and city employees, said Andy Segovia, the city attorney for San Antonio. The chief executive of Bexar County, Judge Nelson W. Wolff, said that the ruling was important because many students who are too young to be vaccinated would otherwise be coming back to school with no protection. The second ruling was delivered by a district judge in Dallas County who said the ban prevented officials from protecting residents during an emergency. “Dallas County citizens will be irreparably harmed” if local leaders cannot require face coverings to stop the transmission of the virus, the judge, Tonya Parker, wrote in the ruling. In light of the decision, Clay Jenkins, the county’s chief elected official, said he planned to issue an emergency order on Wednesday. [Update Aug. 12: The order was issued at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday.] Dallas and San Antonio now join Austin, Fort Worth and Houston in instituting mask mandates in schools. That means the state’s five largest cities are defying Mr. Abbott’s ban for schools. On Tuesday, Texas recorded 20,000 new virus cases, nearly double the number of cases as two weeks ago, according to a New York Times database. Some hospitals in the state are nearing capacity and are bracing for an influx of patients. The intensive care unit at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in Houston is at full capacity, and 63 percent of those patients are Covid cases, CNN reported. While Mr. Abbott remains unmoved as one of the most strident opponents of mask mandates, he did put some restrictions in place in March 2020, such as limiting social gatherings to 10 people and closing some businesses, like gyms. Those that remained open operated at a limited capacity. Last July, as cases surged across Texas, he enacted a mask mandate. The state lifted the mandate this past March, citing the presence of vaccine. This week the governor appeared to acknowledge the growing burden on the health care system. He directed the state Health Department to find additional health care workers from outside Texas to provide reinforcements for overwhelmed hospitals statewide. He also sent a letter to the Texas Hospital Association telling hospitals to postpone elective medical procedures. President Biden has recently criticized the governors of Texas and Florida, two states where virus cases have risen particularly sharply, for their pandemic response. “I say to these governors, please, if you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way for people who are doing the right thing,” he said at a news conference last week. On Tuesday, he encouraged people to get vaccinated as part of their preparation for hurricane and wildfire seasons. Mr. Biden singled out Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi as states with low vaccination rates that are also more at risk from hurricanes. On Tuesday, a temporary mask mandate for students, staff members and visitors to public schools in Dallas went into effect. Brendan Steinhauser, a consultant who lives in a Republican-leaning suburb of Austin, said the rising number of cases had led more people to wear masks. “It is palpable,” he said of his neighbors’ mask-wearing attitude. “I noticed it and it was like, ‘Whoa.’” Correction: An earlier version of this item misspelled the surname of Bexar County’s chief executive.

Oregon’s governor reinstates a statewide indoor mask mandate. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:31 - 0:00 transcript Oregon Reinstates Indoor Mask Mandate to Slow Delta Variant Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said both vaccinated and unvaccinated people must wear masks again indoors starting on Friday. She warned that rising cases driven by the Delta variant could overrun hospitals in weeks. We continue to work to reach Oregonians with information and a vaccine, but it’s clear the current situation requires immediate action to stop the Delta variant from spreading further. That’s why moving forward for the immediate future, masks will be required in all indoor public settings effective this Friday, Aug. 13. Yesterday, we had over 2,300 cases reported, the highest number since the virus first landed in Oregon. Hospitalizations are also at a record high. Across the state, our I.C.U. beds are about 90 percent filled. Some of our hospital regions have fewer than five I.C.U. beds available to start the day. These numbers are because of the Delta variant. These numbers are despite the fact that nearly 73 percent of Oregon’s adults are vaccinated. Modeling from the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Health and Science University project that without new safety interventions, Covid-19 hospitalizations will completely overwhelm our doctors and nurses in the coming weeks. Without safety measures, we could be as many as 500 staffed hospital beds short of what we need to treat patients by September. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said both vaccinated and unvaccinated people must wear masks again indoors starting on Friday. She warned that rising cases driven by the Delta variant could overrun hospitals in weeks. Credit Credit... Kristina Barker for The New York Times Oregon is restoring a statewide mandate ordering both vaccinated and unvaccinated people to use face coverings when gathering indoors. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, a Democrat, said on Wednesday that masks — which will be required starting on Friday — were needed to fight rising caseloads driven by the Delta variant, and that face coverings were a simple tool to help keep schools and businesses open. “After a year and a half of this pandemic, I know Oregonians are tired of health and safety restrictions,” Ms. Brown said in a statement. “This new mask requirement will not last forever, but it is a measure that can save lives right now.” Oregon was the third state to introduce an indoor mask mandate for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, after Louisiana and Hawaii. Washington, D.C., has also reinstated its mask mandate, as have several large cities. While many states brought in mask mandates and other restrictions last year, they have been reluctant to implement such orders again. Two states led by Republican governors, Texas and Florida, have barred mask mandates entirely, though some local leaders plan to impose them anyway. On Tuesday, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said that masks would again be mandated in all of the state’s schools. Oregon has made it through the pandemic with some of the lowest numbers of virus cases and deaths in the country. But new cases have surged in recent days from a daily average of 110 a month ago to nearly 1,300 on Tuesday. With 84 percent of people over 65 fully vaccinated in the state, the rise in deaths has been far smaller, reaching a daily average of six as of Wednesday. But hospitalizations have quadrupled in the past month, with the daily average number of hospitalized patients exceeding 550.

Ms. Brown’s office projects that the state’s hospital capacity could be overrun in the next several weeks if mitigation measures are not in place, leaving Oregon as many as 500 beds short by next month. “When our hospitals are full, there will be no room for additional patients needing care — whether for Covid-19, a heart attack or stroke, a car collision or a variety of other emergency situations,” Ms. Brown said. “If our hospitals run out of staffed beds, all Oregonians will be at risk.” Ms. Brown also said that all employees working under the state’s executive branch would be required to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18, or six weeks after a vaccine receives full approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, a Democrat, announced a similar mandate on Monday.

Hawaii limits gatherings as the Delta variant spreads. Tourists gathered at sunset near the Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station in Hawaii last week. Credit... Megan Spelman for The New York Times After a week in which Hawaii reported more cases than in any other week, Gov. David Ige said on Tuesday that he was reimposing restrictions to try to curb the surge. “Social gatherings will be limited to no more than 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors,” he said at a news conference. Indoor events at bars, restaurants, gyms and places of worship will be reduced to 50 percent capacity, and masks must be worn at all times except when eating or drinking, he said. The measure, which went into effect immediately, came five days after Mr. Ige, a Democrat, ordered all state and county employees to show proof of vaccination by next Monday or face weekly testing. “We know that we won’t see benefits from the increase in vaccinations going up for another six to seven weeks,” he said on Tuesday. “In the meantime, we must take action now in order to slow the spread of Covid-19, especially with the new Delta variant, which has wreaked havoc in our communities.” Hawaii has had the country’s fewest reported cases per capita over the course of the pandemic, but its number of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 has soared from just 40 on July 1 to 246 on Tuesday, of whom 235 are unvaccinated. “That’s a pretty rapid trajectory,” said Hilton Rae­thel, the chief executive of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, a nonprofit that represents hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, home-care companies and hospices. “Hospitals are full, and then you have all these Covid patients. That really stretches our health care system.” Mr. Raethel said that the first of 550 additional health care workers would arrive in Hawaii this weekend from the U.S. mainland. Only one other time during the pandemic has the state needed reinforcements, he said, and that was last September and October. “The numbers tell us that the worst of the surge is in front of us,” he said. The state, with a population of 1.4 million, has a seven-day average of more than 500 reported cases per day and a test positivity rate of 7.3 percent, Mr. Ige said on Tuesday. Eighty-six percent of Hawaii residents 18 and older have had at least one vaccine dose, but only 65 percent are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database.

Amy Harris/Invision, via Associated Press The recent rise in coronavirus cases, fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant, has led to the cancellation of several upcoming musical performances. The group Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit’s show scheduled for Wednesday in Houston has been canceled, according to a statement on Tuesday from Mr. Isbell’s music label, Southeastern Records. The venue, Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, “was not willing to comply with the band’s updated Health and Safety standards,” it read. Tickets bought online will be refunded, according to the statement. Also on Tuesday, the singer Stevie Nicks said that although she is vaccinated, she is canceling the shows she was scheduled to perform this year, because of the rising number of cases. “I want everyone to be safe and healthy and the rising Covid cases should be of concern to all of us,” Ms. Nicks, 73, said in a statement on Twitter. “While I’m vaccinated, at my age, I am still being extremely cautious and for that reason have decided to skip the 5 performances I had planned for 2021.” Over the weekend, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival said that it was canceling this year’s event, citing the rise in cases. In June, Bruce Springsteen became the first person to perform on Broadway as some New York City theaters reopened after closing 16 months earlier because of the pandemic. Before his first performance, Mr. Springsteen told ticket holders that they would be admitted only if they showed proof of vaccination.

Saudi Arabia lifts a ban on foreign pilgrims heading to Mecca. Muslim pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba during umrah, in Mecca, in May. Credit... Amr Nabil/Associated Press BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia has resumed allowing travelers from abroad to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, the kingdom announced this week, a new easing of the restrictions imposed last year to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Islamic holy sites. Aspiring pilgrims from many countries can now apply to perform the lesser pilgrimage to Mecca, known as umrah, as long as they can provide proof that they have received a coronavirus vaccine approved by the Saudi authorities, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported on Sunday. The new policy took effect on Monday. The kingdom has approved the vaccines made by Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. Foreigners who have received two doses of either the Sinopharm or Sinovac vaccines can enter only if they have also received a third shot of one of the four approved vaccines. As the pandemic spread last year, Saudi Arabia barred travelers from abroad from the main pilgrimage, the hajj, which attracts millions of pilgrims in normal years, spreading disappointment across the Muslim world. Devout Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to perform the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, at least once during their lives. Last year, only a few hundred pilgrims who were already in the kingdom were allowed to go. Foreign travelers were also barred from this year’s hajj, which was in July. Umrah can be performed at any time of the year. Allowing vaccinated foreign travelers to apply for it represents a step toward restoring the prepandemic status quo at the holy sites. The number of permitted foreign visitors will initially be limited and will increase over time, with the goal of eventually allowing two million pilgrims a month. Other restrictions, including limiting the number of worshipers in mosques and on buses, will also be enforced to decrease the chances of infection. As of Monday, Saudi Arabia had averaged 732 new cases a day over the last week, a 40 percent decline from two weeks ago, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Saudi Arabia still bans direct travel from a number of countries that it has deemed viral threats. Pilgrims from other countries must observe a mandatory seven-day quarantine on arrival. About 29 percent of Saudi residents are fully vaccinated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. Besides having deep religious significance, the pilgrimage is big business and the ban on foreign worshipers hurt companies across the Islamic world that cater to pilgrims. Before the pandemic, Jamal Ali, who works at a Beirut travel agency that specializes in religious tourism, sold a range of packages including plane tickets and hotel stays. The ban on foreign pilgrims cut his income by about 90 percent, he said. He hoped that the resumption of foreign trips to Mecca would be a step back toward normalcy. “We understand that Saudi Arabia is trying to achieve general immunity,” he said. “We are waiting for relief from God, and for this pandemic to end.”

All Washington D.C. public employees will face a vaccine or testing requirement. Public works employees and contractors are among the groups who will need to be vaccinated against the coronavirus or submit to weekly testing. Credit... Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington on Tuesday directed all 37,000 city employees and contractors who work with the city to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, or undergo weekly testing by Sept. 19. The action follows President Biden’s recent announcement that federal workers would face restrictions and requirements, including testing, if they did not get vaccinated. New York, Virginia, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, have made similar moves, while Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State said Monday that most state employees and all health care workers had to be fully vaccinated or risk losing their jobs. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:08 - 0:00 transcript D.C. Mayor Directs City Workers to Get Vaccinated or Face Testing Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington announced that all 37,000 city employees and contractors must be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus or undergo weekly testing by Sept. 19. All employees, contractors, interns and grantees of the government of the District of Columbia will be required to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Full Covid vaccination will be required for all new hires appointed to job vacancies posted on or after Aug. 14, 2021. All covered individuals have until Sept. 19 to be fully vaccinated. We will, of course, have a process for people who want to apply for exemptions, and any unvaccinated employee, even those who qualify for the medical or religious exemption, will be required to conduct a weekly Covid-19 test. We support businesses having rules for access to their buildings and their services, including masks, of course, which is a mandate in the District inside, and vaccines. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington announced that all 37,000 city employees and contractors must be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus or undergo weekly testing by Sept. 19. Additionally, the Pentagon said Monday that it will seek to make vaccinations mandatory for the country’s 1.3 million active-duty troops “no later” than the middle of next month. “We know that we have been very steadfast and successful in crushing this virus in the district,” Ms. Bowser said at a news conference. “And now we’re going to do the same with the Delta variant. The way to do it, however, is to get everybody vaccinated.” The policy falls short of a mandate, but all new hires filling job vacancies posted on Aug. 14 or later will need to show proof of vaccination. “We will, of course, have a process for people who want to apply for exemptions and any unvaccinated employee, even those who qualify for the medical or religious exemption, will be required to conduct a weekly Covid-19 test and failure to comply will lead to adverse employment actions,” Ms. Bowser said. Only 59 percent of city employees have reported their vaccine status, according to the mayor’s office. Of those, 54 percent are vaccinated. Daily new cases across the city have soared, according to a New York Times database, which also shows that hospitalizations have risen 5 percent and that there were three deaths over the same period. Fifty-three percent of all city residents are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. People younger than 12 are not eligible for the vaccine. “What’s driving our increasing cases right now is really that 25-to-34-year-old population,” Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, the director of the city’s health department, said at the news conference. “And we don’t see any meaningful disparities in terms of who are those new cases from a race and ethnicity perspective.” But Dr. Nesbitt added that there was a wide gap in vaccine coverage for that age group, with Black residents having half the rate of coverage as their white and Latino counterparts. “We are also going to do a better job once everybody gets vaccinated and helping to prevent more of these variants from taking over our communities,” she said. The city gives incentives to all city residents, including public employees, who are 12 and older, like a $51 gift card for receive their first dose of the vaccine at one of its three walk-up vaccination sites. And residents ages 12 to 17 get AirPods for being among the first 400 youths to get inoculated at school vaccination sites.

global roundup Germany will stop paying for virus tests for people choosing to remain unvaccinated. A rapid coronavirus test center in Cologne, Germany, in June. Credit... Ina Fassbender/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images BERLIN — After months of offering free coronavirus antigen tests to all residents, Germany will stop subsidizing them for adults who choose not to get vaccinated, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Tuesday. Starting Oct. 11, when the changes take effect, the tests will continue to be available at no charge for people under 18, pregnant women or others who have medical reasons not to get vaccinated. Since March, the country has spent billions of dollars offering at least one free antigen test per resident each week, which has led to a boom of privately run testing stations. Ms. Merkel met with state governors on Tuesday to negotiate the new rules, as infections, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, are increasing, albeit more slowly than in many other parts of Europe. German authorities have also agreed on new rules requiring proof of vaccination, recent recovery or a negative test for certain indoor activities, including going to a restaurant, hairdresser or gym, once the weekly local infection rate surpasses 35 per 100,000 inhabitants. As of Monday, the authorities had registered 23.5 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week nationwide. Currently 55 percent of Germans have received the full vaccination course and 62.5 percent received the first jab, a rate, as Ms. Merkel noted during her news conference, that was no longer among the highest in the European Union. “We now have enough of the vaccine,” she said. “Now we have to promote vaccinations.” In other news from around the world: In June, European Union leaders recommended that member countries reopen their borders to Americans, expecting to be repaid in kind. But nearly two months later, the United States borders remain closed to most European travelers, even those who are vaccinated. European leaders are frustrated and some have even suggested reimposing travel restrictions against U.S. travelers. The White House spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said the policy was intended “to keep the American people safe at a time where the Delta variant is rising.”

Facebook said Tuesday that it had removed a network of accounts based in Russia that spread misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. The network targeted audiences in India, Latin America and the United States with posts falsely asserting that the AstraZeneca vaccine would turn people into chimpanzees and that the Pfizer vaccine had a much higher casualty rate than other vaccines, the company said. Facebook traced the posts to a marketing firm operating from Russia, Fazze, a subsidiary of AdNow, a company registered in Britain. Facebook said it had taken down 65 Facebook accounts and 243 Instagram accounts associated with the firm and barred Fazze from its platform.

Visitors to France who have been inoculated outside the European Union with approved Covid-19 vaccines may now use a national health pass to enter bars, restaurants, cafes, gyms and other indoor venues, the government said this week. The pass is also required for large-scale events like sports games and music festivals. There had been growing concern among non-European Union tourists that they would be excluded from most social activities if their vaccination certificates were not recognized.

Thousands of people flocked to inoculation sites in Manila, the Philippine capital, on Tuesday as reports emerged that unvaccinated people would miss out on welfare payments from the government.

The latest wave of coronavirus infections in South Asia has been complicated by a surge in dengue, a mosquito-transmitted virus that spreads during monsoon season. The rise in cases of dengue — which can have symptoms similar to those of the coronavirus — is adding to the load of hospitals that are already overwhelmed. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are experiencing some of the worst surges in dengue, which in severe cases can be fatal. Dengue outbreaks are also endemic in India, Nepal and Pakistan. Christopher F. Schuetze, Nicholas Casey, Eileen Sullivan, Davey Alba, Jason Gutierrez, Constant Méheut, Aanya Wipulasena and

The Times analyzed data on breakthrough Covid hospitalizations and deaths by state. Serious coronavirus infections among vaccinated people have been relatively rare since the start of the vaccination campaign, a New York Times analysis of data from 40 states and Washington, D.C., shows. Fully vaccinated people have made up as few as 0.1 percent of and as many as 5 percent of those hospitalized with the virus in those states, and as few as 0.2 percent and as many as 6 percent of those who have died. There is still a lot we do not know about so-called breakthrough infections — when fully inoculated people contract the virus. And there is some evidence that these cases are becoming more common as the more transmissible Delta variant surges. While vaccines have done a remarkable job at protecting a vast majority of people from serious illness, the data in the Times analysis generally spanned the period from the start of the vaccination campaign until mid-June or July, before the Delta variant became predominant in the United States. Data on less serious breakthrough infections is not widely available, though it is possible those cases are rising. Data was not available for several states in which the virus has been surging, including Florida and Missouri. Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that fully vaccinated people accounted for less than 3 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations nationwide and less than 1 percent of virus deaths. But last week, the agency noted that those figures did not reflect new data involving the Delta variant and said it was actively working to update them. Only about 50 percent of people in the United States are fully vaccinated. Looking at how many hospitalizations and deaths have involved fully vaccinated people is a common but crude measure of how well the vaccines are working. As more people get shots, the percentage of hospitalizations and deaths among fully vaccinated people should rise. This may seem counterintuitive, so it’s important to understand why. In a state with a high vaccination rate, a higher percentage of breakthroughs may simply reflect that fully vaccinated people are a bigger chunk of the population, or that there are few hospitalizations and deaths overall. Imagine a state where just two people are hospitalized but both are vaccinated — breakthroughs would account for 100 percent of the hospitalizations in that state, even though these cases were very rare.

Biden’s ire at Facebook over vaccine falsehoods was fueled by a series of meetings. Andy Slavitt, the White House senior adviser for the Covid Response Team, in May. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times In March, Andy Slavitt, then a top pandemic adviser for President Biden, called Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president for global affairs, and delivered an ominous warning. For many weeks, Mr. Slavitt and other White House officials had been meeting with Facebook to urge the company to stop the spread of misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. Many Americans who declined to get vaccinated were citing false articles that they had read on Facebook, including theories that the shots could lead to infertility, stillborn babies and autism. “In eight weeks’ time,” Mr. Slavitt told Mr. Clegg, “Facebook will be the No. 1 story of the pandemic.” Mr. Slavitt’s prediction was not far off. Roughly three months later, with cases from the Delta variant surging, Mr. Biden said Facebook was “killing people.” Mr. Biden’s comment, which he later walked back slightly, was the culmination of increasingly combative meetings with the company about the spread of misinformation. The meetings have involved the top ranks on both sides. In March, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, called Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, and discussed health misinformation. The White House grew so frustrated by Facebook’s answers in the internal meetings that at one point it demanded to hear from the data scientists at the company instead of lobbyists. Talks between the White House and Facebook continue. But the rift has complicated an already tumultuous relationship just as Mr. Biden faces a setback on tackling the virus. The White House missed its goal of having 70 percent of American adults with at least one vaccination shot by July 4, and the highly contagious Delta variant has fueled a rise in cases since then. Facebook has pushed back strongly against the White House’s criticism, accusing the administration in public of scapegoating the company for the administration’s failure to reach its vaccination goals. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the White House hadn’t given the company enough credit for promoting the vaccines. Zolan Kanno-Youngs and

Vaccine side effects remain rare and are outweighed by benefits of vaccination, the C.D.C. reported. Preparing the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine at a mobile vaccination clinic in Los Angeles last week. Credit... Patrick T. Fallon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For adults, the benefits of the three coronavirus vaccines authorized in the United States outweigh the risks of serious side effects, which remain rare, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been linked to inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may increase the risk of a rare blood-clotting disorder and a neurological condition known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. All of the conditions can be serious, but remain uncommon. These small risks are exceeded by the benefits of the vaccines, which provide powerful protection against disease and death, experts concluded. For instance, every million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that are administered are likely to prevent roughly 1,800 hospitalizations and 140 deaths, while causing 14 to 17 cases of Guillain-Barré and 1 to 2 cases of the blood clotting disorder, according to the paper, which was published on Tuesday. The paper is based on data reported to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. The database contains unverified reports, but researchers confirmed many of the cases used in their calculations, which were initially presented at a July meeting of the C.D.C.’s vaccine advisory group. As of June 30, roughly 12.6 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been given to American adults. As of that date, there had been 100 reports of Guillain-Barré, which can cause muscle weakness and paralysis, a rate of 7.8 cases per million doses. The risk was highest for men between 50 and 64, who developed the side effect at a rate of 15.6 per million doses. As of July 8, there had also been 38 reports of the clotting disorder following the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The disorder, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenic syndrome, causes an unusual combination of blood clots, often in the brain, with abnormal bleeding. The overall rate of the clotting disorder is 3 cases per million doses, though women between 30 and 49 get it at a higher rate of 8.8 cases per million. By the end of June, there had also been 497 reports of myocarditis after the second dose of either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines, a rate of 3.5 cases per million doses. That increased to 24.3 cases per million for men between 18 and 29, among whom myocarditis was most common. Information about all three possible side effects have been added to the vaccine fact sheets given to patients and clinicians. The C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration will continue to monitor reports of adverse events, the report noted.

Moderna plans to open vaccine factories around the world, starting in Canada. An employee in a manufacturing area of a Moderna facility in Norwood, Mass. Credit... Nancy Lane/The Boston Herald, via Associated Press Moderna plans to build a facility in Canada to manufacture mRNA vaccines for the coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, the company announced on Tuesday. The agreement is one of up to 10 such partnerships under discussion in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, including in some low-income countries, Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. With the smooth transfer of technical know-how, any company can learn to manufacture mRNA vaccines, he said. “There is no technology in the world that some people can do somewhere and cannot be done somewhere else.” The factory in Canada is likely to be operational in a couple of years, Mr. Bancel said. Its primary mission is to help Canada, but in a pandemic, the facility may also produce vaccines to help the rest of the world, he said. The manufacturing facility could also use Moderna’s mRNA technology to make vaccines for other respiratory viruses, including seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. “The idea is to really be able to provide a vaccine against all respiratory viruses,” Mr. Bancel said. Global health experts and activists have pushed for vaccine manufacturers to teach companies in low-income countries to make coronavirus vaccines. But some experts have argued that making mRNA vaccines is too complex for most companies to master. In June, a South African consortium established the first Covid-19 mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub, with the aim of training manufacturers from developing countries to produce the vaccines. Moderna announced last week that the protection afforded by its vaccine holds steady for at least six months after the second dose. But company officials said booster shots might still be necessary this fall because of the Delta variant. Experts have said that the data available so far do not support rolling out extra doses, except perhaps for some older adults and for people with weakened immune systems who did not produce a robust immune response after the first two doses. But given the dearth of vaccines in much of the world, the World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on boosters for everyone else till the end of September.

Virus misinformation spikes as Delta cases surge. In Manhattan last month. As the Delta variant spreads, so does pandemic misinformation. Credit... Brittainy Newman for The New York Times In late July, Andrew Torba, the chief executive of the alternative social network Gab, claimed without evidence that members of the U.S. military who refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus would face a court-martial. His post on Gab amassed 10,000 likes and shares. Two weeks earlier, the unfounded claim that at least 45,000 deaths had resulted from Covid-19 vaccines circulated online. Posts with the claim collected nearly 17,000 views on Bitchute, an alternative video platform, and at least 120,000 views on the encrypted chat app Telegram, where it was shared mostly in Spanish. Around the same time, Britain’s chief scientific adviser misstated that 60 percent of hospitalized patients had been fully vaccinated. He quickly corrected the statement, saying the 60 percent had been unvaccinated. But anti-vaccine groups online seized on his mistake, translating the quote into French and Italian and sharing it on Facebook, where it collected 142,000 likes and shares. Coronavirus misinformation has spiked online in recent weeks, misinformation experts say, as people who peddle in falsehoods have seized on the surge of cases from the Delta variant to spread new and recycled unsubstantiated narratives.

Amid a ballooning sexual harassment scandal, Andrew Cuomo says he will resign. A news broadcast in Times Square on Tuesday as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that he would resign, capping a remarkable political fall. Credit... Benjamin Norman for The New York Times ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Tuesday he would resign from office, succumbing to a ballooning sexual harassment scandal that fueled an astonishing reversal of fortune for one of the nation’s best-known leaders. Mr. Cuomo said his resignation would be effective in 14 days. Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, will be sworn in to replace him. She will become the first female governor of New York. The governor framed his resignation as a necessary step given the firestorm of controversy surrounding his continued leadership, including an impeachment inquiry that he referred to as a “distraction” from pressing issues as the state recovers from the pandemic. “Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,” Mr. Cuomo said. “And therefore that’s what I’ll do.” Luis Ferré-Sadurní and

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the months following its October release, Mr. Cuomo’s book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Pandemic,” became a source of financial and ethical headaches for Crown. Sales were surprisingly weak for a title that Crown had invested in heavily, with fewer than 50,000 hardcover copies sold, according to NPD BookScan. Promoting the book became challenging, as Mr. Cuomo was mired in investigations that battered his public image, including allegations of sexual harassment from several women. In March, Crown made an attempt to distance itself from the governor, saying that it had canceled plans for a paperback version and would no longer promote the book.

Following Mr. Cuomo’s resignation announcement on Tuesday, questions remained about whether Crown will pay the remainder of his advance. The governor’s tax records and other financial disclosures, which were released in May, showed that he received the bulk of his advance, $3.12 million, in 2020, and expected to receive the remaining $2 million in installments over the next two years. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said around that time that the governor netted about $1.5 million for the book after taxes and expenses, and that he donated $500,000 to the United Way of New York State for its Covid-relief program.

David Drake, the president of Crown, declined to comment, saying “we never comment on contractual matters or financial arrangements with any of our authors.” Robert Barnett, the lawyer who represented Mr. Cuomo in his book deal, declined to comment.

Both the New York attorney general’s office and the New York State Assembly’s judiciary committee have been investigating whether ethics rules were violated when government employees worked on Mr. Cuomo’s book. Staffers helped with tasks such as typing notes or printing and delivering drafts to the Executive Mansion, where Mr. Cuomo lives. His top aide, Melissa DeRosa, who announced her resignation on Sunday, joined video meetings with publishers and helped Mr. Cuomo edit drafts of the book.

The governor was granted permission to author the book by the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics. The commission barred Mr. Cuomo from using state resources, including help from government employees, to work on it. The Assembly’s inquiry is part of its broader impeachment investigation, the fate of which remains unclear now that Mr. Cuomo has resigned.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Some women remained conflicted about the decision.

“I’m highly considering getting vaccinated, I feel like it’s the more responsible thing to do,” said Raeshel Contreras, 29, who lives in the Bay Area. She is 28 weeks pregnant and worries that the vaccine could disrupt fetal development, though there is no scientific evidence of this. “I don’t know what I would do if I got vaccinated and something happened to the baby.”

She has given herself two weeks to make a decision, she said, but the timing of the new C.D.C. directive, during a surge, concerned her.

“Why was this not recommended before?” she asked. “Now there’s this new variant, and now the C.D.C. is jumping, but it wasn’t recommended, I’m like ‘Why is that?’”

The data on birth outcomes is limited, considering the vaccine has only been available since December, but the small number of pregnancies of immunized obstetric patients followed to term have not identified any safety issues, according to Sascha R. Ellington, an epidemiologist who leads the emergency preparedness response team in the division of reproductive health at the C.D.C.

A study of 827 people who gave birth after being vaccinated found the rates of adverse events and poor outcomes were similar to prepandemic rates, but called for more long-term follow-up of such pregnancies. The study was published in April in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“At this time, the benefits of vaccination, and the known risks of Covid during pregnancy and the high rates of transmission right now, outweigh any theoretical risks of the vaccine,” Dr. Ellington said.

“I think it’s pretty clear with everything we’ve learned that you do have more severe disease in pregnancy, and there is concerning data from other countries that pregnant women are being more severely affected with the Delta variant, compared with the earlier strains,” said Dr. Denise Jamieson, an obstetrician at Emory University in Atlanta.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A mere four seconds of all-out exercise, repeated two or three dozen times, could be all many of us need to build and maintain our fitness, strength and physical power, according to an inspiring new study of the potency of super-quick workouts. The findings expand on other, recent studies showing that four-second interval workouts beneficially affect metabolism and muscles in adults of various ages. But they may also highlight new concerns about what we miss if we make our workouts too brief.

Almost anyone with even a passing interest in exercise and health has heard by now of high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, a topic I have covered frequently in this column. A typical HIIT workout involves repeated, short bursts of arduous effort, known as intervals, interspersed with rest periods.

For generations, athletes interval trained to amp their speed and performance. But for most of us, HIIT’s primary allure is its brevity. In past studies, workouts with intense intervals ranging in length from four minutes or even less improved aspects of health and fitness to the same or a greater extent than much longer sessions of continuous, gentler exercise, like jogging or walking. For HIIT fans, the high-intensity workouts often represent their primary or only form of exercise.

The ideal length of the individual intervals remains uncertain, though. Most exercise scientists agree an interval should strenuously stimulate and pressure our hearts, lungs and muscles, prompting them to remodel themselves in beneficial ways. But such intense workouts should not be so draining we cannot finish the intervals or wish afterward never to work out again. Each interval should be, in essence, as grueling and as tolerable as possible.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you are asking for alone time in the reactionary way, Dr. Talib said, you can be specific about what you’re stressed about — a change at work or feeling overwhelmed by tasks at home — and be clear that that’s why you need time to clear your mind on your own. There’s also a difference between being alone and being lonely, she said, and that nuance is worth talking about with kids.

2. Alone time should be part of your family’s routine. Remember those godforsaken color-coded charts from the early Covid days? All the family dinners? “We talked about family routines” when the pandemic started, Dr. Talib said. “Why didn’t we talk about creating a routine of alone time?” Her kids, who are just 3 and 5, know she goes outside every day “to stare at a tree in the backyard.” She’s meditating, and they know not to interrupt “tree time” — and that it doesn’t last very long.

Lizzie Assa, the founder of The Workspace for Children, a website and Instagram account that helps parents teach kids to play on their own, has made sure her three kids, who are now 14, 11, and 8, have “quiet time” every day since they were toddlers. She said it took work, but the payoff is worth it. “Kids learn that they need downtime and they need alone time,” said Ms. Assa, who is a neighbor of mine in Maplewood, N.J. “Even today when they’re having a hard time or getting moody, I don’t have to say, ‘You need to get away from us,’” she said. “They say, ‘I’m going to my room.’”

If instituting daily quiet time feels like a nonstarter in your house, you can try other ways of building downtime into your kids’ schedules. Dr. Pooja Lakshmin, a frequent Times contributor and clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University School of Medicine, suggested I simply ask my daughter what she needs for self-care. You can do this with an 11-year-old, Dr. Lakshmin reminded me: “Ask, ‘What do you feel like you need? Do you want to read a book? Take a bath?’ Help them brainstorm too.”

3. It’s OK for your kids to be upset. If you don’t want to spend every waking hour with your children,“it’s developmentally appropriate for them to be insulted,” Dr. Lakshmin reminded me. “That’s normal. Your job as a parent is to help them understand that it’s OK to feel sad.” She went even further to say that sitting with that discomfort teaches kids that they can take care of themselves even if it makes someone else unhappy temporarily.

Dr. Damour put it even more plainly: “People deserve privacy, full stop.” Plus, she reminded me that I’m heading full throttle into the teen years, when my daughter will likely become “allergic” to me. I might as well appreciate her wanting to stay close while I still can.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many scientists argue that the immunocompromised population is too diverse to uniformly recommend additional shots of coronavirus vaccine. Some may be protected by the standard vaccine dosage, despite their conditions. Others may be poorly shielded by the vaccines, but unable to benefit from an additional shot.

Studies suggest that patients such as organ transplant recipients are in between — often showing little immune response to the standard vaccine regimen, but benefiting from a third shot. One recent randomized, placebo-controlled study by Canadian researchers found that a third dose of the Moderna vaccine improved the immune response of people in that group.

Dr. Dorry Segev, at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, has said about half of transplant patients have no antibody response to the currently authorized vaccine dosage. His team studied 30 transplant patients who were vaccinated but had negative or low-positive antibody titers, which suggested a poor response by their immune systems to the shots. After an additional shot, 14 of them had higher antibody titers.

The Food and Drug Administration’s decision to authorize a third shot for organ transplant recipients and those with similarly compromised immune systems will be considered by an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, scheduled to meet on Friday. Although the F.D.A.’s action is independent of the panel’s recommendation, in practice many physicians wait to act until the C.D.C. weighs in.

If the committee votes to endorse the shots, as expected, the C.D.C. could issue a recommendation the same day. That could give further guidance to physicians and pharmacists about how to proceed.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Across New York the Delta variant has caused a surge of new cases and rising hospitalizations, presenting New York’s incoming governor, Kathy Hochul, with a major public health challenge that is likely to grow between now and the day she officially takes office in two weeks.

Ms. Hochul, who is currently the lieutenant governor, declined to say much that was concrete about the direction she would take on the state’s Covid-19 policies when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo steps down. Mr. Cuomo announced his resignation on Tuesday after a sexual harassment scandal.

But Ms. Hochul, a moderate Democrat from the Buffalo area who has kept a low profile as lieutenant governor, will soon confront a raft of difficult decisions on everything from guidance on mask rules to vaccine mandates.

In her first news conference on Wednesday as the soon-to-be-governor, Ms. Hochul did not say whether she would declare a new state of emergency to respond to rising transmission, as Mr. Cuomo did last year in March at the height of the pandemic, a restriction that was only lifted in late June of 2021.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations across the state is projected to climb to well over 15,000 by the end of August, according to the University of Texas at Austin’s Covid-19 model consortium.

“The fact that we’re having to construct the tents shows that the system in general is not prepared,” said Amanda Callaway, associate administrator for Harris Health System, which oversees the two hospitals in the Houston area requiring overflow space. “There’s lots of concern. There’s only so much you can do, only so many rooms. We’re just trying to respond as fast as we can.”

Aside from the tents, doctors are also treating patients in waiting rooms because of a shortage of beds, she said, adding that at least 90 percent of the coronavirus patients are unvaccinated.

Dr. David Persse, Houston’s chief medical officer, blamed inadequate attention by state officials to highlight the importance and necessity of vaccinations to stem the surge, with Mr. Abbott framing it as an issue of individual rights. “It’s the wrong approach,” Dr. Persse said. “The rhetoric around this has been such that people adhering to their right to make their own decisions are endangering themselves and their families.”

Mr. Abbott, like governors in Florida and elsewhere across the South, maintained his position even after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed course and recommended that both vaccinated and unvaccinated people wear masks indoors in high-risk areas. He issued an executive order prohibiting local governments from mandating vaccines and prohibiting school districts from enforcing masks.

A line stretched outside two buses on a busy corner in Queens. Everyone had a purple sticker signifying they were going to receive the Pfizer shot — and $100. The incentive is being offered at vaccination sites across the city.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The World Health Organization is testing three additional drugs as part of an enormous global trial to find effective treatments for Covid-19, the agency announced on Wednesday.

The trial, which involves researchers at more than 600 hospitals in 52 countries, will evaluate whether the drugs that have already been approved for other uses — one for malaria, one for cancer and one for autoimmune diseases — can reduce the risk of death in patients who are hospitalized with Covid.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O., said Wednesday that he hoped that “one or more of the drugs” would prove effective in treating the virus.

Although there are already some treatments available for people with Covid-19, including steroids and monoclonal antibodies, Dr. Tedros said, “We need more for patients at all ends of the clinical spectrum.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dr. Jose U. Scher, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health who has studied the effect of vaccines on the immunocompromised, said that the C.D.C. vote — and the guidance from its experts — would help patients who had been agonizing over whether to seek out a third shot. Previously, he said, when people tested themselves for antibodies after vaccination and came up empty, “there were no tools for us to respond to that.”

“We now know that this population was being left behind,” he said.

Immunocompromised people will not need a doctor’s permission or a prescription to get a third shot, C.D.C. officials said. They will need only to attest that they meet the eligibility requirements for an additional dose. Anyone else, including people with chronic medical conditions, like diabetes or asthma, should not be getting third shots at this point, they said.

Dr. Scher predicted that this honor-system approach could be messy. “I don’t know if there’s any way of corroborating someone’s claim” of being immunocompromised, he said. Requiring some kind of proof, such as a doctor’s note, would be a better process, he said.

The updated F.D.A. authorizations do not apply to immunocompromised people who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The C.D.C. panel did not offer recommendations on additional shots for that group, which is believed to be small. But the lack of guidance from either the F.D.A. or C.D.C. has left that group in limbo.

“We do understand the challenges here, and because of that we will continue to work very diligently to try to have a solution,” Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.’s top vaccine regulator, said at the panel’s meeting. The F.D.A. is waiting on more data that it expects to receive this month, including Johnson & Johnson’s clinical trial data on the safety and efficacy of two doses.

Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a C.D.C. official, said that patients who qualify for a third dose should ideally seek out the vaccine they already received, but that they could take the other two-dose vaccine if necessary.

Presenting studies that supported giving third doses, Dr. Dooling emphasized that immunocompromised people who receive a third dose should still wear a mask, maintain social distancing with people they do not live with, and avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces. She said that people with weakened immune systems had also been shown to be at greater risk of breakthrough infection.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In Alberta, any federal vote in the near future will come on top of municipal election campaigns as well as referendums on Canada’s equalization system and daylight saving time.

While none of the provincial elections were blamed for major outbreaks, a surge in cases caused Newfoundland to switch to mail-in ballots just 12 hours before voters were supposed to visit polls on Feb. 12, and to extend the election period until March 1. Things only got worse after that, with the final results not being confirmed until the end of that month.

Stephane Perrault, the chief electoral officer, has warned that a pandemic vote will likely lead to an enormous increase in mail-in ballots and perhaps a delay of a few days in announcing some results. Canada does not start counting mail ballots until the day after in-person voting to make sure that no one double-voted and to allow people to submit their ballots right up to the closing of polls.

That may leave some close races in limbo. In-person voters will also see changes such as voting at movie theaters because many usual voting spots like schools are currently reluctant to open up to large numbers of outsiders.

For weeks it’s been apparent that an election is coming soon. Mr. Trudeau and his cabinet members have been traveling the country making spending announcements, and the opposition leaders have similarly hit the road.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WASHINGTON — The Biden administration admonished the Republican governors of Texas and Florida on Friday for blocking local school districts from requiring masks or taking other measures to protect students from the coronavirus in the coming school year.

The secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, sent letters to the governors and their education commissioners, writing that he was concerned about recent executive actions taken by both governors.

Those orders, he wrote, prohibited districts from “voluntarily adopting science-based strategies for preventing the spread of Covid-19 that are aligned with the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” like universal masking. The letters were made public late Friday.

The debate over whether local school districts should be able to require masks has become highly partisan. Republicans have cast mask rules as an infringement on parental rights, while Democrats have said they are a matter of public health.

Días más tarde, su marido, Eugene Bily, de 90 años, empezó a toser y también se aletargó.

De no haber sido por una reunión familiar días antes, los hijos de los Bily no habrían sospechado del nuevo coronavirus. Podrían haber culpado a la gripe, o simplemente al avance de la edad. “Lo que oímos en la televisión fue ‘fiebre alta y dificultad para respirar’, pero ellos no tenían ninguno de esos síntomas”, recuerda Lamanno.

Sin embargo, una decena de invitados se habían reunido en un restaurante de Rockville Centre, Long Island, a principios de ese mes para celebrar el cumpleaños de una sobrina, y uno a uno la mayoría de ellos cayó enfermo de covid, incluidos Lamanno y su esposa.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Higher levels of gut microbiome diversity are generally thought to be a good thing. Studies have linked it to lower rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic disease and other ills. People who live in industrialized nations tend to have less microbial diversity in their guts than those living in more traditional, nonindustrialized societies. Some scientists speculate that modern lifestyle factors like diets high in processed foods, chronic stress and physical inactivity may suppress the growth of potentially beneficial gut microbes. Others argue that the correlation between diverse microbiomes and good health is overblown, and that the low levels of microbiome diversity typically seen in people living in developed nations may be suitably adapted to a modern world.

One subject on which there is usually little disagreement among nutrition experts is the benefits of a high-fiber diet. In large studies, people who consume more fruits, vegetables, nuts and other fiber-rich foods tend to have lower rates of mortality and less chronic disease. Fiber is considered good for gut health: Microbes in the gut feed on fiber and use it to produce beneficial byproducts like short-chain fatty acids, which can reduce inflammation. Some studies also suggest that eating a lot of fiber promotes a diverse microbiome.

The Stanford researchers expected that consuming a high-fiber diet would have a big impact on the makeup of the microbiome. Instead, the high-fiber group tended to show few changes in their microbial diversity. But when the scientists looked closer, they discovered something striking. People who started out with higher levels of microbial diversity had reductions in inflammation on the high-fiber diet, while those who had the least microbial diversity had slight increases in inflammation when they ate more fiber.

The researchers said they suspect that the people with low microbiome diversity may have lacked the right microbes to digest all the fiber they consumed. One finding that supports this: The high-fiber group had unexpectedly large amounts of carbohydrates in their stool that had not been degraded by their gut microbes. One possibility is that their guts needed more time to adapt to the high-fiber diet. But ultimately this finding could explain why some people experience bloating and other uncomfortable gastrointestinal issues when they eat a lot of fiber, said Christopher Gardner, another author of the study.

“Maybe the challenges that some people have with fiber is that their microbiomes aren’t prepared for it,” said Dr. Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.

One question that the researchers hope to answer in the future is what would happen if people simultaneously ate more fermented foods as well as more fiber. Would that increase the variety of microbes in their guts and improve their ability to digest more fiber? Would the two have a synergistic effect on inflammation?

Suzanne Devkota, the director of Microbiome Research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who was not involved in the new study, said it has long been assumed that eating fermented foods had health benefits but that the new research provides some of the first “hard evidence” that it can influence the gut and inflammation. “We were always a little reluctant to make comments about fermented foods being beneficial, particularly from an inflammatory standpoint, because there was really no data behind that,” she said.

A Florida school board defies the governor’s mask ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in Pensacola last year. Credit... Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The chairwoman of the Broward County School Board in Florida said on Sunday that the district had no choice but to defy Gov. Ron DeSantis’s ban on mask mandates. “We’re living out the nightmare of the Covid pandemic, where so many people in our county, including members of our staff and others, are being impacted,” Rosalind Osgood, who heads the school board, said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” Florida’s cases are soaring. The state reported a seven-day rolling average of 21,706 new daily cases on Saturday amid the worst surge of the pandemic. Deaths and hospitalizations are spiking, yet the number of tests administered has decreased. Broward County has lost two teachers and an educational assistant to complications from Covid-19, Dr. Osgood said. The school board imposed a mask mandate for students, staff members and visitors; a doctor’s note is required for student exemptions. “We believe that we have a constitutional obligation to protect the lives of our students and staff,” Dr. Osgood said. After Mr. DeSantis threatened to withhold school funds, the Biden administration stepped in. Officials said they supported the mask mandate and would allow the schools to use funds from pandemic relief measures to replace the salaries. “It was very encouraging to get the support of the White House during this very, very difficult time that we find ourselves in,” Dr. Osgood said. Educators in Florida are aware of the negative impact of so much time away from in-person schooling for many students, including mental health risks and declining academic performance, she said. That made the mask mandate all the more important, along with on-site testing measures, vaccination access and air filtration. “We’ve been working extremely hard to put these in place, and we’re not going to risk their lives by allowing it to be optional,” Dr. Osgood said. Other states have imposed similar bans on mask mandates. Recently, the Arkansas governor said he regretted approving such a ban and hamstringing schools’ ability to protect students under 12, who cannot yet be vaccinated. Read more

Trudeau calls an election in Canada amid a surge of new Covid cases. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, with his wife Sophie Grégoire and their children, arrived at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Sunday to discuss an election with Mary Simon, the governor general. Credit... Blair Gable/Reuters OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with Canada’s governor general on Sunday morning and set the country on a path to an election on Sept. 20. The move had been widely anticipated and signaled his confidence that voters would return him to power after three consecutive campaigns. The election will come less than two years after the previous vote and at a time when coronavirus cases are rising in many parts of the country, leading health officials to declare that a fourth wave is underway. Mr. Trudeau could have waited until 2024 to call an election. For several weeks, Mr. Trudeau, prominent members of his cabinet and the leaders of the main opposition parties have been making campaign-style appearances across Canada. Throughout the summer, several politicians have announced their retirements, signaling that a vote was looming. While campaigning recently, Erin O’Toole, the Conservative leader, and Jagmeet Singh, who leads the left-of-center New Democratic Party, condemned the idea of an election during the pandemic as dangerous, although provincial governments from both of their parties have held votes amid the health crisis. The opposition leaders also characterized an early vote as an unnecessary play by Mr. Trudeau to help his Liberal Party secure a majority in the House of Commons, something it was denied in 2019. Canadian political observers widely agree that Mr. Trudeau, 49, is gambling that his government’s generally well-received handling of the pandemic — Canada is on the verge of having the highest vaccination rate in the world — will translate into political success if an election is held soon. All major Canadian polls put Mr. Trudeau’s party ahead of the Conservatives, but Mr. Trudeau’s hoped-for parliamentary majority is not a sure thing. Much has changed for him politically since he promised “sunny ways” when the Liberal Party he helmed unexpectedly defeated the Conservatives in 2015. Read more

Doubts, anger and anxiety as another pandemic school year begins. Protesters rallied for and against mask mandates outside the Cobb County School District headquarters in Marietta, Ga., on Thursday. Credit... Audra Melton for The New York Times It was supposed to be a new school year, a fresh start with relative normalcy. Instead, it has turned into a politicized, anxiety-provoking experience for many parents, students and educators. This is the third academic year disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. And while there is now broad, bipartisan support for classrooms to be open five days a week, that was based on reassuring evidence from last year that the coronavirus did not spread widely inside schools. The surge in the Delta variant has introduced new uncertainty. Across the United States, there have been more than twice as many daily virus cases this week as there were one year ago. But it is unclear whether the Delta variant presents more danger in U.S. schools than previous forms of the virus. “Essentially, a year later, we’re in much the same place we were in last year with the challenge of keeping children safe,” said Raymond C. Hart, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of urban districts. Cobb County, in the Atlanta suburbs, may be a glimpse of what’s to come. Virus cases in the county, as of Friday, had risen by 76 percent in the last 14 days. But the school district has chosen not to have a mask mandate, and in the first two weeks of school, which began on Aug. 2, the district reported more than 700 coronavirus cases among students and staff members. (Overall enrollment is 110,000.) On Wednesday, the entire fifth grade at East Side Elementary School in Marietta was sent home because so many children had tested positive for the virus. At Walton High School, Holly Golden Simmel’s son, a junior, was exposed to the virus twice on his first day, in homeroom and in a science class. On the third day, he was exposed yet again. But he could still go to school, under the district’s policy, as long as he was asymptomatic and wore a mask for 10 days. Other students could remain unmasked. “I was incredulous,” Ms. Golden Simmel said. “This is a disaster in the making.” On Thursday evening, there were protests outside the Cobb County district’s offices in Marietta. Ms. Simmel and nearly 100 other parents — who want masks in schools and blame the superintendent for the lack of a mandate — clashed with a few who do not. Nationally, 62 percent of parents support masking requirements for unvaccinated students and school personnel, according to a poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. But in an indication of how politicized the debate remains, more than two-thirds of Republican parents oppose school mask mandates. And nine states, led by Republican governors or legislative majorities, have banned school mask mandates, according to research from the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a think tank. The next big debate may be about vaccine mandates, especially for teachers and school personnel. Some liberal-leaning cities, like Los Angeles and Chicago, are requiring all school staff members to be vaccinated. New York is planning to offer teachers the choice between vaccination and weekly testing. But a quarter of states, generally those that lean conservative, have banned vaccine mandates for public employees like teachers and school staff members, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education. Leaders of the national teachers’ unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, said in recent days that they supported vaccine mandates for their members.

As the city reawakens, an all-star video conjures a ‘New York State of Mind.’ As New York rises from its slumber, it’s clear this isn’t just any morning. There’s Stephen Colbert, emerging onto a rooftop, and Peppermint, a drag performer, strolling on a bridge in glittering heels. On the Lower East Side, Sara Bareilles is sitting in a cafe, but she has something on her mind, so she’s not touching her lox bagel. “Some folks like to get away,” she croons, “take a holiday from the neighborhood.” That’s the opening line of Billy Joel’s 1976 song “New York State of Mind.” Some of New York’s most recognizable entertainers follow Ms. Bareilles, as they take turns singing, dancing and playing instruments in a music video that was released on Sunday in an effort to uplift the city as it recovers from the pandemic. “New York State of Mind,” with its lyrics about the Hudson River, Greyhound buses and this newspaper, is a fixture in any situation in which New York spirit is required. It has been invoked in hard times over the years, from the city’s fiscal crisis in the 1970s to the aftermath of 9/11. As the city emerges from the darkest days of the pandemic, the volunteer organization behind the video, NYCNext, hopes the cover will remind New Yorkers of the vibrancy of their city, said Tom Kitt, a Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning composer who helped produce the video. Suzanne Vega performs inside Tom’s Restaurant, the Morningside Heights establishment she helped make famous with “Tom’s Diner.” The Broadway performer Jerry Dixon and the comedian Mario Cantone sing in front of the fountain at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn. The actress LaChanze belts a bridge on the roof of the Steinway & Sons factory in Queens, where the pianist Chloe Flower delivers a soaring arpeggio.

The U.S. is preparing a plan to offer vaccine boosters as early as fall. A man waiting to receive his second shot of a vaccine. The first booster shots would most likely go to nursing home residents and health care workers. Credit... Christopher Occhicone for The New York Times With a stockpile of at least 100 million doses at the ready, Biden administration officials are developing a plan to start offering Covid-19 booster shots to some Americans as early as this fall, even as researchers continue to hotly debate whether extra shots are needed, according to people familiar with the effort. The first boosters are likely to go to nursing home residents and health care workers, followed by other older people who were near the front of the line when vaccinations began last year. Officials envision giving people the same vaccine they originally received. They have discussed starting the effort in October but have not settled on a timetable. While many outside experts argue there is no proof yet that the vaccines’ high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization is waning in the United States, administration officials say they cannot afford to put off figuring out the logistics of providing boosters to millions of people. The spotty nature of the nation’s disease-reporting network makes the question of timing even trickier. The effort comes as the nation is gripped by a virus wave driven by the more contagious Delta variant. Hospitals in states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are again swamped with patients, the vast majority of them unvaccinated. The administration is also carefully watching Israel, where some data suggests an uptick in severe disease among older adults who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine early in that nation’s campaign, according to people who have reviewed it. Some officials are concerned that even if a decline in protection merely results in mild or asymptomatic infections, those infected could still spread the virus and prolong the pandemic. Any booster policy decision is fraught, officials said, because the administration does not want to undermine public confidence in what have proved to be powerfully effective vaccines. Nor does it want to overvaccinate Americans when many other countries have yet to even begin vaccination campaigns in earnest, increasing the threat of dangerous new variants that could spread to the United States and evade the vaccines.

New York landlords and tenants square off over evictions after Supreme Court ruling. Demonstrators called for the expansion of New York’s eviction moratorium on Wednesday, but a day later it was partly blocked by the Supreme Court. Credit... Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A Supreme Court ruling last week blocking part of an eviction moratorium in New York State has given a glimmer of hope to struggling landlords, but has fanned fears among financially unstable tenants. The ruling means that landlords will be able to bring tenants to court and allow a judge to decide whether an eviction is warranted. It took aim at a provision of the New York State moratorium, which was enacted last year and is set to expire on Aug. 31, that barred evictions of tenants who file a form declaring economic hardship, rather than providing evidence in court. There is speculation that Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is set to become New York’s next governor after Gov. Andrew Cuomo leaves office amid a sexual harassment scandal, may push for new protections. In a statement on Thursday, she promised to “strengthen the eviction moratorium legislation.” More than 830,000 households in New York State, a majority of them in New York City, are behind on rent, according to an analysis of census data by the National Equity Atlas, a research group associated with the University of Southern California. But a $2 billion rental assistance program aimed at helping tenants pay their landlords has given funds to fewer than 5 percent of applicants since its start in June. With the Supreme Court ruling, New York landlords could technically start filing suits immediately to evict tenants, although it takes two weeks between sending a notice and executing an eviction. But the order does not block a tenant’s ability to mount a so-called hardship defense. Randy M. Mastro, a lawyer for the landlords who had challenged the law, said that “both tenants and landlords suffered from the pandemic, and this gives a level playing field, as a matter of fairness, so that both sides can be heard in court.” Lawyers said the ruling essentially allows housing courts to operate as they used to before the pandemic. A federal moratorium on evictions in areas of high transmission, renewed this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, offers some protection to tenants but does not prevent landlords from taking them to court. That moratorium is set to expire on Oct. 3. Read more
