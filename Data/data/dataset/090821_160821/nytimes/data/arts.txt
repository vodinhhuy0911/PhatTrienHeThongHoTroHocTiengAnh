TAZBAH CHAVEZ Even two and a half years ago, to be a Native writer or have any Native characters on any show was a big deal. We went from feeling blessed then, to now being on these shows where you have half or full Native writers’ rooms, Native directors, full casts of Native actors. Part of that has to do with the way that we all function as community.

There’s Indigenous values that are operating within our come-up, opening doors and mentoring each other. There’s going to be this huge rise of Native artists and creatives, because we would never leave each other behind. We just were not in a position of hiring power before, which is where we are now with people like Sterlin and Sierra.

MIGIZI PENSONEAU Sierra and Sterlin are the first ones to like break through, but there’s a whole bunch of us pushing them from the back as well. I didn’t expect us to break through in the way that we have. But now that it’s happening, it’s time to get used to everybody’s names here.

There’s so much overlap between creators and actors on the two shows.

CHAVEZ We all know each other. There’s not a project out there that we don’t know about. We all support each other, and I don’t think there’s competition.

How important is it to you to open doors for less experienced Indigenous crew and cast?

JANA SCHMIEDING It’s my responsibility as a person who has a bit of leverage at this point to do everything that I can to share any skills that I’ve learned. And I’m learning from the best. I can’t believe the people that I am mentored by, on a Mike Schur show, on a Sierra Teller Ornelas show. Capacity building is also kind of a cultural value.

FREELAND From my personal experience and working in Hollywood, the words “film industry” and “community” don’t necessarily go together. It’s hypercompetitive and you’re fending for yourself. It’s so refreshing and heartening to see the Indigenous side bleeding into the process and making shows as we would want to make them, with us at the helm.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Among performers who are intent on seeing the institution change, it is crucial to diversify the audience as well, which tends to skew older and whiter. These performers aren’t thrilled with the new ticket pricing system, which Second City started testing shortly before the pandemic.

The system, called dynamic ticket pricing, calculates prices based on the time of the show and number of tickets left. The cheapest tickets cost $25 each, but with growing interest in the return of live theater and lower-than-usual ticket inventory because of the pandemic, they can run much higher. This Saturday, tickets for the 7 p.m. shows are about $90 each.

Some performers worry that raising ticket prices will help maintain the status quo.

“How can I make this a show that makes people feel included and have an audience that reflects how we look?” asked Terrence Carey, a Second City performer who is Black.

A spokeswoman for Second City, Colleen Fahey, said the ticket pricing model is helpful in allowing the company to recoup revenue after a 14-month shutdown. She added that customers still have access to cheaper tickets.

At iO, Olivia Jackson, one of the creators of the petition, said she was eager to meet with the new owners to discuss the issues her group raised. After that, she would determine whether to return to iO. If she decided against it, she could always turn to one of the newer, scrappier operations.

“There are so many insanely talented people in Chicago who really love improv,” she said. “Chicago improv will be OK.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Who couldn’t use a warm welcome back to live theater like the one being offered these late-summer evenings in Central Park? There, Jocelyn Bioh’s “Merry Wives,” a joyful adaptation of Shakespeare’s “The Merry Wives of Windsor” set in an African diasporic community in Harlem, is doing everything a comedy can do to embrace all comers.

First, the director Saheem Ali, who was born in Kenya, delivers enthusiastic greetings over the Delacorte Theater’s loudspeakers. Next, Farai Malianga, a drummer from Zimbabwe, leads the audience in a call and response chorus of vernacular African salutations: “Asé” (Nigeria), “Yebo” (South Africa) and “Wau-Wau” (Senegal) among them. By the time the play proper starts, we are all guiltless cultural appropriators.

Or should I say the play improper? Purists who pine for the original (circa 1597) text — and possibly the world in which it existed — will find plenty that gets their goat in Bioh’s makeover, including roasted goat. She has cut the number of characters nearly in half and the running time by more than a third. (Ali’s production comes in at a swift 110 minutes, with no intermission.) Much of Shakespeare’s wordplay, incomprehensible without an Elizabethan thesaurus, has been swept away along with words like “master” and “mistress” and their buzzkill implications.

Thankfully, Bioh has not replaced them with woke lecturing. She has said she wanted a “Merry Wives” that her Ghanaian family could enjoy, and in achieving the goal has not excluded the rest of us. Or, rather, she has made us all a part of the family, perhaps erasing some of Shakespeare’s worldview in the process, but underlining the human qualities we know from our own households — or, if not, from popular culture.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A judge overseeing the conservatorship of Britney Spears has denied a request to expedite a forthcoming hearing that will focus on whether to remove or suspend the singer’s father from a role in directing the legal arrangement, as a new lawyer for Ms. Spears recently petitioned.

The ruling by Judge Brenda Penny on Monday in Los Angeles probate court denied the request made last week by Mathew S. Rosengart, a former federal prosecutor who was approved in July to replace the court-appointed lawyer who began representing Ms. Spears in 2008.

Mr. Rosengart had called for moving up a Sept. 29 hearing in the case as he seeks to have the singer’s father, James P. Spears, removed as conservator of her estate, a position Mr. Spears has held, sometimes in collaboration with others, for 13 years. Ms. Spears has called the arrangement abusive and exploitative, singling out her father’s control over the conservatorship.

“Every day that passes is another day of avoidable harm and prejudice to Ms. Spears and the Estate,” her lawyer wrote last week, in calling for Mr. Spears’s immediate suspension or a quicker hearing date.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@How does this new iteration pay homage to the original while also carving out its own identity?

The premise is very much the same. It’s about wish fulfillment; it’s about growing as a human being; it’s about making dreams come true. Guests come to the island — they have a desire, they have a dream, whatever it is — then the island helps them navigate through a journey that has magic and can fulfill them.

But the fact that the lead role is a female, that’s a testament to how the showrunners wanted to do something that is a little more current. Directors, a lot of heads of departments, showrunners — they’re all female, behind the camera and in front of the camera. They took some creative liberties that are going to elevate the material, especially the fact that you have minorities in charge as leads. It’s keeping up with the current times.

Why is now the right time for another adaptation of “Fantasy Island”? What sets this one apart from its predecessors?

Because of everything that is going on in the world right now. The world — especially in the United States — is in such an in-between, gray area right now, and I think people are looking for escapism, things that are positive. You want to still see blue skies, and you want to see hope for the future. I think people want to see minorities. Inclusivity is a very important topic nowadays, and we, all these different ethnicities that are so underrepresented, are fighting hard.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SALZBURG, Austria — “I personally don’t like the word ‘reliable,’” Robert Carsen said in an interview here recently. “It sounds so boring.”

I had approached Carsen with a theory: that he might be the most, well, reliable director in opera. I meant it as high praise: His work is by no means repetitive, cautious or dull. But in more than 125 productions over three decades in the field, he has been peerlessly dependable.

You can expect Carsen productions to be sophisticated, intelligently conceived and conceptually airtight. They connect with newcomers, while also leaving room for mystery and provocation. They are elegantly designed, even strikingly beautiful, yet not superficial. And always — reliably, you could say — their confidence reflects Carsen’s mastery of the material at hand.

All this is evident in his staging of Handel’s oratorio “Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno,” which is running at the Salzburg Festival through Aug. 17. But it also can be clearly seen in the 10 more of his productions that I revisited on video this summer.

Stephen Colbert opened “The Late Show” on Monday with a story of “being disinvited from the cool kid’s party” that was former President Barack Obama’s 60th birthday on Martha’s Vineyard over the weekend.

“Here’s the thing — a hot ticket is what it was, but given the whole pandemic thing and the Delta variant, a celebrity mosh pit was maybe not the wisest choice, so Obama decided to scale back the guest list for his party,” Colbert explained.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@RUN

Book One

By John Lewis and Andrew Aydin

Illustrated by L. Fury with Nate Powell

If this were a graphic book review it would start out with a drawing of me on a lounge chair holding Congressman John Lewis’s latest graphic memoir, “Run: Book One.” There would be a skeptical look on my face. “Voter suppression in comics?” I would ask while mulling how sketches and snippets of dialogue and made-up words like WHEEEOOOOWWWWWWWW could possibly capture such a sinister and complex period of our history.

By the end, you’d see me in the same spot, a chalice to my lips and a faraway look in my eyes. The skepticism would be gone. I might say something like MMHMM.

Anyone familiar with Lewis’s celebrated “March” trilogy (whose final book is still the only comic to win a National Book Award) knows that graphic novels can handle nuance quite adeptly. This work, most of which was completed by Lewis and his team of collaborators before he died in the summer of 2020, picks up where “March” left off, with the civil rights movement winning important legislative gains in the 1960s but still very much unfinished in its aims. There’s a timeliness to “Run,” a reminder that the efforts to keep prospective voters from casting their ballots that are so much in the headlines these days are nothing new.

It turns out the animus that drives so much of our nation’s history is well suited to this form. One encounters in the arresting artwork of “Run” beady eyes, angry grimaces, looks of anguish and defiance. “Now git!” says the finger-pointing, scowling white man who emerges from a whites-only church in the opening pages to tell a young Lewis to end his protest of the segregated services inside. No need to go on and on about his disdain for those born with more melanin in their skin or his hypocrisy in praying to the Lord while acting devilish.

Q. Is it true that if a woman hasn’t achieved her highest good by age 55 she never will? Do you have any books or films you’d recommend about women yearning for more creatively? I have loved celebrating the work of others and wonder what my best work is or if it has been done yet.

Kamala Harris turned 56 last October, shortly before she was elected vice president of the United States; the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature at age 57, while she was working on two new books. So 55 is hardly a border beyond which all is shadow. True, in the middle of adulthood it’s easy to envy those merely on the brink of it, with their imagined freedom to wander and aspire and their seemingly endless (and endlessly squandered) free time — forgetting how much of those rootless years were eaten up by uncertainty and fear. I, too, would love to be 20 once more, however miserable I actually was back then.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@GARRISON, N.Y. — Prospero’s grievance has been gnawing at him a dozen years when at last he speaks of it to his teenage daughter, Miranda, explaining how they were forced from their noble life in Milan into island exile.

His own treacherous brother snatched his dukedom away, propelled by “an evil nature” and a craving for power that Prospero — bookish sorcerer, kindly father, distracted ruler — hadn’t suspected in him.

Does he sense his own darkness, though? His own lust for dominion? The way Prospero spins his tale, he is a great man and a good guy wronged. But in Ryan Quinn’s fitfully magical production of “The Tempest” at Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, the cruelty that lurks in him is abundantly on display.

The long-lashed, gold-dusted spirit Ariel (Britney Simpson), forced to do Prospero’s bidding, desires her freedom from him more than anything. The brutish Caliban (Jason O’Connell) wants the same, and to be left in peace on the island that was his before this enslaving invader arrived. Both of them call him master.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Billie Eilish emerged a few years ago as the embodiment of the new-model pop star — flooding the internet with content, designing merch items herself and accumulating boatloads of fans through social media.

But in some ways her mode of success is thoroughly traditional. “Happier Than Ever,” the seven-time Grammy winner’s second studio album, opens at No. 1 on the latest Billboard album chart with decent streaming traffic but extraordinary sales of vinyl, CDs and even cassettes. It had 114 million streams — far exceeded by other recent chart-toppers by J. Cole, Olivia Rodrigo and Morgan Wallen, among others — but sold 153,000 copies as a complete package.

Altogether, “Happier Than Ever,” Eilish’s second No. 1 album, had the equivalent of 238,000 sales in the United States, according to MRC Data, Billboard’s tracking arm. It was the fifth-best opening for an album this year — beaten by Cole, Rodrigo, Wallen and Taylor Swift.

Released in an array of boxed sets and retail-exclusive variants, “Happier Than Ever” made 54 percent of its total sales in the United States on physical formats, including 73,000 vinyl LPs, 46,000 CDs and nearly 10,000 on cassette. It had the second-highest weekly vinyl haul since at least 1991, when SoundScan, MRC Data’s predecessor, first began keeping accurate data on music sales. (Only Swift’s recent LP release of “Evermore,” which sold 102,000 copies after months of preorders, had more.)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'm a terrible patient and an impatient nurse. I will take to my bed with a scratchy throat, texting a bossy shopping list to the family member who is unlucky enough to be dispatched to the drugstore on my behalf. (Why is it so hard to find Luden’s cough drops?) But when the tables are turned — for instance, when my husband was recovering from shoulder surgery — I assume a brusque, snappy air, Florence Nightingale overseeing a ward of rowdy soldiers instead of a kind man whose worst offense is playing hockey in midlife.

Accompanied by my own eccentricities, I ventured into EVERYTHING I HAVE IS YOURS (Flatiron, 400 pp., $27.99), Eleanor Henderson’s account of her husband Aaron’s three diseases — as she describes them, “addiction, mental illness and what I have taken to calling, inadequately, ‘chronic illness.’” I wasn’t sure I would have the stomach for Aaron’s bewildering medical conditions (worms are involved; so is skin) or for her forbearance, which is evident from the first page.

Henderson begins in their bedroom in Ithaca, N.Y., where she is trying to coax Aaron to sleep as he writhes in pain from the rashes and boils covering his body. After being sober for four years, he’s chasing a battery of prescription medications with Smirnoff Ice. “He is struggling, crying out, his eyes squeezed shut in pain,” Henderson writes. “I rub his back. I kiss his forehead. ‘It’s OK,’ I whisper. ‘You’re OK.’”

Aaron is not OK, that much is clear. Over the course of the book, spanning states and decades, births of two sons and deaths of parents, he receives diagnosis after diagnosis, each more incomplete and indefinite than the last. Some experts believe he has Morgellons disease (don’t Google it); others blame stress; one acupuncturist and herbalist says Aaron has “too much fire.” There is no clear path to wellness or course of treatment. Family members are loyal but perplexed; the neighbors don’t arrange a casserole brigade. It’s hard to mobilize around a condition that has no name, trajectory or known cause.

Henderson jumps around in time, dipping into her early days with Aaron and then back to the waiting room at urgent care and then to the time she meets her brothers to spread their father’s ashes and Aaron can’t be there. You feel for him, but you also worry about Henderson, who bears the brunt of their emotional and financial responsibilities. When she’s recalling the most difficult moments, she lapses into the second person: “After many unbearable hours on the porch, as the sky darkened and you’d both talked yourselves dry, you took him into the bedroom and made peace.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s incumbent on the author of a good book to provide an apt title. Would we feel the same way about Faulkner’s “Intruder in the Dust” if it were called, as he once considered, “Malpractice in the Dust”?

“Playlist for the Apocalypse,” Rita Dove’s new book of poems, is among her best. The title makes it leap from the bookcase. It’s about life in what she calls this “shining, blistered republic.”

It’s about the weight of American history, which Dove treats as news we’re still actively metabolizing. It’s about mortality. This book is the first time the poet has publicly acknowledged that she has — and has had for more than 20 years — a form of multiple sclerosis.

It’s about family, food and front porches, too. Dove’s books derive their force from how she so deftly stirs the everyday — insomnia, TV movies, Stilton cheese, rattling containers of pills — into her world of ideas and intellection, in poems that are by turns delicate, witty and audacious. Her sleepless eye for cant, necessary in all good poetry, is a bonus.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jennifer Hudson had plenty of time to think about how to portray Aretha Franklin onscreen. In 2007, soon after Hudson won the Academy Award for best supporting actress — for playing a girl-group singer in “Dreamgirls” — Franklin told Hudson she should play her in a biopic, starting a decade-long friendship filled with weekly conversations.

Like Franklin, Hudson grew up singing in church, and she has poured gospel virtuosity into pop songs. And like Franklin, whose mother died at 34 of a heart attack, Hudson experienced sudden, devastating loss: her mother, brother and nephew were murdered in Chicago in 2008. In her career, Hudson has repeatedly paid tribute to Franklin, from using a Franklin song for her “American Idol” audition in 2004 to singing “Amazing Grace” at Franklin’s funeral in 2018. Now, Hudson is playing Franklin in the biopic “Respect” that comes to theaters this week.

“Every artist, every musician, you’ve got to cross paths with Aretha, especially if you want to be great,” Hudson said in a video interview from Chicago, where she lives; her gray cat, Macavity, prowled in the background. “She’s always been present in my life in some form, even when I didn’t know it.”

As Hudson explained the choices that went into her performance, she said that through the movie, she came to understand just how much of a “blueprint” Franklin was. “Our church music was based solely on her. The ‘Amazing Grace’ that I grew up singing in church came from her ‘Amazing Grace’ album. I didn’t realize that until we were doing research on the film.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After more than a year of pandemic-related crises, Manuel Antonio Morán wanted to give a gift to New York. He envisioned something lighthearted and uplifting, but also thought-provoking and as varied as the city itself. The answer? Puppets.

But there’s nothing here to prompt sneers or eye rolling. The International Puppet Fringe Festival NYC, which arrives this week with over 50 shows and events, more than a dozen short films and five accompanying exhibitions, including “Puppets of New York” at the Museum of the City of New York, is far from a kiddie celebration.

“The wrong perception in the United States is that puppetry is just for children or to be used for education,” Morán, the festival’s artistic director, said in an interview at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural and Educational Center, the programming’s Lower East Side hub. “That’s something I’m fighting every single day.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The scenes were inspired by current events, but Hinterhäuser said the sum of their parts transcended the particular situation of Italy circa 1960.

“We could also be talking about ‘Fidelio,’” he said. “Great artworks have something prophetic, and there is something prophetic that liberates this piece. I’m not interested in daily politics and art; I’m interested in politics and art. And while art is not free from political elements, it needs to have another level of reflection.”

Nono’s score is often, a bit unfairly, described as strident. The piece calls for a massive orchestra — in Salzburg, the Vienna Philharmonic, filling the pit of the Felsenreitschule theater and also flanking its stage with a battery of percussion. The cast is no smaller in scale: a full chorus, unaccompanied in the first and last scenes, and principal singers who perform at extremes of pitch and volume.

“It’s an opera about a collective,” Hinterhäuser said. “It has to do with muscles — the choir, the cast, the 26 dancers we have in this production — and the rising up of the masses.”

To reflect that, he brought in Lauwers, who directed Monteverdi’s “L’Incoronazione di Poppea” at Salzburg in 2018. In an interview, Lauwers described his work this summer as a continuation of his broader preoccupation over the past decade with theater focused almost entirely on people. This is why the set is virtually nonexistent here, and is mostly just projections on the towering stone backdrop of the Felsenreitschule, the word “INTOLLERANZA” written across its broad stage.

Within that space, a cast of nearly 100 singers and dancers is almost always in motion and onstage for the work’s 75-minute running time. The tenor Sean Panikkar, who plays the emigrant protagonist, said that Lauwers has conducted rehearsals with an improvisational style, “which allows for freedom and play,” before arriving at a more narrowed focus.

At the farm, which recently finished a run of a site-specific play about climate change, the boundless stage includes a courtyard lined with hydrangeas, greenhouses and a field of flowers. Over four nights last week, audience members trekked the outdoors there, walking from scene to scene, as the actors, musicians and stilt walkers performed in vibrant, whimsical costumes.

The performance is the second installment of a decade-long series, “Dream on the Farm,” in which the Farm Arts Collective, whose home is on the 30 acres, plans to produce one play a year centered on climate change.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the months following its October release, Mr. Cuomo’s book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Pandemic,” became a source of financial and ethical headaches for Crown. Sales were surprisingly weak for a title that Crown had invested in heavily, with fewer than 50,000 hardcover copies sold, according to NPD BookScan. Promoting the book became challenging, as Mr. Cuomo was mired in investigations that battered his public image, including allegations of sexual harassment from several women. In March, Crown made an attempt to distance itself from the governor, saying that it had canceled plans for a paperback version and would no longer promote the book.

Following Mr. Cuomo’s resignation announcement on Tuesday, questions remained about whether Crown will pay the remainder of his advance. The governor’s tax records and other financial disclosures, which were released in May, showed that he received the bulk of his advance, $3.12 million, in 2020, and expected to receive the remaining $2 million in installments over the next two years. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said around that time that the governor netted about $1.5 million for the book after taxes and expenses, and that he donated $500,000 to the United Way of New York State for its Covid-relief program.

David Drake, the president of Crown, declined to comment, saying “we never comment on contractual matters or financial arrangements with any of our authors.” Robert Barnett, the lawyer who represented Mr. Cuomo in his book deal, declined to comment.

Both the New York attorney general’s office and the New York State Assembly’s judiciary committee have been investigating whether ethics rules were violated when government employees worked on Mr. Cuomo’s book. Staffers helped with tasks such as typing notes or printing and delivering drafts to the Executive Mansion, where Mr. Cuomo lives. His top aide, Melissa DeRosa, who announced her resignation on Sunday, joined video meetings with publishers and helped Mr. Cuomo edit drafts of the book.

The governor was granted permission to author the book by the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics. The commission barred Mr. Cuomo from using state resources, including help from government employees, to work on it. The Assembly’s inquiry is part of its broader impeachment investigation, the fate of which remains unclear now that Mr. Cuomo has resigned.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Cannes Palme d’Or winner “Titane,” about a serial killer with rather unorthodox sexual tastes, and the Sundance critical hit “Passing,” an adaptation of the Harlem Renaissance novel by Nella Larsen, are among the highlights of the 59th New York Film Festival, organizers announced on Tuesday.

After last year’s virtual edition, screenings will be held in-person with proof of vaccination required, although there will be some outdoor and virtual events. (More details on pandemic protocols will be released in the coming weeks.)

As previously announced, “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” Joel Coen’s solo directing debut, will play opening night, Sept. 24. A take on the play by Shakespeare, it stars Denzel Washington in the title role and Frances McDormand, the director’s wife, as Lady Macbeth. The centerpiece of the festival will be “The Power of the Dog,” the first Jane Campion film in more than a decade, and “Parallel Mothers,” from Pedro Almodóvar, will be the closing-night title.

The main slate will feature a mix of premieres and highlights from earlier festivals. The body horror tale “Titane” made headlines last month when its director, Julia Ducournau, became only the second woman (after Campion in 1993) to win Cannes’ top prize. Other titles from the French festival heading to New York include “Benedetta,” Paul Verhoeven’s 17th-century lesbian nun potboiler; “The Souvenir Part II,” Joanna Hogg’s follow-up to her 2019 semi-autobiographical drama about a film student in 1980s London; and “The Velvet Underground,” Todd Haynes’s documentary about the band synonymous with Andy Warhol’s New York.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Spencer Ackerman’s barnburner of a new book, “Reign of Terror,” reminded me of that moment in 2015 (remember then?) when Donald J. Trump descended his golden escalator to announce his long-shot candidacy for the highest office. Instead of starting with the usual heartwarming clichés about the country’s better angels, Trump came out swinging, declaring that the United States was in trouble: “When was the last time the U.S. won at anything?”

It certainly hadn’t been winning any of the wars it had been fighting for more than a decade. Ackerman contends that the American response to 9/11 made President Trump possible. The evidence for this blunt-force thesis is presented in “Reign of Terror” with an impressive combination of diligence and verve, deploying Ackerman’s deep stores of knowledge as a national security journalist to full effect. The result is a narrative of the last 20 years that is upsetting, discerning and brilliantly argued.

Ackerman, who has been a correspondent for outlets like Wired and The Guardian, shows how Trump clearly understood something about the post-9/11 era that the professional political class did not. Waging endless war — on Afghanistan, on Iraq, on terror — yielded nothing so definitive as peace or victory, and instead simply fueled a “grotesque subtext” to which Trump proved to be remarkably attuned. He may have changed his positions on this or that conflict willy-nilly, but Trump, Ackerman writes, never wavered on one key point — “the perception of nonwhites as marauders, even as conquerors, from hostile foreign civilizations.”

“Reign of Terror” begins with a prologue titled “The Worst Terrorist Attack in American History” — a phrase that for years had referred not to the 9/11 attacks but to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. In the immediate aftermath, Muslims were blamed. Newspaper columnists started railing against foreigners and immigrants. The actual culprit, Timothy McVeigh, had been an avowed white supremacist, though you wouldn’t have necessarily known it from the media reports at the time, which kept emphasizing McVeigh’s “survivalism.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Walter Yetnikoff, who led CBS Records during the boom years of Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” album and lived the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll life more indulgently than many of his stars did, died on Monday at a hospital in Bridgeport, Conn. He was 87.

His wife, Lynda Yetnikoff, said the cause was cancer.

Mr. Yetnikoff was one of the most powerful, insatiable and abrasive figures in music in the years just before the digital revolution upended the business.

He was among a small group of powerful executives who shaped the record business in the rock era, including Clive Davis (who led Columbia Records and founded Arista Records), David Geffen of Asylum and Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic. He strode through those heady days of hit records brashly, licentiously and, by his own admission, often drunk or drug-addled.

Though he never claimed to have much of an ear for music, he was adept at pacifying the stars on his roster — who in addition to Mr. Jackson included Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand and Billy Joel — and at outmaneuvering competitors and perceived enemies, at least into the late 1980s.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@THE REPUBLIC OF FALSE TRUTHS

By Alaa Al Aswany

Translated by S. R. Fellowes

Alaa Al Aswany’s latest novel begins with an Egyptian general waking up punctually, with “no need of an alarm clock,” for the dawn prayer, which he performs with feelings of “deep and genuine humility.” He spends the rest of the morning overseeing the torture of a political prisoner, though his heart isn’t really in it. He’s worried about his daughter, a medical student who has been posting videos on Facebook that show the police brutalizing civilians.

Aswany’s opening is a clever riff on the most celebrated novel in Arabic literature, Naguib Mahfouz’s “Palace Walk” (published in 1956), which also begins with a character waking in the night “without having to rely on an alarm clock.” But it’s a risky move too, since all allusions invite comparisons and these aren’t always in Aswany’s favor.

Like Mahfouz’s novel — and like Aswany’s best-known work, “The Yacoubian Building” — “The Republic of False Truths” is a panoramic fiction with a large cast of characters: generals and schoolteachers, factory managers and chauffeurs. Both novels take aim at the hypocrisies of power, especially the patriarchal kind, and show how political crises can divide families along generational lines. The climax of Mahfouz’s story is the 1919 revolution against the British, while Aswany’s novel centers on the occupation of Tahrir Square in 2011.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AMERICAN ESTRANGEMENT

By Saïd Sayrafiezadeh

The first sentence of “Audition,” the opening story of Saïd Sayrafiezadeh’s excellent new collection, is the kind of thing story writers pray for while fending off their agents’ pleas to finally just write a novel. It’s an entire world compressed into a dense instant. Just try not to get pulled in: “The first time I smoked crack cocaine was the spring I worked construction for my father on his new subdivision in Moonlight Heights.”

The story’s 19-year-old protagonist is an aspiring actor who dreams of moving to Los Angeles, but is instead trapped in “the soft, downy repetitiveness” of a midsize city and the living wage he earns from his father. It’s the ’90s: “Seinfeld” and Michael Jordan loom over everything, serving as potent symbols for the combination of overstimulation and banality that defined the era (and, in the story’s casually cosmic scope, every era). The narrator accepts an offer to “party” from a fellow construction worker, who educates him in the art of purchasing cartons of black-market cigarettes and preparing and smoking crack. The story’s structure resembles that of a sestina, the same elements — Jordan, Seinfeld, aluminum foil, Chore Boy and baking soda — recombining in different configurations throughout to dizzying effect. I’ve taught it to writing students numerous times since it was first published in The New Yorker in 2018, in an attempt to disprove truisms about “rising action” and characters “needing to change.” I would, I’m trying to tell them, prefer that the future of American fiction be more like this story.

“American Estrangement” is Sayrafiezadeh’s second collection — the first was the vivid, deadpan War on Terror-era story cycle “Brief Encounters With the Enemy” — and he writes with a veteran’s swagger and discipline. Nothing here feels obligatory or tossed off; instead, the collection joins a list that includes Leonard Michaels’s “I Would Have Saved Them if I Could,” Lorrie Moore’s “Like Life” and Charles D’Ambrosio’s “The Dead Fish Museum” as a second book of stories that exceeds and expands upon the promise of the first, confirming the writer as a major, committed practitioner of a difficult form.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Séraphin Turihamwe, the sharp-witted protagonist of Ngamije’s debut novel, “The Eternal Audience of One,” is bursting with teen angst when we first meet him in hot and dusty Windhoek, Namibia. The son of Rwandan exiles, he feels doubly alienated, desperate to lose his virginity — there’s a comically failed attempt — and escape his humdrum life in this culturally barren land. “By the time Séraphin reached university, he was determined to be a citizen of the world,” Ngamije writes. “His heart was a library of longings, his mind a hive of buzzing trivia.”

Flash-forward to the present: Séraphin is in his final year at an elite law school in Cape Town in the late aughts and the center of a circle of friends from across Africa who call themselves, ironically, “The High Lords of Empireland.” In Cape Town he finally feels “the cramped corners of his being relax and stretch as he filled out his skin.” He is now much more sexually experienced, too, rotating through a series of hookups and heartbreaks, and a regular at various local hot spots.

Despite the book’s title, though, this is essentially a choral novel, where the adventures, banter and text messages of the “High Lords” take center stage, exposing the sexual and racial politics of an ambitious new generation making their way in South Africa’s “Rainbow Nation.” Even Séraphin’s internal voices are a cacophony, as he obsesses over his relationships and playlists, not to mention run-ins with racist doormen and cops. This is a novel of youthful anxiety and dreams — written at a lively, chatty pace — that poses an eternal question: What will happen after graduation?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The story increases speed once Ramadan arrives in the Middle East. While the first half of the book, the portion set in New Orleans, spans nearly 13 years, the second half takes place over a long weekend. This section of the book follows Ramadan from New Orleans to Turkey to Syria on his quest to find Mustafa. Ultimately, over the course of the book, Ramadan meets a host of memorable characters and visits various locations around the world, from the New Orleans Superdome, crowded with evacuees in the immediate aftermath of Katrina, to the Hagia Sophia stuffed with tourists.

If this all sounds like a bit much, that’s because it is. But Edwards holds readers’ attention with his attention to language and his skill at quick, yet rich, characterization. As the plot rips along, Edwards plays the characters straight, rather than for laughs, and in the process, he presents characters who are often able to overcome their pain or mistrust of others and do the right thing. Ramadan and the people around him respond to the dire situations they face as overwhelmed people often do: by doing the best they can.

Even with so much plot happening, Edwards is adept at callbacks and uses the earlier settings and plot points to arrive at greater meaning. More than once, as young Ramadan tries to make sense of his circumstances, he recalls the words of someone who was kind to him and repeats those words as mantras that guide him. “It’s so easy,” he tells himself, echoing a phrase he learns from a tarot card reader, which, to Ramadan, becomes a lesson that the obstacles in his path are not as formidable as they appear. “Everything depends on how hungry we are,” becomes another motto, this one picked up from Mama Joon, who explains to Ramadan that it will require great effort on his part to pursue any of his dreams. As basic as some of these mantras are, they bring comfort to Ramadan and potentially the reader, who may be reminded of the clarifying power of a simple idea.

Edwards, a critically acclaimed writer who has received both a Guggenheim fellowship and a Whiting Award, hasn’t published a book-length work in nearly two decades. His new book was worth the wait. In “Ramadan Ramsey,” Edwards has written an ebullient, picaresque novel. Despite the darkness Ramadan encounters, he focuses on the few friendly people who support him. He decides at the relevant points to lean into positivity rather than negativity — and not only overcomes the adversity of his narrative, but transcends it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This lack of a distinct self is evident throughout the novel. In social settings, Mrs. March mimics the words of a former professor, passing off his ideas as her own. At restaurants, she allows her husband to order for her, intimidated by the menu. Among the few times she asserts herself is via an imaginary friend, Kiki, a double whose function seems to be to give voice to things that Mrs. March cannot. All of this is exemplified by Mrs. March’s signature mint gloves — a Christmas gift from her husband and a color she would never have dared to choose but that she prizes because she imagines others “assume her to be the kind of carefree, confident woman who would have selected such a bold color for herself.”

Behind closed doors, however, she frequently falls into bouts of self-loathing, leering at herself in the mirror as she assesses her “dented” stomach, “sagging belly” and gut “scratched with stretch marks.” It is ultimately this insecurity, this absence of self, that makes the prospect of a possible connection between her and Johanna terrifying, as it would mean everyone “would see inside her,” the “wickedest of all violations.”

Feito works hard to make sure readers know that there is something amiss in this character’s fragile mind, inviting us to question which of Mrs. March’s experiences are real and which the product of psychosis. There are phone calls from people whose voices she does not recognize, asking for Johanna. There are cockroaches in her bathroom. There is a newspaper clipping about a missing girl that Mrs. March finds hidden in her husband’s notebook and on which she begins to fixate; the girl was from the town where her husband goes hunting with his editor. And there is her growing suspicion that everyone is talking about her, about Johanna and how they are one and the same. Thoughts of Johanna consume Mrs. March to the point that, in one particularly telling scene, upon being reminded of Johanna’s character’s fictional status, she demands to know: “Then why does it feel like she exists and I don’t?”

The most compelling examples of Mrs. March’s fractured identity come when Feito breaks away from the claustrophobic Upper East Side. Determined to discover the connection between her husband and the missing girl, Mrs. March ventures on a trip to the town, where she breaks into a cabin owned by her husband’s editor and interviews people who knew the girl, insinuating herself into the girl’s home and bedroom, and eventually ending up in a strange embrace with the girl’s boyfriend. For the first time, we witness Mrs. March acting rather than being acted upon — something that is so out of character that even she is flummoxed by her decisions. This deviation from her usual pattern allows us to see her slow loss of grip on reality in a new way, without the repetitive is it real or isn’t it tactics, which makes the novel all the more intriguing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She suggested that her role may be fluid as “Jeopardy!” develops new spinoffs. “Name it and they may dream it up for me to host,” she said, lying in bed under the covers. She went out of her way to praise Burton, whom she has worked with before, and who had a large fan base pushing for him to be named host.

When Variety magazine published an article last week saying that Richards was the top candidate for the job, there were decidedly mixed reactions; some on social media expressed disappointment that an executive with influence over the succession battle would end up being the winner. (Some made comparisons to Dick Cheney, who was tasked with vetting possible running mates for George W. Bush in 2000, only to take the job himself and become vice president.)

In an email to “Jeopardy!” staff that the show released to the media earlier this week, Richards — who was the host of a reality show called “Beauty and the Geek” — wrote that he was “humbled and deeply honored” when he was asked if he would consider hosting the show.

“The choice on this is not my decision and never has been,” Richards wrote. “Alex always believed the game itself and the contestants are the most important aspects of the show.”

In his note, Richards also addressed an employment lawsuit against “The Price Is Right” when he was an executive producer, a controversy that resurfaced online when his name was floated for the host position. In 2010, one of the game show’s former models, Brandi Cochran, filed a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit against the show, CBS and others, saying that after she revealed she was pregnant, she was repeatedly taken out of acts she would have appeared in before and was denied the chance to return to work after she took maternity leave.

According to the lawsuit, after Cochran revealed on air that she had been carrying twins, Richards put his face in his hands and said to her, “Twins? Are you serious? … You’re serious?” The case went to trial and the jury sided with Cochran, awarding her about $8.5 million, but the decision was later overturned and a judge ordered a new trial. The sides ultimately settled in 2016.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The other thing — and this is external to the show — is that this was going to be the first production that had Covid protocols in place, and anticipating the movie I’m now making, I was curious to see how it works. I wondered, Could I make a movie? Was it too expensive, awkward, impossible? I was happy to see that after a while you get quite used to it. It made it very clear what would be involved and how it could work.

I’m not Canadian, but there seems to be something very Canadian about “Slasher” as a series. I just can’t put my finger on it.

We do have a reputation for a certain kind of horror film that’s uniquely Canadian. Is it the water of Lake Ontario? [Laughs.] I’m not sure. It did feel weirdly comfortable working on the show in that strange, nationalistic way, but without anybody making a big deal out of it. I think we do have our own perspective on things in the dark.

“Slasher” as a series has been very diverse, with casts and characters of assorted races and sexualities that haven’t always found homes in horror. This season, there’s a character who identifies as nonbinary and queer.

I can only say that in all of my films, including my early underground films, I’ve always had nonbinary and gay characters, so for me that’s not a new thing. It’s just a natural thing. It wasn’t coming from social pressure.

I think one reason people enjoy horror is because horror digs underneath the walls of normal society, and people have a need to feel and see and experience that, even if they can only experience it in art forms and not in their lives. It’s natural for horror films to connect with what normal society suppresses.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“This is the eternal anthropological question,” said Tang Fu Kuen, the artistic director of the Taipei festival, who is also from Singapore and works with Choy as a dramaturge. “How can an outsider enter a foreign culture and see it from fresh eyes, different perspectives?”

“He is not exploitative as people think,” Tang added. “They think, ‘Ah, he is just going around, entering different countries, taking away from the culture.’” But as Tang sees it, Choy’s work is more about honoring and learning from those he meets. “It is always tempered with his own understanding, while respectful and faithful to the voices that he encounters.”

Before the opening of “CosmicWander” at KINDL, Choy took a break from installing the show to talk about his path as an artist and where his wandering has led him. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

What first drew you to dance and working with the body?

I studied video in art school and went on to make theater performance, collaborating a lot with dancers and musicians. I got more and more drawn into dance, because I always find language a problem. Though it’s ironic because in the last 10 years of my dance work, there is a lot of talking.

But how it really started was when I went to London to study design in 2010. I removed myself from my comfort zone and everyone I was working with. At that time, I was playing with muscle sensors, and I just had myself, my laptop and some sensors. I became like a bedroom D.I.Y. scientist, electrocuting myself, trying to stimulate muscle movement.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Beanie Feldstein will star as Fanny Brice, the role that helped make Barbra Streisand a star, in a production of “Funny Girl,” which is returning to Broadway for the first time in 58 years.

The revival of the 1964 musical will be directed by Michael Mayer, who oversaw a 2015 revival of the show in London. Producers said performances would begin in the spring, but did not specify a date — though a recent Equity casting call gave April 2 as the first performance. The theater where the musical will be housed will be announced later.

“The first time I played Fanny Brice was at my third birthday party, in a head-to-toe leopard print outfit my mom made for me,” Feldstein said in a statement. “So, it’s safe to say that stepping into this iconic role, on Broadway and not in my family’s backyard, is truly my lifelong dream come true.

“I am immensely grateful to be able to do so alongside such a remarkable creative team,” she added, “and cannot wait for audiences to get back in theaters again!”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Taylor Mac’s “Joy and Pandemic,” a play set during the 1918 flu pandemic, was a bright spot on the horizon at the Magic Theater in San Francisco: a world-premiere production, to open in September for what would have been the theater’s first live audience in 18 months.

But now, in a further life-meets-art-meets-life twist, the production, which was announced in March, has been postponed indefinitely because of the Delta-variant-driven surge in Covid cases.

“Timing is everything,” Mac said in a statement. “With the rise of infections, this is not the time to engage wholeheartedly with the themes in this work. Our hope is that time will come soon.”

Mac is best known for “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music,” a marathon 24-hour performance piece that takes in all of American history through song, refracted through a radical queer lens (and involving some exuberant audience participation). “Joy and Pandemic,” to be directed by Loretta Greco, was partly inspired by some of Mac’s research for that show and had been commissioned by the Magic, a 144-seat nonprofit theater with which Mac has a long association, before the Covid-19 pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s coming season at New York City Center will celebrate Robert Battle’s 10 years as artistic director, the company announced Wednesday. After the difficulties of the past 17 months, Battle is more open to embracing the occasion than he might otherwise have been.

“Being a part of the problem solving that has taken place and kind of making our way through this has actually made me in a way own that 10 years a little bit more fully,” he said in an interview. “There’s something about going through that makes me think ‘Hey, if I’m going to go through this, then I’m going to definitely take the good and I’m going to go with it.’”

During his tenure at Ailey, Battle has founded the New Directions Choreography Lab, an initiative to support emerging and midcareer dancemakers, and named Jamar Roberts as the company’s the first resident choreographer. “When I was first starting to create, I was fortunate to have David Parsons, who gave me the floor,” Battle said. “I’ve always wanted to pay that forward.”

His support has paid dividends. Roberts has created several critically acclaimed dances, including “Members Don’t Get Weary” and “Ode,” since taking up the post in 2019. And now, to concentrate on his choreography, Roberts is retiring from dancing; his farewell performance, on Dec. 9, was announced along with the season’s slate.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“It’s a pretty long list of milestones that we need to hit to stay on track to peak on Aug. 12,” said Annemarie Roe, the president of BaAM, an event management company that designed the new facility. “The perfect field, the corn at the perfect height, the time of the game with the sun in the right direction setting down, the lighting working exactly as planned — and then bringing 8,000 people plus staff onto a site that doesn’t typically have anything but a tractor rolling through.”

Of course, the inconvenience of the location is part of the charm. Driving through miles of highway bordered by cornfields, a visitor is reminded of a similar trek to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. — much hillier and windier, yes, but the sensibility is the same.

It seemed only fitting that Josh Rawitch, who starts next month as the new president of the Hall of Fame, drove here on Wednesday with his family as part of their journey from Scottsdale, Ariz., to upstate New York.

“We planned our whole trip across the country and tied it to this game so that we could be a part of it,” said Rawitch, a former executive with the Arizona Diamondbacks.

“My daughter hasn’t seen the movie, and as we were driving, I was explaining it to her and I literally got choked up telling her about playing catch with your dad at the end. And I kind of laughed — like, I can’t believe I’m getting choked up talking about this — but something about this pilgrimage to the Field of Dreams, it connects you with previous generations. That’s what the movie intended to do. It wasn’t just Ray Kinsella and his dad, it was generations of baseball. That’s what Cooperstown does, too.”

Dwier Brown, the actor who played Ray Kinsella’s father, lost his own father a month before filming began in 1988, giving extra emotional heft to the role. When the movie was finished, Brown found himself and his co-stars weeping as they watched the screening for the cast.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In February 2020, James Patterson flew to Nashville to visit Dolly Parton.

She was a fan of his “Alex Cross” thrillers, and he had a proposal for her: Would she work with him on a novel about an aspiring country singer who goes to Nashville to seek her fortune and escape her past?

Parton loved the idea. Two days later, she sent Patterson notes on the plot — along with lyrics for seven new songs that she wrote, based on the story.

“She didn’t want to get involved in something just to put her name on it. She really wanted to be involved,” Patterson said in an interview on Wednesday. “She’s not going to do something if she doesn’t think she’s going to do it well.”

In March, Little, Brown plans to publish “Run, Rose, Run,” a collaboration between Patterson and Parton, in print, e-book and audio editions. The novel, about a young singer with a dark secret that inspires her music, draws on Parton’s experiences in country music.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The documentary “Misha and the Wolves” revisits a semi-infamous episode in Holocaust appropriation. In a 1997 book, an author named Misha Defonseca claimed that, as a child during World War II, she had trekked through the woods living with a pack of wolves.

The spoiler-averse will want to stop reading. But about a decade later, her story was exposed as a fraud. The film, directed by Sam Hobkinson and streaming on Netflix, recounts how various people — a publisher, Jane Daniel; a genealogist, Sharon Sergeant; and a Holocaust survivor, Evelyne Haendel, who tirelessly researched the case in Belgium — uncovered information about Defonseca’s real wartime experiences.

The movie also tries to illustrate the nature of deception, to the point of lying to the viewer. A person labeled by name as an ordinary talking head turns out to be a performer on a set; at a critical moment, we see her wig removed. But “Misha and the Wolves” is most absorbing when it deals with the search for truth. Haendel, who spent her own childhood during the Holocaust hiding as a Catholic, recalls how she pored over old phone books and other records.

“Misha and the Wolves” plays best on first viewing, with its surprises intact. The current documentary “Enemies of the State” deals more provocatively with verification issues in a less publicly settled case. Still, “Misha and the Wolves” shows how, in certain situations, people too polite to demand evidence can be hoodwinked. The film’s late efforts to portray Defonseca as at least some sort of victim don’t wash.

Misha and the Wolves

Rated PG-13 for lies. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. Watch on Netflix.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Early in the book, we revisit the era of medieval farmers, who, Burkeman says, didn’t even think of or experience time as “an abstract entity — as a thing.” Nature and necessity provided a rhythm for days and tasks, and they simply followed that rhythm. But then somewhere along the line (hashtag capitalism?) “time became a thing that you used,” a resource that you could feel bad about mishandling. Burkeman wants to “prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place.” (He enjoys italics.)

One of the ways to do this is to exercise a Buddhist-like detachment and acceptance. “The world is already broken,” Burkeman writes, and so is the possibility of your making the most of your time. In the face of the tyranny of choice, you can find freedom (and presumably stress relief) in understanding that “you’re guaranteed to miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer.”

He lost me a little when he wrote about time being a “network good,” something that’s best optimized among groups of people in order to “socialize, go on dates, raise children, launch businesses, build political movements, make technological advances” — but that’s only because, aside from socializing, I don’t really want to do any of those things.

No contemporary guide to time management can ignore the need to ignore our phones, and Burkeman pauses to acknowledge the attention plague. After describing his use of Twitter, he says he’s “now in recovery.” (In addition to Twitter, I’ve spent a not insignificant portion of the prime of my life playing various anagram games on my phone. You?)

In the end, some of Burkeman’s advice (“focus on one big project at a time,” “keep a ‘done list’”) seems disappointingly traditional, given how good he is at puncturing his genre’s pieties. As another example, he is withering on one page about the mindfulness mandate to “be here now.” (“It’s like trying too hard to fall asleep, and therefore failing.”) Then, near the book’s end, he counsels us to “pay more attention to every moment, however mundane.”

But part of the pleasure of reading Burkeman is that you assume he would happily point out these same reversals and contradictions. His tone is not confident or hectoring; he’s in the same leaky boat we’re in, just trying to stop things up where he can.

Despite my airport habits, there are things I want to accomplish in this life. And some of Burkeman’s modest suggestions about how to prioritize things, without simply adding stress about prioritizing things to life, seem well worth trying. And in addition to whatever help it might offer, “Four Thousand Weeks” is also just good company; it addresses large, even existential, issues with a sense of humor and an even-keeled perspective. I found that reading it — Burkeman might balk at this particular way of describing it — was a good use of my time.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Georges Bergès Gallery has sat on a chic stretch of SoHo for six years now, a relatively little-known newcomer in a New York art world that has long been dominated by name-brand power brokers like Pace Gallery and Gagosian.

This summer, however, it has unexpectedly become one of the most talked about galleries in the nation, thanks to its plans to sell works by another relative newcomer to the art world: a fledgling artist who happens to be the son of the president of the United States.

The gallery is planning to sell 15 works by Hunter Biden, and is asking as much as $500,000 apiece. The prices — which are high for a novice artist — have raised questions in Washington about whether the works might attract buyers seeking to curry favor with the Biden White House.

In response, the administration has helped to develop a set of ethics guidelines that call on the gallery to keep the identity of buyers and other details of the sales from both the artist and the administration.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Surfacing The Hidden Melodies of Subways Around the World When train doors close, these jingles warn riders to stand clear.

Montreal’s signature “doo-doo-doo” has the same intervals as the opening for Aaron Copland’s “Fanfare for the Common Man.” In Budapest, a fleeting arpeggio sounds like a cheerful “ta-da!” [Hungarian] Kérem, vigyázzanak, az ajtók záródnak.

[English] Please stand clear of the closing doors. In New York, the downward jingle sounds like a marimba. Stand clear of the closing doors, please. In London, the notes are so fast, they seem to blend together. This train is about to depart. Please mind the door. Ted Green has been collecting the sounds and sights of transit systems for more than a decade. He travels frequently for work, as a civil engineer, and in every city he visits, he rides the mass transit system and films video of the closing doors, replete with the announcements and the telltale chimes — beeps, ding-dongs, jingles and arpeggios that warn riders around the world to stand clear. “I think the appeal is the simplicity,” Green said. “You wonder, how can there be so many different variations of beeps? And then you listen, and they’re all so different.” Like many aspects of mass transit systems, door chimes may seem banal, the dull background track to daily commutes. If you listen more closely, though, you’ll notice regional patterns and distinctions.

For Green, recording videos of door closings started as a way to document his travel for himself, but he eventually compiled some videos on YouTube. He was shocked when one door-closing montage got more than two million views. He has made many more videos since; this past year, he’s noticed that there’s been a spike in viewership, perhaps because of nostalgia for train riding during global lockdowns.

“A lot of train enthusiasts are also collectors,” said Adam Rose, an audio designer who works on train simulations for Dovetail Games, and who consequently spends a good part of his day listening to transit chimes. “So looking for different transit chimes can almost be a form of collecting.”

Most chimes these days are computer generated, played automatically as part of the door-closing process. But some originally emerged from mechanical processes in older trains.

In Montreal, where the first metro trains were put in service in 1966, there was an electronic circuit called a current chopper, which worked to slow down the electronic frequency applied to the motor. It made a sound as the trains pulled out of the station: “doo-doo-doo.” “Metro cars act as a sounding board, and amplify the melody,” said Benoit Clairoux, a historian of Montreal’s transit system.

When the transit authority wanted to add a door-closing chime in 2005, they tested various sounds, though none was as popular as a chime that mimicked this mechanical sound. So executives added a synthetic “doo-doo-doo.”

“Three simple notes — ‘doo-doo-doo’ — that have become synonymous to Montreal, as much as smoked meat (sorry, New York!) and the Habs in hockey,” Clairoux wrote in an email. (The Habs refer to the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League.) “Without these three notes, Montreal and its metro would not be the same.” (Many mistake the sound for the opening notes of Fanfare for the Common Man, a piece by composer Aaron Copland, but this is a coincidence, Clairoux added.)

In Rio de Janeiro, the jingle, in a minor key, sounds like an homage to bossa nova. [Portuguese] Próxima estação: Afonso Pena. Desembarque pelo lado direito.

[English] Next stop: Afonso Pena. Disembark on the right. In Toronto, the jingle is a calming downward arpeggio. Please stand clear of doors. In contrast, Vancouver’s vibraphone-like jingle is an upward arpeggio that seems to signal an arrival. Hong Kong has announcements in Cantonese, Mandarin and English. [Cantonese] 請勿靠近車門。[Mandarin] 请不要靠近车门。

[English] Please stand back from the train doors. In Paris, a simple “A” note plays as the doors shut. This is also a throwback, a sound that mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part that is no longer in use on any of the system’s trains. “But for a half century Parisians and visitors alike became used to that sound, so we decided to keep it, and recorded a synthesized version,” said Song Phanekham, a communications manager for the Paris transit system. “It’s a tribute to the heritage of the Paris Metro.” In Tokyo, each station has its own custom jingle to signal departures. In Rio de Janeiro, the subway’s door chime pays homage to bossa nova. In Vancouver, the doors still close to a three-note sound that was recorded in the 1980s on a Yamaha DX7. (“The hallmark of any mid-80s pop song,” said Ian Fisher, manager of operations planning at British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.) Door chimes are part of a broader soundscape that can evoke something deeply specific to place and time. One Russian train enthusiast, who also collects transit videos, said that he finds station announcements and certain chimes to be reminiscent of a romantic, inaccessible past. “Being a native Russian speaker, I understand everything in St. Petersburg’s subway announcements,” he said. “When I ride through the Old Town and hear the names of the stations located there, I imagine that I’m a hero of a Dostoyevsky novel. I imagine that I’m in the 19th century, and if I get to this or that station I will see carriages, kerosene lamps and people in black suits and hats. So certain chimes can transfer me to another world, which feels amazing.” Green, the civil engineer, says he doesn’t have a favorite among the many chimes he’s recorded, from Singapore to San Diego. But he does have a least favorite, which plays on New Jersey Transit, and which he has dubbed “the Alfred Hitchcock sound.” The most iconic, he thinks, is New York’s “ding-dong,” along with the announcement: “Stand clear of the closing doors, please.”

When it comes to designing a new transit chime, there is much to consider. Length, for one, especially given what is called “dwell time,” when a train is lingering in the station. “One of the biggest things about transit is just trying to get people to step lively on and off trains as the doors are about to close,” said Max Diamond, a New York City Transit conductor. “It seems to a layperson like a door chime is innocuous, but it’s a really critical part of keeping the capacity of the subway up.”

So, Diamond said, you wouldn’t want the chime to be too long, or it might slow things down further on an already overburdened transit system. On the other hand, according to Fisher, of the British Columbia Rapid Transit Company, it can’t be too short or people might miss their window of opportunity to rush out the doors. (New York’s two-note chime lasts just a fraction of a second, on the shorter side of transit chimes.)

In Gurgaon, India, the chime is a chirpy repeated sequence. Tokyo’s jingle has a rhythmic pattern similar to that of Gurgaon. In Paris, the sustained chime mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part. In Berlin, the beeps are a steady pulse like an alarm clock. [German] Zurückbleiben. Then there’s the question of how best to get people’s attention. A relaxing melody might fail to rouse slow-walking commuters from their daydreams, as they shuffle out the door. “You cannot use too gentle a sound, because to get hit by the door is not pleasant,” Phanekham said. “A nice musical sound with a harmony might be a false promise.” But there is rider experience to think about, as people hear the chimes day in and day out, often during stressful parts of their day. Fisher said descending chimes might be more soothing than the upbeat sound of climbing notes. “If you just miss your train, hearing the ascending chimes is really aggravating,” he said. Bruce Alexander, who was the senior director for the office of strategic innovation and planning for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority before he retired, was involved in fine-tuning New York’s signature “ding-dong.” It was introduced around 1970 for safety purposes, but originally, he said, there was too long a delay between the sound of the chime and the moment when the doors closed; it contributed to accidents as more people tried to rush to the doors. The M.T.A. cut the delay time down to zero, before eventually automating the chime process altogether.

Even given all these considerations, most commuters likely won’t notice the sound as they go about their days. “It becomes, like everything else, a part of the background,” Alexander said. “No matter how strong a signal is, eventually it’s going to disappear into the general cacophony.”

But sifting through this everyday din, listening closely to the notes and beeps and arpeggios that play as doors around the world open and close, the collectors of transit chimes are doing their best to ensure that the music doesn’t completely escape notice.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the early series including “Girl Friends” and “Line Up,” both from 2014, Gutierrez created and photographed luxurious scenes with mannequins as archetypes of beauty, altering their appearance and her own to mirror each other in intimate hyper-feminine groupings. The illusions are so seamless, it’s easy to mistake what is “real” and what is artifice.

“When I was in the gallery next to my work, viewers didn’t recognize that I was the girl in the picture,” said Gutierrez, who was then using male pronouns. She said it was her first realization that she wanted to transition and be seen as a woman by the world.

Works from these series are on view through Oct. 24 in a survey show at the Blaffer Art Museum at the University of Houston titled “Martine Gutierrez: Radiant Cut.” It also includes images from her 2018 project “Indigenous Woman,” a 124-page art publication that appropriated the large format of “Interview” magazine in a provocation “dedicated to the celebration of Mayan Indian heritage, the navigation of contemporary indigeneity, and the ever-evolving self-image,” as she wrote in an editor’s note. As model, photographer, advertiser and editor in chief, she brought alive a panoply of tropes — sporting costumes from Guatemala in high-fashion spreads, spoofing beauty products in advertorials, playing roles from Latina maid to trophy wife in a psychosexual saga about the white man’s “discovery” of the Indigenous woman.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The concert industry had hoped that this summer would mark its high-decibel rebound after being shut down for more than a year by the pandemic.

It started promisingly, with restrictions being eased and fans snapping up tickets, but as the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant has accelerated in recent weeks, an ominous cancellation blotter has begun to build up.

Foo Fighters and Fall Out Boy have missed high-profile shows. Stevie Nicks and Limp Bizkit have scuttled tours. The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, planned for October, was canceled amid high infection rates in Louisiana.

The pileup of bad news, along with fearful chatter among artists and touring workers on industry back channels, has led to what many in the business describe as a confusing and even chaotic situation over whether — and how — to proceed.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@How did you prepare for this new album of the nocturnes?

I had dreamed of recording them for quite a while, but I knew that to do it well I would have to play them in concert first, to get the right emotion. They’re not technically difficult — you can approach them from an early age — but it is very difficult to make them sound good. I have been scheduling many of them in my recitals to get that experience of communicating them. The nocturnes make me feel like I’m at home at night and I have an emotion I want to express; they’re pieces I play for myself. To play them in front of people — to break that private bubble — has been the challenge.

In recordings, the complete nocturnes are usually presented in chronological order. Why did you stick with that precedent?

I’m very traditional. I’m the type of person who likes sending out postcards written in fountain pen, who uses a landline phone with a rotary dial. I am also traditional in how I listen to and present music. After I recorded the nocturnes, I did think about the order. They were not written to be played together — they are very individual pieces — but the slight adjustments I could have made to improve the flow of the recording were not worth compromising the tradition.

Why did you choose to record in the Meistersaal, an early-20th-century Berlin concert hall?

We chose it because it was very practical during Covid. We could have it to ourselves; there was nobody in the office; there were no distractions. And it isn’t too cavernous, so I didn’t have the feeling I was playing for an empty hall. Also, there is natural light, which I really appreciate. And we could easily adjust the electric lights if I wanted a different ambience. In the end, it was just a very inspirational space.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A woman who accused the rapper Nicki Minaj’s husband, Kenneth Petty, of sexual assault during high school filed a lawsuit on Friday against the couple, alleging that they harassed and intimidated her while trying to convince her to recant her account.

The case dates back to 1994, when Jennifer Hough, then 16, reported to the police that Mr. Petty — a 16-year-old she had known growing up in Jamaica, Queens — had raped her after leading her into a home at knife point, the lawsuit says. Mr. Petty was arrested that day and was charged with first-degree rape, and subsequently pleaded guilty to attempted rape, said Kim Livingston, a spokeswoman with the Queens district attorney’s office. He served about four and a half years in prison, according to inmate records.

According to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Ms. Hough, 43, and her family members started to receive communications from people claiming to be connected with Ms. Minaj and Mr. Petty shortly after Mr. Petty was arrested last year for failing to register as a sex offender in California. The lawsuit alleges harassment and witness intimidation, as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress by Ms. Minaj and Mr. Petty, and seeks unspecified damages. It also alleges sexual assault and battery against Mr. Petty, referring to the mid-90s case.

A representative for Ms. Minaj did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Petty, Michael Goldstein, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The wrestlers who perform in companies like the Duffy Wrestling League often resemble starving artists, honing their craft for little money as they wait for a big break to catapult them to national prominence.

“They’re creative people who want to make it work,” the showrunner Mike O’Malley said of the “Heels” characters. “All of the people who make it in show business and professional sports, they had to start somewhere. And were they met with disappointment or encouragement? That’s what the story is about.”

But “Heels” is particularly devoted to exploring the emotional and conceptual nuances of a lifestyle that, for those who participate, resembles a secret society. Characters openly explain terms like “kayfabe,” the performer’s commitment to insisting that the action and melodramas are strictly “real,” and the best way to hit someone with your elbow without actually hurting them.

In an era where most wrestling fans over the age of 12 understand that the winners are predetermined and the story lines scripted, modern wrestlers must consistently invent new ways to capture the audience’s attention. “We know that they know, and they know that we know that they know,” Jack Spade says of the fans, while proposing one particularly complicated story to his business partner. “Heels” digs into how the lines between truth and fiction can be blurred so convincingly that even the performers can’t tell what’s authentic — good entertainment for us, and a big headache for the people who, if they’re not careful, can easily forget they’re playing a character.

A particularly meaningful endorsement came from the wrestler Phil Brooks, who performed professionally as CM Punk and who guest stars as a veteran of the independent wrestling scene.

“He turned to us and said, ‘This is how it is,’” Ludwig said. “‘You guys are making exactly the show I want to see.’”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TELL IT TRUE

By Tim Lockette

Geographically, Lisa Rives lives on a lake in a small Alabama town. Emotionally, she lives in that unsettling landscape of teenagers who have realized the world is a messed-up place. Lisa’s parents fight a lot and she suspects her dad is having an affair with a co-worker. Her former-beauty-queen mom spouts harmful stereotypes, for example suggesting that Lisa and her father have autism since they clearly have “something wrong” with them. Oh and that lake, around which her town of Beachside was built? It’s “fake.”

The real story begins when Lisa’s friend Preethy begs her to take over as school newspaper editor after Preethy’s friend Jamie resigns to run for student body president. Lisa is reluctant. She’s always been curious about people and current events, but only because she knows the world is dangerous and doesn’t want to be caught off guard. She ends up at the paper’s helm anyway and finds herself assigned to cover the same election that got her the job.

Faced with the task of interviewing candidates, she tells her cool new journalism teacher that one of the would-be presidents, Nolan Ramsey, makes her uncomfortable by constantly talking about how he wants to have sex with her. The teacher responds: “So what? He’s always joking about how he’d like to have sex with me too.” The sexual harassment goes largely unaddressed. Preethy even suggests that Lisa could have had “a pretty OK boyfriend” if she’d agreed to date the candidate instead of writing about him.

Lisa goes ahead with the interviews, asking questions about each candidate’s politics, a topic that historically had been off limits, and inadvertently tips the scale in favor of her harasser. As the power and responsibility of her role begin to sink in, Lisa sets her sights on covering the execution of a local man who’s been sentenced to death. Soon she’s the story, as other media outlets report on her unusual request.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Season 2, Episode 4, ‘Carol of the Bells’

Houston? We have a Christmas Episode.

Here I’ve been, trying to convey the relatively subtle ways in which the second season of “Ted Lasso” differs from the first. And then, four episodes in, they give away the whole game. It’s not merely that they’ve produced a Christmas episode — albeit one airing in August — it’s that it’s an episode that, back in the day, would have been billed as a “Very Special Christmas Episode”: absurdly uplifting — even for “Ted Lasso”!—seasonally sweet, devoid of tension or discord, et cetera.

This was the unfair knock on the first season of “Ted Lasso”: That it was too much about just making viewers feel good (as if that were a bad thing), and was unwilling to plumb deeper — which it actually did, mostly without making a big deal about it.

Our newest episode, by contrast, is not merely a holiday episode, but a meta-holiday episode: an episode about holiday movies, and about one movie very much in particular. There are red herrings scattered about — you’ve got to love the “Christmas Story” leg lamp that Keeley unveils early on and the fractional glimpses of “It’s a Wonderful Life.” But this episode is aiming at a much more specific target.

Rebecca’s invitation to a Christmas party at Elton John’s may be the first obvious clue. Why, her Yuletide plans sound almost as awesome as those of a certain over-age rocker circa 2003.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Last year, the Salzburg Festival dialed back centenary celebrations to pay tribute to its Jewish artists who were expelled or murdered by the Nazi regime.

During a small ceremony, 28 “stolpersteine,” or golden “stumbling stones,” commemorating those artists were laid on Max Reinhardt Platz, a square named for the German theater impresario and a founder of the festival who died in exile in New York in 1943.

“Everyman’s Jews: 100 Years Salzburg Festival,” an exhibit on view at the Jewish Museum Vienna until Nov. 21, shines a spotlight on many of those whose names now glisten on the square. They include singers, musicians, directors, conductors and actors who contributed to the success and international renown of the Salzburg Festival in its first two decades.

Curated by Marcus G. Patka and Sabine Fellner, “Everyman’s Jews” features objects from Mr. Reinhardt’s estate, exhibited for the first time, along with costumes, props and set designs from many of the festival’s early productions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pat Hitchcock looks at the troubling scene unfolding before her in her father’s 1951 thriller, “Strangers on a Train”: Bruno Antony — a psychopath who has strangled the estranged wife of a man, Guy Haines, he has just met and believes would in turn kill his father — is demonstrating his murderous technique on a society matron at a party.

“You don’t mind if I borrow your neck for a moment, do you?” asks the oleaginous Bruno, played by Robert Walker. He places his hands on her neck and starts to throttle her.

Miss Hitchcock, playing the sister of the woman Guy wants to marry, is seen in a blurry background shot, her expression curious. But it quickly turns to horror as she watches the matron struggle for breath; she sees that Bruno is staring at her, probably because she is wearing glasses like those the murdered woman had worn.

She finally freezes in shock after some other partygoers pry Bruno’s hands from the woman’s neck, and he collapses.

The Real History of the Mexican Drug Trade

By Benjamin T. Smith

It was a defining moment for the reluctant trinity of North American nations. Poor Mexico — described by the dictator Porfirio Díaz as “so far from God” — was drawing closer to the United States, Canada and the historic free trade deal that its Harvard-educated president was negotiating.

Then, on a Monday afternoon in late spring, 1993, a Mexican cardinal, dressed in clerical robes, a large crucifix hanging from a chain around his neck, was shot 14 times as he got out of his white Grand Marquis at the entrance to the Guadalajara airport. Mexican investigators concluded that the prelate, Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, had been caught in a shootout between drug lords, including one named Joaquín Guzmán.

Just two weeks earlier, I had moved to Mexico to work as a foreign correspondent for this newspaper; my principal assignment: covering the upcoming North American Free Trade Agreement and reporting on Mexico’s acceptance into the club of developed nations. The brazen attack lasted only minutes, but it abruptly ended the glowing bonhomie that Mexico had enjoyed until then. Besides introducing “El Chapo” Guzmán to the world, the killing made all of us aware of the terrifying power of the cartels.

The initial investigation into the cardinal’s murder was deeply flawed, and the notion of an unlucky crossfire or mistaken identity gave way to sinister theories involving Mexican officials. It’s unlikely the truth will ever be known, but the nexus between drug traffickers and the government has been laid out convincingly in many journalistic and academic works.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Si los retazos están demasiado triturados, los investigadores a veces los reconstruyen virtualmente con una máquina llamada ePuzzler. Pero el volumen de archivos rotos es tan grande que el ePuzzler no es capaz de acelerar el proyecto de forma significativa.

Los equipos colocan los trozos que pueden reconstruirse a mano sobre una mesa y utilizan cinta de archivo para volver a armar cada documento. A partir de ahí, los papeles completados pasan a los archivos de la Stasi. No hay difusión asociada a ellos, y no se notifica a nadie mencionado en los archivos; la filosofía del grupo es que la decisión de indagar o no en su archivo debe ser de la víctima.

Los datos sobre los informantes y agentes de la Stasi son otra historia: no se consideran privados, por lo que los periodistas e investigadores pueden solicitar el acceso a ellos. En los años 90, revelar que alguien había sido informante arruinó tantas carreras y matrimonios que la revista alemana Der Spiegel, que regularmente sacaba a la luz la colaboración de personas destacadas gracias a los registros, los apodó los “archivos del horror”.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shane appears to escape all accountability and just walk away from the death he caused. On the other hand, Kai (Kekoa Kekumano) will likely be severely punished for stealing the Mossbachers’ jewelry.

I think that’s intentional. In this “White Lotus”-reality, here’s how one class of person is treated by the criminal justice system and here’s how someone with access, money and privilege is treated. Yes, you would normally be told, “Don’t leave the island,” or “Don’t leave the state.” But Shane’s dad probably called in a favor — a senator? a judge? That’s how at times a certain level of this world operates. Kai will be a felon, but Shane will not have to serve any time — and Shane will still paint himself as a victim, because he might become a social pariah. He might not be invited to summer parties in the Hamptons because of this.

How replicable do you think the show’s concept is as it continues as an anthology series? How many oblivious rich people can we take?

If Mike White didn’t have more to offer at this same level, he would go do something else. But you could do something more like “Upstairs, Downstairs,” with the second season being more about the service end of things.

People have been talking about how the show is about entitlement, but Mike says it’s more about how money corrupts the dynamics of every relationship, whether it’s a business relationship, a friendship or a marriage. Tanya [Jennifer Coolidge] unfairly dangles this hope to Belinda [Natasha Rothwell] of having her own spa, and it’s messed up how quickly she snatches that hope away. But you also see how Belinda changes in the face of this opportunity. Nobody’s free from it, except maybe Quinn [Fred Hechinger] and the guys in the outrigger canoe, because none of them are making money from the ocean. There is a certain equality in that relationship.

The story also seems to be about complicity. When Rachel joins Shane at the airport, she is essentially accepting his objectionable qualities in exchange for the benefits he provides. But since she spent the night in another hotel room, do you think she knew that Shane killed Armond?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The ongoing challenges of Covid-19 compelled the company to keep performances to 90 minutes or less, with no intermissions. That meant making considerable trims to staples like Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” and Mozart’s “The Magic Flute.” For some devotees this might seem sacrilegious. But during earlier golden eras of opera works were routinely cut. I found the experience fascinating, and rich with potential for drawing in new audiences. Zambello said in an interview that with the informal outdoor setting and intermission-less programs, the festival attracted many people attending for the first time. The crowds have averaged about 700 per performance, she said. The audiences I saw — beginning on Thursday morning with “Il Trovatore” — were eager, despite some steamy weather.

The core of the “Trovatore” story might seem the ill-fated love between Leonora, a lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Aragon, and Manrico, the troubadour of the title, an officer in the forces of a rival prince at time of civil war. But the opera is driven by Azucena, supposedly the mother of Manrico, who is consumed with fulfilling her mother’s dying command to “Avenge me,” after the woman was accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake.

Zambello, who directed the production with Eric Sean Fogel, decided to make Azucena the focus. This adaptation, set in contemporary times, opened with Part 2 of Verdi’s work, which the composer subtitled “The Gypsy.” Here, Azucena (Raehann Bryce-Davis, a mezzo-soprano with a burnished voice and dramatic fervor) sang the character’s gloomy, haunting aria, when she recalls her mother’s dying words, while looking at a steel container emitting smoke from burning refuse. Then, we were taken back to the actual start of the work, the scene with Ferrando (Peter Morgan) and his band of soldiers, here presented as scrappy militia forces of the count.

In an opera with a plot as convoluted as this one, it was hard to complain that the reordering of scenes made a hash of the story. Dramatically, the reframing certainly gave a central place to the obsessed Azucena. The bright-voiced veteran tenor Gregory Kunde was a volatile Manrico; the soprano Latonia Moore, the Leonora of this production, was ill on Thursday and replaced by Alexandria Shiner, who displayed a gleaming, powerful voice. The young baritone Michael Mayes was a compelling Count di Luna. Joseph Colaneri conducted a sure-paced account of the abbreviated score.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BERLIN — “I’m not asking for an opera here,” the notorious criminal Macheath says at his wedding, early in a work that happens to be called “Die Dreigroschenoper” (“The Threepenny Opera”).

And in Barrie Kosky’s hauntingly enjoyable new production of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s famous “play with music” for the Berliner Ensemble — at the theater where it premiered in 1928 — Macheath then reaches into the orchestra pit in search of nuptial entertainment and steals the “Threepenny” score from the conductor’s stand. He flips through the pages while humming the show’s big hit, “Mack the Knife,” tears them up and throws the scraps into a metal bucket. Then he lights them on fire.

The line “I’m not asking for an opera here” dates back to the ’20s, but Weill and Brecht never wrote what follows — nor did their essential collaborator Elisabeth Hauptmann, who with this production is finally getting proper billing alongside them after decades of neglect. Yet this kind of ironic gesture toward the art form wouldn’t be out of character for them; coming from Kosky, it’s a subtle tribute, and a blazing declaration of independence.

It’s a moment, along with many others in Kosky’s production that epitomizes the adage of knowing rules in order to break them.
