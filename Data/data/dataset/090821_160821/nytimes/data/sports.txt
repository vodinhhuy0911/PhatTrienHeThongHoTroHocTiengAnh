Members of The New York Times staff at the Tokyo Olympics reflected on moments that will stay with them from a Games undercut by the pandemic but filled with emotional twists.

When the Olympics happened at BMX

When a great athlete earned an event victory, the culmination of years of practice, dedication and sacrifice, there was some polite applause from a few scattered volunteers, or maybe a shout from a coach. Not the roar of a packed stadium excited by the spectacle they had witnessed.

But at the BMX cycling, one man tried to overcome that. Kye Whyte of Britain had just won a silver medal, and he paused to watch the women’s event. His teammate, Bethany Shriever, had two years before turned to crowdfunding after her state financing was cut. Now, as Shriever surged ahead of the other competitors, Whyte became a one-man cheer squad, shouting his approval and punching the air as she raced to the line. When she won, he lifted her in a bear hug, as joyful about her gold as his own silver.

“Bethany Shriever is absolutely the flipping best,” he said afterward.

The Olympics, with their masks, coronavirus protocols and oceans of empty seats, lacked some of their familiar joy. Whyte managed to bring it back, at least for a moment.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anderson’s wife suggested that the ski coach focus on finding 314 people who would each contribute $1,000 and, better yet, pledge to do it again a year later.

“It kind of sounded crazy at first, but it kind of put into perspective: I realized there’s got to be 314 people who will sign on and do this,” Anderson said. “As soon as it was business hours on the East Coast, I started making phone calls.”

He argued to one prospective donor after the next that collegiate skiing was an Olympic pipeline. He told them that he worried universities would see a school in Alaska, of all places, cutting skiing and decide they could also do without. For months, assistants largely ran the program while Anderson focused on fund-raising and sought to protect his athletes from the worries that sometimes seemed overwhelming.

The hockey coach was more hands-off, largely deferring to Bethard and an energized band of supporters who wrote a business plan, negotiated a memorandum of understanding with the university and built a website. A $2 contribution arrived; so did one for $100,000. Corporations with vast presences in the state sent money, as did individuals like N.H.L. owners and a man who works for a plumbing and heating company. Business titans called their colleagues. About $100,000 came in one day in July, in part because of a golf tournament.

“We’ve always had to do grass roots type of stuff, but never to this degree before, and it was never mapped out,” Bethard said. “Everybody has to have a goal, everybody has to have something to shoot for. If you can give us that goal, we’re going to get there.”

A similar sentiment enveloped the gymnastics program. The women began writing to club gyms across the country in search of support and doing handstands on social media to spur donations. There was a silent auction and a leotard sale. Some gymnasts even sold their hair.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After Durant left the Thunder in 2016, Westbrook became the focal point, and the Thunder were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round for three straight years.

A large part of the issue with Westbrook is that he has been an inefficient scorer for much of his career. His career true shooting percentage — which accounts for free throws and 3-pointers — is 52.8 percent, whereas the league average is around 55 percent. And he takes up a lot of possessions to score his points as a result.

His defense has also been suspect.

This is where his joining James and Davis makes for a fascinating, and potentially treacherous, situation. Two of the players the Lakers traded for Westbrook — Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope — were helpful defensively and with floor spacing. That meant they didn’t need the ball in their hands to make their presence felt on the floor. Kuzma shot 36.1 percent from 3 last season, while Caldwell-Pope was at 41 percent. Westbrook’s career average from 3 is 30.5 percent. A data point helpful to Westbrook: Kuzma shot only 31.6 percent from 3 in the Lakers’ championship year.

The fit with Westbrook, James and Davis will be a mad experiment. Westbrook needs the ball in his hands to be effective, while James usually runs his team’s offense. James’s best teams have been loaded with shooters to toss the ball to when he drives into the paint. Davis is one of the most offensively skilled big men but, like Westbrook, inconsistent from 3, at 31.2 percent for his career. Even James is a career 34.5 percent shooter from deep — around average.

This means the Lakers will presumably start three players who aren’t the most reliable shooters in today’s N.B.A., which is so dependent on efficient offense generated by spacing. The Lakers have some counters with their other additions: Kent Bazemore, Anthony and Wayne Ellington — all of whom shot better than 40 percent from 3 last season.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@All hell broke loose when center Larry Sanders broke his thumb, getting into a fistfight in a nightclub, throwing a champagne bottle, adding to the perception of the Bucks as completely dysfunctional. It was humiliating for Sanders, who had just signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension.

Injuries mounted. D.J. Stephens, a reserve guard, remembered someone saying on the bench: “There’s $60 million just sitting there at the end of the bench. Can’t even play because they’re hurt.” He had to laugh — things were so bad.

It didn’t help that it was the year of the Arctic polar vortex, the coldest on record in two decades in Milwaukee. The temperature dropped below zero 24 times, and the windchill was characterized as “life-threatening,” with values as low as 60 degrees below zero. Experts warned of potential frostbite to anyone who stepped outside with uncovered skin.

The cold was a big adjustment for Antetokounmpo. He didn’t own warm clothes at first. He had only the Bucks sweatsuits, which he wore every day. Forward Ersan Ilyasova gave him a pair of jeans, as did guard O.J. Mayo and forward Caron Butler. But he would wear just a light down jacket or sweatshirt and sweats on those frigid Milwaukee days. Sometimes Antetokounmpo would hold on to the arm of Ross Geiger, an assistant video coordinator, when walking because he was shivering, wearing Nike slides with socks rather than snow boots.

One night, as they were leaving the Cheesecake Factory near 11 p.m., a heavy snow was falling, the beginning of a blizzard. Inches and inches of snow had already piled up outside as Antetokounmpo and Geiger headed to the car. The windshield wipers furiously whipped back and forth, but the snow pelted down so hard Geiger couldn’t see. At all.

Geiger pulled over. “Don’t pull over,” Antetokounmpo said. “We keep going.” Antetokounmpo, still buckled into his seat, took his right arm, towel in hand, and lunged forward and stretched his massive wingspan all the way over to Geiger’s side, serving as a human windshield wiper, cleaning each side every 30 seconds. Geiger could see enough to make it home.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BEIJING — Guards in biohazard suits, ready to stop anyone from leaving. Athletes giving interviews from behind plastic walls, speaking through microphones. All-day armpit thermometers, with tiny transmitters to sound the alarm should someone develop a fever.

With the Winter Olympics in Beijing just six months away, the Chinese authorities are detailing some of the elaborate precautions they plan to take against Covid-19. The measures are expected to go far beyond those taken at the Tokyo Games, which ended Sunday with more than 400 infections reported.

China has made clear that containing the virus is its top priority. On July 30, as case numbers were climbing in Tokyo, Beijing organizers announced plans to redesign their 39 Olympic venues. Workers are now dividing passageways lengthwise and installing new toilets and other facilities.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PHILADELPHIA — We still don’t know the meaning of the missives. When Steven Cohen visits his stumbling Mets in the road clubhouse on a Sunday morning — and tweets about it — is that an act of support, or a sign of panic? When he tweets on Friday that the Mets will start hitting, but instead they look feeble all weekend, will there be repercussions?

In his first season as the Mets’ owner, Cohen has gotten precisely what he paid for with his $2.475 billion: a team that can whip your emotions from hopeful to confounded, often at a breakneck pace. After a punchless weekend against the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, the Mets have tumbled to third place in the National League East.

Philadelphia completed a three-game sweep on Sunday with a 3-0 victory spearheaded by the former Mets starter Zack Wheeler, who spun a two-hit shutout with 11 strikeouts and only one walk. The Mets began August with a four-game division lead, but now stand two and a half games behind the first-place Phillies and a half-game behind Atlanta.

“This is a special group,” Mets Manager Luis Rojas said. “We’re not going to stop saying that, ever, as much of a struggle as we run into. I think we’re doing really good; we’re pitching, we’re playing defense. The one thing that we’re missing right now is our offense.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TOKYO — The kaleidoscopic stands of Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium — a disordered mosaic of white and green and reddish-brown seats — were designed to evoke the sun-dappled floor of a Japanese forest.

Over the past three weeks, though, they have had another, useful effect: Squint your eyes, blur them just so, and it almost appears as if spectators are arrayed around the sweeping structure, as if the 68,000-seat stadium is not essentially empty, as if these are a normal Olympic Games.

Of course, they were not. On Sunday night in Tokyo, a stripped-down closing ceremony in Japan’s sprawling national stadium will bring these extraordinary Games to an end, concluding an Olympics that, in some sense, felt like an illusion — at times convincing and fully welcome, at others jarringly off-key.

Pushing forth in a pandemic, these Games were meant to be, as the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said last year, “the light at the end of this dark tunnel the whole world is going through.” Yet they were often claustrophobic, cut off from society, with capacious venues across Tokyo repurposed into cloistered safe houses.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After investigating reports that a fan had yelled a racial slur during a game at Coors Field in Denver on Sunday, the Colorado Rockies determined the fan was actually yelling for the team mascot, Dinger, the team said in a statement on Monday.

The incident happened in the ninth inning of Sunday’s game against the Miami Marlins, with Miami outfielder Lewis Brinson, who is Black, at the plate. The yelling man’s words were picked up by television microphones, and many people thought he had used a racial slur.

A Marlins television broadcaster made a statement on his Twitter account after the game, saying he was disgusted by the language. The Rockies echoed that sentiment, and said they would investigate the matter. Tony Clark, the head of the players’ union, also issued a statement Sunday night deploring the incident as he thought it had occurred.

But other camera angles surfaced on Monday showing a man appearing to gesture toward Dinger, a purple dinosaur mascot, who appeared to be nearby in the stands. It is unclear how close the man was to the microphone, and whether Brinson heard him. Brinson never appeared to react.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SAITAMA, Japan — The members of the U.S. women’s basketball team lined up on the court at Saitama Super Arena, stepped onto the highest podium and raised their hands above their heads.

The scene, in some ways, was novel and unfamiliar. Thick white masks obscured the lower halves of the players’ faces. The seats in the stands behind them were empty. But in other ways, it was exactly what the basketball world has seen from the American women’s team for more than two decades.

The United States dominated on the court in the final of the Olympic tournament, beating Japan, 90-75, to claim the team’s seventh consecutive gold medal. The Americans’ talent was unmatched throughout a Games in which they did not lose. And in the middle of the team picture afterward were the smiling faces of two veteran guards, Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, who won their first gold medal before some of their current teammates had started kindergarten.

Aug. 8, 2021, 9:22 a.m. ET Aug. 8, 2021, 9:22 a.m. ET The cauldron goes out, and the ceremony — like the Games — ends with an empty feeling. The Olympic flame was extinguished at the end of the closing ceremony. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times TOKYO — A most unusual Olympics ended with a fitting closing ceremony: the usual speeches, performances, parades and tributes played in front of tens of thousands of empty seats. For the past two-plus weeks, the athletes performed, often at the top of their games, and records and hearts were broken. And on television around the world, it may not have looked so unusual. But on the ground there was an undeniable feeling of absence. An absence of cheering fans in the seats, an absence of parents embracing their medal-winning children, an absence of the buzz that takes over Olympic cities, which makes taxi drivers, hotel clerks and other residents want to eagerly talk handball or table tennis with each other or a visitor from another country. Save the masks on the participants, the closing ceremony mostly avoided the coronavirus pandemic. I.O.C. President Thomas Bach did laud the athletes for providing “hope” during dark times. But for the most part, the familiar elements played out as if nothing was different. Flags were raised and lowered, anthems were sung, speeches were made and the flame was doused with everyone playing their parts as if nothing were wrong, with the Olympic movement or the world. The entertainment included the familiar — dancers and jugglers. It included the representative — drumming on a huge taiko. And it had the unexpected — a ska band. For pandemic-related reasons many segments that might normally have involved scores of costumed cavorters in the stadium were shown on video. When the Olympic cauldron was extinguished, the organizers quickly moved to a highlight reel for the Paralympics, which begin on Aug. 24, and some fireworks. As usual, there was a segment devoted to the next Olympics host. But this year, the video peek at Paris 2024 offered not only a sense of excitement about the next Games on the horizon. It also speculated that maybe, just maybe, there will soon be a Games that will be about running and jumping rather than testing and quarantining.

James Hill for The New York Times In the run-up to and throughout the Games, organizers repeatedly touted the Games as “safe and secure,” and described athletes and others within the Olympic bubble as the “most tested community almost anywhere in the world.” Thomas Bach echoed that sentiment at the closing ceremony, making reference to the coronavirus pandemic and saying that the athletes gave people hope. All told, 436 people related to the Olympics — nearly two-thirds of whom were residents of Japan — tested positive for the virus since early July. According to the Tokyo organizing committee, only three of the Olympics-related patients ended up in the hospital, and none of them needed intensive care and have already been released. But since the Games opened on July 23, daily cases outside the bubble in Tokyo have more than tripled. The number of people requiring ventilators has started to tax the city’s medical system. Some experts have said that by hosting the Games, the organizers tacitly gave the general public the impression that things were normalizing and that it was acceptable to go out and engage in behaviors that might have led to the increase in infections, particularly as the vaccine rollout in Japan has been much slower than in other affluent nations.

Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times From taiko drumming and Harajuku street fashion to J-pop hits and Ainu dance, the closing ceremony incorporated Japanese cultural touchstones that were almost entirely missing from the opening ceremony. In some ways, this celebration of Japan, on the final day of the Olympics, also marked what was lacking from these Games: the intersection of whimsy and solemnity that makes Tokyo so special. Japan has a knack of taking traditions from outside and making them its own, whether it’s baseball or baked goods. Add to that ancient customs that thrived on an island chain that kept itself secluded for centuries. Athletes and other members of Olympic squads were kept from Tokyo for fear of infecting a city grappling with record coronavirus cases. Fair enough. At least with the closing ceremony, they got a hint, “chotto,” as we say in Japanese, of Tokyo’s magic. Read more

Aug. 8, 2021, 8:57 a.m. ET Aug. 8, 2021, 8:57 a.m. ET A moment of remembrance has a key omission. The moment of remembrance was commemorated by a dancer and a taiko drummer. Credit... James Hill for The New York Times The moment of remembrance in the closing ceremony was commemorated by a dancer and a taiko drummer rather than the more conventional moment of silence. During the opening ceremony, Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, specifically honored athletes who had died in previous Olympics, including the Israeli athletes killed during a terrorist attack at the Munich Games in 1972. A pointed omission in the closing moment was any mention of the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, whose 76th anniversaries passed this week without any mention by the Olympic organizers. Civic leaders and survivors had appealed to Bach to observe a moment of silence on Aug. 6, the date of the U.S. dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. But the I.O.C. declined to do so, saying that it would not single out any particular country but would offer a moment of silence during the closing ceremony to cover all past tragedies. Survivors were particularly galled by this decision given that Bach had visited Hiroshima before the Games. “At the Olympic Games, a festival for peace, there should be no objection for everybody involved to have a silent prayer for the many lives lost by the atomic bomb and the victims of war,” said Toshiyuki Mamiki, acting chairman of the Japan Confederation of Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Sufferers Organization. “President Bach took the trouble to visit the atomic bombed area of Hiroshima and saw the museum, to realize the disastrous consequences of nuclear weapons. As someone who has seen Hiroshima, I believe the least that can be done is to in some shape or form, acknowledge to the world what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.” Read more

James Hill for The New York Times Every closing ceremony also looks ahead, to the next Games in four, or in this case three years. After a healthy dose of Japanese music and dance, Paris was given the floor for 10 minutes or so. Because bringing a host of performers from Paris to Tokyo would have been a daunting prospect, the presentation relied almost entirely on film — an unusual move for the closing ceremony. First came videos with the familiar romantic sights and rooftops of the city that have helped sell it as a site for honeymoons, school trips and major sporting events for generations. France has never been afraid to use the Eiffel Tower for marketing purposes, and the show ended with a segment from the famed monument with a cheering crowd — packed uncomfortably close, perhaps — on the Champs de Mars. And a jet flyover and break dancing, which will debut as a sport at the Paris Games.

Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times At every Olympics, thousands of volunteers serve as the glue that hold the Games together, driving official vehicles, fetching water, carrying Olympic medals. This time in Tokyo, they were also among the most visible and plentiful presence in the venues that were shorn of spectators. Their tasks were myriad: wiping perspiration from table tennis tables, fetching soccer balls kicked over the goal into empty stadium seats, sweeping the gym floor during basketball games. Sumika Yoneda, 22, who was responsible for leading press photographers into the so-called moat of the National Stadium for athletics events, was shocked by how fast the photographers would run to get a picture when an athlete fell on the track. “It was so surprising to me at first, thinking about the athletes’ feelings,” said Yoneda, who was on duty at the closing ceremony. “That’s not the first thing I would do, but I guess that’s the job of a photographer.” Journalists in general seemed to surprise the sensibilities of the volunteers. Journalists “are very strong minded,” said Rachel Leng, 31. They “are very creative with trying to sneak into the media seats even if they don’t have the proper ticket — they’ll try to hide their badges, or some will come in once and then leave and give their credential to a colleague that doesn’t have the right to be in the space and try to pass it off as themselves, it’s been a mess!” Read more

As the medalists for the men’s and women’s marathons are honored, it’s worth noting that several countries scored their first medals at these Games. The Philippines won its first gold medal, courtesy of Hidilyn Diaz in women’s weight lifting. San Marino won not only its first but also its second medal, entering the history books as the smallest country to score a podium finish. Bermuda struck gold in the women’s triathlon, making it the smallest nation to win gold in the Summer Games. Burkina Faso won its first medal, bronze in men’s triple jump. Turkmenistan also gained its first medal, silver in women’s weight lifting. “It’s unbelievable,” Diaz, the Philippine lifter, said after her surprise triumph in the 55 kilogram weight lifting division. “I never thought this would happen today.” Read more
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It helped, she said, that she had “complete confidence” in her teammates, a collection of luminaries, present and future. Felix acknowledged that the race — specifically, the 3 minutes and 16.85 seconds that it took the American team to circle the track four times — felt like a generational passing of the torch.

Sydney McLaughlin, who turned 22 on Saturday, and Dalilah Muhammad, 31, joined forces after going head-to-head this week in the final of the 400-meter hurdles, a classic race in which McLaughlin edged Muhammad at the line to break her own world record. Athing Mu, a 19-year-old phenomenon from New Jersey, had won the 800 meters with a dominant performance days before.

And there was Felix, of course, who reiterated that these would be her final Olympics. She first competed at the Athens Games in 2004, when she won the silver in the 200 meters as a fresh-faced prodigy. Only later in her career would she become an icon who transcended the sport.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@While most of the Yankees’ positive tests have been so-called breakthrough cases in which a person tests positive despite being fully vaccinated, Rizzo’s vaccination status was unclear. In June, as a member of the Chicago Cubs, he told reporters he was not yet vaccinated, saying he was “taking some more time to see the data” in what he described as a “difficult decision.”

Other teams have dealt with coronavirus outbreaks this season, including the Washington Nationals, who at one point briefly lost nearly half of their active roster, but the Yankees have been hit particularly hard, with a long list of positives that includes stars like Gerrit Cole, Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez and now Rizzo.

“You’ve got to roll,” Boone said of the team’s long list of positives. He also said he would not get into the vaccination status of any of his players going forward other than to say that a large percentage of the team is vaccinated.

Luke Voit, who led the majors in home runs last season but has struggled this season after knee surgery, came off the injured list on Sunday and started in Rizzo’s place during the Yankees’ 2-0 loss to the Seattle Mariners at Yankee Stadium, which snapped their five-game winning streak. Voit was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts in his return to action.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There she reconnected with an old friend, Jason Strauss, who was opening an outpost of Tao, a popular New York club, and hired her as the director of V.I.P. operations. Ms. Uchitel displayed an immediate zest for the job: taking the high-wattage contacts accumulating in her phone to New York, Miami, Los Angeles, the Hamptons; connecting clubs with the elite clientele who oxygenate nightlife.

“To me, the word ‘hostess’ does not describe what she did,” said Ron Berkowitz, the president of Berk Communications, who represented the Tao Group at the time. “She was the liaison between the club and big money. People trusted her and people called her to get into these clubs. She was the queen of it. She was the best. She had the Rolodex, she knew how to negotiate. And she also was very sweet. But then she got caught up in something that was not good for her business.”

Ms. Uchitel and Mr. Woods met in 2008 through a mutual friend, Derek Jeter, and began their relationship a year later. “I knew him to be cheating on his wife from the first time I met him, well before we got together,” she said. But Ms. Uchitel believed she had special status. Mr. Woods would fly her around the world to tournaments and events, and, she said, told her he would invest in a restaurant she dreamed of opening.

As tabloids began looking into rumors of Mr. Woods’s infidelities, Ms. Uchitel was in frequent communication with his handlers, even helping with crisis management. But the representatives stopped returning her calls after their star client’s car collision with a fire hydrant near his home in Windermere, Fla., following a dispute on Thanksgiving night with Elin Nordegren, then his wife.

As paparazzi swarmed outside Ms. Uchitel’s apartment in Chelsea, she realized she needed a lawyer of her own. She contacted three she had seen on “Nancy Grace,” a favorite show, including Ms. Allred, who called her the next morning and told her to get on a plane to Los Angeles.

The Colorado Rockies are investigating whether a man in the stands at Coors Field in Denver on Sunday repeatedly and loudly yelled a racial slur at Miami Marlins outfielder Lewis Brinson, who is Black.

The Rockies said in a statement that they were disgusted by the incident. The offender was not identified before the game ended, the Rockies said, but the team is investigating the incident.

“The Rockies have zero tolerance for any form of racism or discrimination, and any fan using derogatory language of any kind will be ejected and banned from Coors Field,” said the statement, which was posted on the team’s website.

The incident happened during the top of the ninth inning, and the loud, brazen yells were picked up by microphones behind home plate and clearly heard on the Marlins’ television broadcast.

Caeleb Dressel set two world records in the swimming pool: one in the 4x100-meter relay as part of the U.S. team and another in the individual 100-meter butterfly race. And the weight lifter Lasha Talakhadze of Georgia set three world records, in both lifts and his total.

World records in track cycling were broken multiple times during these Olympics. In men’s team pursuit, a world record fell during the first round, and again during the finals. In the women’s team pursuit, the world record was broken three times in the same day, first in qualifying rounds, and twice in the first round of competition.

China is departing these Olympics with 88 medals and five new world records across swimming, cycling, shooting and weight lifting events.

Here’s a look at all of the world records set during the Tokyo Games.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TOKYO — As the athletes finished marching into the stadium for the closing ceremony of the 32nd Summer Olympics on Sunday night, the announcer asked for a big round of applause. But there simply weren’t enough people in the stands to make much noise. And the flashiest component of the ceremony, a formation of the five Olympic rings by tiny points of light, was invisible live in the stadium. The magic of its special effects played only on large screens and to television audiences.

And so one of the strangest Olympics in recent memory ended much as they began, with reduced cohorts of athletes waving to cameras and volunteer dancers rather than spectators, and rows of empty seats serving as reminders of a pandemic that could not be brought to heel by messaging about the healing power of the Games.

Yet perhaps more than any recent Olympics, the tournament was an athletic reality show, inviting viewers to seek respite from the frustration and tragedy of the past 18 months. The drama of competition and bouts of rousing sportsmanship offered diversion from the daily counts of coronavirus cases — the ones within the Olympic bubble and the vastly larger numbers outside of it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On Saturday morning in Sapporo, about 500 miles north of Tokyo, Molly Seidel of the United States ran her third marathon.

It just so happened to be the Olympic marathon. And she just so happened to win the bronze medal, only the third time an American woman has reached the podium in the Olympic race.

By Sunday night in Tokyo, she was being honored on an international stage as the medals were awarded at the Olympics’ closing ceremony.

It has long been tradition to award medals at the closing ceremony to the top finishers of the men’s marathon, one of the last events of any Summer Olympics. But the medalists in the women’s marathon were also honored at the ceremony this year.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@How may different ways can the Olympic rings be displayed? Let’s see, you could do it with flame, luminescent shapes, costumed performers, fireworks … yeah those have all been done. With the Games coming every two years (uh, usually), original ideas must be hard to come up with.

The choice this time is forming the rings with tiny points of light. Except, the effect is only visible on TV screens. It’s completely special effects magic. In the stadium, athletes and onlookers see nothing. Hard to imagine the organizers trying that at a normal Olympics with paying spectators in the stands.

But based on the closing ceremonies of the recent past, we can still safely predict some of what we’ll see starting at 8 p.m. Tokyo time on Sunday night (7 a.m. Eastern). There will be music, speeches, anthems and more.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Setting aside all the is-it-a-sport-or-not arguments, rhythmic gymnastics (the one with the ribbons) delivered some drama with an unexpected finale.

And an unsettled loser afterward.

The gold medal favorite, Dina Averina of Russia, completed a routine as convoluted as the reason Russia is competing as R.O.C. (for Russian Olympic Committee) at the Olympics instead of its plain old name.

She’s the three-time world overall champion, and to make matters even more interesting, her identical twin sister Arina was in the running, too.

But Linoy Ashram of Israel, and her hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon, would not back down and finished with the highest score (even after dropping the ribbon).
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The club has spent vastly and poorly in recent years, of course. It has squandered the legacy that Messi had done so much to construct. But it has done so in a context in which it was asked and expected to compete with clubs backed not just by oligarchs and billionaires but by whole nation states, their ambitions unchecked and their spending unrestricted.

The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the onset of calamity, and so Barcelona was no longer in a position where it could keep even a player who wanted to stay. When it came time for him to leave, he found a landscape in which only a handful of clubs — nine at most — could offer the prospect of allowing him to compete for another Champions League trophy. They had long since left everybody else behind, relegated them to second-class status.

And of those, only three could even come close to taking on a salary as deservedly gargantuan as his. He should not be begrudged a desire to be paid his worth. He is the finest exponent of his art in history. It would be churlish to demand that he should do it on the cheap, as though it is his duty to entertain us. It could only have been Chelsea or Manchester City or Paris.

To some — and not just those who hold P.S.G. close to their hearts — that will be an appetizing prospect: a chance to see Messi not just reunited with Neymar, but aligned for the first time with Kylian Mbappé, who many assume will eventually take his crown as the best, and with his old enemy Sergio Ramos, too.

That it will be captivating is not in doubt. And doubtless profitable: The jerseys will fly off the shelves; the sponsorships will roll in; the TV ratings will rise, too, perhaps lifting all of French soccer with it. It may well be successful, on the field; it will doubtless be good to watch. But that is no measure. So, too, is the sinking of a ship.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the hottest commodities in the minor leagues right now isn’t a fireballing pitcher or a phenom slugger. Instead, a garbage-can-flying raccoon astronaut named Sprocket has captivated baseball’s lower levels.

Sprocket is the mascot for the Rocket City Trash Pandas, the Class AA affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. And since the fall of 2018, when the team name and Sprocket were unveiled, he has helped the club in Madison, Ala., pull in more than $4 million in merchandise sales.

Even in a sport with climbing merchandise sales, the Trash Pandas’ revenue is a staggering sum for a single team. That the total was largely achieved before the team played a regular-season game makes it almost dumbfounding. (It is noteworthy that the numbers were released at all considering the tight lips of most minor league clubs.)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Athletes with disabilities are only able to compete at this level when they have access to the necessary supports and accommodations that they need to be successful,” Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, wrote in a letter to the committee. “They should not be forced to navigate the Tokyo Olympics without the support that they need, particularly in the midst of a global pandemic.” The governor and the two U.S. senators from Maryland, the home state of the champion swimmer Becca Meyers, echoed Hassan’s concerns.

The issue is not new, but it gained new attention last month when Meyers, a three-time Paralympic gold medalist who is deaf and blind, removed herself from the United States Paralympic swimming roster because her mother, Maria, would not be allowed to accompany her in Tokyo. Maria Meyers has regularly traveled with the U.S. team to assist her daughter since Becca, 26, had a harrowing experience at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Meyers’s withdrawal on July 20, first reported by The Washington Post, was not a dramatic last-ditch attempt to win approval for her mother to travel to Tokyo. By then, Meyers said, she had accepted that she wouldn’t have the support she needed to swim in Tokyo and add to her collection of six Paralympic medals from London and Rio. Now she was pursuing a broader goal: raising awareness about the complications that elite athletes with disabilities routinely face and pressing for better accommodations for their needs.

“I’m speaking up to spark a conversation so that we can effect change and protect future generations,” Meyers said in an interview. “No one should ever feel afraid on Team U.S.A.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@But a player reportedly earning about $132 million a year in salary and bonuses could not move just anywhere.

He may be 34, but Messi’s performance levels appear to be undimmed by age. Just this summer, he was honored as the player of the tournament, the top scorer and the assists leader as he led Argentina to the Copa América championship, its first national team title in almost three decades.

P.S.G. will add him to an attack that includes the two most expensive signings in soccer history: Kylian Mbappé, the jet-heeled French star, and Neymar, the Brazilian who was once Messi’s teammate at Barcelona.

With Messi in its star-studded ranks — and even if Mbappé is sold, possibly to Real Madrid, to recoup some of the cost — P.S.G. will once again take aim at the Champions League, the biggest prize in club soccer but a tournament that, despite P.S.G.’s billions of dollars in spending over the past decade, it has failed to win. Messi won the competition four times with Barcelona.

Unlike Barcelona, though, P.S.G. is still trying to write its history. And it is doing that by spending money. A lot of money.

It spent more than $400 million to acquire Mbappé and Neymar and then surrounded them with even more high-priced talent lured from rivals around Europe. Messi, for example, is joining a team that this summer added the Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, the Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum and the Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos.

It is unclear just how P.S.G. will justify the addition of those salaries, and Messi’s, under European soccer’s cost-control rules. But like Manchester City, which broke the British transfer record this summer by signing Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish for 100 million pounds ($139 million), the club appears to be free of domestic or regional rules on spending.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@My name is Henry Hsiao. I go to school at West Windsor- Plainsboro High School North in New Jersey and I’m in 11th grade currently. Hi, my name is Lizzie Phelps. I went to Poolesville High School and I’m currently a first year at Wellesley College. When I wrote this review, I was a senior in high school. How did you find out about this contest and why did you decide to participate? I found out about this contest through my English teacher. In fact, the previous school year, we were entered in, I believe, the editorial contest. The next year on my own initiative, I searched for a different contest I could participate in. And in this case, I thought reviewing something would be fun. I found out about the contest through my high school journalism class. We had an assignment to write a review of something. And we read some of the previous year’s reviews. And my journalism teacher just really pushed for us to do it. It an assignment and then it was an extra five homework points to submit it to the contest. What was your reaction to hearing that you were a finalist? I was so excited. I wasn’t expecting much. You know, I was like, OK, awesome to see what happens. And actually, I didn’t know I was a finalist, and my friend texted me, and was like, oh, my god, congratulations. I was like, what? What are you talking about? I don’t know what this is. So then I checked my email and I was just so excited. It’s gratifying, and really encouraging, especially when you’re recognized for writing like this, because it really encourages you to keep on writing. Do you have any advice you’d like to give to other young writers who might be applying to this contest in the future? Pick something that you have strong feelings about, because like I was saying earlier, that’s really what propelled me to keep going and to make sure this review was as good as I thought it could possibly be, was that I didn’t want to let Lizzo down. No topic necessarily is the wrong topic. And I would argue that your point of view perhaps may be something extremely unique. If you have a unique story to tell, then by all means, go out and tell it and share it with others.

Questions About Writing

What is a personal narrative?

For this contest, we’re defining a personal narrative as a short, powerful, true story about a specific experience, event or incident from your real life.

Because you’re telling a story about a particular moment rather than, say, summarizing your whole life or reflecting on your feelings about a topic, there should be a clear narrative arc — a beginning, middle and end — that is driven by a conflict of some kind that is eventually resolved or spurs an attempt at an ongoing life change.

Keep in mind, however, that any story can work. It doesn’t have to be the most dramatic thing that ever happened to you; it can, instead, be about baking brownies with your brother, or a conversation you had on Tuesday’s bus ride to school. It’s all in how you tell it.

And a good personal narrative not only tells a story but supplies a reason for telling it, so that readers come away with a sense of some larger meaning or a universal message they can relate to. The best essays often do this subtly and leave room for the reader’s own interpretation.

How can I make my essay stand out?

We are primarily looking for good storytelling, as explained above. But we’re also looking for writing that is vivid and engrossing. A few tips:

Hook your readers right from the start by dropping them into the scene.

Write from your own point of view in your real voice. We want to see your personality come through on the page.

Follow the adage “show, don’t tell.” For example, don’t simply say: “my brother was angry.” Instead, describe his clenched fists or flared nostrils. Such imagery elicits a more powerful response because readers can imagine the scenes you describe, and feel what the narrator is feeling. But be careful to avoid overly ornate or complicated wording that could detract from your story.

Try to avoid sweeping conclusions, clichés and platitudes (like “it’s always darkest before the dawn”). A strong story will clue us onto its themes without having to state them overtly.

I have no idea what to write about. Where should I start?

Everyone has a story to tell. Read essays from the Times’s personal narrative columns (linked below) or look at winning essays from 2019 and 2020.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“While the N.C.A.A. process found violations that occurred between 2011 and 2016, we can confidently say Baylor is a much different university today than it was three, five and certainly 10 years ago,” the officials, President Linda A. Livingstone, and the athletic director, Mack B. Rhoades IV, wrote.

The allegations around Baylor’s football program, which have led to some criminal cases and convictions, were shocking in their scope and violence when they surged into the national consciousness in 2015 and 2016. University regents said years ago that at least 19 players had been accused of sexual misconduct since 2011, a figure that some people have suggested was an undercount, and investigators found that Baylor officials had tried to shield players from scrutiny by the university or law enforcement.

The crisis ultimately led to the resignations or firings of the university’s president, Ken Starr, who had been the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton; its football coach, Art Briles; and the athletic director, Ian McCaw.

Although the N.C.A.A. committee wrote that Briles had “failed to meet even the most basic expectations of how a person should react to the kind of conduct at issue in this case,” a lawyer for the coach said Wednesday that Briles had been “exonerated and cleared of all N.C.A.A. violations.” The lawyer, Scott Tompsett, added that Wednesday’s decision “clears the way for Mr. Briles to return to coaching college football.”

In a text message, McCaw said that it was “tragic that Baylor’s decades-long, campus-wide sexual assault scandal arose due to systemic failings.” Starr, who told the N.C.A.A. committee that Baylor’s shortcomings had amounted to “a colossal operational failure,” said Wednesday that he found the panel’s final report “very thorough.” He declined additional comment.

In addition to the scrutiny by the N.C.A.A., Baylor, whose campus is in Waco, Texas, has faced a criminal inquiry and a wave of civil litigation related to the sexual assaults. Baylor prevailed in one of those cases in June, when a jury in Houston determined that, under a state law, the university was not responsible for the sexual assault of a woman in 2017.

But Baylor has been penalized in other ways. In October, for instance, the U.S. Department of Education fined the university more than $461,000 in connection with violations of a federal law that governs campus crime statistics. The university has also reached settlements with some women who brought claims under Title IX, the federal law that effectively prohibits sexual harassment and assault in educational settings.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“It’s a pretty long list of milestones that we need to hit to stay on track to peak on Aug. 12,” said Annemarie Roe, the president of BaAM, an event management company that designed the new facility. “The perfect field, the corn at the perfect height, the time of the game with the sun in the right direction setting down, the lighting working exactly as planned — and then bringing 8,000 people plus staff onto a site that doesn’t typically have anything but a tractor rolling through.”

Of course, the inconvenience of the location is part of the charm. Driving through miles of highway bordered by cornfields, a visitor is reminded of a similar trek to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. — much hillier and windier, yes, but the sensibility is the same.

It seemed only fitting that Josh Rawitch, who starts next month as the new president of the Hall of Fame, drove here on Wednesday with his family as part of their journey from Scottsdale, Ariz., to upstate New York.

“We planned our whole trip across the country and tied it to this game so that we could be a part of it,” said Rawitch, a former executive with the Arizona Diamondbacks.

“My daughter hasn’t seen the movie, and as we were driving, I was explaining it to her and I literally got choked up telling her about playing catch with your dad at the end. And I kind of laughed — like, I can’t believe I’m getting choked up talking about this — but something about this pilgrimage to the Field of Dreams, it connects you with previous generations. That’s what the movie intended to do. It wasn’t just Ray Kinsella and his dad, it was generations of baseball. That’s what Cooperstown does, too.”

Dwier Brown, the actor who played Ray Kinsella’s father, lost his own father a month before filming began in 1988, giving extra emotional heft to the role. When the movie was finished, Brown found himself and his co-stars weeping as they watched the screening for the cast.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two high school basketball coaches in Georgia have been charged with murder in connection with the death of a teenager who collapsed after running drills during a practice held in nearly 100-degree heat and later died.

On Wednesday morning, days before the second anniversary of the death of the teenager, 16-year-old Imani Bell, lawyers for the Bell family announced the charges in a news conference in Atlanta.

“This is very big,” said Justin Miller, a lawyer representing the family in a related lawsuit. According to Mr. Miller, who is also Imani’s cousin, the murder charges are the first ever brought against coaches accused of negligence.

Eric Bell, Imani’s father, called the charges a “bittersweet” development. “It doesn’t get any easier,” he said of his daughter’s death.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Olivia Moultrie, a teenage soccer phenom from Portland, Ore., received a scholarship offer from North Carolina at age 11 but instead turned pro, signing an endorsement contract with Nike at 13. In July, at 15, she became the youngest player ever in the National Women’s Soccer League after a successful antitrust challenge to the league’s minimum age requirement of 18.

“I have no problem with this impatience,” said Anson Dorrance, who has coached North Carolina to 22 N.C.A.A. women’s soccer titles. “I support these kids who want to use their name, image and likeness to generate income. Who are we to prevent them from doing it? They are monetizing their passion.”

The United States is one of the few countries where youth athletics are mostly organized by schools instead of sports clubs. Some administrators, coaches and officials have expressed concerns that star athletes like Ewers and Williams could be riding the crest of a wave that might swamp the customs and norms of school-sponsored sports.

Joe Martin, the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association, said that several problems could develop if some players had endorsement contracts: Tension and jealousy in the locker room that undermine team spirit and cohesiveness. Escalated abuse of transfer rules as powerhouse high schools recruit players on the promise that they can better build their brands with enhanced visibility. Awkward situations where some high school players make more money than their coaches.

“The Ewers kid at Southlake is making more than the whole coaching staff, period; think about that,” Martin said. “That’s something we’ve never had to address before as coaches.”

Still, high school football and basketball at the top levels have long become big business. Even the idea of a school team has undergone a radical metamorphosis in some cases. Williams plans to play basketball this season for newly-formed Vertical Academy, based in Charlotte, N.C., and founded by his father. It will play a national schedule and plans to be sponsored by a shoe company. Vertical Academy is an independent team, not a school; Williams will take classes online or in person at a Christian school he previously attended, Mahlon Williams, his father, told The Charlotte Observer.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@DYERSVILLE, Iowa — Their movie never felt like a surefire hit, not exactly. But what the caretakers of “Field of Dreams” have always had is a sense of duty, as if they were stewards of something precious. Kevin Costner felt that way when filming it here 33 years ago, and he felt it again before the live sequel, of sorts, on Thursday night.

“It’s nuanced, and it’s with love, you can see it,” Costner said. “I think ‘Field of Dreams,’ all the way through, from the movie to this moment, has had the benefit of people who are very careful.”

Yet for all the planning, all the cinematic flourishes Major League Baseball applied in staging an actual game at a new diamond carved from the same cornfields, reality could have intruded. A storm, a blowout, an injury.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@All these years on, it is hard to identify the exact straw that broke the camel’s back. Perhaps it was the night when Carlos Tévez, in the thick of a Champions League game against Bayern Munich, seemed to refuse to come on as a substitute. Maybe it was the evening Mario Balotelli spent setting off fireworks in, and setting fire to, his own bathroom.

Ideally, really, as a way of illustrating the mounting absurdity of it all, it would be what became known as the Birthday Cake Incident: the time that Manchester City either did or did not buy Yaya Touré a birthday cake, but most definitely did not buy him a Bugatti, a decision that prompted Touré’s agent at the time to declare that one of the club’s greatest ever players wanted to leave.

Most likely, of course, the last straw was all of them and none of them. It was their weight, taken together, the apparently endless stream of minor problems blown out of proportion, that persuaded City — at some indistinct point, six or seven years ago — that buying the biggest and the brightest stars was more trouble than it was worth. That the club would, instead, take a different tack.

Where that led was cast, most clearly, when Pep Guardiola’s team encountered, and overcame, Paris St.-Germain in last season’s Champions League semifinals. City and P.S.G. are often presented as two sides of the same coin, the twin vanguard of soccer’s new order: both soaringly ambitious, both unimaginably wealthy, both bankrolled by private individuals who are definitely not acting with the backing of Gulf states.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The wrestlers who perform in companies like the Duffy Wrestling League often resemble starving artists, honing their craft for little money as they wait for a big break to catapult them to national prominence.

“They’re creative people who want to make it work,” the showrunner Mike O’Malley said of the “Heels” characters. “All of the people who make it in show business and professional sports, they had to start somewhere. And were they met with disappointment or encouragement? That’s what the story is about.”

But “Heels” is particularly devoted to exploring the emotional and conceptual nuances of a lifestyle that, for those who participate, resembles a secret society. Characters openly explain terms like “kayfabe,” the performer’s commitment to insisting that the action and melodramas are strictly “real,” and the best way to hit someone with your elbow without actually hurting them.

In an era where most wrestling fans over the age of 12 understand that the winners are predetermined and the story lines scripted, modern wrestlers must consistently invent new ways to capture the audience’s attention. “We know that they know, and they know that we know that they know,” Jack Spade says of the fans, while proposing one particularly complicated story to his business partner. “Heels” digs into how the lines between truth and fiction can be blurred so convincingly that even the performers can’t tell what’s authentic — good entertainment for us, and a big headache for the people who, if they’re not careful, can easily forget they’re playing a character.

A particularly meaningful endorsement came from the wrestler Phil Brooks, who performed professionally as CM Punk and who guest stars as a veteran of the independent wrestling scene.

“He turned to us and said, ‘This is how it is,’” Ludwig said. “‘You guys are making exactly the show I want to see.’”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nico Ali Walsh didn’t default to boxing, even though his grandfather, Muhammad Ali, was a three-time heavyweight champion and one of the best fighters in history.

And Ali Walsh, 21, says none of his relatives pushed him to box professionally, even though people on both sides of his family have deep connections to the sport. An aunt, Laila Ali, went 24-0 as a pro from 1998 to 2007. An uncle, Mike Joyce, manages fighters and runs the Celtic Boxing Club in Chicago.

Instead, Ali Walsh, who grew up in Las Vegas, said he came to love the sport for himself and to handle the family baggage that comes with it. On Saturday night in Tulsa, Okla., he is scheduled to make his pro debut, televised by ESPN. He acknowledges that his connection to Muhammad Ali generates the buzz that landed his first pro fight on an ESPN card. But he also fights to find the balance between honoring his grandfather’s name and establishing his own.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There will be no U.S. Open for Roger Federer this year, and after his announcement on Sunday that he will have yet another knee operation, it is time to question whether he will play tennis on tour again.

For now, Federer, one of the greatest athletes of this or any era, does not intend to retire, but after turning 40 last Sunday and after two operations on his right knee in 2020, he is well aware that the odds are heavily against him.

He is an optimist, no doubt, long inclined to see the water bottle as half full. He has been successfully fending off retirement (and retirement questions) for more than a decade, but even he looked and sounded glum on Sunday as he described his situation in a post on Instagram, a medium that did not exist when he began playing Grand Slam tournaments in the late 1990s.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In the early days of baseball, the sport was mostly a test of hitting, fielding and base running. The pitcher was merely the fielder in the middle of the diamond who tossed the ball underhand — as if pitching a horseshoe — to home plate.

In 1884 the National League finally allowed overhand pitching, from a 6-foot-by-6-foot square 50 feet from the plate. That was the season Charles Radbourn, nicknamed Old Hoss, worked 678⅔ innings and pitched 73 complete games. It was also, for many decades, the last season with eight no-hitters.

Now we have another. On Saturday night in Arizona, the Diamondbacks’ Tyler Gilbert twirled a no-hitter in a 7-0 win against the San Diego Padres in his first career start. The pitcher he beat, Joe Musgrove, threw the first of this season’s eight no-hitters, in April against the Texas Rangers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In terms of pressure, I don’t focus much on that. These jobs, they’re stressful, and there’s enough things to deal with without putting an additional stress or pressure on yourself. I just try to be myself. I guess, in terms of the idea of diversity. I think that, by and large, if you have people from different backgrounds and, probably even just as importantly, different experiences in different ways of thinking, I think it enhances the league. It’s good because then you see different — and sometimes better and more creative — solutions to solving different problems, and in the general manager’s case, it’s putting together a team.

Many people say the way to bring more diverse candidates is to give them more exposure and opportunities. How have you seen that play out in your career?

I do think it’s exposure to different decision makers. I feel very fortunate that I had a number of my bosses throughout my career, whether it was [former General Manager] Ryan Grigson in Indianapolis that gave me exposure to the ownership group in Indianapolis or [Eagles General Manager] Howie Roseman in Philly who gave me exposure to the ownership group there. Or [former Browns General Manager] Sashi Brown, who really gave me exposure to the Haslam family here during my first go-round. I think having people, whether it’s in the league office or within your current club, that are willing to be mentors for your career and allow people who do or will make those hiring decisions gain familiarity with candidates, both on a personal and professional level — I think that can only enhance the process.

You haven’t dealt with vaccine headlines like other teams have. What did you do to get players to either get comfortable to be vaccinated or to not be outspoken about their disapproval of it?

I guess it’s really two things. I think No. 1, we did our best to educate not just our players, but everyone across the organization, in terms of the health and safety benefits of getting vaccinated, as well as the benefits that the league offers for vaccinated individuals versus nonvaccinated individuals. I think the second thing is, we also didn’t want it to be an issue that would divide our team. The spring and training camp, that’s supposed to be a unifying experience as a team, and as much as we realized that whether or not to get the vaccine can be politicized where people can have strong opinions on those sides, that’s not something that we wanted to tear our group apart. But we really did our best to try and educate as well as possible. And we started very, very, very early in the spring.
