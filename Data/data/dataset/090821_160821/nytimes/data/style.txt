There she reconnected with an old friend, Jason Strauss, who was opening an outpost of Tao, a popular New York club, and hired her as the director of V.I.P. operations. Ms. Uchitel displayed an immediate zest for the job: taking the high-wattage contacts accumulating in her phone to New York, Miami, Los Angeles, the Hamptons; connecting clubs with the elite clientele who oxygenate nightlife.

“To me, the word ‘hostess’ does not describe what she did,” said Ron Berkowitz, the president of Berk Communications, who represented the Tao Group at the time. “She was the liaison between the club and big money. People trusted her and people called her to get into these clubs. She was the queen of it. She was the best. She had the Rolodex, she knew how to negotiate. And she also was very sweet. But then she got caught up in something that was not good for her business.”

Ms. Uchitel and Mr. Woods met in 2008 through a mutual friend, Derek Jeter, and began their relationship a year later. “I knew him to be cheating on his wife from the first time I met him, well before we got together,” she said. But Ms. Uchitel believed she had special status. Mr. Woods would fly her around the world to tournaments and events, and, she said, told her he would invest in a restaurant she dreamed of opening.

As tabloids began looking into rumors of Mr. Woods’s infidelities, Ms. Uchitel was in frequent communication with his handlers, even helping with crisis management. But the representatives stopped returning her calls after their star client’s car collision with a fire hydrant near his home in Windermere, Fla., following a dispute on Thanksgiving night with Elin Nordegren, then his wife.

As paparazzi swarmed outside Ms. Uchitel’s apartment in Chelsea, she realized she needed a lawyer of her own. She contacted three she had seen on “Nancy Grace,” a favorite show, including Ms. Allred, who called her the next morning and told her to get on a plane to Los Angeles.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Donald Trump was president, the world should have been Cindy Adams’s oyster.

Forgive me for this reference, but she seemed destined to be the Ben Bradlee to Mr. Trump’s J.F.K.

The White House had come onto her turf. The chief executive was her old pal. Mr. Trump was the first tabloid president, a creature of the New York gossip columns. That was the litter box in which he sharpened his claws and perfected his media sorcery.

Ms. Adams, who attended all three of Mr. Trump’s weddings and covered both of his divorces as if they were Watergate, seemed the best positioned to get scoops out of the new president.

She stood next to him at Trump Tower on election night in 2016. He reminded her of what the notorious lawyer Roy Cohn had told her back in the 1970s: “One day this kid is going to own New York.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When he returned, he was empty-handed. “He was like, ‘Oh, I completely forgot you were here,’” she said. He had an explanation for his behavior: “I was drunk, the way you sometimes are in your early 20s,” he said.

But the next day, he pieced together that making conversation with Ms. Muszynski felt so easy that he might not have needed the predate lubrication. That afternoon, he texted her.

“I said, ‘Hey, I’m going to go food shopping later,’” he said. “‘I want to try and start eating healthy. Do you want to come with me?’” It wasn’t Ms. Muszynski’s background in health care he thought might interest her in a spin around the organic section at Wegmans. “It was just an excuse to see her,” he said.

Ms. Muszynski liked the novelty of the suggestion. She also liked that he hadn’t waited longer than 24 hours to ask her out again. “I never had a guy pursue me where he wanted to see me the next day,” she said. “It made me feel like, wow, he must have had a good time. I wasn’t expecting that.”

At the store, he took the lead, unfolding what would become for Ms. Muszynski a culinary awakening. Thai and Indian ingredients were new to her. He was a Food Network devotee committed to educating himself about the flavors of the world. “His family is like my family — they love their chicken fingers and French fries,” she said. “We both grew up eating simple stuff.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Although the summer opened with promises, or threats — depending on your perspective — of a “hot girl summer” and a “hot vax summer,” the surge of the highly contagious Delta variant may have, at least for now, dashed hopes of a hedonistic few months. But there’s another group whose plans weren’t so contingent on the virus disappearing: those who have embarked on a “healing girl summer.”

Helena Honey Selassie, a content creator based in Los Angeles, was an early adopter of the phrase on TikTok. Over the last year and a half, Ms. Selassie had recovered from a binge eating disorder “and became an overall healthier version of myself.” When she posted a video of herself jogging, “someone commented ‘OK hot girl summer’ and it didn’t really resonate with me,” she said. “I felt like my summer needed self-care, learning to love myself and unlearning behaviors that were causing me stress and anxiety. I said ‘no, it’s a healing girl summer’ and it kind of stuck.”

Ms. Selassie, 30, went on to create a healing girl summer series, where she shares the negative thoughts, which she says are the result of a former relationship that was physically and verbally abusive, that come up in her new relationship. She says the series has resonated with so many people that she went from 50,000 to 240,000 followers on TikTok from that content alone.

“‘Hot girl summer’ is about feeling confident in who you are and looking good while doing it. ‘Healing girl summer’ is all about learning to love yourself and eventually love someone else even after you’ve been hurt,” she said. “I’m dedicating the entire summer to healing myself.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Henry Connelly, the communications director for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, can relate to the cinematic tale of a farmer discovering his “Field of Dreams” in an Iowa cornfield.

The girl of his dreams, Samantha Warren, was born and raised in the thick of an Illinois cornfield. Their love story, though, was set in Washington.

“He inspires me,” said Ms. Warren, the chief of staff for Representative Bill Foster, Democrat of Illinois. “Henry’s successful but modest, and is so generous with his time and his talents where both me and his friends are concerned. And he comes from the most wonderful family.”

After graduating from Yale in 2009, Mr. Connelly, 34, was hired as an organizer on a campaign for the 2011 special election for a Los Angeles-area congressional seat, which was won by Janice Hahn. She then hired Mr. Connelly to work in her Washington office.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Jordan Culbreath, an accomplished running back for the Princeton Tigers, entered his senior year at Princeton University in 2009, he began to realize that something was wrong in his body. He had headaches. He felt numbness in his limbs. He “couldn’t even walk up a set of stairs without getting tired,” he said. He got knocked down on the field and couldn’t get up.

Mr. Culbreath was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare condition where the body stops producing enough blood cells. He had to leave school. Doctors tried to find him a bone marrow donor, but to no avail. It began to look likely that Mr. Culbreath wouldn’t be able to get lifesaving treatment. Running out of options, Mr. Culbreath enrolled in a clinical trial for an immunosuppressive therapy. It was a long shot. But after about six months, Mr. Culbreath’s body began producing blood cells again. The following academic year, he returned to Princeton to finish his studies.

Salone Loney, who was also a student at Princeton, knew Mr. Culbreath. They had met as freshman, and their social circles overlapped. They considered each other friends. But they weren’t so close that Ms. Culbreath was aware of the scope of Mr. Culbreath’s illness — even after Mr. Culbreath disappeared from campus.

Ms. Loney said she “had heard through the grapevine that Jordan got sick.” But she didn’t know just how sick, she said, or “how debilitating and scary his situation actually was.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Our clients come from so many cultural backgrounds — Taiwanese, Polish, Nigerian-American, Black American,” she said. “They can’t all use the same caterer.”

Consumer Demand

Industry professionals may commiserate about the gate-keeping of vendor lists, but they said that confronting venues about their lack of transparency often feels futile and carries a risk. “We can’t create bad blood,” Ms. Austin-Davis said. “This is our livelihood. This is why a lot of people of color don’t make a big deal out of it.”

Of venues, she said: “They have access to what we need, and they can stop us from working.”

The New York Times reached out to more than 80 venues across the country with questions about their vendor lists: how often they’re updated, how many vendors they include, how those vendors are chosen, and whether the vendors have to pay any fees. Six venues responded. The lists these six venues keep have as few as eight vendors and as many as 67. One venue updates its list annually. Others said they review them monthly or when they work with someone they like. Two said their lists are public.

Ellie Tumlinson is the director of catering at one of these venues, the Alida Hotel in Savannah, Ga. Ms. Tumlinson said she currently has a list of 67 vendors, which is available on the hotel’s website, and updates it whenever she works with someone she thinks is a good fit.

If she adds a contractor to her list, she said it means that “you’re good at what you do and I feel comfortable suggesting you for couples for the biggest day of their lives.”

Cera Stan has owned the Stan Mansion in Chicago for 15 years; she does not charge her “dream team” of vendors a fee to be on her suggested list because she thinks the cost will be transferred on to her clients. But she understands why some venues do. “We spend a lot of money on advertising, and that’s probably something to offset their costs,” Ms. Stan said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Even if you’re not usually an anxious person, it’s common to feel worry, doubt and even fear in times of uncertainty. However, excessive worrying can often drive a wedge between you and your loved ones.

Nicole Comforto, the writer of this week’s Modern Love essay, noticed that her husband’s bouts of panic became more frequent after their first child was born. Soon, her husband’s chronic worrying about keeping their family safe intensified. Although Ms. Comforto recognized that her husband’s fears stemmed from a deep desire to protect them, she started to wonder if they would eventually have to live separate lives.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The actress Naomi Watts has been wearing several hats since the pandemic hit. She is a founder of Onda Beauty, an indie retail store with branches in TriBeCa and Sag Harbor, N.Y. She has also been filming, including a couple of movies that will be out this year: the thriller “Lakewood” and “Infinite Storm,” a tale of survival.

A mother of two living in Manhattan, Ms. Watts, 52, has, like the rest of us, been living through the ups and downs of this strange time. Find out the beauty rituals and regimens that keep her centered and how something as simple as a mani-pedi can be so restorative.

Discovering Skin Care

I’ve always had sensitive skin. Working on set, with multiple applications of makeup and under hot lights, I became really, really reactive to everything. My friend Larissa Thomson, who was a lifestyle and fashion editor at various publications, and Sarah Bryden-Brown had joined together to found Onda Beauty. Larissa had been telling me about products and brands she was interested in, and I had tried stuff out of her makeup bag. They instantly smelled right and felt right on. My skin said: “Yes.”

As Onda was kicking off, I got more involved. First, I was an ambassador and influencer, and later I got more interested in the business side of things. The pandemic was so tough on small businesses. We just closed our Notting Hill store. We had opened it right before the pandemic hit. We just couldn’t handle the third shutdown. Our TriBeCa store was closed for six months. All things considered, though, we’ve managed to stay afloat.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kathryn Gongaware, a 32-year-old yoga teacher and comedian in Chicago, was always curious about Botox, but it wasn’t until she started mentioning it to friends and realized that people she wouldn’t have expected (including her au-natural-everything acupuncturist) were getting it that she felt comfortable making the jump at age 30.

“The more people were open about it, the more it felt destigmatized,” she said.

This forthrightness has been particularly transformative among women of color, who are often left out of conversations and marketing about cosmetic procedures. There’s also a deeply rooted stigma in many communities of color that by opting for cosmetic procedures that have inclined toward European beauty ideals, you’re rejecting your roots, said Dr. Onyeka Obioha, a dermatologist in Los Angeles who has been getting Botox since she was 25.

“Historically, and even today, the majority of advertisements for cosmetic procedures do not feature or target minorities,” Dr. Obioha said. “But now with social media, there’s more attention given to the fact that women of color also get cosmetic procedures, so the stigma surrounding them seems to be decreasing.”

While online sharing has helped reduce the stigma, it has brought with it some downside, too — namely, young people thinking they need to start Botox because their friends are doing it.

“I’ve had 20-year-olds in college come in without knowing anything about Botox who really don’t need it, but they have this sense of FOMO because their friends are doing it,” said Dr. Sheila Farhang, a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon in Arizona, who doles out skin-care tips to thousands of followers on Instagram and YouTube. “I will not inject someone that age, and I try to explain to them why they really don’t need it.”

The Difference in ‘Baby Botox’

A shift in how Botox is administered has also helped convince younger people to try it. “When Botox first came out, people were using it to really isolate and freeze the muscles, so that frozen look was what people associated it with,” Dr. Schaffer said. At the time, doctors were using 20 to 30 units in one area or muscle alone, a dosing that has lowered significantly in the last 10 years.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“I immediately took it off, and my skin was more red and irritated than ever before,” Ms. Puig said. After reviewing the ingredient list, she became convinced that the peppermint and citrus oils were the culprits.

In January, Summer Fridays posted an apology to customers after receiving a slew of negative reviews that mentioned rashes and hives as side effects. While the brand attributed the reactions to a product batch being compromised by a third-party manufacturer, it noted that it would be working to remove essential oils from its products “to mitigate any future potential for irritation.”

Why Essential Oils Are So Risky

To understand why essential oils can be risky for skin, it helps to understand what they are and are not. Extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots and select fruits via either distillation or cold-pressing, essential oils are highly concentrated chemical components that contain a plant’s essence or smell.

“They require a high amount of plant material for processing, so they usually have much higher active ingredient concentrations than we’re used to,” said David Petrillo, a cosmetic chemist in Los Angeles. They are much more concentrated than popular oils like coconut and argan, for instance, which are considered “carrier” oils that are milder and are often used to dilute stronger essential oils.

While inhaling certain essential oils has been shown to affect the central nervous system and stimulate the brain to release neurotransmitters like serotonin that help with mood regulation, they’ve also been shown to disrupt the normal functioning of hormones. When it comes to the skin, some experts say that in small concentrations they offer antibacterial benefits, but many believe that beyond giving a product a nice scent, they do more harm than good.

“Using them on your skin almost insures that some of it will get into your bloodstream,” Dr. Petrillo said, listing a skin-crawling list of common side effects, including redness, chemical burns, headaches, swelling and blisters. And although many brands maintain that the antibacterial properties of essential oils aid in fighting acne, they can actually worsen breakouts.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Not Too Blond, Please

My natural hair color is dark brown. I got it dyed for the first time in my freshman year, and I got highlights. It was pretty natural, but every time I got highlights, I added more and I got lighter and lighter and I became blond, and that’s not what I wanted. Then I dyed my hair black, and it was so dark it was almost blue. It was my emo phase!

Recently I started highlighting it more again. I don’t want to go full blond. It’s just a little flavor. When I get my hair done, I always ask for a deep conditioner. My favorite one to use at home, though, is TRESemmé. I’ve tried all different ones — the keratin therapies, too — but I like that one.

TikTok Diets

Diet is something I definitely think about as an athlete and a model. In both of my jobs, my body does the work. I haven’t talked about this very much, but last year I was struggling with eating. Being skinny isn’t really that great if it’s compromising your strength. I’m naturally very lean. I just wasn’t eating enough, or I wasn’t eating the right way. I was counting calories and thinking about food all the time.

What happened was that during the early months of the pandemic, I got stuck on those TikTok videos that document “what I ate today,” which was all disorders! It wasn’t even so much that I wanted to look like those girls, but I realized later that I was truly being influenced by them. I was looking at what the girls were eating, and then I looked at what I ate in a day, and it looked like so much! One girl was eating, like, one piece of white bread a day.

The thing is, the culture of being a teenage girl these days — not even in modeling or the ski industry — it’s very competitive. At home, I could be in the school lunchroom eating my mac and cheese, and some girl will be shaking her salad right next to me. Or if everyone is eating a Caesar salad, the conversation is “Oh, I’m eating the same salad but with no croutons.” And then someone else will say, “Oh, I’m eating a salad without croutons, and I’m taking out the avocado.”

It was a big moment for me, growing up with social media and TikTok, to realize that something was wrong. I’m sponsored by Red Bull, and they assigned me a nutritionist. I now FaceTime her about once a month. I just ran a blood test when I was in Austria, and everything looks great. I definitely eat more now — I’m 5-foot-8 and 120 pounds — and I’m eating about 2,000 calories a day. It’s really a maintenance level for me, and then sometimes I need to eat more.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Victoria’s Secret Angels, those avatars of Barbie bodies and playboy reverie, are gone. Their wings, fluttery confections of rhinestones and feathers that could weigh almost 30 pounds, are gathering dust in storage. The “Fantasy Bra,” dangling real diamonds and other gems, is no more.

In their place are seven women famous for their achievements and not their proportions. They include Megan Rapinoe, the 35-year-old pink-haired soccer star and gender equity campaigner; Eileen Gu, a 17-year-old Chinese American freestyle skier and soon-to-be Olympian; the 29-year-old biracial model and inclusivity advocate Paloma Elsesser, who was the rare size 14 woman on the cover of Vogue; and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, a 38-year-old Indian actor and tech investor.

They will be spearheading what may be the most extreme and unabashed attempt at a brand turnaround in recent memory: an effort to redefine the version of “sexy” that Victoria’s Secret represents (and sells) to the masses. For decades, Victoria’s Secret’s scantily clad supermodels with Jessica Rabbit curves epitomized a certain widely accepted stereotype of femininity. Now, with that kind of imagery out of step with the broader culture and Victoria’s Secret facing increased competition and internal turmoil, the company wants to become, its chief executive said, a leading global “advocate” for female empowerment.

Will women buy it? An upcoming spinoff, more than $5 billion in annual sales, and 32,000 jobs in a global retail network that includes roughly 1,400 stores are riding on the answer.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Some influencers have advised people tired of contouring their faces with makeup to use a thick sunscreen with high SPF, applying it only on the areas they want to highlight, like the top of the cheekbones and bridge of the nose. The rest of the face is left to tan (and burn), sunscreen free.

It’s a tip that flies in the face of the American Academy of Dermatology’s recommendation that everyone wear a broad-spectrum SPF of at least 30 on any exposed skin. “We know that this is crucial to do from a very young age from both a skin cancer and anti-aging perspective, so the idea that these videos are suggesting otherwise to a very young audience is disturbing,” Dr. Nathan said.

In April, drinking chlorophyll, which has had moments on other social media platforms, had a spike in interest on TikTok, driven by the endorsements of influencers like Amelie Zilber, according to Traackr, an influencer marketing platform. It has been called a “miracle product” that can increase energy levels, induce weight loss and clear up skin, but doctors say these claims are not backed by research.

Drinking chlorophyll is one of the more harmless recommendations on TikTok, but it’s likely a waste of money. (Sakara Life’s Detox Water Drops with chlorophyll cost $39, and raw chlorophyll drops on Amazon cost about $20, on average.) “If people are seeing ‘results’ from drinking chlorophyll, it’s likely because they’re drinking more water than normal, so their skin is getting better and their bathroom trips are more regular,” Dr. Sonpal, the gastroenterologist, said.

What trend do doctors really want to see left to the professionals? Microneedling, which involves puncturing the skin with tiny needles in an effort to generate new collagen. On TikTok, conversation around at-home microneedling grew in 2020 and is already experiencing five times more engagement in 2021, per Traackr, but experts say it’s incredibly risky to do at home.

While some studies have shown that medical-grade microneedling can improve skin suppleness and lessen wrinkles, “it needs to be done in a really clean, safe setting,” Dr. Engelman said, pointing to the high risk of infection. “If you go hard enough on your skin, it can lead to color change, textural change and scarring, essentially worsening what you’re trying to make look better, like fine lines and acne scars.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When a fresh crop of young stars began building audiences on TikTok in late 2019 and early 2020, many were hopeful that this time would be different. They’d grown up watching YouTubers speak frankly about these issues. “When it comes to Gen Z creators, we talk so much about mental health and caring for yourself,” said Courtney Nwokedi, 23, a YouTube star in Los Angeles. “We’ve seen a bunch of creators talk about burnout in the past.”

Still, they weren’t prepared for the draining work of building, maintaining and monetizing an audience during a pandemic. “It’s exhausting,” said Jose Damas, 22, a TikTok creator in Los Angeles. “It feels like there aren’t enough hours in the day.”

“TikTok is just as demanding as YouTube,” said Gohar Khan, 22, a TikTok creator in Seymour, Conn.

Thanks to the app’s algorithmically generated “For You” page, TikTok delivers fame faster than any other platform; it’s possible to amass millions of followers within a matter of weeks. But as quickly as creators rise, they can fall.

“It almost feels like I’m getting a taste of celebrity, but it’s never consistent and as soon as you get it, it’s gone and you’re constantly trying to get it back,” said Lauren Stasyna, 22, a TikTok creator in Toronto. “It feels like I’m trying to capture this prize, but I don’t know what the prize even is.”

The volatility can be rattling. “When your views are down, it affects your financial stability and puts your career at risk,” said Luis Capecchi, a 23-year-old TikTok creator in Los Angeles. “It’s like getting demoted at a job with no warning.”

Creators have encountered all kinds of problems, including bullying, harassment and discrimination. “Some creators get their content stolen too, so someone else will go viral off their content then they get all the press,” Mr. Harris said. Not to mention, fan communities and internet commentators can be vicious. “You can’t just film what you want to film,” Mr. Harris said. “They’ll make fun of you if your views drop.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Debbie Gibson, the pop singer who shot to fame in the late 1980s with “Electric Youth,” is still making new music. She has an album out in August, “The Body Remembers,” her first in 20 years, and is performing in Las Vegas (at the Venetian) to boot. “Electric Youth” may have influenced fashion (her signature headwear) and beauty (Electric Youth perfume) for a certain generation, but Ms. Gibson, 50, is living firmly in the moment. “I never say ‘back in the day’ because today is today, and that’s how I approach life,” she said. Here, her current take on beauty products and wellness regimens.

She’s a Morning Person

I joke that I if I was not in entertainment, I would be a farmer. I’m down with the sun and up with the sun. I did half the vocals of my new album by 5 a.m. in my nightgown. I do try to linger in bed with my dogs, three boy dachshunds. That snuggle time with puppy kisses for me is everything.

I need breakfast within a half-hour of waking up. I’m a basic eggs, orange juice and coffee person. On a decadent day like today, it’s an almond croissant.

Mad Scientist Skin Care

I’m kind of a mad scientist with my skin regimes. I do what I need on that day. I love micellar water for cleansing. I just got the Soap & Glory Triple Action Jelly Eye Makeup Remover. I also have this Tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment. It’s got glycolic in it. It really wakes my skin up. I also love the Tatcha brand — the deep cleanse and the moisturizer.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Curiosity, Confusion, Then a Kiss

We had been friends for a year when she sent me the text: “I’m attracted to you.” I was stunned into a newfound curiosity and confusion. I had never been with a woman before. Three weeks after the text, we went to a D.J. set — as friends. She asked if I wanted to go to the bathroom. We took turns peeing and then went to the sink. I gathered her hands in mine and lathered them, our skin making soapsuds and new charge of electricity. We kissed with the sink running, hands interlocked, a friendship spilling at our feet. — Sarah Diedrick
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“Kismet,” I wrote. “Is that so much to ask?”

Meghan had convinced me to start online dating by promising she would do it with me. To cover our bases, we registered on two sites: OkCupid (which was free) and eHarmony (which was definitely not). Soon Meghan began going on dates, returning to our San Francisco apartment with accounts of cringe-worthy misrepresentations and awkward conversations.

I stayed home. I’d spotted zero signs of kismet (not even any artistic or literary overlap), and I refused to settle for less.

Sometimes Meghan would carry her laptop into my bedroom. Once she said, “I found someone for you. He’s cute and funny, but too short for me.” (I’m 5-foot-1.) Another time, we received the same message from the same guy: “I’m sorry, but I just have to lay it on the line and let you know, despite the fact you hear it all the time, that you’re undeniably, effortlessly and strikingly attractive.”

I grew discouraged. From what I could tell, the internet was where kismet went to die.

Then one day I noticed a guy who looked handsome, seemed smart and claimed to bake pies. Who doesn’t like a handsome, smart man who bakes pies? Also, he had filled in the prompt “Contact me if ___” with “you want to get out of town.” I was a traveler, always wanting to get out of town — so I “favorited” him, the OkCupid equivalent of sending over a drink.

After two days of flirtatious banter, I finally broached the question that had been bothering me: “You listed favorite music and films, but no books. Was that an oversight, or do you not read?”

“Recorded music has always spoken to me the way the written word speaks to most,” he replied.

I shut my computer. I was the daughter of bookshop owners, a lifelong collector of signed first editions and an author. Discussing literature was the height of stimulation. Reading was fundamental to my identity.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Warning About Neighbors

The Bible says to “love thy neighbor,” but I took that advice too far, dating a man from down the street before we mutually ghosted each other. (During a Canadian winter, we mistakenly prized the convenience of proximity over compatibility.) Now, almost every time I get gas at our local station, I look up and see my ghost pumping gas across from me. The first time we saw each other, we nodded for pretense’s sake; now, we awkwardly look the other way. Readers, heed my warning: Don’t date people in your neighborhood, or you’re bound to get haunted. — Cassie Silva
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I was 23, newly single and back in Los Angeles after having spent a year living in Hong Kong on a prestigious fellowship. I had returned home to submit my law school applications before heading off to the international destinations that beckoned a second gap year. I wanted something to do between practicing logic games and drafting statements about why I thought going to law school in New York City would be a fruitful endeavor.

Albert filled those moments in between. He became my something.

Initially, we were fine keeping things shallow and embodying the labels we placed on each other. I wanted good sex from Albert — a lot of it — and little else.

He seemed to understand.

“So, let’s say I decide to have sex with you tonight,” I said. “Then what?”

“Then I hope we can do it again and again,” Albert said.

Unknown to us at the time, his words were a spell that locked our chain firmly in place.

Our emotional distance allowed us to be vulnerable and unrestricted in ways we couldn’t be with anyone else. We were honest with each other. There were no games.

To my girlfriends who criticized my involvement with a man who didn’t have a degree or a profession with a sexy job title, I made it clear that our fling would be fleeting and our intentions were mutual.

I didn’t care about Albert’s ego. I didn’t care about his feelings. I felt free to tell him what I wanted and didn’t want. He was willing to oblige my curiosities because I dared to share them with him.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Often, when people are first dating, they hide things about themselves in order to appear in the best light.

Right, they do. But in this essay, a woman has to hide a really essential part of herself in order to survive. And over time, that just takes a huge toll.

Before I was even old enough to have a boyfriend, I was trained to lie to him. My secret, my mother said, could be used against me. “You can never tell anyone you’re undocumented.”

When I was 11, my parents who had been living and working in the United States for years, brought me from Mexico to join them in Texas. Three years later, my U.S. visa expired, and I became one of 11 million undocumented people in this country.

I didn’t understand the implications of my immigration status, only that it was a weapon that could be used against me. The first time I lied was in 11th grade at a party with my crush, Chris. When the police arrived in response to a noise complaint, I took off running into the backyard and jumped the fence. He said I overreacted, not knowing I could be deported if I got caught.

My fear of discovery was ever-present: at school, where I excelled, in college, where I graduated cum laude, and in my first finance job in New York City, working for Goldman Sachs. When would my lies begin to unravel? Every phone call or email I got from human resources would make my blood run cold. Yet it never happened. After Chris, I lied to nearly every man I ever dated.

In college, I finally pushed aside my mother’s advice about hiding my status with the guy I was then seeing, who had driven me an hour to eat my favorite tacos. On the ride back to campus, I took a deep breath and said, “I don’t have papers.” I exhaled with relief over speaking the secret that had been crushing me for so long.

A few years later, after he and I moved from Texas to New York City, I discovered that he was cheating on me. I found the woman’s number and threatened to call it. “If you call her,” he said, “I’ll call ICE.”

After that, it took me years to share my immigration status again with anyone. The next time was when my father had passed away, and I couldn’t travel to Mexico to be with him. In a moment of desperation, I shared my undocumented status with my then boyfriend. “I can’t be here anymore,” I said, weeping. “I’m going to move back to Mexico.”

The pressures of my immigration status left us with two choices — break up or get married. We chose to elope so we could stay together in the United States, but after saying “I do,” our entire relationship became about filling out paperwork, meeting with lawyers and having interviews with immigration officials to prove our love. We never had a honeymoon. I became a U.S. citizen. But the years-long process extinguished our romance. And we eventually divorced.

More than a decade later, newly single, I downloaded Bumble and matched with a bearded hipster. After telling him about my past, I never heard from him again. Next, I swiped right on a handsome Mexican man with sun-kissed skin and a flirtatious smile. On our first date, he told me how he used to build fighting rings for his wrestling toys as a boy and now worked at an architecture office.

My mother would approve, but would she still want me to lie?

I told him I was a writer. There, one truth. And he told me about his travels to Europe. “I never traveled anywhere when I was younger,” he said. “And I knew as soon as I could afford it, I wanted to see the world.” My favorite trip had been the one I took to Mexico to see my family after getting my papers, but I couldn’t tell him that. Not yet.

Here I was, on my first date with woody, kind-hearted Fernando, wishing I could unburden myself and speak honestly. But I was too scared to trust that it wouldn’t ruin everything before it began. So once again, I chose the lie of omission.

Soon, it was 2:00 a.m. and the restaurant was closing, seven hours after we arrived. “I had a great time,” I said. “When can I see you again?” he said.

A few weeks and many dates later, I was headed to Antigua for my best friend’s wedding with a layover in New York. As soon as I landed at J.F.K., I realized I didn’t have my U.S. passport, which I would need for my flight the next morning. I panicked. I found out the only way for me to make the wedding was if someone were to drive my passport to L.A.X. and place it on the last overnight flight to J.F.K., a service I didn’t even know existed.

Fernando’s office was only a few miles away from my apartment, but I hesitated to ask him for help. My U.S. passport was in the same drawer as my Mexican one, which I had not updated since my divorce. Mexican passports for married women require them to list their husband’s last name. I hadn’t told Fernando about my first marriage.

Now, he might see my name next to my ex-husband’s.

What if Fernando saw that and thought I was still married? Would he ever let me explain?

I thought about all the friends’ weddings I missed because I couldn’t travel outside the country and how much I regretted not being there for the people I loved. I couldn’t do it again.

If Fernando eventually came to love me, he would need to understand or at least accept my need to hide the more difficult points of my life. I called him.

“OK,” he said, “I’m on it. Tell me what to do.” I gave him the combination to my catsitter’s lockbox for keys and explained where to find my passport.

The next morning, I picked it up from the airline counter and boarded my flight. As we ascended, I decided I would tell Fernando everything when I returned. I was tired of the evasion and lies. I am an American citizen. And if I couldn’t finally be free of my past, then all those years of anxiety would be for naught.

Maybe Fernando would run, as had so many others, when he learned the truth — that I had spent more than 10 years undocumented, that I had used fake papers to work at Goldman Sachs, that I was divorced at 33. Would it all be too much? Would he ever trust me?

Romance may thrive on mystery, but love can’t be built on lies.

When I got back home — and what a glorious word that is, home — I met Fernando at a quiet bar down the street from my apartment. We sat on a red velvet couch, his hand resting on my lap as I told him about the wedding in Antigua and thanked him for rescuing my passport. Then I paused and bit my lip.

“Is everything OK?” he said.

“I have to tell you something,” I said. “I’ll answer your questions, but let me finish.”

He set up. “OK,” he said, but he never let go of my hands.

As the truth flowed from me, backfilling my past, he never looked away, never raised an eyebrow, never signaled any judgment.

“That’s it?” he said. “I thought you were going to tell me you killed someone.” He pulled my hands toward his face and kissed it. “Life is complicated.”

He didn’t ask where I bought my fake papers, why my parents didn’t fix my immigration status, or why I hadn’t gone back to Mexico if things were so difficult here.

Instead, at the end of the night, he asked me the same question he had asked after our first date. “When can I see you again?”

I had spent so many years keeping people at arm’s length, believing that isolating myself was necessary. I carried a heavy load of guilt over all the lies I told to stay in this country, to grasp onto the few crumbs of love I was given. I accepted crumbs instead of looking for a whole person, someone who understood that love, for those of us who have to hide the truth to survive, sometimes drives us to take seemingly indefensible actions.

For my entire life, I believed finding love was all up to me.

If only I could figure out the perfect formula of what to omit, what to say, and how and when to say it, love would be mine.

But what I really needed was a husband who doesn’t judge me, fault me, or question the difficult choices I made to carve out a life in America.

Now that I have found a home in Fernando’s heart, I refuse to hide or apologize for any of it.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In a TikTok video from May, a 21-year-old woman in London shoves a clump of lettuce leaves into a Superman mug, steeps them in hot water (with a peppermint tea bag, for taste) and drinks it. “Update, I do feel slightly drowsy,” she records herself saying from a reclined position later on. “Another update, lettuce has crack because your sis is gone,” she adds again, looking like she’s on the verge of falling asleep.

The #lettucewater hashtag on TikTok has spawned hundreds of videos and garnered more than 31 million views, as many people — some bored and curious, some desperate for a sleep hack — try the trend. An influencer in Washington State says she can barely keep her eyes open an hour after drinking the concoction. A man in Ontario says the same, claiming that a cup of “lettuce water” allowed him to sleep for nine hours straight.

Proponents on social media concur that steeping a handful of lettuce leaves for several minutes in boiling water, then drinking the liquid, can help you fall asleep faster — and stay asleep longer. But doctors and sleep experts say these claims are unsubstantiated.

“This is a pretty easy thing to try, it’s pretty harmless,” said Michelle Drerup, director of the behavioral sleep medicine program at the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center. “But unfortunately, it doesn’t have any evidence or merit behind it.”

Can lettuce water actually help you sleep?

No studies have shown that eating (or steeping) lettuce you buy in the grocery store can help you fall asleep, Dr. Drerup said. But it’s understandable why people think it might.

Lettuce has been used in folk medicine as a natural sedative and pain reliever for centuries. During the 19th century, for instance, some doctors used lactucarium — a dried, hardened form of a bitter, milky juice secreted by wild lettuce — as a sedative, or combined lettuce with other ingredients (like opium and hemlock, a poisonous flowering plant) to make dwale, an herbal anaesthetic.

Dr. Drerup said that the TikTok trend may have stemmed from a 2017 Korean study in mice, which she has seen people cite in videos. In the study, researchers reported that after feeding young mice a concentrated extract of lettuce seeds and leaves and pentobarbital (a sedative), some slept as much as about 20 minutes longer than mice that were fed just the pentobarbital. But Dr. Drerup said that the study had many limitations, including the fact that the lettuce extracts were tested alongside a sleep-inducing drug. Not to mention, mice aren’t humans. “It doesn’t really support the hypothesis of the lettuce water doing anything,” Dr. Drerup said.

There have been a handful of other animal and human studies — none on lettuce water itself — showing an association between lettuce seed and its extracts and reduced symptoms of insomnia, including one in pregnant women, but they don’t provide strong enough evidence to prove lettuce can help with sleep, Dr. Drerup said. And even if there were a sedative component in conventional lettuce, boiling a few leaves would not release enough extract to have an effect on you, she added. “You’d probably have to have a truckful.”

There is some limited evidence that wild lettuce — a medicinal plant found growing in sunny spots around the world and sometimes sold in tincture, powder, oil or pill form — has sedative and pain-relieving effects. But keep in mind that ingesting it raw is toxic to humans, said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, an associate professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University Medical Center and the director of the Sleep Center of Excellence at Columbia. “It is a sedative, but it’s not something you’d want to be consuming in large doses,” she said, and wild lettuce is entirely different from the leaves people steep in hot water on TikTok.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The combination of the underarm’s thin, folding skin, hair follicles and moist environment makes this area of the body more susceptible to irritation or an allergic reaction compared to, say, if you put deodorant on your back. In fact, Dr. Chen noted, one study on fragrance allergies found that among many of the scented personal care products tested — like scented deodorants, lotions, shampoos, shaving creams and hair dyes — the deodorants caused the most cases of allergic contact dermatitis, a skin rash caused by contact with an allergen.

Dr. Botto said that while she still sees allergic reactions to synthetic fragrances, she’s been getting more and more patients who are dealing with allergic contact dermatitis after using products with natural fragrance, like those containing linalool and limonene — natural compounds extracted from certain plants, like citrus fruit peels, which are commonly used in natural deodorants.

Even worse, “a lot of times you’ll see that someone gets a rash with a natural deodorant and they’ll put on balms and other ‘natural’ remedies that contain more of the same ingredients,” Dr. Botto said. “It’s kind of like adding gasoline to a fire.” She noted that such rashes can also cause breaks in the skin, which can then lead to infection. “It can be a real mess,” she said.

Does natural deodorant even work?

The experts said they weren’t aware of any studies that reliably looked into how well natural deodorants work. But the way they’re formulated can offer clues.

Because regular and natural deodorants don’t contain aluminum (which is what helps antiperspirants minimize sweating) they typically rely on ingredients like fragrances and baking soda to mask body odor. This means that natural deodorants generally should function as well as regular deodorants do in terms of keeping you fresh. However, while the experts were not aware of any rigorous, head-to-head studies comparing the efficacy of natural deodorants versus antiperspirants, it stands to reason that they may not counteract smell in the same way that an antiperspirant does. “Bacteria are stimulated to grow by the available water and nutrients found in sweat,” Dr. Gilbert said. “So antiperspirant is getting to the main route of the odor problem.”

Dr. Arielle Nagler, an assistant professor of dermatology at the N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine, said that the effectiveness of a product will also depend on how it interacts with your own biology. “Everyone smells a little bit different,” she said, which depends on how much you sweat and what kinds of bacteria are on your body.

Should I buy natural deodorant or not?

Natural deodorant is not better or worse for your health than traditional deodorant or antiperspirant. “A lot of the claims that one product is better than another are just marketing claims that are not based on scientific evidence,” Dr. Chen said. “I don’t think there’s any proof that one is safer than another.”

During the first lockdown, I was in my house in the country in England for 14 months, living with eight people. Two were over 80. One was my mother. It was a very scary time. But it was also great time, the first time I lived with my family since the ’80s. We had a lot of catching up to do. The minute my mother, who is 81, had her second vaccine her shoulders went down.

A fabled rite of the spring social season, it returned last week with a splash, as the first major gala in New York City to take place in person since the pandemic put the charity circuit on hiatus.

Spread over two days and across various sites in Central Park, the luncheon drew more than 922 members of the city’s philanthropic, fashion and social elite, mingling and fanning out their finery, many for the first time since the protracted confinement of lockdown. It also raised more than $2.8 million.

For one of her own bathrooms, Ms. Baker recently had a shower curtain custom made — in bold swirls of yellow, green and blue — to match the hand-painted Porter Teleo wallpaper that covers the wall. “It’s a focal point,” she said.

The pandemic brought masks, which severed humanity from its sense of smell, “the sublime which is right here,” as Mr. Collado calls it. And it brought the possibility that the virus could leave him unable to smell anything, which had happened to him briefly years ago and caused a kind of existential crisis.

Then there was the future of his smelling tours, which he pioneered in his native Catalonia, and which, for a time, had seemed under threat as well.

Si Dalí pintó relojes derritiéndose con estos mismos paisajes de fondo, Collado ha hecho del olor de este panorama su arte. Cosecha heliantemos, un arbusto mediterráneo de pétalos blancos y hojas perennes. Hace tinturas de hinojo marino, una planta comestible de punzante aroma salado que recuerda al mar.

Mezcla estos y otros olores para producir Cala, la fragancia que comercializa.

Las algas podridas que recoge de la orilla del mar y la resina prensada del lentisco, un árbol mencionado en Don Quijote de la Mancha, también son parte de su búsqueda de aromas locales.

“Sus fragancias te golpean aquí”, dijo Juan Carlos Moreno, un perfumista aficionado, y se golpeó fuerte el pecho.

Moreno cuenta que lloró la primera vez que olió una de las fragancias de Collado. Era Muga, un olor que, según sus materiales publicitarios, podrían causar “sentir el zumbido de las abejas y la silenciosa sexualidad del romero, la siempreviva, el tomillo y el cantueso”.

Ernesto Collado creció escuchando a su abuelo José Collado Herrero contar relatos sobre perfumes. Collado Herrero formuló uno de los perfumes más vendidos en España a principios del siglo XX. Pero el nieto primero se hizo conocido como actor televisivo y director de teatro.

Now that more of us are vaccinated and the rules for the most part are more flexible and even lifted in some areas, singles are connecting again (or at least trying to do so without putting themselves at risk of contracting the Delta and Lambda variants) and meeting up with romantic interests to get acquainted.

Often getting-to-know-you stages inspire standard questions about hobbies, interests and upbringings. But, more than a year into the coronavirus pandemic, personal and wellness-related inquiries are finding space in courtship conversations, too.

If you’re dipping your toes back into the dating scene, you may be discussing Covid vaccinations, mental health or even sexually transmitted infections. Experts share their best advice about how to delicately approach and respond to these topics when chatting with a potential partner.

Vaccinated or not Vaccinated

Some people proudly divulge that they have been vaccinated and even include this detail on their dating app profiles. Others do not feel the urge to share their statuses openly. The latter doesn’t necessarily indicate thoughts such as “‘I think the government is out to get us,’” said La Keita Carter, a licensed psychologist in Owings Mills, Md.

Mr. Mowers and Ms. Thorsen, 69, who owns Ranch Dressing, a Marfa store that sells vintage Navajo rugs and sterling silver jewelry, married in 2016. For a few years, they commuted between Marfa and Chattanooga, Tenn., for Mr. Mowers’s work. But as they planned to settle in Marfa together, the couple faced a few issues with the adobe house that needed to be resolved.

The exterior walls were finished in mud and straw that protected the bricks, but the coating sloughed off during storms and had to be constantly reapplied. “The mud would just wash away in the rain,” Ms. Thorsen said, adding that sometimes after a storm, “you couldn’t even open the door because there was so much mud on the ground.”

“We experienced a number of years of just resurfacing the outside of the house,” Mr. Mowers said.

They eventually covered the house in a more durable lime plaster. Then it was on to the next glaring problem.

Ms. Kaplan suggests choosing undergarments even before committing to buying your dress and taking them with you to your dress fittings. “I recommend first finding options of shapewear and foundation that will work with the dresses you’re eyeing.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WHAT DO YOU FEED A KING, dulled to every luxury beyond want? In the city-state of Venice in 1574, the young Henry III, then king of Poland and en route to becoming king of France, was welcomed with a banquet, just another in the hundreds of his life. But when he reached for his napkin, it shattered, a handful of dust. The whole setup was fake — the drape of tablecloth, the platters and knives. All were molded out of a powdered sugar paste likely made with rose and orange blossom water and tragacanth, a resin from a plant indigenous to the Middle East and Asia: the yields of trade and Western expansion. A year before, Venice had ended a war with the Ottoman Empire by grudgingly ceding Cyprus, the site of its cane plantations, and the price of sugar was high. To waste so much of it was a show of power. It hardly mattered, then, that this was a feast of nothing, too sweet to eat. The pleasure lay in the surprise, the beautiful lie.

For centuries, the West has delighted in the treachery of food in disguise, from the intricate sotelties of the Middle Ages, presented to aristocrats between dinner courses — a pastry stag, say, with an arrow in its side, which when plucked let loose a gush of bloodlike claret — to the grand edible monuments and landscapes erected for public festivals in Italy in the 16th through 18th centuries, with swooping arches of bread and cheese crowned by suckling pigs and mock trees hung with fruit and haunches of game. Part of the entertainment was inviting the public to ransack the displays and scrabble for mouthfuls among the ruins, while nobles of the court applauded from afar: a literal hunger games. These fever dreams were meant to evoke the mythic Land of Cockaigne, a utopia that first entered European literature around the 13th century, where custard rained down from the sky, roofs were tiled in bacon and garlic-roasted geese and stewed larks, tasting of cloves and cinnamon, flew straight into your mouth — where no one, highborn or low, had to suffer to make a living to ease their hunger. It was a fantasy of abundance at a time when, for much of the population, food was no certainty. (Inevitably, a disapproving tone crept in, and by the 16th century, Cockaigne was a cautionary tale of gluttony and sloth.)

Centuries later, we’re still mesmerized by these little duplicities, the more so in our compulsively visual culture, where food is increasingly consumed without actual eating, experienced through a screen. Between or even in lieu of meals, we sate ourselves on the theater of ever-proliferating TV cooking shows while trawling Instagram for brightly staged still lifes of brimming-over burgers and neon macarons. This disembodiment was exacerbated during the pandemic, when many restaurants were forced to shut down and dining with anyone beyond immediate family — eating as occasion, as opposed to mere sustenance — all but ceased. What a happy distraction, then, when last summer, BuzzFeed’s Tasty shared a video on Twitter that opened on a close-up of a knife looming over a red Croc sandal with its bulbous toe box. There was barely a moment for the viewer to register the banality of the shoe before the knife, wielded by a black-gloved hand, cut it brusquely in half, revealing layers of yellow and pink cake.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Four Principles to Design By

In his teaching, as in his own practice, Mr. Morrison keeps four goals in mind — the four characteristics of a successful landscape design.

First, it must be ecologically or environmentally sound, meaning that it has a level of natural diversity that will provide resilience against climate change.

“The species in the landscape must be adapted to the site and region, and hence not require a lot of support like watering or applying poisons to the earth,” he said. “It also means we don’t introduce nonnative invasives that will diminish diversity.”

A landscape must also be experientially rich, beyond the visual dimension. That means considering “the nonvisual aspects: the feel of the wind, the aroma of prairie dropseed grass that permeates the air,” he said. “And the other forms of life, too: the bees and butterflies that move through it.”

A design must, likewise, be of the place — averting the fate conjured in a favorite quote. “When you have standardized landscapes with the same plants, all irrigated and on artificial support, ‘there is no there there,’” he said, borrowing from Gertrude Stein. “A native landscape gives you a clue of where you are. You should know if you are in Des Moines or Connecticut.”

Last, a landscape must be dynamic, changing over time. “We spend all kinds of effort to keep our landscapes looking the same, mowed and clipped and unchanged,” Mr. Morrison said. “You are missing out by doing that, missing out on the change from one growing season to another, and over time.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you are asking for alone time in the reactionary way, Dr. Talib said, you can be specific about what you’re stressed about — a change at work or feeling overwhelmed by tasks at home — and be clear that that’s why you need time to clear your mind on your own. There’s also a difference between being alone and being lonely, she said, and that nuance is worth talking about with kids.

2. Alone time should be part of your family’s routine. Remember those godforsaken color-coded charts from the early Covid days? All the family dinners? “We talked about family routines” when the pandemic started, Dr. Talib said. “Why didn’t we talk about creating a routine of alone time?” Her kids, who are just 3 and 5, know she goes outside every day “to stare at a tree in the backyard.” She’s meditating, and they know not to interrupt “tree time” — and that it doesn’t last very long.

Lizzie Assa, the founder of The Workspace for Children, a website and Instagram account that helps parents teach kids to play on their own, has made sure her three kids, who are now 14, 11, and 8, have “quiet time” every day since they were toddlers. She said it took work, but the payoff is worth it. “Kids learn that they need downtime and they need alone time,” said Ms. Assa, who is a neighbor of mine in Maplewood, N.J. “Even today when they’re having a hard time or getting moody, I don’t have to say, ‘You need to get away from us,’” she said. “They say, ‘I’m going to my room.’”

If instituting daily quiet time feels like a nonstarter in your house, you can try other ways of building downtime into your kids’ schedules. Dr. Pooja Lakshmin, a frequent Times contributor and clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University School of Medicine, suggested I simply ask my daughter what she needs for self-care. You can do this with an 11-year-old, Dr. Lakshmin reminded me: “Ask, ‘What do you feel like you need? Do you want to read a book? Take a bath?’ Help them brainstorm too.”

3. It’s OK for your kids to be upset. If you don’t want to spend every waking hour with your children,“it’s developmentally appropriate for them to be insulted,” Dr. Lakshmin reminded me. “That’s normal. Your job as a parent is to help them understand that it’s OK to feel sad.” She went even further to say that sitting with that discomfort teaches kids that they can take care of themselves even if it makes someone else unhappy temporarily.

Dr. Damour put it even more plainly: “People deserve privacy, full stop.” Plus, she reminded me that I’m heading full throttle into the teen years, when my daughter will likely become “allergic” to me. I might as well appreciate her wanting to stay close while I still can.

Then along came Aaron Goldstein, 39, a self-described homebody who is an owner of Macellum Capital Management, a Manhattan-based hedge fund.

And how places like Kentucky are stuck because of people’s attitudes.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Andrew Rannells: Well, it was an unexpected, traumatic event that happened at an unexpected time with a super unexpected person, and that’s just the way life works sometimes.

I was on a first date with this guy I didn’t know very well. I wasn’t sure how much I liked him, but I was 22 and trying to date. I ended up having sex with him, and as soon as we finished, I looked at my phone and there were all these messages from my family that my father was in a coma and had had a heart attack. He was going to die. I had to take in that information with this stranger. And it put a lot into perspective about what I wanted and who I wanted to spend my time with, and to trust my gut. If you’re saying to yourself, “I don’t really want to have sex with this guy,” then you probably shouldn’t.

And yes, I felt panicked and upset that night, but I didn’t treat my date very well. This episode was an opportunity for me to imagine what his version of that night was.

This was your first time directing. Did you ever think, “What am I doing?”

Yeah, there were definitely times. We had prepped everything to shoot in March 2020, and obviously that didn’t happen because everything was shut down. So I had an obscene amount of prep time, and by the time September rolled around, I was so ready. Also I got to cast some of my friends, so I knew that even if things started to go bad, I could just look at them and say: “Do something to fix it!”

People may not realize that the whole season was shot during the pandemic, which meant all kinds of restrictions and concerns — masks, protocols, tests.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“This might be the start of Kit Harington’s romantic comedy career,” Daniel Jones, the editor of Modern Love, said to me recently, only half joking.

Though Mr. Harington may be better known for playing Jon Snow in “Game of Thrones,” viewers can now see him play an affable Irishman who is smitten with a woman (played by Lucy Boynton) at the start of the pandemic.

We’re happy to announce that after many pandemic-related postponements, Season 2 of “Modern Love” is now available to stream on Prime Video.

The eight-episode season features Minnie Driver, Dominique Fishback, Marquis Rodriguez, Anna Paquin, Sophie Okonedo, Lulu Wilson, Tobias Menzies, Gbenga Akinnagbe and Zoë Chao, among many others. You can watch the trailer and read all the original essays that inspired the second season here.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marvin Alexander, a makeup artist in New York City who decided to shift from the fashion industry to bridal during the depths of the pandemic, is also seeing lots of last-minute bookings, including from rescheduled weddings. The events are often more modest affairs, with smaller wedding parties and guest lists, in a nod to virus risks.

“I’m starting to see a few people being more comfortable about 2022, even with the Delta variant strong on our heels,” Mr. Alexander said.

On the other end of the spectrum, Magdalena Mieczkowska, a wedding planner, has seen demand in the Hudson Valley and Berkshires take off for big events in 2022. And clients are willing to spend: Her average was typically $100,000 per event, but now she's seeing some weekends come in at $200,000 or more.

“People were postponing, and now they have more savings,” she said. Plus, vendors are charging more for catered meals and cutlery rentals. “Everyone is trying to make up for their financial losses from the 2020 season.”

Wedding industry experts said they expected demand to remain robust into 2023 before tapering back to normal, as new bookings vie for resources with delayed weddings like the one Ariana Papier, 31, and Andrew Jenzer, 32, held last weekend in Richmond, Mass., a town in the Berkshires.

The couple had to cancel their original June 6, 2020, date, opting to elope instead, but rescheduled the event to Aug. 7, complete with signature cocktails (a bush berry Paloma and an Earl Grey blackberry Old-Fashioned), a dance floor and s’mores.

“We’re calling it a vow renewal and celebration,” Ms. Papier said just ahead of the ceremony, adding it was the couple’s third attempted venue, thanks to pandemic hiccups.

“Third and best,” she said. “We are so excited.”

No More 9 to 5

I am 27. In the last year, I landed my dream job. My job has purpose. My skills and qualifications are used and challenged. My co-workers and supervisors are unparalleled but alas: 40 hours a week is not sustainable. I have hobbies. I have creative pursuits and therapy and laundry, and I own a small dog, so I am busy. My partner and I are considering starting a family in a few years. Because I already feel like there is not enough time in the week, I wonder what getting away from the 40-hour workweek looks like. I have considered self-employment, trying out the artist lifestyle, going back into academia, mildly rejecting capitalism, but maybe I should just get over it? Thoughts? — Brit, Indianapolis

At 46, as the workaholic daughter of immigrants with an intense work ethic, I am inclined to tell you that this is life. You have to get over it and find a way to balance your professional and personal lives. For many people, only having to work 40 hours a week at one job would be a dream. It’s important to acknowledge that. But we do live in a country obsessed with work to the detriment of our collective well-being. You ask an important question and one many of us struggle with. Is this all there is? Are our lives destined to be consumed by work? It is kind of maddening. Work is a means to an end. If you’re lucky, you enjoy what you do and thrive professionally but we’re not working for fun. We are working in a capitalist society that demands our participation.

Many European countries model more reasonable work/life balance. In July, Iceland shared results of a four-day workweek trial that showed great results. So there are alternatives to working a 40-hour week. You should know that most of the other options you list are more demanding than you might think. Academia is demanding; you just have more control over where you spend your time when you’re not in the classroom, though that is if you’re one of the very few academics who gets a tenure track position. As an adjunct, you do essentially the same job for a fraction of the compensation.

I don’t want to discourage you, but there is no magical way to earn a full-time salary without working full-time. You have to decide what your priorities are and what you’re willing to do to nurture those priorities. If you want to pursue an artist’s life or reject capitalism, how will you pay for housing, food and health insurance? What are you willing to forego to have a more fulfilling life? That is the question; it’s an unfair choice until we, as a culture, decide there is, indeed, more to life than work.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As someone who lived a few blocks away, she was excited to have such valuable intel to share. “My group chats were all blowing up,” she said. “A bunch of my friends work in the area, so everyone was trying to walk by, trying to get a glimpse of them.”

But it also made her feel like SoHo and New York City, more broadly, was back in action. “It’s really cool they are starting things like this again,” she said.

Well into the second year of the pandemic, New York City streets are once again alive with the buzz of movie and television filmings. In 2019, the film and television industry supported approximately 185,000 jobs, $18.1 billion in wages, and $81.6 billion in total economic output in the city, according to the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment. Last year, however, all film permits were suspended on March 21 and did not resume until July 1. This year, in April and May alone, there were around 360 projects. In 2020, there were a total of 732 film and television projects shot in the city, a significant decrease from the 2,214 projects in 2019. Even with the recent return of activity, the Mayor’s office does not anticipate this year’s number to match 2019 levels.

Film crews take over streets and city corners for days at a time, crowding the spaces with trailers and trucks and limiting cars from parking and pedestrians from walking. While some residents who live in the area complain about the hubbub or lack of parking spaces, many others delight in living in a movie set for a short time. Some lucky New Yorkers are asked to be extras or are paid by the production crews to do small, helpful tasks like keeping a particular light on or off in their apartment.

The pandemic has either made living on the street where a filming is taking place a delight or a terrifying experience. Some people panic at the sights of large crews descending on their block. Others find it exhilarating to be part of this action after such a quiet year.

Hi, Michael.

michael gold

Hello.

dodai stewart

How are you?

michael gold

You know, how’s anyone really.

dodai stewart

Yeah, OK, let me just do a little business. Hold on. One second. [CLEARS THROAT] From The New York Times, I’m Dodai Stewart. Bennifer is back. Ben and Jennifer, Affleck and Lopez. It’s been almost two decades. It’s almost like they never broke up. I can’t stop talking about it. I’m not alone. I don’t understand why we care so much. But the person who I talked to about this is my friend, Michael Gold.

michael gold

I’m alarmed at how much time I’ve spent thinking about this, but also not alarmed. It’s quite on brand.

dodai stewart

Michael’s our metro reporter for The New York Times. And I would say that you’re the most online person I know.

michael gold

I will take that. I don’t believe it. But that speaks volumes to you, I think, and your selection of friends — your good selection of friends.

dodai stewart

[LAUGHS] OK, so it was May 23.

michael gold

Yep.

dodai stewart

I saw a Page Six tweet. And they claimed that Ben was wearing a watch that looked just like the watch Jennifer Lopez gave him in 2002. And I was just like, these people are bonkers. There’s no way it’s the same. Why would you be wearing a watch that he got, like, 19 years ago? Also, he’s so sad and bedraggled all the time. Why would he even be putting on a wa — why does he even have a watch on?

michael gold

Who needs to know what time it is anymore, really?

dodai stewart

I just feel like his position has been the saddest man on the internet.

michael gold

Mm. So I want to preface this because I think this is really important, and it doesn’t actually get talked a lot about when we talk about Ben Affleck’s status as the sad man, which is like, Ben has talked a lot about struggling with anxiety. He’s talked a lot about struggling with depression. He’s talked about his alcoholism and his issues with sobriety. There are a lot of things surrounding all of this that are very serious. But the internet and culture strips that context out of everything. And so, none of that really gets talked about, but I do think it’s important to mention.

dodai stewart

Fair, fair.

michael gold

So here’s the thing about sad Ben Affleck. I think this really all started with the back tattoo.

archived recording Something that’s been talked about plenty — Ben’s large tattoo across his back.

michael gold

Around 2016, Ben Affleck had just broken up with Jennifer Garner, his ex-wife. And he shows up with a enormous back tattoo.

archived recording I did not believe this is real. That cannot be real. And —

michael gold

It’s a phoenix rising from the ashes. It’s red and blue and yellow. It covers his entire back.

dodai stewart

Far be it for me to cast judgment on this, but I think the internet agreed that the tattoo was hideous.

michael gold

It was horrible. Yeah, I mean, it was just, the colors weren’t right. The image was too big. And it was just very garish. It was very bold it didn’t hide easily. And the internet loses it.

archived recording 1 It’s terrible. archived recording 2 I know! archived recording 3 It’s terrible. archived recording 4 Yes! archived recording 5 It’s the whole back, and it’s very weird. archived recording 6 That tattoo is so butt ugly. I mean, I’m sorry if it means a lot. It’s not even an attractive phoenix. archived recording 7 There’s the tattoo. archived recording 8 It’s awful! archived recording 9 It’s awful. It’s not a tatt — [MUSIC]

michael gold

Because, remember, up to this point, Ben Affleck, we thought of him as this huge A-lister. And the idea that this man who we’d grown up idolizing as part of this huge Hollywood establishment would get this giant back tattoo just seemed crazy.

dodai stewart

There’s something about it. There was something about it that was dark.

michael gold

Yeah, I mean, it was this — there was this moment where everyone kind of looked at that, and they were like, is this guy OK? Is he spiraling? What is this man doing?

dodai stewart

OK, but there’s the back tattoo, but that is not the only sad Ben Affleck moment. There are so many others.

michael gold

Right, so also another early one that has really crystallized into a meme and made its way around the internet comes from also 2016, when Ben Affleck was promoting “Batman v. Superman.” And this was his big action movie where he was playing Batman.

archived recording Guys, thank you for speaking to us today.

michael gold

And you may recall that the reviews of the movie were a little mixed.

dodai stewart

Oh, right.

michael gold

Not great.

archived recording You’ve obviously been on the press tour for this film for quite a while now, it feels like.

michael gold

But they’re doing the press tour, and they’re sitting down with the media. And he’s sitting next to Henry Cavill, who plays Superman, his co-star in the movie.

archived recording But these are the first interviews you’ll be doing since reviews of the film have come out. And I don’t know —

michael gold

And an interviewer asks, what do you think about these reviews? They haven’t been so great.

archived recording But I just wondered whether that — how that makes you guys feel and whether it will even affect the film as such. archived recording (henry cavill) Well, the interesting thing is that —

michael gold

And Henry Cavill, doing his job dutifully, starts talking about the movie and the reviews. And Ben just sits there, looking dazed, looking distant.

dodai stewart

I think he full on dissociated.

michael gold

It seems like it.

dodai stewart

His eyes just glazed over. And he was in another dimension.

michael gold

Oh, he’s in a fugue state. And someone creates a meme out of this, where they have this clip of him looking very upset. And the video kind of focuses on his face and —

archived recording (simon and garfunkel) (SINGING) Hello, darkness, my old friend.

michael gold

— Simon and Garfunkel’s song “The Sound of Silence” plays in the background.

dodai stewart

Whoever did this was a genius.

michael gold

Yeah, if you’re listening, please get at us.

archived recording (simon and garfunkel) (SINGING) Left its seeds while I was sleeping.

michael gold

We were also used to thinking of him as this 2000s era heartthrob, that I think it just sort of grabbed people as like this man is in a freefall. Everyone’s kind of rooting for him, but it just becomes this joke. He becomes this epitome of male sadness and male fragility. And so, to me, that was actually where you really get the sad Ben Affleck stuff. And there’s other stuff, too. I mean, there’s a bunch of photos of him smoking cigarettes or e-cigarettes.

dodai stewart

Yes.

michael gold

Where he just looks very distraught or anxious or upset.

dodai stewart

And the Dunkin’ Donuts pictures where he’s holding Dunkin’ Donuts iced coffee and —

michael gold

A box of munchkins. So Ben Affleck’s got a tray full of iced coffees and a box of Dunkin’ Donuts munchkins. And he’s in the process of dropping them, kind of fumbling them. You look at the photo, and you know — you know these things are going to hit the floor. Here’s the other thing I will say about this. His arms look really good in that picture.

dodai stewart

[LAUGHS]

michael gold

Objectively, as a New York Times reporter, his arms look really good in that picture.

dodai stewart

OK, I didn’t notice that.

michael gold

Well, you’re not paid to look at details like this.

dodai stewart

[LAUGHS] What I did notice is that something happened where I used to look upon these photos of him fumbling with his coffee, and there’s one where he’s got coffee and a bunch of Amazon packages.

michael gold

Oh, yep, mm-hmm.

dodai stewart

I used to look at these as kind of like, oh, there he goes, the bumbling sad man. But what’s happened, the pandemic hit and suddenly really looking like a little bit on the verge of collapse, it’s very relatable.

michael gold

Yeah, I think the pandemic changed things for him, and it changed things for us. So it changed things for him in a very concrete way. Right before the pandemic or around the time we all go into lockdown, Ben Affleck starts dating Ana de Armas. And she’s another actress. The paparazzi in L.A. doesn’t have a lot to document at this point. And there aren’t a lot of new couples happening in March 2020 that people know about. And we’re barraged with photos of Ben Affleck, still one of the most famous men in Hollywood, going for walks and doing all these things that we’re all doing so that we don’t lose our minds. And he’s wearing a mask. I wear a mask. He’s walking around the neighborhood, seemingly going nowhere. I’m walking around the neighborhood, seemingly going nowhere. No one wants to think about the sirens outside their houses or think about the fact that you don’t know when you might see your family or friends or co-workers ever again. And the other thing is, all of a sudden, we’re like, oh, I feel that way now all the time. But it just becomes this thing where his sadness and his kind of every man dejection is this thing that we can all suddenly relate to in a way, because our lives aren’t really so fabulous anymore.

dodai stewart

Yes, and that’s why, when you see this photo of him wearing this fancy watch, looking kind of good, that it’s very shocking. It’s very strange, because he doesn’t look like the saddest man in the world. He looks like something’s going on. He looks he’s dressed up. He’s wearing a watch. What’s happening?

michael gold

Yeah, I mean, it’s very like, when you see your friend for the first time after the pandemic, and you realize they’ve had this huge glow-up and everything’s changed.

dodai stewart

Yeah.

michael gold

So that’s a big part of it. But the watch is also a big part of it, right? Because it’s like, oh, he’s wearing this watch that we associate with this moment when he was on top of the world. And he looks kind of like he could be on top of the world.

dodai stewart

He has places to be. He needs to know what time it is.

michael gold

Yeah.

archived recording Check out Bennifer having dinner at Nobu in Malibu over the weekend, the pair in all their glory.

dodai stewart

And then, on June 14, the photo drops, and it’s confirming everything. Their lips are touching. It’s a kiss.

michael gold

It’s a kiss. it’s a kiss.

dodai stewart

And there they are, like —

archived recording [CROWD OOHING] Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck making out in public, and we are so here for it.

michael gold

I mean, I lost it. I think we all lost it a little bit.

dodai stewart

I saw a tweet that said it was the 13 most important seconds in cinema. And I was like, yeah.

michael gold

Eat your heart out, Citizen Kane. J. Lo and Ben are kissing again.

dodai stewart

So my thing was that here we have the internet’s saddest man and then the absolute, untouchable reina queen, Jennifer Lopez. It’s like this collision because she is at peak power right now.

michael gold

Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people had this reaction where it was like, him? Because here’s the deal with J. Lo now, right? She has had a second surge in her career in a way that a lot of people don’t get in any of the industry she’s in. Just to run you through the short list of all the things J. Lo has been up to in the last few years —

archived recording (jennifer lopez) It’s like robbing a bank, except you get the keys. Are you in?

michael gold

— “Hustlers.”

dodai stewart

This is the film about dancers who end up scamming the men they’re dancing for.

michael gold

Exactly.

dodai stewart

But she plays an incredible character.

michael gold

Yes, and then —

archived recording The National Football League welcomes you to the Pepsi Super Bowl 54 Halftime Show.

michael gold

— the Super Bowl Halftime Show happens. And this was in 2020. It was probably one of the last big events we had before we all went into lockdown. And notably, in one moment, as sort of a political rebuff, I think, to what was happening in the world, she’s got a bunch of kids in cages at the front of the stage.

archived recording (jennifer lopez) (SINGING) Let’s get —

michael gold

She’s singing her song, “Let’s Get Loud.”

archived recording (jennifer lopez) (SINGING) Let’s get —

michael gold

Which she then bursts into a year later at the inauguration of —

dodai stewart

Oh my gosh.

michael gold

— President Joe Biden.

archived recording (jennifer lopez) (SINGING) Let’s get loud. Because this land was made for you and me.

michael gold

In front of every political leader in America and every TV network, she sings her song, “Let’s Get Loud,” in this moment of like, let’s get loud, America. And it was so weird, but everyone was talking about it. I mean everyone was talking about it. And she’s 51 at this point. And she’s at the Oscars. She’s at the Super Bowl. She’s invited to inauguration. She also launches a beauty line. And she’s a mogul. I mean, she’s got the fragrance line. She’s had clothes lines. This woman is everywhere. She’s doing great.

dodai stewart

Yeah, and Ben is not everywhere doing great on the same level.

michael gold

Ben’s not everywhere. Ben doesn’t seem to be doing great. Ben seems to have had a lot of false starts.

dodai stewart

But the kiss!

michael gold

The kiss.

dodai stewart

I saw it everywhere.

archived recording Interrupting my magical day at Disneyland to let you know that Bennifer has been caught kissing.

michael gold

I mean, they’re in love.

archived recording 1 Nothing confirms a relationship more than making out in front of your niños. archived recording 2 I mean, I’m so here for this.

michael gold

Everyone flipped out. I mean —

dodai stewart

It was everywhere.

michael gold

It was everywhere. And it was like seeing them kiss just seems to have struck at this visceral moment in our core. And you saw think pieces everywhere about J. Lo dating Ben Affleck, various kind of thoughts on their relationship and what does it mean and how long will it last. And people lost it.

dodai stewart

Yeah, so wait. So let’s talk about that, why we can’t look away.

michael gold

Why we care so much.

dodai stewart

Why we care so much. There are other things going on in the world. Why do you think this has taken over our brains?

michael gold

There are a lot of reasons, but I have three theories about this.

dodai stewart

OK.

michael gold

So the first bucket, the first reason, I would say, that people are very into this relationship is nostalgia. We know nostalgia is really powerful. It’s a very powerful motivator. It basically powers the internet. And we have to think about where we were in 2002 when these two got together. A lot of us are kind of coming into more public consciousness. We’re developing our opinions about pop culture.

archived recording My life is really mostly about work right now. I haven’t got it all figured out yet, but I’m trying.

michael gold

She’s in movies. She’s in pop music. And the music is literally everywhere. I mean, Jennifer Lopez shaped the internet. She wore a green Versace dress at the Grammys, and people were so interested in the dress, they kept googling it. And Google thinks —

dodai stewart

Oh, that’s right.

michael gold

Yeah, we need a way to do image search so that when people Google Jennifer Lopez Versace dress, they see the Jennifer Lopez Versace dress.

archived recording Hi, nice to meet you. I have a Golden Globe.

michael gold

Ben Affleck also having a great moment. He’s on the A-list. He’s doing action movies. He’s done some indies. He’s got that credibility. And so they were really central to the pop culture in a time when a lot of us were kind of coming up. And all of a sudden, here comes this huge celebrity “it” couple at this really important moment that sort of defined that era for the 18 months that they were together. Now we’re a little older. We don’t have the centrality to the culture anymore than we used to. It’s Billie Eilish’s turn now. And I think that’s nice. But I think that’s part of it. I just think there’s something very millennial about this. Like, oh, it’s all these years later. But I really care about these people. And there’s something really powerful about accessing that part of yourself that you were back when that happened, and you weren’t so concerned about the virus and the fate of the world and climate change.

dodai stewart

I just want to say that I’m not a millennial. And I do think that part of the reason that everyone can glom onto this is because they are crossgenerational.

michael gold

That’s fair. I mean, she’s been around.

dodai stewart

There are very few people that your grandma knows, your niece knows, your coworkers know. She, for sure, is one of those people where you can be seven, you could be 77, and you know J. Lo.

michael gold

I think some of it speaks to her longevity, too, right?

dodai stewart

Yeah.

michael gold

Because she’s continued to be around and on such big public stages. Gen Z knows who she is, too.

dodai stewart

Yeah, well, she’s on “American Idol,” yeah, and “Hustlers,” yeah.

michael gold

The other thing I will say is, they’re weaponizing nostalgia a little bit, I think.

dodai stewart

What makes you say that?

michael gold

J. Lo is master of imagery. She knows how to control her image. She knows what she’s putting out into the universe. She’s very good at Instagram. And there’s a paparazzi photo of the two of them on a yacht —

dodai stewart

Oh my gosh.

michael gold

— at the end of July, I think. And it’s almost perfectly recreating an iconic shot from the “Jenny From the Block” music video.

dodai stewart

Yes.

michael gold

This was a song off of her 2002 album. And it’s like shot for shot. She’s wearing a pink bikini. She’s lying on the yacht. He’s touching her rear. And it’s just everything is perfect to the point where we’re all kind of sitting here like, oh, these two people have to know what they’re doing. They’ve been in the public eye for 20 years. Something is going on here.

dodai stewart

Right. OK, so let’s go to your second bucket, which is relatability.

michael gold

Relatability. All right, Dodai, I’m going to level with you.

dodai stewart

OK.

michael gold

So here’s the thing.

dodai stewart

I’m ready.

michael gold

The last year and a half has not been great.

dodai stewart

I feel that so much. It’s been rough.

michael gold

And we’ve had a lot of time to sit and think and look at Instagram and look at Twitter and look at Facebook, and then look at Instagram again. Everyone has that one ex that you wonder if I met them now and we were the people we were today, would it work? J. Lo and Ben Affleck, they were like, let’s see. Let’s find out. I think the other thing is that relationships have changed so much in the past year or so. I think people are rethinking their priorities. They’re rethinking how they approach finding a partner, how they structure their relationships. So we’re in this moment where everyone’s kind of reconsidering their relationships. She goes through a post-pandemic breakup. And Jennifer Lopez and A-Rod are no more. And then the world starts to open up. And she makes a decision that I feel like not all of us would make. Not everyone is going to go back to the ex from 2002. But all of us are also kind of like, oh, yeah, but we’ve sent that text. We’ve sent someone a TikTok that we thought was funny and said, thinking of you, even if we weren’t thinking of them, just to see what would happen.

dodai stewart

I agree that for me, what’s relatable is, hey, you know what? Anything could happen.

michael gold

It’s hot vax summer.

dodai stewart

That’s right.

michael gold

OK, so here’s the third thing. It’s hope.

dodai stewart

Let’s talk about hope.

michael gold

Remember earlier, when I was talking about how we all saw Ben Affleck, and we thought, this is us. This is me. I am going to get on my fitness routine during this pandemic so that when the paparazzi catches me dropping iced coffees, some New York Times reporter says, “But his arms look good, though.” I am not perfect, but I’m trying. If Jennifer Lopez, the queen princess of pop culture, who, more or less, seems perfect — she seems flawless. I know there are criticisms, but she seems pretty flawless as far as celebrities go. If she sees value in this man, that means there is value in all of us.

dodai stewart

It’s like, I, too, can be pulled out of a dark moment where I was spilling coffee all over myself and have a moment in the sun on a yacht. There is hope. And they are living avatars for scenarios that we can see for each other, where you’re like, after all this despair, something good can happen.

michael gold

Yeah. And I think also, I mean, a little part of this, too, is that something good can happen to someone. Later in life, these —

dodai stewart

True.

michael gold

— are two people who are 48 and 52. And they found each other again. And they reconnected. And they look genuinely happy. And relationships are hard. I won’t say how long this lasts, but at least for a moment, they have this nice thing. And that means that in the future, we can have nice things.

dodai stewart

[LAUGHS] OK, so there are moments, and it’s happening now. But there might be another lockdown. There might be another variant. The summer’s fleeting. Summer ends.

michael gold

Not trying to hear that, but OK, great.

dodai stewart

If we are living through them, we’ve been transformed. We took something that was in the gutter with coffee spilled all over it and is now in the yacht, in the sunshine. If that dissolves, if they break up, are we going to be OK?

No, I don’t think we’re going to be OK. I think it’s going to be really — I think people are going to take it really personally I think, because I think we’ve all invested in the narrative around that as there’s hope for us. We can restore ourselves. We can better ourselves. We can show the person who thought we weren’t good enough that we have changed and that we are ready and that this is the time for us. And we can step into the sun. And if they break up, I think a lot of people are going to be devastated because it will say if these two people who have every advantage going for them can’t make this thing work, well, what hope do I have? I think it’s going to be really hard.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For much of this summer, Dylan Fogarty, 28, the director of academic partnerships for an education start-up, has been having a blast in Fire Island Pines: hosting pool parties at his four-bedroom house, making new friends at the Low Tea bar, and dancing at the Pavilion club till dawn to pop songs by Lady Gaga and Dua Lipa.

But when he got off the ferry two weeks ago, he saw something he hadn’t seen for almost two months: a coronavirus testing site.

That wasn’t the only thing that changed. Some people were wearing masks on the boardwalk again, hosts were asking guests if they had been vaccinated, and the bouncers at clubs and bars were once again screening for vaccination cards at the door.

“It’s because of the Delta variant,” Mr. Fogarty said. “All it takes is for one person in one room, and it spreads. I am always happy to show my proof of vaccination, and I’m glad a lot of places did it last weekend.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Once your innermost circle has heard the news, you can send a marriage announcement, either digitally or via snail mail, to your wider network using photography from the elopement. Then, spread the word on social media if desired.

Explain Your Reasoning

Expect that family might ask why you chose to elope, especially if the decision seemed out of character. Whether motivated by pandemic safety or the realization that a big ceremony no longer suits your tastes, clearly and calmly express why you went the route of elopement. Explain the context of your elopement — the limits on gathering, budgetary concerns, or not wanting to delay starting a family — to put the decision into perspective.

“Be proud of your decision and share it proudly,” said Lizzie Post, a president of the Emily Post Institute and an author of “Emily Post’s Wedding Etiquette” (sixth edition). “I think that can have a really good impact on the people around you.”

Be sure to underscore the fact that this was a decision made by both partners to avoid making your spouse the family scapegoat. “When something goes astray, the person who’s new gets blamed,” Dr. Sherman said.

But be Prepared for Fallout

Weddings can cause familial turmoil under normal circumstances. But in the event of an elopement, those left out from the event may feel slighted. Instead of apologizing for eloping, acknowledge the hurt your relative is experiencing, Dr. Sherman said. Have compassion for your loved ones and give them the time and space to sort through their emotions, however they react.

“At the end of the day, if that family member is really brooding and upset, the couple has to relinquish the need to make them feel better,” said Sojourner Auguste, a New York City-based wedding planner. “If they’re spending so much energy on trying to make that person feel better, they’re missing out on being a newlywed.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marissa Meizz, 23, was out to dinner with a friend in the East Village in mid-May when her phone started buzzing. She tried to silence it, but the texts kept coming. They all wanted to know: Had she seen the TikTok video?

She clicked the link and a young man appeared onscreen. “If your name’s Marissa,” he said, “please listen up.” He said he had just overheard some of her friends say they were deliberately choosing to hold a birthday party when she was out of town that weekend. “You need to know,” he said. “TikTok, help me find Marissa.”

Ms. Meizz’s heart sank. After getting in touch with the man who posted the video, which amassed more than 14 million views, she confirmed that she was the Marissa in question and that it was her friends who had conspired to exclude her from their party.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Una mañana, cuando nuestro hijo tenía cuatro meses, mi marido notó una pequeña mancha roja en el labio del niño. Como cualquier padre mal dormido, mi marido fue a su computadora y buscó en Google “mancha roja en el labio del bebé”. Veinte minutos después, volvió con la cara pálida e hiperventilando; incluso tuvo que meter la cabeza entre las rodillas para no desmayarse. Se había metido en un oscuro agujero de internet y había encontrado la historia de un bebé con una mancha roja en el labio que acabó trágicamente enfermo.

La mancha de nuestro bebé se desvaneció en cuestión de horas. Pero fue, de hecho, la primera señal de algo aterrador: el trastorno de ansiedad de mi marido.

La noche que conocí a Mike, me cautivó en un concurso de preguntas de un pub de Seattle con sus conocimientos enciclopédicos. Yo soy pésima en ese tipo de juegos, pero de pronto supe que quería saberlo todo sobre ese informático de 25 años que sonreía con facilidad y compartía mi afición por inventarse letras tontas de canciones pop. A menudo perdía cosas y tenía el refrigerador lleno de comida caducada, pero era fiable en lo que importaba: tratar a la gente con amabilidad, decir la verdad, presentarse.

Me acompañó con entusiasmo a festivales de música, a pueblos remotos de Sudamérica y a mi programa de posgrado en París.
