Vietnam’s four-member team has bagged three gold and one silver medals at the 53rd International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO 2021), according to the Ministry of Education and Training.

All the winners are 12th graders, who attended the IChO 2021 held virtually by Japan from July 25 to August 2 with the participation of 79 countries and territories.

The three gold medalists include Nguyen Le Thao Anh and Nguyen Duy Anh of the Hanoi - Amsterdam High School for the Gifted, and Pham Duc Nam Phuong from Nguyen Trai High School for the Gifted in Hai Duong Province.

The silver medal went to Nguyen Hoang Duong of the Hanoi University of Science’s High School for Gifted Students under the Vietnam National University-Hanoi.

The Vietnamese chemistry team competed online at the Hanoi National University of Education under the direct supervision of the organizers from Japan.

Last month, Vietnamese students won three gold and two silver medals at the 2021 International Physics Olympiad.

The same month also saw the Vietnamese teams grab one gold, two silver and three bronze medals at the 2021 International Mathematical Olympiad, and one gold, two silvers and one bronze at the 2021 International Biology Olympiad.

Overall, 37 Vietnamese students have been honored at this year’s Olympiads, including 12 gold, 13 silver and 10 bronze medals, along with two certificates of merit.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many owners of private kindergartens in Vietnam have been trying to sell their schools after they ran out of money to maintain their operations following a prolonged shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A Facebook group has even been established to facilitate the sale of private kindergartens in many localities.

A user named N.C. stated in his post that he wanted to transfer the ownership of a preschool in southern Binh Duong Province due to the pandemic.

“The venue was licensed in August 2020," C. elaborated.

"About 30 students were learning at the school prior to the outbreak, with monthly tuition at VND2 million [US$87].”

Another Facebook account named Ngoc Linh said she had managed to survive the previous three waves, but can no longer maintain the operation of her kindergarten due to the current round.

Linh stated that the school was officially open in October 2019, adding that she has spent over VND1.5 billion ($65,300) on it so far.

She also offers to liquidate all equipment and tools inside the office, classrooms, and playground, along with air conditioning and CCTV systems at cheap prices.

Similar to Linh, N.T.H.P., who owns a preschool in Ho Chi Minh City, said she has been paying rental fees over the past months even though the venue was closed due to COVID-19.

“I don’t know when the kids are able to come back," P. said.

"I have no other choice but to sell my school.”

N.T.U., who runs a network of seven kindergartens in several districts in Ho Chi Minh City, considered herself among the luckier as she is still able to keep her facilities.

“A lot of my peers have run out of money to maintain the operations of their schools,” U. elaborated.

“One of them told me he had to spend up to VND200 million [$8,700] covering monthly rental fees, teachers’ salary and insurance, as well as interest on his bank loan.”

After failing to sell the school, he eventually gave up and let the landlord take all equipment to pay his debt, U. stated.

Vietnam is struggling with the fourth and worst COVID-19 outbreak, with 170,563 local infections recorded in 62 provinces and cities since April 27.

Social distancing measures have been implemented across the nation, while students are required to stay home as part of pandemic prevention and control efforts.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Go Vap District Medical Center in Ho Chi Minh City has recently brought a cohort of mental health specialists to its COVID-19 isolation ward in order to provide relief for the pressured coronavirus patients.

The mental health experts will provide advice and address the perturbation that over 400 COVID-19 patients are facing as they fight off the disease with no friends or family members around.

Doctor Nguyen Trung Hoa, director of Go Vap District Medical Center, said the support of mental health professionals is needed as the mental burden on COVID-19 inpatients is immensely high.

Acknowledging the issue, the institution has formed a cohort consisting of top mental health doctors and experts, who will enter the isolation ward to provide informed advice to patients.

“Most COVID-19 patients look forward to having their issues and questions addressed,” Hoa said.

“After a physician performs their daily check-ups on the patients, a mental health expert will visit them to provide consultation and ease their mental burden.

“The consultation is proving beneficial to patients' mental wellness.”

According to Hoa, the majority of COVID-19 transmission cases fall into episodes of anxiety, panic, and insecurity when they are brought to the isolation ward.

This leads to several undesirable reactions, including self-imposed seclusion, which worsen their mental health and even physical state, proving specifically detrimental to elder patients with pre-existing conditions.

Seeing the extent of the issue, the mental health cohort has offered in-person consultation, as well as live sessions via phone calls to share the burden with medical staffers in the isolation ward.

“Many patients have shown good mental health recovery after these consultations, which helped them proceed with their COVID-19 treatment and cooperate better with practitioners,” Hoa reported.

Ho Chi Minh City has emerged as Vietnam’s gravest outbreak site, recording 100,557 cases out of the country’s total of 161,482 domestic infections since the fourth wave began on April 27.

The situation prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home.

Nationwide, the total number of patients has so far reached 165,339 cases, including 46,965 recoveries and 1,881 deaths, according to the Health Ministry’s data.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PARIS -- Lionel Messi joined star-packed Paris St Germain on Tuesday after leaving Barcelona, the club where he had begun and expected to end his career.

Messi, a six-times winner of the Ballon d'Or for Europe's best soccer player, signed a two-year contract with an option for a third year, the club said in a statement on its website.

The move will add the Argentine, one of the best players of his generation, to an already formidable PSG attack that includes Brazil's Neymar and French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe.

"I am excited to begin a new chapter of my career at Paris Saint-Germain," PSG quoted Messi as saying. "I am determined to help build something special for the club and the fans, and I am looking forward to stepping out onto the pitch at the Parc des Princes."

The arrival of Barcelona's record scorer, with 672 goals, will boost Qatari-owned PSG's ambitions to win the prestigious, and lucrative, European Champions League for the first time.

"He has made no secret of his desire to continue competing at the very highest level and winning trophies, and naturally our ambition as a club is to do the same," PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said.

PSG wasted little time in targeting Messi after the heavily indebted Catalan club made clear it could not afford to keep him because of La Liga's financial fair play rules.

Crowds of supporters thronged to the club's Parc des Princes stadium, chanting and setting off smoke flares.

"It's going to be mad. There's a legend arriving, after all," said supporter Florent Chauveau.

Messi arrived in Paris on a private jet earlier in the day with his wife and three children, waving to hundreds of supporters gathered outside the airport before being whisked to a private hospital for a medical. He later waved to dozens of fans who had assembled beneath the balcony of his hotel room.

From tears to smiles

Only two days ago, Messi had wept as he bade farewell to his boyhood team, describing his feelings at being told he had to leave as like having "a bucket of cold water poured over me".

However, he said he wanted to carry on competing and that he still harboured ambitions to win another Champions League trophy - one that his new club has never won, despite Qatar Sports Investment's lavish spending.

Neymar and Mbappe were already the two most expensive soccer players in history, and the addition of Messi to Mauricio Pochettino's PSG line-up could rival the unstoppable triumvirate that he formed at Barcelona with Neymar and Luis Suarez.

Messi will wear the number 30 shirt, the club confirmed in a video posted on its Twitter feed, headlined "a new diamond in Paris".

Messi, who won four Champions Leagues and 10 domestic league titles with Barcelona, joins several other big names arriving at PSG on a free transfer this summer.

Spain defender Sergio Ramos was no longer wanted at Real Madrid, Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum had run down his contract with Liverpool and Italy's Euro 2020-winning goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma also joined after his contract with AC Milan ran out.

The arrival of Messi, whose last contract with Barcelona was worth a total of 555 million euros ($650 million) and reported to be the most lucrative in world sport, is also set to provoke a renewed new debate about UEFA's financial fair play rules.

Soccer's European governing body introduced the rules in 2009 in an attempt to restrict the power of free-spending owners to buy success, but their success is debatable.

The star-power of Messi, who has 245 million followers on Instagram, will be welcome news for Ligue 1 as a battle rages between broadcasters over the price of its television rights, crucial to the finances of the clubs.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lionel Messi wept on Sunday as he bade farewell to his boyhood team FC Barcelona and confirmed he was talking with French club Paris St Germain over a possible move.

The 34-year-old Argentine's emotional news conference followed Barca's announcement last week that it could no longer afford him after a glittering two decades.

French newspaper L'Equipe reported on Sunday that he will travel to Paris either Sunday or Monday to undertake a medical and finalise a deal with the Qatar Sports Investment-owned club.

Spanish newspaper Marca reported PSG formally sent their offer to Messi on Sunday morning, just as the Argentine held the news conference.

While Messi did not confirm he would definitely join the Parisians, he said his plans were to carry on playing as long as possible, adding he still harbours ambitions to win another Champions League trophy.

"As long as I go on being competitive and as long as my body responds (I'll carry on playing)," he told a news conference.

"As long as I can, I will carry on competing."

PSG declined to comment on the report that Messi would be arriving in Paris later on Sunday. "We are not in a position to confirm anything," a club spokesman said.

"I tried to behave with humility and respect and I hope that is what remains of me when I leave the club," said an emotional Messi as hundreds of fans, many wearing his No. 10 jersey, massed outside Barca's Camp Nou stadium to bid farewell to the player they called Messiah.

Messi broke down as he walked onto the stage before conducting his news conference and was handed a tissue by his wife Antonella Roccuzzo as he fought back the tears.

"This is the toughest moment of my career. When the club told me, I just froze. This is all like a bucket of cold water has been poured over me and we are still coming to terms with it," he sobbed.

"When I get home, I'm sure it'll be even worse. But I'll be surrounded by my loved ones and I'll carry on playing football, and when I do so, I'm sure it'll become a bit easier."

Financial issues

It had been widely reported by local media that Messi was set to stay at Camp Nou, with the player admitting he had agreed to a five-year deal involving a 50% pay-cut.

Barca, whose debts total way over 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion), were unable to make the deal work within the frameworks of La Liga's financial fair play regulations - prompting their surprise u-turn announcement last Thursday.

"Honestly, when the elections happened (in March), I spoke with (Barca president Joan) Laporta, we had dinner and after that I was convinced I would be staying," Messi said.

"My contract was never the issue ... What I know is that I did everything I could. The club say it could not happen because of La Liga. I can guarantee you that I did everything I could to stay. Last year I didn't want to and I said that, but this year it was different."

La Liga announced last Wednesday that it had secured a private equity injection of 2.7 billion euros from firm CVC, with the funds to be shared amongst the clubs in return for a 10% of the league's revenue.

It had been believed this would allow Barcelona to get the Messi deal over the line, however after Real Madrid rejected the proposal and said they would take legal action against La Liga, Barca also came out against it.

Laporta told a news conference on Friday that Barca's finances were in worse shape than he had thought after conducting an audit.

He added the league informed him that accepting this injection was the only way they would approve a new contract for Messi, but rejected that saying he had to put the long-term interests of the club above any player.

Marca also reported on Sunday that Barca fans had hired a French lawyer, who had lodged a case with the Paris Appeals Court to try and block Messi's move to PSG.

Record breaker

Messi, Barca's all-time record goalscorer with 682 in 21 years, received a lengthy standing ovation from the media, current and former team mates and coaches in attendance.

It was noticeable that he was not accompanied by Laporta or any of the other Barcelona directors.

All 35 trophies he won during his time at the club were laid out for what the club described would be a private photo session after the news conference.

Barcelona face Juventus in a pre-season friendly on Sunday, with nobody given Messi's No.10 shirt for the game.

The club have not confirmed if they plan on leaving it vacant for the new season.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Giant pumps whir deep underground at a plant in Singapore that helps transform sewage into water so clean it is fit for human consumption while reducing ocean pollution.

The tiny island nation has little in the way of natural water sources and has long had to rely principally on supplies from neighbouring Malaysia.

To boost self-sufficiency, the government has developed an advanced system for treating sewage involving a network of tunnels and high-tech plants.

Recycled wastewater can now meet 40 percent of Singapore's water demand -- a figure that is expected to rise to 55 percent by 2060, according to the country's water agency.

While most is used for industrial purposes, some of it is added to drinking water supplies in reservoirs in the city-state of 5.7 million people.

And the system helps reduce maritime pollution, as only a small amount of the treated water is discharged into the sea.

This is a contrast to most other countries -- 80 percent of the world's wastewater flows back into the ecosystem without being treated or reused, according to UN estimates.

"Singapore lacks natural resources and it is limited in space, which is why we are always looking for ways to explore water sources and stretch our water supply," Low Pei Chin, chief engineer of the Public Utilities Board's water reclamation department, told AFP.

One key strategy is to "collect every drop" and "reuse endlessly", she added.

This is in addition to the city-state's other main approaches to securing water supplies -- importing it, using reservoirs and desalinating seawater.

At the heart of the recycling system is the high-tech Changi Water Reclamation Plant on the city's eastern coast.

Parts of the facility in land-scarce Singapore are underground -- some as deep as 25 stories -- and it is fed by wastewater that flows through a massive, 48-kilometre (30-mile) tunnel, linked to sewers.

The site houses a maze of steel pipes, tubes, tanks, filtration systems and other machinery, and can treat up to 900 million litres (237 million US gallons) of wastewater a day -- enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool every 24 hours for a year.

In one building, a network of ventilators have been installed to keep the air smelling fresh, although a putrid whiff still hangs in the air.

'Limited amount of water'

Sewage that arrives at the plant undergoes an initial filtering process before powerful pumps send it flowing to facilities above ground for further treatment.

There, the treated water is further cleansed, with impurities like bacteria and viruses removed through advanced filtration processes, and disinfected with ultraviolet rays.

The end product, dubbed "NEWater", is mainly used in microchip manufacturing plants -- which are ubiquitous in the city-state and require high-quality water -- and for cooling systems in buildings.

But it also helps boost drinking water supplies. During the dry season, it is sent to top up several man-made reservoirs and, following further treatment, flows to people's taps.

Singapore is expanding its recycling system.

It will add an extra underground tunnel and a major water reclamation plant to serve the western half of the island, which should be completed by 2025.

Singapore will have spent Sg$10 billion (US$7.4 billion) on upgrading its water treatment infrastructure by the time the expansion is finished.

One impetus to seek greater self-sufficiency are the city-state's historically fractious relations with key water source, Malaysia.

The neighbours have had stormy ties since Malaysia ejected Singapore from a short-lived union in 1965, and they have in the past had rows over water supplies.

Stefan Wuertz, a professor of environmental engineering at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, stressed the importance for other countries to treat wastewater more effectively, warning of serious long-term impacts otherwise.

"There is a limited amount of water on the planet," he told AFP.

"If we were to keep polluting the freshwater, at some stage we would reach the point where... treatment becomes extremely expensive."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SEOUL -- South Korea reported more than 2,200 new daily COVID-19 cases, a record since the pandemic began last January, Health Minister Kwon Deok-cheol said on Wednesday, as the country grapples with its worst COVID-19 outbreak to date.

Despite having tough distancing measures in place for over a month, infections have spiked due to the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant and a rise in domestic travel over summer, Kwon told a COVID response meeting.

He also noted a rise in so-called "silent spreaders" within communities such as workplaces, indoor gyms, churches and nursing homes, leading to an increase in infections of unknown origin.

South Korea has been struggling since July to tame sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19 that were at first centred largely on metropolitan Seoul but have since spread nationwide.

Nearly half of new cases detected recently have been found outside Seoul and in summer holiday spots, while authorities are concerned many people are ignoring social distancing rules.

Kwon strongly urged people who return from holidays to voluntarily get tested before going back to work.

The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 2,223 new coronavirus cases for Tuesday, bringing the country's coronavirus infections to 216,206, with 2,135 deaths.

Only 15.7% of South Korea's 52 million people have been fully vaccinated, while 42.1% have received at least one dose of vaccine. The government's target is for 70% to have received at least one shot by September.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police in the northern Vietnamese province of Bac Giang have captured a man who allegedly stabbed to death his elderly neighbor and seriously injured the victim’s wife over a noise conflict.

A police official in Yen Dung District, Bac Giang Province confirmed to Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper on Wednesday morning that officers had arrested 53-year-old Nguyen Huu Phu.

Phu is the prime suspect in the murder of his neighbor – 74-year-old Nguyen Viet Chung.

Preliminary information showed that Phu broke into the yard of Chung’s house at 1:15 am on Monday and started shouting.

As Chung opened the door, Phu attacked him with a knife, killing the victim on the spot.

The man then headed into the house and assaulted Chung’s wife – 70-year-old Phan Thi Sau – with the same weapon.

Sau was severely injured and was later admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment.

Phu ran away after the incident and was arrested at 9:40 pm on Tuesday when he was hiding at a location about three kilometers from the murder scene.

The suspect did not resist when he was captured by officers.

At the police station, Phu admitted to committing the crime over a conflict with the victims.

Phu said he got irritated by the noise that Chung often made when he opened or closed the gate of his house.

Further investigation is ongoing.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hanoi chairman Chu Ngoc Anh on Tuesday approved a plan to carry out a massive COVID-19 testing drive until August 17 with a target to collect 1.3 million samples.

Although authorities have enforced social distancing measures since July 24, Anh said, the pandemic situation in the capital has remained complicated as the number of daily new cases averages from 60 to 80, with the sources of infection at many clusters staying unknown.

Anh requested functional forces to take advantage of all resources to conduct a large-scale COVID-19 testing program during the extended social distancing period, in combination with testing cases discovered by contact tracing, to completely isolate infections from the community.

“[We must] mobilize all resources to implement this large-scale testing plan throughout the city, ensuring the correct test assignment in areas at risk and to the right target groups, along with expanding the testing drive to representatives of households,” Anh said.

The chairman requested the units to ensure absolute safety and appropriate distance during the implementation to avoid cross infections.

The authorities will assess the risk in each area by categorizing them into three types.

The red type includes areas in very high-risk and high-risk communes and wards, high-risk cases with high mobility and high exposure such as workers in supply chains and markets and pandemic prevention workers, as well as other areas according to epidemiological expertise.

The orange type consists of factories, enterprises, production facilities, agencies, markets, supermarkets, hospitals, medical examination and treatment establishments, areas located in at-risk zones as prescribed by the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, and other areas according to epidemiological expertise.

The green type covers cases with little movement in infection-free areas.

Regarding testing representatives of households in high-risk districts, a representative sample will be taken from the most at-risk member.

At the same time, the organization of testing for COVID-19 patients, their direct contacts, arrivals and returnees from virus-hit areas, and other subjects must be carried out regularly according to regulations.

Medical forces will use both real-time RT-PCR testing and rapid test kits.

The Ministry of Health on Wednesday morning confirmed 4,802 new COVID-19 infections, including 2,128 cases in Ho Chi Minh City, taking the national tally to 232,937 patients, with 80,348 recoveries and 4,145 deaths.

Since April 27, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi have accounted for 131,879 and 2,143 infections, respectively, out of the country’s total of 228,990 cases.

The NanoDragon satellite (NDG), a nano-layer cubesat satellite which weighs about four kilograms and is the size of three rack units (U), was developed by the Vietnam National Space Center (VNSC) under the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology.

NanoDragon is expected to be launched into orbit in September, marking the tenth anniversary of the VNSC.

The satellite is the product of a project to create a nano-scale satellite under the national space technology program during the 2016-20 period.

The process of researching, designing, integrating, and testing the satellite's functions was undertaken completely in Vietnam by VNSC researchers.

In addition, the whole mechanical structure and source distribution circuit for the satellite were produced in the Southeast Asian country.

The NDG completed an environmental testing phase which simulated the launch and space environments at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan from March 9 to April 9, according to Assoc. Prof. Dr. Pham Anh Tuan, director of the VNSC.

A ground station to operate the satellite after launch was designed and constructed at the VNSC headquarters at Hoa Lac Hi-Tech Park in Hanoi.

NanoDragon will have two main tasks, namely the monitoring of marine vehicles with an automatic identification system and the use of an optical imaging device to verify the quality of the satellite's position controller when operating in orbit.

The NDG is expected to operate in a solar synchronous orbit at an altitude of about 560 kilometers, according to the VNSC.

Before NanoDragon, the VNSC also successfully built the PicoDragon supermicro satellite, which weighs one kilogram and was launched into orbit and obtained signals in 2013.

After that, the 50-kilogram MicroDragon satellite, which was manufactured by a group of 36 staff members of the VNSC under the guidance of Japanese experts, was launched into orbit in January 2019 and sent photos to the ground station in Japan.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SYDNEY -- Three Australian publishers of lifestyle content say Facebook Inc used their articles on its just-launched news service after refusing to negotiate licensing deals, and that the country's tough new internet law has failed to protect them.

Australia this year passed a law that pressured Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google to sign deals with some of the country's biggest news companies by threatening government intervention.

The dispute highlights possible shortcomings in the controversial law. While most of Australia's main media firms have signed deals, some smaller outlets say the law has not stopped their content generating clicks and advertising revenue for Facebook without compensation.

Broadsheet Media, Urban List and Concrete Playground, websites which publish entertainment news, reviews and listings, say that after the law was passed in February they approached the social media giant about payment for their content.

Facebook knocked them back, calling their content unsuitable for its Facebook News platform and recommending they apply for grants it was offering from a A$15 million ($11 million) fund for Australian regional and digital newsrooms, the three companies told Reuters in a joint call.

"They told me that, 'oh well, you're not going to be included in News tab and that's what we're paying for'," said Nick Shelton, founder of Broadsheet Media.

"To our surprise, we woke one morning last week and all of our content was there."

Facebook News went live in Australia on Aug. 4.

Facebook declined to comment directly on the three companies but said it created value for publishers by sending viewers to their sites.

Under the law, Facebook and Google must negotiate payment deals with outlets or a government-appointed arbitrator will do it for them, but a publisher must first prove its primary purpose is producing news and that it has been unfairly disqualified.

The three publishers said they want Facebook to come to the table to talk but if it declined they may seek government intervention.

"If at the end of the day we don't get included in a commercial agreement, then absolutely they need a stick," said Shelton. "We are three prime examples of publishers and media businesses which should be included as part of this framework."

To be covered by the law, publishers must register as a news provider with the Australian Communications and Media Authority "based on criteria including the levels of 'core news' (essentially public interest journalism) that they produce", the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which drafted the law, said in an email.

Urban List has registered on the list. Broadsheet and Concrete Playground have yet to register, saying they want to hold out for a private deal.

Tama Leaver, a professor of internet studies at Australia's Curtin University, said that while Facebook had not broken the law as the matter was not yet before arbitration, its apparent treatment of the three publishers was "extremely poor practice, disingenuous and further disadvantages the smaller players in the news business arena".

In a separate dispute, the ACCC has said it would look into a claim by The Conversation, which publishes current affairs commentary by academics, that Facebook has refused to negotiate a licensing deal. The Conversation has secured a deal with Google.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.

Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar teamed up with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. It would also prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system.

"I found this predatory abuse of Apple and Google so deeply offensive on so many levels," Blumenthal said in an interview Wednesday. "Their power has reached a point where they are impacting the whole economy in stifling and strangling innovation."

Blumenthal said he expected companion legislation in the House of Representatives "very soon."

The stakes are high for Apple, whose App Store anchors its $53.8 billion services business as the smartphone market has matured.

Apple said its app store was "an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation, one that now supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states."

Google declined to comment, but a spokeswoman cited previous company statements that Android devices often come preloaded with two or more app stores and that app sellers can allow downloads without using Google's Play Store.

The bill won praise from Spotify, Epic and Tile. Tile, which makes tags to find lost objects, complained earlier this year about Apple launching a rival product.

A similar law revision has been introduced in South Korea. Google said last year it would enforce certain in-app payment methods there and receive 30% commission fees from non-game digital content.

Apple's control over apps on its Store, and 15% to 30% commissions on digital sales have come under regulatory scrutiny. A federal judge is reviewing testimony to rule on an antitrust lawsuit by "Fortnite" creator Epic Games.

Epic also sued Google for its app store practices, as have a big group of state attorneys general alleging that it unlawfully worked to maintain a monopoly for its app store for Android phones.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Six people, including a child, were killed in a mass shooting in the city of Plymouth in southwest England on Thursday evening, in an incident described by the British Home Secretary as "shocking".

Two females and three males, including the suspect, died from gunshot wounds at the scene of the incident, the Devon and Cornwall Police said in a statement. Another female died a short time later in hospital, the police added.

One of the people killed was a child under 10 years old, Luke Pollard, a local lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said in a tweet.

Police had earlier described the shooting as a "serious firearms incident" and said the situation was contained. The police added that the incident was not related to terrorism.

The United Kingdom has one of the lowest gun homicide rates in the world, and mass shootings are rare. This was the first mass shooting in the country for 11 years.

Sharron Turner, 57, who lives behind the scene of the shooting, was quoted by The Times newspaper as saying that a gunman had "kicked in" the front door of a semi-detached house before shooting a mother and her daughter. Turner said she had been told that the man, who was dressed in black and grey, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon.

After the attack, the gunman escaped through a park behind the house and shot two dog walkers, The Times reported.

"The incident in Plymouth is shocking and my thoughts are with those affected," Home Secretary Priti Patel said on Twitter.

Devon and Cornwall Police said they were called to the Keyham area of the city at 6.10 p.m. on Thursday.

"Investigations are continuing into the incident and disruption to the road network in the Keyham area will remain throughout the night," the police said.

The South Western Ambulance Service earlier said it had responded to the incident with a significant number of resources, including Hazardous Area Response Teams (HART), multiple ambulances, air ambulances, multiple doctors and senior paramedics.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Five cities in the central Chinese province of Hubei have declared "red alerts" after torrential rain left 21 people dead and forced the evacuation of nearly 6,000 people, state media reported.

The deaths were recorded in the township of Liulin, part of the city of Suizhou in the north of the province.

More than 2,700 houses and shops suffered flood damage and power, transportation and communications were also disrupted, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

Rescue crews have been dispatched to the worst affected areas, including the cities of Suizhou, Xiangyang and Xiaogan, China's Ministry of Emergency Management said.

The city of Yicheng also saw a record 400 millimetres of rain on Thursday.

According to the official China News Service, as many as 774 reservoirs in Hubei had exceeded their flood warning levels by Thursday evening.

Extreme weather in the province has caused widespread power cuts and has damaged more than 3,600 houses and 8,110 hectares of crops.

Total losses were estimated at 108 million yuan ($16.67 million), the official China Daily said on Friday, citing the province's emergency management bureau.

China regularly experiences flooding during its wet summer months, but authorities have warned that extreme weather is now becoming more frequent as a result of climate change.

Around 80,000 were evacuated in the southwestern province of Sichuan last weekend and record rainfall in Henan last month caused floods that killed more than 300 people.

The China Meteorological Administration warned that heavy rainstorms were likely to continue until next week, with regions along the Yangtze river vulnerable to flooding.

State weather forecasters also issued a geological disaster warning late on Thursday, saying areas at risk include the central provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan and Anhui, Chongqing, Sichuan and Guizhou in the southwest as well as Zhejiang on the eastern coast.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@E-commerce giant Shopee has officially announced the rebranding of food delivery service Now in Vietnam to ShopeeFood from August 18.

Now is a food delivery platform run by local tech firm Foody Corporation, 82 percent of whose shares were acquired by Singapore-based Internet company Sea Group in 2017.

According to the firm, the change of name will help it unify the brands in its ecosystem that includes e-commerce platform Shopee and e-wallet ShopeePay, which was renamed from AirPay in June, in order to enhance customer experience.

Following the rebranding, all existing rights of users and partners will remain the same, the company stated.

Users will only need to update their Now app to access the revamped services while account information, balance, and related benefits will not be affected.

In addition to food delivery app Now, the NowShip service will be renamed ShopeeExpress Instant.

Other food delivery brands operating in Vietnam include GrabFood powered by tech unicorn Grab, GoFood by Gojek, Baemin backed by South Korean unicorn Woowa Brothers, and homegrown Loship.

According to online statistics portal Statista, revenue from online food delivery in Vietnam stood at US$302 million in 2020 and is estimated to reach $557 million in 2024.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A charity initiative administered 700 care packages on the weekend to workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Binh Tan District, as well as Lao and Cambodian students in the Pre-University College of Ho Chi Minh City.

The initiative was undertaken by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, supermarket chain Saigon Co.op, and e-commerce platform Shopee, with support from the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.

The organizers prepared essentials, including rice, cooking oil, and fish sauce, and divided them into thousands of gift packages, each of which was priced at VND145,000 (US$6.3) on Shopee.

The packages were delivered on Saturday directly to the beneficiaries, including 500 workers who are struggling financially in Binh Tan District, 200 Lao and Cambodian students and those of Vietnam's ethnic minorities at the Pre-University College in District 5.

Among the recipients was Tran Ngoc Sang, a manufacturing worker in Binh Tan District who hails from Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta.

“I feel blessed to receive these essential items, which will help ease the burden on my family during social distancing,” said the sole breadwinner for the family of seven.

Other demographics, including youths in locked-down areas of Hoc Mon District, as well as unofficial workers in Cat Lai Ward of Thu Duc City, also received the care packages of the initiative.

After the first run on Saturday and Sunday, the organizers plan to hand another 2,500 packages to struggling people in cordoned-off areas in Ho Chi Minh City on July 22 and 25.

They are currently accepting donations on Shopee and ShopeePay.

In June and early July, many working-class residents in Ho Chi Minh City suffered from lay-offs or reduced income as the southern metropolis emerged as Vietnam’s coronavirus epicenter, with its caseload rising in the thousands daily.

The alarming situation has prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home, effectively cutting off the livelihoods of many unofficial workers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In his ongoing sketch project, Ho Chi Minh City-based artist Le Sa Long strives to portray the small acts of generosity among residents, a virtue that has once again been highlighted during the tough time of social distancing in the southern city.

An established painter in the domestic art scene who has multiple solo exhibitions and awards under his belt, Long picked up urban sketching as a habit in mid-May.

He wandered the city which he has called home for over 30 years for live sketches for a few weeks, until it began to be put under social distancing measures on May 31 and later a citywide ban on non-essential travels on June 15.

Cooped up at home under this hibernation phase, Long decided to create a new series of sketches inspired by heartwarming photos of Saigonese that he spotted on social media and in newspapers.

He has so far portrayed 40 vignettes on paper and is planning to create more.

“These images of Saigonese residents helping each other out during hard times touched my soul," he said.

"I was inspired to translate these moments and put them under a new light through the language of art.”

A standout in his collection is the vignette of a five-year-old wearing PPE overalls, standing by herself, waving goodbye to the camera before boarding an ambulance to enter quarantine.

Another sketch pays tribute to pop singer Ha Anh Tuan, who donated 25 metric tons of rice to help the struggling citizens.

Other optimistic news stories, including no-cost grocery stores for the needy, community fridges, and charity efforts benefiting pandemic-struck people, are also portrayed.

The sketches have earned Long showers of praises after they were posted on his social media account.

Many individuals have even asked to buy his pieces online, despite not having seen them in person, Long revealed.

He plans to auction several slice-of-life works to raise funds for charity causes for underprivileged people in the city, while portrait pieces of Ha Anh Tuan or frontline doctors will be gifted to the respective subjects as a tribute.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Czech Republic is willing to transfer 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses and a number of rapid test kits to Vietnam, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh during their online talks on Monday.

PM Babis thanked the valuable support of the Vietnamese government and Vietnamese community in the Czech Republic for Czech people during the early stages of the pandemic.

Although the pandemic situation in the Czech Republic remains complicated, the local government will further support and cooperate with Vietnam in the fight against COVID-19.

The European country is willing to transfer 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses and a number of rapid test kits to Vietnam, PM Babis stated.

He added that the Czech Republic will also call on other European countries to provide Vietnam with COVID-19 vaccines such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, and Sinopharm, which are being widely used in the region.

PM Chinh thanked the Czech government for its assistance, as well as for the decision to donate 250,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Vietnam, which was announced on July 26.

The Vietnamese leader affirmed that the timely and valuable support demonstrates the good traditional friendship between the two countries over the past 70 years.

During the conversations, both sides also discussed measures to bolster the traditional friendship and step up cooperation in the auto industry, transportation, education-training, and national defense-security.

Regarding trade and investment ties, Chinh suggested that the two nations closely coordinate to maximize the potential of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA).

He took the occasion to invite Babis to visit Vietnam as early as possible, while the Czech PM said he wishes to visit the country this year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Market monitors in two districts of Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City have discovered a large volume of COVID-19 test kits and other medical equipment smuggled from China.

The smuggled goods, including rapid test kits for coronavirus, disinfectant sprayers, blood oxygen meters and oxygen cylinders, were found in a container at a warehouse in Binh Tan District, said the Ho Chi Minh Market Surveillance Department on Friday.

Particularly, the quantity of oxygen generators seized amounts to 13,828, the department reported.

Most of the smuggled products were made in China, without sub labels in Vietnamese as required by law.

There were no invoices or other documents related to the goods, which included a number of commodities showing signs of violations of industrial property rights of some trademarks that are being protected in Vietnam.

The total value of the smuggled goods is estimated at billions of Vietnam dong (VND1 billion = US$43,800).

One day earlier, at another inspection at Tin Thuc International Trading Co., Ltd. in Tan Phu District, the department found and seized 80 rapid COVID-19 test kits and 30 blood oxygen meters without invoices and relevant documents.

Similar to the case in Binh Tan, all these goods were made in China and had no sub labels in Vietnamese.

In addition to such smuggled medical devices, the department, in conjunction with local police, also seized more than 67,200 medicine tablets without documents from a house in Binh Tan on Tuesday.

The pills, worth around VND200 million ($8,750), were brought illegally from China into Vietnam and advertised to be capable of curing COVID-19.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I’ve never been to a gym in my life. This explains why I look like a pear.

However, I do my best as I’m getting older. At 63, although I’m lucky enough to look about 50, I do have to work on my fabulous bod. And that’s harder now that we have to stay home and watch Netflix all day. The luckier of us live in semi-rural towns like Hoi An in central Vietnam so we’re not moaning so much as we’re trying to stretch muscles that usually only reach for the top shelves at VinMart. Those shelves are not high actually.

About 14 years old, there was no such thing as a gym except at the high-class resorts open at that time. Barely a few weeks ago, everything looked remarkably Western: Vietnamese cyclists in the latest skintight sports gear complete with snazzy sunglasses and water bottles while young adults run on a treadmill in body showing-off fashions.

Nowadays you can’t walk anywhere without falling over a yoga teacher. I can understand us flabby Westerners rolling on mats but when you get unbelievably slim Vietnamese women joining the classes, I have to wonder at the power of Vietnamese image-promoting media. Vietnamese do eat a rather healthy diet, I believe.

Now it’s fair enough if you’re stuck in Ho Chi Minh City in a shoebox with the kids screaming in the background and not much room to swing a cat, let alone do some decent body squats somewhere between the kitchenette and the pile of laundry blocking the TV set. For sure, you’ll shut your eyes as you pass the mirror trying to avoid staring at the love handles flopping over your waist.

Boredom does create an unwillingness to switch off the telly, shut the fridge, and not hit the alcohol during our present stressful times. But it’s got to be done! It’s time to wiggle a toe, bend a knee, and practice your marvel movie moves in the privacy of your own fantasy space!

But we’ll get back to that in a moment.

Fitness is a weird concept. We imagine that our prehistoric ancestors whizzed all over the place running down dangerous big things with nothing more than a spear. And some people want bodies like that. Amongst young Vietnamese and their young Westerner counterparts, the body becomes part of their attractiveness. Hey, wait until you’re my age and you’d be surprised how little difference that makes to your future romantic happiness.

So, what to do during these movement restrictions? Well, get some bricks, there’s your weight. Use your body weight instead of fancy gym gadgets. Stop eating huge meals, as you can’t afford them anyway. Start at the beginning, which means doing two or three of some exercises – not twenty or thirty, why? Your body needs to get used to all your madness.

Don’t let the house fall apart just because you don’t feel like doing anything – cleaning is important and good for your sanity. Actually, just rolling around the floor with your dogs is probably as effective as a half-hour walk around the block. If your partner is the main chef, do it yourself. You’ll lose half a kilo out of sheer nervousness.

Water is a great weight trainer for your arms and chest. Remember all those plants dying in Vietnam’s current heatwave? Go save the planet and feel proud of yourself remembering to do something meaningful.

OK, that’s it for tips. Now the warnings.

We’re all too long sitting in front of the computer. It’s bad for the eyes, heart, and legs. So go make a cuppa and while you’re waiting for the water to boil, squat up and down a bit – it will make your bum tighter and more attractive! Just ignore the giggles, you now have stronger willpower than they do!

For those who can actually leave the house, please don’t run or jog in the middle of the day. It’s the height of stupidity and you’ll collapse in the middle of a crowd debating what to do with you as you slowly die of heatstroke.

Keep this other idea in mind. We get around 80 billion heartbeats in a lifetime, why waste them running when it’s totally unnecessary at that time of the day. Haven’t you noticed that almost all Vietnamese do exercise in the early morning when it’s still cool?

And here’s a really good tip. Make a friend for exercise – nothing else – you can even do this via video phone these days, so there are no excuses for not stepping something up. People are important, they snap you out of daydreams and depression, they give you ideas and advice; and the best ones never judge you.

Fitness shouldn’t be a goal – ever. Enjoying your body’s groove when it’s in tune is rare, so savor it, treasure it and above all, don’t take fitness too seriously, prehistoric folks would have rolled on the floor watching us exercise.

But since it’s enhanced social distancing, I don’t blame you if you order takeaways, sleep a lot and get a little fat. After all, we did come to Vietnam to relax, hey?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Editor's note: This story is written by Ray Kuschert, an Australian who has lived in Ho Chi Minh City and experienced daily traffic in the city for more than eight years.

The first thing every visitor says as they arrive in Ho Chi Minh City is, 'OMG!! Look at those bikes!!” As the third largest consumer of motorcycles in the world, Vietnam thrives on the two-seater scooters for daily transport. In fact, around 50 percent of the population are said to own a bike. However, getting around town is actually much better than the critics would have you think.

With less than 10 percent of commutes being by car, motorbikes have been a symbol of life in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, for decades. In fact, local streets are often built just to accommodate motorcycles and many homes have a space in the living area to keep a motorbike safe at home.

From the outside, it can appear that Ho Chi Minh City is a gridlock of two-wheeled vehicles, however, logical designing and cultural respect have created one of the better traffic systems in the world.

Cars in major cities all over the world create massive congestion. In cities like New York and Sydney, commute times for private vehicles now far exceed one hour each way, but in Ho Chi Minh City, the average commute time of around 56 percent of the working population that use motorbikes is less than 40 minutes, with others walking, using bicycles, cars and public transport.

There are a few strategic reasons why this occurs. Firstly, this society does not have massive class differences across the city. This means that a worker can live in budget accommodation in an area that is within the reach of their work. Additionally, for the lower wage earners such as factory staff, accommodation and assistance are often given to allow workers to live within the walking distance of their factory.

For those that commute, there is a strange cultural process not seen anywhere else in the world. There is a culture of continuance of movement. Traffic occurs, and with the motorbikes it is like a colony of ants moving through the city, but there is this culture of movement that keeps traffic going.

Where a traffic jam occurs, riders will use footpaths or any spare space to get out of the traffic. Likewise, red lights are sometimes considered as not so important with police being flexible to disregard the lights to move traffic on when congestion happens. The whole foundation of movement is different from any Western city so you rarely find yourself sitting still for too long.

Sitting over this is the sense of community. It is a daily experience to be sitting in traffic and to find yourself talking to someone about something totally irrelevant. Whether it is a kid wanting to practice English, or just a person wanting to be friendly, the streets of Ho Chi Minh City are a melting pot of people getting to their destination and those who actually have a moment to acknowledge you.

As a comparison, my commute time in Sydney, Australia ranged from one hour to an hour 45 minutes each way per day. Here in Vietnam, my maximum commute is 45 minutes in traffic each way. The swarm of motorbikes is an illusion. Smaller and more mobile vehicles mean that the drivers have more options to maintain movement in their commute. Red lights are considered more a suggestion than rule and police maintain a very different view of the traffic compared to Western countries.

Even building design lends itself to better operations. Because everyone drives a bike to work, you can fit around six motorbikes in the same space you can fit one car. This means your business can plan for around 60 percent to 70 percent less space for staff parking. This is a massive saving for global companies choosing Ho Chi Minh City as an offshore operation location.

Don’t fear the swarm of traffic because it has purpose and function. In the modern world of Ho Chi Minh City, the average commute is under 10km and we will see the city evolve with electric modes of personal transport becoming more popular every day. Also, businesses will be able to accommodate this changing technological world with more ease than car-based communities. Ho Chi Minh City is quickly becoming a choice location for global businesses having skilled workers, with good English, unique infrastructure that is growing to meet the future world and a growing economy that is devoid of the stresses present in many Western countries. It really is the jewel of the east for companies and visitors alike.

Make sure you take the time to visit Ho Chi Minh City and experience how good ‘different’ can really be. It’s the city where timeless charm meets the future world. See you soon in Saigon.

Officers under the municipal Department of Public Security confirmed on Saturday they were verifying the accusation against Eagle Education International English Center and Eagle English International School.

The two facilities reportedly charged learners’ tuition fees but did not run enough courses as promised.

Early reports showed that the directors of the two venues, Tran Minh Tuan and Nguyen Truong Giang, had left their places of residence since December 2020.

Officers thus announced they were searching for Tuan, a 30-year-old man from the northern province of Hai Duong, and Giang, a 22-year-old person from the northern province of Ha Nam.

The two are required to contact the police station at 674 3 Thang 2 Street in Ward 14, District 10, Ho Chi Minh City (phone number: 0914840681).

Residents who have information on Tuan and Giang’s whereabouts are advised to contact police officers at the above address and phone number.

If the two individuals do not show up within 15 days, officers will conclude that they have run away and will deal with the case according to the law.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many universities in Ho Chi Minh City have provided coronavirus vaccination for more than 10,000 students, with priority given to frontline volunteers.

One of the schools is the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, where nearly 3,000 students have registered for their second vaccine shots, said Truong Van Dat, head of the university’s student affairs department.

“Such registration is applied to those students who have got the first jabs at least six weeks before. The school has planned to give the second injections to them from August 13 to 22,” the department head said.

The university has given the first injections to all of its students staying in the city since late June, with priority intended for those who have engaged in COVID-19 frontline activities, Dat added.

To date, more than 4,800 students, including 1,600 frontline volunteers, of the medical school have got their first doses.

The municipal Center for Disease Control has since June coordinated with the university hospital to offer COVID-19 inoculation to students from all universities and colleges participating in epidemic prevention and control efforts. As yet, thousands of such students have been inoculated.

Dr. Ha Thanh Dat, from the University of Medicine Pham Ngoc Thach, said that more than 3,000 students of the school have been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, of whom 200 have received two full doses.

At the Ho Chi Minh City University of Industry, the first vaccine shots have been given to 250 students, of whom 180 are boarders while the rest partake in the COVID-19 fight, said university president Phan Hong Hai.

“Our volunteer students are going to receive the second jabs. The school has made a list of 2,500 students who are living in Ho Chi Minh City for vaccination,” the president added.

Meanwhile, 89 boarders of the University of Science have been provided with the first jabs, said Tran Vu, head of the school’s student affairs department.

The Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology also said all 850 students and staff at its dormitory in District 10 have been given the first doses.

Throughout the city, the numbers of people receiving the first and second injections have so far reached more than 3.85 million and 118,000, respectively, according to the Ministry of Health’s data.

Since the pandemic hit the country in early 2020, the city has documented 135,224 COVID-19 cases including 3,582 deaths, while the corresponding figures of the country are 241,543 and 4,487, the ministry reported on Thursday morning.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The abrupt enforcement of a new movement declaration system at COVID-19 checkpoints in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday baffled the majority of commuters and clogged up traffic flow for hours.

The novel movement declaration requirement, devised by the Ministry of Public Security and considered part of the national population database, was simultaneously introduced at COVID-19 checkpoints in the city around 1:00 pm on Saturday.

This is meant to keep track of people's travels in case contact tracing is needed to stall coronavirus spread.

As witnessed by a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper correspondent, all commuters passing these checkpoints would be pulled over and could only leave when they scanned a QR code on their phones, completed their movement declaration online, captured a new QR code, and presented it to checkpoint officers to see if it matched the database.

The steps were deemed rather complicated and time-consuming by the public due to a variety of reasons, including the reduced sensitivity of mobile phone cameras for QR scanning under broad daylight, or the lack of Internet connection at checkpoints.

Several officers were ill-prepared for their duties, as the batteries on their mobile devices died while they logged commuters’ information.

“Some senior citizens had their smartphones with them, but did not know how to declare the information on the apps and required officers' help,” an checkpoint officer explained.

“Some individuals took as long as 15 minutes to complete their declaration.”

The unoptimized process impeded traffic flow, causing lines of delayed vehicles to snake out as far as a few kilometers.

On Phan Dang Luu and Le Van Duyet Streets in Binh Thanh District, hundreds of motorbikes were seen struggling to inch toward the checkpoints, where officers were still strictly upholding the declaration protocol.

“Residents can scan the QR code and declare their information at home," said Senior Lieutenant Colonel Huynh Thi Thu Trang, a senior official at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Public Security.

"They will receive another QR code, which they can save to their phone and use for the next three days.

“When passing the checkpoints, they only need to bring up the QR image so officers can instantly check their information, reducing processing time and avoiding congestion.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police on Sunday asked people leaving Ho Chi Minh City for their hometowns to turn back to their current places of residence in compliance with COVID-19 travel restrictions.

The mass departure took place when local authorities have applied social distancing measures at various levels since late May to curb the coronavirus, which has caused almost 145,000 infections, including 4,315 deaths, in the city since the pandemic hit the country in early 2020.

Such restrictions, which will be in place until at least September 15 as the city has been struck hard by a fourth wave since late April, have caused job losses and business closures, putting many people in dire straits and thus driving them back to their hometowns.

On duty at many checkpoints at the city’s gateways, traffic police officers stopped the exodus, traveling on motorbikes or in cars, and advised them to return to their current residence for the sake of epidemic prevention and control.

At the Linh Xuan Overpass in Thu Duc City, officers requested hundreds of people to turn around.

On National Highway 1 in Di An City under Binh Duong Province, which borders Ho Chi Minh City, local forces also asked people to come back to their current accommodations.

N.C.K., a native of the north-central province of Thanh Hoa, told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper that he wanted to travel to his hometown after having been jobless for months due to COVID-19.

“Many people who departed earlier than me have been asked to turn back,” K. added.

The mass migration has led to traffic congestion at a number of checkpoints, especially in the Linh Xuan Overpass area.

Senior Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Van Binh told Tuoi Tre that traveling without a proper reason violated social distancing rules and such gatherings at checkpoints put many people at risk of coronavirus infection.

The same situation was seen in the Suoi Tien area in Thu Duc City, where many travelers were stopped.

As many people refused to turn around, police had to gather them in the new Eastern Bus Station area in the district and persuaded them to stay.

Tran Viet Bao, a former porter, who wanted to go back to Hue City, his hometown, told Tuoi Tre that he has been out of work for three months and has owed his landlord two months’ rent.

As the landlord could no longer allow him to default on the rent, he had to leave for Hue, Bao said.

In coping with waves of people leaving Ho Chi Minh City, the municipal police have coordinated with their counterparts in Binh Duong and Dong Nai Provinces to control the situation, give explanations to the internal migrants, and request them to turn back.

Those deliberately breaking the law were penalized but most turned around, listening to explanations given by police officers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Ho Chi Minh City teacher with a love for the environment has discovered a passion for upcycling fabric scraps, which she uses to make various creations and launch a project called Made by Zy.

Nguyen Thanh Ngoc Thao, a young teacher who is nicknamed Zy, is known as a person who is enthusiastic about leftover fabric and do-it-yourself projects.

Thao developed a passion for creating things as a student with the goal of being financially independent.

In 2015, Thao was able to sell enough handmade accessories like bracelets and various pieces of jewelry to cover her tuition instead of asking her parents for it.

Thao began using fabric scraps to make accessories at the end of 2019. She started selling the products to support a community project to provide fresh water in the northern mountainous province of Lao Cai.

She paid a lot of attention to fabric remnants after paying a visit to a relative’s tailor shop in the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho at the beginning of 2020.

Taking the trimmings to the home, the young teacher tried out creating some accessories as gifts for herself.

Regarding them as only a way to play with her passion, Thao was surprised by the welcome and support from her close friends and acquaintances.

The project Made by Zy that specializes in making accessories out of fabric leftovers was officially launched at that moment.

Currently, apart from her main job as a STEM teacher in Ho Chi Minh City, Thao immerses in her own sewing project to play with fabric scraps on weekends.

“I would like to be always ready to work. I can do what I want to at the moment," she said.

"I believe in the future, I would have many precious memories when I look back to this time, and I would never regret anything."

Thao’s aunt, who is a tailor shop owner, has given her very much support as she understands how useful and practical her project would become. The aunt has supplied Thao with a lot of craft materials.

“The fabric scraps have now been able to be recycled in a useful way instead of being thrown away like before,” shared Thao.

“My aunt suggested some craft ideas that can be made out of trimmings."

When Thao’s project gained traction, the sources of fabric scraps have definitely increased with more contributions from other tailor shops.

Like Thao’s aunt, the tailor shops’ owners hope a huge amount of fabric leftovers would be given a new lease of life in a more useful manner instead of being dumped in a landfill.

Under the young woman’s skillful and creative hands, soon-to-be discarded trimmings can be transformed into beautiful items like colorful headbands, ribbons, envelopes, earrings, water bottle holders, and bags.

Learning from mistakes

Thao was not hesitant to talk about mistakes she made during her interview with Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper.

As a young entrepreneur, she occasionally found herself in troublesome situations that she had to struggle to overcome.

She had to spend one hour making one headband during the first days. That was when Thao did not know how to cut, combine, and sew the scraps together properly and beautifully.

In addition, customers did not welcome her first products due to their uncompetitive prices.

“I was turned down by so many people that I felt extremely disappointed,” recalled Thao. Some of her co-workers those days decided to leave for more stable jobs as well.

“My feelings were ambiguous and stressed at that time,” she added. Thao is determined to get out of her comfort zone to challenge herself in the business area.

Despite several obstacles in the beginning, Thao tried her best to figure out efficient ways of making headbands from fabric scraps.

It takes her just two to three minutes to complete a headband now, and she can make around 100 pieces each day.

Thao took part in a group sharing her ideas of transforming fabric leftovers into headbands. Her dedication to the idea caught the fellow community members’ attention.

Eventually, she got an offer from a stranger of one online community to bring her products to present in their store, which she considered as 'light at the end of the tunnel' then.

Thao has run into some problems while pursuing her passion and she found herself growing up after such challenges.

She becomes more careful in choosing potential partners by the time thanks to those sad experiences.

Thao failed to conduct a process of collecting and recycling second-hand clothes in February 2021 due to a shortage of staff, and she could not control the collected clothes’ quality either.

After the failure, she held many mini-workshops where participants brought their old clothes to and repurposed them into new things like headbands and ribbons by themselves.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Thao went online to sell her handmade products. She connected with some e-commerce sites specializing in selling eco-friendly goods to reach her potential customers.

The woman intends to explore more new kinds of craft materials besides fabric scraps, especially plastic waste, in creating more practical and useful items in the near future.

Promoting creativity, decreasing screening time Thao said her upcycled products’ prices are affordable to students in general. She hopes that easy access will encourage the young to choose environment-friendly products and lead a greener life. The young teacher holds some workshops on clothes for children from six to 12 years old. She teaches the children to know how to distinguish kinds of cloth and let them understand how it would become dangerous to the environment if they were thrown away irresponsibly. Thao is always willing to give financial support to projects relating to environmental protection conducted by students. As for children, she hopes that her workshops not only help them get used to recycling but also decrease children’s screen time on electronic devices. As a STEM teacher, Thao would like to encourage the kids' curiosity and creativity while they are learning how to play with trimmings. STEM teachers are educators who teach science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marcus Manh Cuong Vu’s ‘Memento Mori: Water’ and Nguyen Phan Linh Dan’s ‘If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood’ will represent Vietnam in the Asian Project Market (APM) category under this year’s Busan International Film Festival (BIFF).

APM said it has selected 26 movies out of 429 film submissions to present to the judges at BIFF 2021, which is slated for October 12-14.

Among the 26 shortlisters are ‘Memento Mori: Water,’ produced by Nguyen Hoang Diep, Nguyen Trinh Hoan and directed by Vu.

This supplied photo shows film director Marcus Manh Cuong Vu.

It is the second piece in the ‘Memento Mori the Movie’ trilogy, an adaptation of Dang Hoang Giang’s 2018 hit nonfiction book ‘Diem Den Cua Cuoc Doi’ (The Destination of Life).

Through the story of Ha, a mother who accompanies her son Nam’s journey to battle bone cancer, 'Memento Mori: Water' delves into the heavy subject of near-death experience through the lens of empathy, humanity, sharing, and enlightenment.

The casting process for ‘Memento Mori: Water’ has been completed in 2019, while filming is anticipated to start in 2022 and the official launch slated for one year later.

The first volume of the trilogy -- 'Memento Mori: Earth' -- is still being crowdfunded for its post-production and is expected to be released next year.

Speaking with Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, Vu showed his excitement at the APM result.

“It is an honor for us to be included in the Busan International Film Festival this year, as this marked the first major recognition for our project,” he stated.

“All independent filmmakers in Asia want to be chosen for APM in their first production phases, as it is an apt opportunity that supports and motivates them to complete their films.”

The milestone proves even more meaningful for Vu due to the countless struggles that his production crew and other filmmakers in Vietnam are facing in the current COVID-19 slump.

This supplied photo features director Nguyen Phan Linh Dan (middle) at the 2019 Busan International Film Festival in South Korea.

Also coming to APM 2021 is ‘If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood,’ the debut feature of director Nguyen Phan Linh Dan, whose portfolio includes the director of photography role in BIFF 2019 participant ‘Bi Mat Cua Gio’ (The Secret of the Wind) as well as directing work for various commercials and music videos.

Film directors will have to pitch their movies to a panel of international producers and investors in order to win their cash prizes.

In APM 2020, Tran Thanh Huy, director of BIFF 2019 grand prize winner ‘Rom,’ acquired the US$10,000 prize for his new project ‘Tick It.’

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Since returning to Vietnam after spending two years studying art therapy in New York under the prestigious Fulbright program, 32-year-old Nguyen Huong Linh has made it her mission to help Vietnam’s marginalized communities cope with trauma.

Linh, who completed her undergraduate studies at Korea National University of Arts in 2014, had long dreamt of connecting her passion for art with gender activism and art therapy.

Shortly after graduation, Linh began introducing the concepts of body awareness, gender equality, and reproductive health to children in Vietnam through a series of 12 books she authored and illustrated herself.

Her dream was lifted to new heights in 2017 when she was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to a Master’s program in art therapy at New York’s School of Visual Arts.

Upon returning to Vietnam, COVID-19 restrictions forced her to spend two weeks at a centralized quarantine facility in Hanoi before she could enter into the community.

Rather than spend those two weeks sitting idly, Linh launched MAI:tri - an online space which provides one-on-one therapy consultation and self-reflection through art.

Her first ‘customers’ were her roommates at the facility.

The positive responses she received from her roommates at the quarantine facility have motivated Linh to continue down the art therapy path, inspiring a blog and a series of videos on the topic.

For a time, Linh ran MAI:tri out of Ho Chi Minh City where she hosted therapy workshops for vulnerable demographics, including underprivileged teens, medical practitioners, and social activists who face mental health issues.

“I’ve been trying to re-adapt to Vietnamese culture and have spent a lot of time reflecting on what I learned during my time abroad. I’ve realized that the various presumptions and stigmas that surround mental therapy are a hindrance to the growth of the discipline in Vietnam,” Linh explained.

Linh is facing these presumptions and stigmas head-on.

She now runs MAI:tri out of Hoi An City in the central Quang Nam Province in order to broader her customer base both in the city and in nearby Da Nang City.

She also hosts clients from across Vietnam in online consultations, and prides herself on offering LGBT-friendly services.

When she’s not busy with MAI:tri, she’s focuses her attention on a charity which funds consultations for young women, cancer patients, and survivors of abuse.

In early 2021, after the COVID-19 pandemic and the historic flooding in Vietnam’s central province’s took massive physical and mental tolls on her fellow Vietnamese, Linh initiated a series of 20 free webinars that focused on holistic healing practices, including yoga, art therapy, movement therapy, creative writing, and breathwork, to over 3,200 participants.

According to Linh, continuous social distancing, a lack of human connections, and work/study burnout, has left many feeling dejected, dissociated, and hopeless.

Daily depressing COVID-19 updates have helped breed fear and discord in communities. Such negative feelings have taken negative tolls on the health of many.

“Finding a mental health therapist is as important as finding a doctor for our physical diseases,” said Linh.

According to Linh, the stigma around mental health in Vietnam is gradually easing, a phenomenon she sees as ‘uplifting’ for Vietnam’s public health outlook during such tumultuous times.

She strives to offer art as a self-care method which can help people observe their emotions in a more intuitive manner compared to the usual dialogue approach.

“With the help of Linh, I was able to awaken my inner therapist and compliment and guide myself through the traumatic childhood memories without fear or constraint,” a participant in Linh’s webinar said.

For the time being, Linh is working on a new series of workshops for Ho Chi Minh City residents who are struggling with long days spent inside amidst social distancing.

The event has gathered nearly VND55 million (US$2,400) which will be donated to the city’s needy through local charities.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bidding farewell to her dream jobs after more than ten years working in the banking and community welfare service sectors, Chau Ngoc Diu gambled her savings and efforts on developing her hometown’s hallmark palm nectar industry, which has struck a chord at home and abroad.

The 39-year-old woman, of Khmer ethnic minority in Tri Ton District in the Mekong Delta province of An Giang, feels deeply that she has to leverage her community’s long-standing trade of making palmyra palm (thnot, Borassus) sugar and help lift local farmers out of poverty.

“The mild sweetness of palm sugar from the good old days lingers in my mind till now,” Diu shared, adding the abuse of additives to cut processing time and boost volume has made the sugar much harder to come by in Vietnam.

It then occurred to her to produce palmyra nectar by capitalizing on the plants that grow in abundance in her hometown.

The daring woman stood her ground firmly as her family members and friends frowned on her plans to quit well-paid jobs for a risky business.

Diu founded Palmania JSC in June 2017 with an aim to develop traditional palmyra nectar production of Khmer ethnic people and turn a local specialty into an international standard product.

Now, her nectar is found in supermarkets and convenience stores all over Vietnam and possibly in other Asian countries and Europe in the time to come.

Diu’s granulated palmyra nectar, branded Palmania, is the world’s third of its kind to win a two-star accolade at Great Taste Awards 2020 held in the U.K..

At the competition, considered the world's largest and most trusted food and drink awards in the fine cuisine world, her product was put to the test with a panel of over 500 experts and earned the highly respected seals of approval.

Sweet success

Diu still remembers growing up beneath the shades of the palm trees and seeing members of her community make palm sugar in the traditional way.

Upset that the nutritious, pleasantly sweet products failed to make their way to supermarkets and convenience stores as they were marred by unattractive packaging and uncontrolled quality, the innovation-minded budding entrepreneur felt compelled to do something to help.

“I want to churn out items which bear our hallmarks and make nice, readily accessible gifts,” Diu shared.

With that in mind, she began experimenting with sugars.

Almost four years later and one trial after another, the woman finally caught on to her work: she was cooking up a wholly natural, pure, and healthier sweetener.

Though her first steps were met with immediate failures, she finally came up in 2017 with Palmania, a pure, unrefined, and tasty palmyra nectar that sets itself apart from its rivals.

According to Diu, Palmania is the combination of ‘pal,' which means palm tree in the Khmer dialect and ‘mania,' or passion.

“Our brand name tells everything. We want our health products to reach far beyond our impoverished neighborhood,” Diu revealed, adding she is really personal about the items she makes.

The nectar is free of preservatives and additives and rich in healthy minerals as the nectar components are not removed.

“With a low content of sugar and being alkaloid, our products are considered a nutrient-rich, healthful sweetener,” Diu noted, adding she believes it is something her clientele appreciates.

The entrepreneur added her workers stick to a stringent production process, including extracting the nectar in the wee hours to keep it from going sour and using sen (mukulungu) wood to minimize fermentation of palm flower juices within eight hours.

No chemicals or additives are used in any phases to retain natural flavor and ensure perfect safety for consumer health.

This supplied photo shows chips of sen (mukulungu) wood, used to minimize fermentation of palmyra flower juices in the traditional sugar production method.

No regrets

Developing nectar from the abundant supply of palmyra trees in her hometown seemed a natural move, but getting her business off the ground was not easy.

Before quitting her job as the department head at a community welfare organization, the daring woman, who had also worked for 10 years in the banking sector, spent two years monitoring her nectar business remotely from Ho Chi Minh City, where she was working her day job.

With her gaze fixed on developing the healthy products and seeing that the items were becoming popular, Diu quit her job in the southern metropolis altogether in 2019 and focused solely on her business.

After meticulously weighing the pros and cons of such a career move, she bravely entered the business world, ready for the challenges it would bring.

“I was at a crossroads then, but if I didn’t leave my day job, I wouldn’t be able to keep an eye on the production phases and wouldn’t have time for new products,” Diu recalled.

“It’s worth it as for how far I’ve gone."

A major hurdle, Diu shared, is talking local farmers into doing away with their low-tech, unclean production.

To encourage the farming households, the entrepreneur provided them with tools and offered high prices for their finished products.

“The challenge is getting local farmers to see the benefits of clean production,” Diu said, adding it took one whole year to perfect the procedures including ingredient procurement, transport, and processing.

Among the households is Nguyen Van Luom, from Tinh Bien District in the same province, who owns around 50 palm trees aged 25 years and above.

His daily routines now are sterilizing, collecting, and processing nectar in compliance with Diu’s standards.

“It is really tough producing sugar in the method formulated by Diu. I have to steer clear from additives in all phases,” Luom said.

“I also have to refrain from using cleansers and granulated sugar, so it takes much longer to get the nectar.”

Luom said he was on the verge of giving up after some time but has stuck to the method since thanks to Diu’s encouragement and the much higher prices she offered compared to current market rates.

Another disadvantage, according to Diu, is that hers is a process that could prove difficult to scale.

The costs are high too, something Diu said is unavoidable, as one cannot provide healthy treats without additional costs.

Going the traditional way, it takes only four to five hours to get 100 kilograms of sugar as a finished product.

With Diu’s method, an eight-hour production yields only 20-30 kilograms.

“My products boast a really different taste and high nutritional value while retaining the very essence of nectar,” she proudly said.

Diu’s currently two main product lines, soft palmyra nectar and granulated palmyra nectar, have hit shelves at supermarkets and convenience stores across the country.

She is working to export her fine quality products to Japan and Europe, hoping to meet the benchmarks of these choosy markets.

These days, Diu is translating readings from foreign sources to make modifications to her machinery and production procedures.

Regarding her future plans, she said she will work hard to come up with new product lines from palmyra nectar.

National recognition Chau Ngoc Diu’s products have won numerous prizes at provincial and national competitions. In 2020, her soft palmyra nectar was recognized with four-star OCOP (One Commune One Product) by the An Giang People’s Committee to encourage entrepreneurs’ efforts in tapping into local specialties. Her two mainstay better-for-you products both received Tri Ton District’s recognition conferred on agricultural products the same year.
