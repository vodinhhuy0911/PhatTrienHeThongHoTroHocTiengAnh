@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many owners of private kindergartens in Vietnam have been trying to sell their schools after they ran out of money to maintain their operations following a prolonged shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A Facebook group has even been established to facilitate the sale of private kindergartens in many localities.

A user named N.C. stated in his post that he wanted to transfer the ownership of a preschool in southern Binh Duong Province due to the pandemic.

“The venue was licensed in August 2020," C. elaborated.

"About 30 students were learning at the school prior to the outbreak, with monthly tuition at VND2 million [US$87].”

Another Facebook account named Ngoc Linh said she had managed to survive the previous three waves, but can no longer maintain the operation of her kindergarten due to the current round.

Linh stated that the school was officially open in October 2019, adding that she has spent over VND1.5 billion ($65,300) on it so far.

She also offers to liquidate all equipment and tools inside the office, classrooms, and playground, along with air conditioning and CCTV systems at cheap prices.

Similar to Linh, N.T.H.P., who owns a preschool in Ho Chi Minh City, said she has been paying rental fees over the past months even though the venue was closed due to COVID-19.

“I don’t know when the kids are able to come back," P. said.

"I have no other choice but to sell my school.”

N.T.U., who runs a network of seven kindergartens in several districts in Ho Chi Minh City, considered herself among the luckier as she is still able to keep her facilities.

“A lot of my peers have run out of money to maintain the operations of their schools,” U. elaborated.

“One of them told me he had to spend up to VND200 million [$8,700] covering monthly rental fees, teachers’ salary and insurance, as well as interest on his bank loan.”

After failing to sell the school, he eventually gave up and let the landlord take all equipment to pay his debt, U. stated.

Vietnam is struggling with the fourth and worst COVID-19 outbreak, with 170,563 local infections recorded in 62 provinces and cities since April 27.

Social distancing measures have been implemented across the nation, while students are required to stay home as part of pandemic prevention and control efforts.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hanoi authorities on Wednesday announced that the second phase of the national high school graduation exam, which was initially slated for August 6-7, will be canceled due to concerns over the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community.

Traditionally held in July, the national high school graduation exam is an annual assessment that 12th-grade students in Vietnam’s K-12 system are required to sit after they finish their studies.

Results of the test are needed for graduation and to help universities and colleges enroll undergraduates.

On account of the coronavirus, this year’s iteration of the exam is implemented in two phases.

While the first, carried out on July 7-8, involved the majority of candidates, the second phase is intended for students who were unable to finish their tests because of the pandemic.

In a recent guiding document, the Hanoi Department of Education and Training decided to pass all candidates who signed up for this year’s exam and did not get disciplined by the exam panel in the first phase, but were not able to complete or enter the first phase because of unforeseeable circumstances.

The department requires all high schools and educational centers to inform the eligible candidates about their granted privilege.

Those who wish to qualify for the privilege would need to apply to their respective education facilities through emails, so that the school officials can compile a list of candidates to submit to the municipal education authority.

In their statement, the Hanoi Department of Education and Training also ordered education facilities to notify their students of the upcoming aptitude tests for the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City campuses of the Vietnam National University, which will supersede the national high school exam results to decide entrances to these higher institutions.

Other higher education facilities are encouraged to devise their own tests, instead of using the national exam results, to evaluate their applicants.

The capital city has reported 1,082 COVID-19 infections since April 27, when the fourth wave started wreaking havoc in Vietnam.

On Saturday, Hanoi authorities began the implementation of the prime minister’s Directive No. 16, which requires all residents to stay home unless for essential duties, plus banning all public transport, taxi, ride-hailing, and food delivery services.

Vietnam on Thursday morning reported 2,821 new cases of COVID-19, increasing the country’s tally to 123,640 with 27,457 recoveries, according to the Ministry of Health.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam accounted for three out of the top five projects honored at the Social Business Creation 2021 competition, its organizers announced on Monday.

Along with Vietnam, Mexico and Argentina each had one project highlighted at the competition, which was organized by HEC Montréal, a public Canadian business school, and Professor Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner.

These five projects have been awarded the 'Impactful Social Innovative Concepts' prize.

Among Vietnam’s three winners, 'Nanoneem' is a research project on herbal-based biopesticides for green agriculture, aimed at serving forest preservation and supporting communities in remote areas.

The project, which got the highest mark in the competition’s seminal round, at 91 out of the 100 marks, is developed by Dr. Duong Nguyen Hong Nhung, a lecturer at the biotechnology faculty of International University in Ho Chi Minh City, her students, and some other students from the Foreign Trade University in the same city.

Another winning project is Brain Analytics, which focuses on using artificial intelligence (AI) software in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results.

The project was implemented by a group of students from the biomedical engineering faculty of International University, whose representative is Pham Thi Nhu Trang, under the instruction of Dr. Ha Thi Thanh Huong, head of the faculty's regenerative medicine department.

This project received a score of 79.5 at the contest.

The remaining project that scored 86 marks is entitled 'Cereal Straws' of VinaStraws, a manufacturer of biodegradable drinking straws, whose representative is Do Thi Huong Thao, along with 10 students from universities in Hanoi.

This project targets the making of eco-friendly products from common materials in Vietnam.

Social Business Creation 2021 is a global competition and an innovative training platform through which participants learn about how to use market mechanisms to solve social challenges.

In addition, the contest provides students and young people with learning and experience opportunities in an international environment so that they can develop their business ideas that create great social significance.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Ministry of Education and Training on Friday afternoon made a proposal to management boards of 16 universities, institutes, and colleges in Hanoi for turning their campuses into COVID-19 quarantine facilities.

The schools chosen for the conversion include the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, the University of Transport and Communications, the National University of Arts Education, the National Economics University, the Hanoi University of Mining and Geology, the Hanoi Open University, the University of Industrial Fine Art, the Hanoi University, the Foreign Trade University, the Hanoi National University of Education, the Hanoi University of Physical Education and Sports, the Thuongmai University, the National University of Civil Engineering, the Hanoi Pedagogical University 2, the National Academy of Education Management, and the National College for Education.

The education ministry suggested that the aforementioned schools prepare a plan to transfer students and staff to safe areas and set aside dormitories, gymnasiums, stadiums, and halls for the establishment of COVID-19 isolation and treatment facilities.

Schools in Hanoi have been closed since the end of April due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

City chairman Chu Ngoc Anh has decided to enforce extensive social distancing measures under the prime minister’s Directive No. 16 for 15 days from 6:00 am on Saturday over the increase of new local infections, with the Delta variant spreading fast.

Of 3,991 new local COVID-19 cases confirmed by the Ministry of Health on Saturday morning, five were registered in Hanoi and 2,070 infections were logged in Ho Chi Minh City, which has risen to the top of Vietnam’s leaderboard in terms of new infections.

The latest cases have taken the country’s tally to 86,957, including 15,536 recoveries, as recorded since early 2020.

Since April 27, when the pandemic’s fourth wave appeared in the Southeast Asian nation, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have accounted for 884 and 52,544 cases, respectively, in the country’s total 84,812 domestic infections.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam's Ministry of Education and Training has decided to organize the second phase of the national high school graduation exam next month for students who could not attend the first leg due to COVID-19 impacts.

Pursuant to the ministry’s decision announced on Monday, the second phase of the exam is scheduled for August 6-7, around one month after the first phase that took place on July 7-8.

The second phase is also intended for students who had their tests in the first unfinished because of epidemic outbreaks.

The decision was made following the ministry’s consultation with local education departments in the country’s 63 provinces and cities, as well as the direction of Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam and the proposals of many provincial and municipal authorities.

Like the first one, the second phase will have five subjects that will be arranged during the two examination days.

The difficulty levels of the exam questions and their duration in this phase will be equivalent to those in the previous leg, the ministry said.

The ministry requested all local exam steering committees send their lists of students attending the second phase before July 20.

Vietnam has so far recorded 65,607 COVID-19 cases since early 2020.

Since April 27, when the pandemic’s fourth wave appeared in Vietnam, the country has documented 61,940 domestic cases.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Department of Education and Training in the south-central Vietnamese province of Phu Yen suspended test taking at two high school graduation exam sites after detecting 166 suspected coronavirus infections among students and staff on Wednesday -- the first day of the 2021 national high school graduation exam.

Traditionally held in July, the national high school graduation exam is an annual assessment taken by twelfth-grade students in Vietnam at the end of their studies.

The results of the exam are used to ensure students meet graduation requirements and to help colleges and universities make acceptance decisions.

In light of the ongoing pandemic in Vietnam, many provinces and cities tested all candidates for COVID-19 before this year’s exam, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, requiring the in-person attendance of nearly one million students.

In its report to the Ministry of Education and Training on the first exam day, the Department of Education and Training in Phu Yen said 151 candidates and 15 staff members at seven exam venues had apparently contracted the coronavirus.

In response, the department suspended test-taking activities at Nguyen Thi Minh Khai High School in Tay Hoa District and Tran Hung Dao Middle School in Tuy Hoa City, where there were 39 and 100 students, respectively, are suspected to be infected with the pathogen.

All exam questions and exam records at those two test venues were returned to ensure confidentiality in accordance with national regulations.

The suspected test-takers were asked to stay home and adhere to instructions from local medical authorities.

They will take another test in the second phase of the exam, with the dates to be decided by the education ministry.

There were two special cases in which two candidates at two exam sites -- Hung Vuong Middle School and Duy Tan High School in Tuy Hoa City -- had already received their exam questions before staff were informed that they were suspected to have COVID-19.

The provincial education department allowed the two students to take the test as normal in isolation rooms, which were completely disinfected after the tests were handed in.

Those two students will take the remaining subjects of the exam during the second phase.

The 15 staff members in question were also asked to stay home under the monitoring of local medical authorities.

A spike in local coronavirus infections that emerged on June 23 in Phu Yen has yet to be brought under control.

The province has recorded 315 COVID-19 cases during this latest wave, according to the Ministry of Health’s update on Thursday morning.

In the same update, the health ministry confirmed 314 new cases of COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City and the neighboring province of Binh Duong, increasing the country’s tally to 23,385.

Recoveries have reached 8,557 while the death toll has mounted to 102, the majority of whom were older patients with critical underlying diseases.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Despite the developments of COVID-19 in Vietnam, education authorities still stick to the plan to start the 2021 high school graduation exam, which involves the in-person attendance of nearly one million students, on Wednesday.

Traditionally held in July, the national high school graduation exam is an annual assessment that twelfth-grade students in Vietnam’s K-12 system are required to sit after they finish their studies.

Results of the test are needed for graduation and to help universities and colleges enroll undergraduates.

This year’s iteration of the exam is considered a momentous one as it is being held amidst the fourth and worst virus wave, which has driven Vietnam’s case count near 19,000 across 55 out of its 63 provinces and cities, as recorded since it first emerged at the end of April.

Back in 2020, the exam was delayed to August due to the epidemic situation. However, it has returned to the normal time frame of early July this year, even in provinces that are seeing an outbreak.

In light of the situation, provincial authorities have committed efforts, manpower, and resources to ensuring epidemiological safety for test-takers.

Many provinces and cities have tested all candidates for COVID-19 before the exam, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.

Candidates sat for the first test of Vietnamese literature on Wednesday morning before taking the math test in the afternoon, both of which are compulsory subjects for all test-takers, according to the Ministry of Education and Training’s direction.

On Thursday, they will do three other tests of choice, including one in the 'foreign language' category; one among physics, chemistry, and biology in the 'natural science' classification; and another among history, geography, and civic education in the 'social science' group.

On Wednesday morning, Pham Ngoc Thuong, Deputy Minister of Education and Training, visited northern Bac Giang Province, one of the largest epicenters of Vietnam in the fourth COVID-19 wave, to oversee the high school graduation exam.

Although the spread of COVID-19 in the province has generally been put under control, local authorities still had to suspend an exam venue at a high school after a student tested positive for COVID-19 during the screening process.

In southern Can Tho City, students had to endure a short shower before they reached exam rooms and took their first test.

“It has been raining since the early hours of the morning. I had to ask my friend to drive me to the venue,” said Nguyen Dang Thanh, a twelfth-grade student of Chau Van Liem High School in Can Tho.

“I’m slightly worried about the first day of the exam, but also confident about my performance in the literature subject.”

In the Mekong Delta’s Vinh Long Province, students showed up at exam venues as soon as 6:00 am to do check-in procedures.

As seen at the exam centers of Hoang Thai Hieu High School and Binh Minh High School, parents who accompanied their children had to pull over 50 meters away from the school gates and avoid forming large crowds in front of the schools.

“I’m worried about the COVID-19 situation, but hearing the at-risk exam officers were screened and superseded ahead of the test relieved me a little bit,” said Le Van Cong, a parent of a test-taker.

In Phu Loc District of the central province of Thua Thien-Hue, many students were seen donning raincoats on the way to exam venues due to a sprinkle in the morning.

A total of 13 students who live in cordoned areas in Loc Thuy Ward were allowed to leave to take the test at Thua Luu High School and Thua Luu Middle School.

They were transported to the exam venues on two specialized buses, and were told to do the test in isolated rooms.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam’s University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH) is considering awarding some US$1 million worth of scholarships to foreign students in the coming time, the school’s headmaster has said.

A total of 170 scholarships worth $1 million will be granted to international students in the academic year 2021-22, said Prof. Dr. Su Dinh Thanh, the UEH’s principal.

These scholarships include 100 undergraduate scholarships, 50 scholarships for master’s degree and 20 fellowship scholarships.

They will be granted during the official training period of the academic year, including funding of 50 to 100 percent of the tuition and boarding costs depending on the type of partial, full or excellent scholarships.

Such scholarships will be given to foreign students who are admitted into training programs taught in Vietnamese or English at the UEH, but they are not exchange students or those nominated for training under treaties.

In addition, scholarship winners must be those who have yet to receive any scholarship in Vietnam.

Foreign students do not need to prepare application for such scholarships, since the UEH will directly select qualified candidates from their enrollment documents and grant appropriate scholarships for them.

Excellent scholarships will be kept unchanged throughout the official study period, while full and partial scholarships will be subject to upgrade or downgrade depending on academic achievements of the beneficiaries of such scholarships, Dr. Thanh said.

“This policy aims to motivate students to strive for better schooling results to maintain their scholarship levels during their study at the school,” the principal added.

The UEH, established in 1976, has been detached from the Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City since 2000 to operate under the administration of the Ministry of Education and Training.

As shown on its website, the university has been recognized in the Top 1000 Best Business Schools globally, and in 2020 it was ranked in the Top 5 National Universities by several prestigious international publications in Vietnam.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@All four members of the Vietnamese national team have won silver medals at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) 2021 held online recently.

The four students winning the medals include Ho Ngoc Vinh Phat, Le Quang Huy, Truong Van Quoc Bao, and Nguyen Hoang Vu.

Phat and Huy are 12th graders at Quoc Hoc - Hue High School for Gifted Students in Thua Thien-Hue Province and the High School for Gifted Students in Natural Sciences under the Vietnam National University-Hanoi, respectively, while Bao and Vu are both 11th graders at Phan Boi Chau High School for Gifted Students in Nghe An Province.

The IOI 2021 was hosted by Singapore in the online format from June 19 to 25, attracting 351 contestants from 90 countries and territories.

The Vietnamese team took part in the competition at the University of Technology under the Vietnam National University-Hanoi.

Last month, at the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad, also organized virtually, Huy and Bao claimed two gold medals while Phat won a silver, along with three other teammates who bagged three bronzes.

Amid the complicated COVID-19 spread, Vietnam had fully prepared for its students to attend the IOI 2021, meeting the IOI organizing committtee’s requirements on both epidemic prevention and professionalism.

This is the second year that the IOI contest has been held online due to the COVID-19 impacts.

In the IOI 2020, the Vietnamese team snatched one gold medal, two silvers, and one bronze.

Vietnam has taken part in the IOI since 1989, when the first contest was held, and has so far won 17 gold, 41 silver, and 52 bronze medals.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam’s tertiary education has improved its profile on the global academic map with its two establishments finding their places among the world’s best young universities in 2021, according to the rankings of Times Higher Education.

The two national universities in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have respectively ranked in the tops 251 - 300 and 401+ in the Young University Rankings 2021 published by Times Higher Education (THE) magazine on Wednesday.

The prestigious rankings, intended for the world’s best universities that are 50 years old or younger, are prepared based on 13 separate indicators grouped under five categories: Teaching (30 percent of final score), research (30 percent), scientific citations (32.5 percent), international prospects (5 percent) and income (2.5 percent).

In this ranking, THE uses the same appraisal method as applied to its World University Rankings, but the weights of the above criteria have been adjusted to reflect the missions and roles of young universities.

In the Young University Rankings 2021, THE has appraised 475 higher education institutions from 68 countries and territories, an increase of 61 institutions compared to 2020.

Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University topped the 2021 rankings while South Korean universities won three places in the top 10 of the list.

The outstanding performance of young universities in South Korea reflects the growing trend of educational quality improvement as well as steady growth of higher education in Asia.

This is the first year that a large presence of Asian young universities has been seen in the top 10 of the annual Young University Rankings.

The UK continued dominating this year’s rankings with 37 universities, while India and Spain ranked second and third with 34 and 33 educational institutions, respectively.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Teachers at a foreign language center in Vietnam have recently complained that the establishment has failed to settle their remuneration payments for nearly two years.

Having many branches in Ho Chi Minh City, southern Binh Duong and Dong Nai Provinces, and central Da Nang City, the Saigon Vina Foreign Language Center (SGV) signs contracts with teachers for short-term courses, lasting less than three months each, with remuneration payment supposed to be made at the end of the courses.

However, many teachers have complained that they have not been paid for nearly two years.

S., a teacher at a SGV branch in Tan Phu District, Ho Chi Minh City, said he had repeatedly asked the center to pay up, but all he received were empty promises.

The center kept postponing the payment date, claiming that there was no source of income.

Meanwhile, all leaners are usually required to fulfill for their tuition fees at the beginning of each course, S. added.

Another teacher said she had spent the past months trying to claim VND30 million (US$1,300) worth of remuneration owed by the center.

“They promised to pay all of the money within one month if I agreed to teach one more course, but I have not received any penny up to date.”

H., who teaches Chinese at a branch in District 4, said her last course at SGV ended about two years ago, but the center still owes her VND12 million ($522).

N., another victim, said he has managed to claim VND4.5 million ($195) out of VND30 million ($1,300) after multiple “aggressive attempts.”

Another teacher said SGV has been paying him a small amount under VND1 million (VND1 million = $43.5) each month, but still owes him about VND10 million ($434).

The teacher also showed his text messages with a SGV accountant named Hung, who cited that the center had run out of money and had to borrow from multiple sources in order to pay its teachers.

During a conversation in February, Hung said that there was no source of income as no learner had signed up for weeks due to the pandemic.

In order to solve the issue, many teachers said they are planning to file a collective petition to competent authorities.

Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper reporters have been unable to contact any SGV leaders but a representative.

SGV still exists and may be able to pay all of its debts in the future, the representative stated.

“If you make a bigger deal out of this situation, we may end up declaring bankruptcy, and no debt will be settled,” he added.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Advertising their services in broad daylight, forgery service accounts on social media are promising fake degree certificates with identical design and stamps from those issued by top universities of Vietnam — for the cost of just a few million Vietnamese dong. (VND1 million = US$44).

To investigate these clandestine operations, a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper reporter went undercover and telephoned a man who claimed to provide certificate forgery services on social media.

The person quoted VND4 million (US$174) for a bachelor’s diploma, while a master’s degree could cost VND10 million ($436). Payment is only required when the final products arrive at the customer’s location.

As if to clear the unspoken doubt in the buyer’s mind, the enigmatic trafficker ascertained that his forged diploma would come with ten notarized copies, plus an academic transcript.

“Don’t worry, they can’t be detected with the naked eye,” he affirmed.

According to the dealer, his products are made out of blank diplomas issued by higher education institutions.

“This particular school admits 5,000 students per academic year, so they have to prepare 5,000 blank diplomas," he claimed.

"However, there’s no way all of these students are going to graduate, as they will quit along the way, leaving some diplomas unfilled.”

The man added that he was able to source these blanks and then use the ‘latest technology’ to produce identical replicas that even university officials cannot detect.

“Had my products been iffy, I would have been busted by now,” he doubled down.

Once the customer is convinced, the dealer would collect several personal details, including birth date, sex, and the university of choice that customer wants their name written next to on the diploma.

The man refused to give any preview of the product before sending it off, saying some customers have dodged payment after realizing photos of their forged certificates are enough to apply for jobs.

“I will get the certificates delivered to you in three days," he vowed.

"You can inspect it before paying."

Another forgery service provider on Facebook also promised counterfeit diplomas of mint quality, with wet signatures and a fail-proof guarantee against all notary services in Vietnam, for the price of VND8 million ($349).

According to the seller, his products, made from school-issued blanks, can be used to apply for jobs or promotions since employers barely ever cross-check the legitimacy of certificates with universities.

However, they cannot be used in applying for master’s programs, for the information on them would not match any records in the academia system.

Universities’ perspective

According to Nguyen Trung Nhan, head of academic affairs at the Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City, it is almost impossible for certificate blanks to be leaked from the school.

The school used to purchase certificate blanks from the Ministry of Education and Training, with the quantity strictly matching the number of confirmed graduates for the year.

Currently, the university is now manufacturing blanks in-house.

These blanks are stored in a room with three layers of lock, the keys to which are managed separately by three departments of the university.

After the list of graduates is confirmed, it requires the presence of all three departments to open the vault and obtain the correct number of blanks for certificate issuance.

Even if the blanks do get sneaked outside, universities can still easily expose forged certificates via cross-examination.

“We receive dozens of certificate cross-checking requests every week,” he said.

“There were times when we found 20 percent of scrutinized diplomas to be fake.

“The public can cross-check any certificate issued by us on the university’s official website.”

Bui Hoang Thang, head of academic affairs at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, also thinks that a leak of certificate blanks is highly improbable.

“Many recruiters are reaching out to us to cross-check the academic degrees of their candidates," Thang said.

"We weed out a lot of fakes from them.”

Diploma blanks are issued by Vietnam’s official money-printing agency and are equipped with anti-counterfeiting details that can only be detected by a few people in charge, said Pham Ngoc Minh, former head of academic affairs at the Banking University of Ho Chi Minh City.

With a strict manufacturing protocol, the smuggling of blanks is basically implausible.

“Modern printing technology can generate identical-looking copies of blanks, but I can spot a fake with just my eyes,” Minh claimed.

“On top of that, most headhunters are cross-checking candidates' diplomas directly with the universities or through their websites, which leaves no windows for fake diplomas to pass.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Teachers in Thach Ha District of Vietnam’s north-central Ha Tinh Province have prepared boxes of snacks, milk and books as items of comfort for a group of students who was quarantined inside a local school for suspicion of COVID-19 infections.

According to Dang Hong Quan, a military officer of Thach That's Tam Lam Huong Ward, over 30 students were sent to quarantine on Tuesday after coming in contact with a young COVID-19 patient at the library of Tan Lam Huong 1 Primary School.

A group with the majority being fourth- and fifth-graders, these students are undergoing a 21-day period of quarantine at the Tan Lam Huong Preschool.

The youngest quarantined child in the group is eight-month-old N.A.D., who is being taken care of by four-year-old sister N.T.V. and mother N.T.H. in the quaratine ward.

However, parents of many other students would not be allowed inside the quarantine zone since only direct contacts of a confirmed transmission case, as well as medical officers, are permitted to stay there.

Considering the situation, a group of teachers in the locale has packed boxes of snacks, milk and books to provide comfort for the students during isolation time.

They have even added hand written labels with uplifting notes to cheer the students up during the challenging time.

H., mother of two quarantined students in the group, showed her gratefulness for the support that her children received from medical officers and teachers.

“Their living environment suddenly turned upside down, but my children are adapting well.”

According to Nguyen Thanh Nga, head of the Thach Ha District Bureau of Education and Training, the library in question for COVID-19 transmissions gained permission to reopen on June 1.

Earlier, the library, as well as other education facilities in Ha Tinh, had been closed for nearly one month in an attempt to curb the fourth wave of COVID-19 tranmission of provincial authority.

After a group of students was sent to quarantine, local teachers and the provincial Youth Union have prepared packages of necessities as a gesture of care for the children.

“We hope that the gifts will help the students learn something and not waste their time in quarantine,” Nga said.

The organizing team had samples collected for COVID-19 testing on Sunday, while the others will experience sample collection on June 12.

The high school entrance exam, held every year around June for ninth-grade students as well as independent candidates, acts as a placement test for high schools in the city's K-12 system.

This year, more than 13,000 candidates in Da Nang will sit for the exam for three days, starting June 13.

However, public high schools in the city only announced around 60,000 slots, according to the municipal Department of Education and Training.

After having gone three weeks without any new COVID-19 cases in the community, Da Nang is looking to ease a social distancing mandate introduced in early May, allowing outdoor businesses and sit-in dining services to resume operations.

Da Nang has reported 158 infections and one death in the fourth wave of COVID-19 in Vietnam, which started on April 27.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Team BK M.C.E., consisting of eight first-year students at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), has successfully utilized the Internet of Things (IoT) and facial recognition technologies to create a screening system capable of monitoring the risk of COVID-19 infection at campus entrances.

The team’s system is centered around the idea of a screening booth which can check whether an occupant is wearing a face mask, as well as measure body temperature and dispense hand sanitizer.

The system also employs IoT and facial recognition technology to identify each occupant along with his/her staff or student ID number – a crucial aid in contact tracing efforts, according to BK M.C.E. member Cao Khanh Gia Hy.

The system has so far been endorsed by the university’s management, who both approved the idea as a university-level science project and granted the team access to the institution’s labs and materials.

HCMUT lecturers Assoc. Prof. Dr. Quan Thanh Tho, Dr. Le Thanh Long and Dr. Vo Thanh Hang mentored the team throughout the creation process.

The team is currently working to finalize the system’s software and hardware before installing it at the HCMUT campus in June, as requested by the school leaders.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@All students living at the dormitories of the Vietnam National University-Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) have had to move out to leave rooms for people needing to be quarantined for COVID-19 prevention.

According to the announcement of the VNU-HCM’s dormitory management center on Friday night, the students have to collect and move their belongings out of the dorm rooms by 5:00 pm on June 1.

Students hailing from virus-hit areas as announced by the Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control and some special cases can apply for the dorm management center’s consideration to remain in designated rooms.

Those allowed to continue staying are requested to strictly adhere to the management center’s regulations and COVID-19 measures.

Nearly 35,700 students board at the VNU-HCM dormitories, according to the management center.

Many of them have left for their hometowns since their universities switched to remote learning for coronavirus prevention.

This is not the first time the VNU-HCM dormitories have been requisitioned for quarantine purposes.

Between March and May 2020, VNU-HCM students spared their dorm rooms for quarantined people.

Established in 2000, the VNU-HCM dormitory system is the largest of its kind in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, the management center claimed on its website.

It covers an area of 50.77 hectares in Thu Duc City and is divided into two complexes, with 27 buildings from 15 to 16 floors and 20 buildings with five floors, able to provide rooms for nearly 60,000 students.

The requisition of the VNU-HCM dormitories comes as Ho Chi Minh City authorities are preparing for emergency situations in its current battle against COVID-19.

The southern metropolis has recorded several dozen local infections in this new wave, most associated with a religious mission in Go Vap District.

Vietnam has detected 3,594 domestic infections in 32 provinces and cities since April 27, when the fourth wave broke out in the Southeast Asian country, according to the Ministry of Health’s data.

The nation has recorded 6,657 cumulative COVID-19 patients since the virus first emerged in it on January 23, 2020.

Recoveries have hit 2,896 while 47 virus-related fatalities have been documented so far.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tran Cao Quanh has spent more than 10 years providing education for children with special needs and joining hands with his colleagues in going to great lengths to help their students even amid COVID-19.

As a freshman of the department of educational psychology at Hue University in Hue City, located in central Vietnam, Quanh never thought that one day he would be working with special needs children.

His vision at the time was to become a university lecturer or a high school vocational teacher in his hometown.

Unexpectedly, Quanh was selected for a special training program with German special needs education experts.

He has been in close contact with autistic children ever since and his passion for the job has slowly built.

Simply a calling

C. is the mother of seven-year-old P., a child diagnosed with autism at the age of two.

Every single morning, P. would not be willing to leave his mother’s side to step in class unless teacher Quanh was there to welcome him.

Amid his shrieking and crying, the 32-year-old teacher appeared, saying, “Has P. come already? Come here with me, boy!”

By instinct, the autistic child let go of his mother’s hands and flung himself into Quanh’s arms.

“Many [special needs] children are rejected by kindergartens because it is hard for them to blend in with their peers,” said Quanh.

“They should not be subject to such discrimination.”

His first job recommendation was to be a practitioner at Tinh Truc Gia – a vocational center for disabled teenagers in Hue City, which is the capital of Thua Thien-Hue Province.

However, it was the age group that concerned the young man.

“How about younger children diagnosed with autism?" he wondered.

"With timely intervention, they will have a much better chance of socialization."

Quanh left the job at Tinh Truc Gia and came to the Early Intervention Center in Hue.

This center provides diagnosis and admission to autistic children two years old and above.

A job of joy

There are over 20 autism-affected children at the Early Intervention Center. They are placed in two groups.

The first group is mostly newcomers who learn fundamental self-catering skills.

The second group – the preschoolers – practice writing and reading.

As COVID-19 struck, the center had to close following instructions from the provincial authorities.

School suspension was a major concern for teachers, according to Le Thi Kim Anh, director of the Early Intervention Center.

Their children run the risk of a drastic psychological and biological change over the break, causing rehabilitation a possible challenge.

The teachers, therefore, have decided to visit their children at their private homes to make sure their education continues.

“We are fortunate to have such devoted teachers like Quanh and Cuong," Anh said, referring to another teacher.

"They don’t mind the lengths it takes to help the kids."

Providing this service in the home requires extra preparation on the part of the teachers, according to Quanh.

In case of children’s bites or self-harm behaviors, the teachers are on their own to dissolve the tension.

During his decade of hard work, Quanh and his colleagues have experienced serious injuries from the children’s scratches and bites.

“Once I was carrying this speech delay kid to class when he suddenly bit me in the ear," Quanh recalled.

"It was bleeding.

“It hurt for a week.

"There’s still a scar there.”

“Did you ever think of quitting this job as it’s so intense,” a reporter from Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper asked Quanh.

The teacher acknowledged the pressure from the daily loud noises.

“But if everyone thought of it this way, then what would happen to the children?” said Quanh.

“Who would go to the front line if everyone was scared of death?”

The job, however tough, brings him joy.

Looking at a child sitting next to him, he said, “I cried big when he enunciated ‘dad’ and ‘mom’ for the first time.

"The child was diagnosed with delayed speech.

“Another child who developed speech late made it to first grade after several years with us, and he even did very well academically.”

Quanh is married to his colleague, Tran Thi Hong. They hosted a simple wedding reception with the presence of their own autistic children.

“Perhaps it’s these children that brought us together,” said Quanh.

“It felt strangely happy to see their smiles at our wedding party.”

A vocational center for special needs children

There is currently a shortage of environments for autistic children to transfer to after their successful intervention, according to Anh, director of the Early Intervention Center in Hue.

She further explained that the majority of intervention schools in Hue are private businesses, which are not sufficiently funded to establish vocational centers for the children.

“Besides intervention in their behaviors and provision of knowledge, we try to find vocational partners so that the children can learn a trade,” said Anh.

“In the long term, however, I hope the authorities in Thua Thien-Hue Province will build a vocational school just for autistic students.

"That will pave the way even more for their socialization.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnamese students claimed two gold medals at the 2021 Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO), which took place last weekend.

Aside from the gold medals, they also pocketed one silver and three bronzes, the Ministry of Education and Training confirmed on Wednesday.

With this result, Vietnam ranked fourth among the 35 participating countries and territories at the event, following China, Iran, and Japan.

This year’s APIO was hosted by Indonesia on May 22 and 23, but the event was organized virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Vietnamese team, which included 15 contestants, competed at the University of Engineering and Technology under the Vietnam National University-Hanoi.

The gold medals went to Le Quang Huy, a 12th grader from High School for Gifted Students in Natural Sciences under the Vietnam National University-Hanoi, and Truong Van Quoc Bao, an 11th grader from Phan Boi Chau High School for the Gifted in the north-central province of Nghe An.

Ho Ngoc Vinh Phat, who studies in 12th grade at Quoc Hoc – Hue High School for the Gifted in the central province of Thua Thien - Hue, won the silver medal.

The three bronze medals belonged to two 12th graders in Ho Chi Minh City and northern Hai Duong Province, and a 10th grader in Hanoi.

The 2021 APIO attracted 845 contestants, 228 of whom were nominated for medals.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@By definition, the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is meant for candidates who apply for higher education or academia. Nevertheless, well-to-do parents in Vietnam are preparing their children for IELTS tests in a bid to secure them spots at top K-12 facilities – all while they have barely graduated elementary school.

In recent years, the IELTS certificate has emerged as a new norm for English proficiency assessment in Vietnam, with top colleges and high schools accepting the test results during their evaluation of candidates.

The test results have even been adopted by a middle school, which just announced that candidates applying for grade six will get 20 bonus points in evaluation if they score in the 3.0 band or above on the IELTS test.

Burning through money

Minh Hieu, 36, a parent in Thu Duc City under Ho Chi Minh City, has been scrambling to find an IELTS prep class for her son during his summer break.

As a recent outbreak in Vietnam forced his school to shutter in early May, his summer break started a few weeks earlier than expected, which, as Hieu sees it, is more time for her kid to reach the goal of band 5.0 on the IELTS test before the next school year.

He has just turned eleven, which may sound too early for the English paper.

Nevertheless, Hieu is committed when it comes to her plan, as it would engender 'a great leap' for her child to enter a good middle school.

“I have thought it all out," she said.

"With an overall score of 5.0 in IELTS, my son would not have to worry about the English subject at school.

"It only takes three months in the summer, but he gets exemption [from English classes] for the next four years.”

After weighing up between three IELTS centers in Thu Duc City and Binh Thanh District, Hieu finally opted for an ‘intensive class' with six hours of lessons per day, five days a week for three months.

More specifically, students would have to sit in front of the computer for three hours in the morning from 8:00 am for grammar, vocabulary, and reading practices, then show up in the actual classroom for another three hours of listening, speaking, and writing lessons in the evening.

For the price of no less than VND50 million (US$2,200), the intensive program promises IELTS test results of 5.0 and above for all students by the end of the course.

In a similar fashion, Ngoc Duyen, 45, parent of a seventh-grader in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, has registered her kid for private tutoring sessions with an American teacher living in Vung Tau City.

Duyen’s objective is clear: her kid needs to achieve IELTS band 5.0 by the next school year and band 6.5 one year later to qualify for high school programs abroad.

If her child fails to get a scholarship to fly out of Vietnam, the IELTS score would still be of great help for him in domestic K-12 study, Duyen added.

Pre-IELTS

Pre-empting a surge in demand for IELTS training for kids, English centers in major cities have launched ‘pre-IELTS’ programs, or other prep courses to provide foundational knowledge for students before the main lessons.

The majority of these courses last three to six months, with a focus on grammar and vocabulary.

They may cost each student VND3-8 million ($130-346) depending on the popularity of training centers, teachers, and class intensity.

During a phone call with a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper reporter, a telemarketer of an English center in Binh Thanh District, Ho Chi Minh City advertised their pre-IELTS program as one based on the ‘Cambridge’ curriculum, pivoting toward building foundational knowledge for kids before future IELTS tests.

Students graduating from the course can proceed to an actual IELTS training program that promises band 7.0-7.5 on the IELTS test for learners.

“IELTS is getting more advantageous as it is favored by many universities during their admission assessment," the telemarketer claimed.

"An IELTS certificate also exempts students from the English test during the high school entrance exam.”

However, the test itself is not recommended for individuals under 16 years old, as stated by the British Council, co-owner and organizer of the IELTS exam in Vietnam.

Echoing the sentiment, Nguyen Duc Thinh, 27, winner of British Council’s IELTS Prize in 2019, advised against subjecting students to training for the IELTS test too early.

The test demands not only good speaking and pronunciation skills, but also an understanding of social issues, spanning from law, the environment to public health, among others, during the speaking and writing tests, which may put inexperienced adolescents at a disadvantage.

Phung Quang Huy, 25, an IELTS prep teacher in Hanoi, also cautioned parents on the risk of sending their children to IELTS training without establishing foundational knowledge for them.

Without a solid basis, these students would turn to test-taking tips and tricks, which may stump them in further efforts to learn the language.

“Students can already amass a decent understanding of lexicon and grammar with English lessons at their school," Huy said.

“They should start thinking about sitting the IELTS exam in late middle school or early high school.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The ITU Virtual Digital World 2020, an event co-organized by Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), kicked off on Tuesday evening.

Themed ‘Building A Digital World. Together,’ the three-day online event brings together more than 50 ITU member countries.

The technological foundation used during the event was developed by Vietnam's military-run Viettel telecom group.

In his opening remarks, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said the Vietnamese government has paid attention to telecommunication infrastructure development and considered IT one of the top priorities.

Digital transformation has been regarded as a crucial solution for helping the country develop more rapidly and sustainably, Dam added.

The deputy PM reiterated the Vietnamese government’s commitments to supporting and coordinating with the ITU and its member countries in building a digital world for peace, cooperation, and prosperity.

Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said Vietnam’s digital infrastructure is now ready for a digital-based economy and society.

Vietnamese technologies not only deal with domestic but also global issues, the minister said, adding that the country is striving to make technology a driver of development and global cooperation.

ITU Secretary General Houlin Zhao said Vietnam is an important partner in many markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean region, which has made the nation become a bright example in IT development to many other developing countries.

ITU is a United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies.

The first ITU telecom event was held in 1971. Since its 40th anniversary in 2011, the event has been held on an annual basis in a different location worldwide.

The 2020 edition is named ITU Digital World and takes place online from October 20 to 22.

The ITU Digital World 2021 will be back in its usual form in Hanoi in October next year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A golf tournament aimed at supporting Vietnamese start-ups first organized by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper last year is set to return for the second edition this September.

‘Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020’ is meant to support start-ups in the beginning period of their business by helping to connect young entrepreneurs with seasoned and successful business people.

During the tourney, which will be launched on September 18, the organizers will also present awards to the most excellent entrepreneurs of the start-up community.

Excited to participate

Many entrepreneurs, who are experienced golfers, are excited to take part in this year's competition. In their opinion, the tournament will give them a chance to both play golf and help the upcoming generation of business people.

“I appreciate Tuoi Tre for holding such a golf competition to promote start-ups and help experienced entrepreneurs have another approach to supporting them,” said Le Hai Binh, founder and chairman of the IT services company Mat Bao Group, who is also a golfer taking part in the tournament.

“The competition will provide young entrepreneurs with opportunities to meet with their potential investors among the golfers who participate in the tournament."

The competitors interviewed by Tuoi Tre applauded the paper's idea to create ‘a playground’ for start-up owners.

Meeting with other entrepreneurs on the golf course is certain to bring a different vibe than traditional environments like offices or working space, and may help generate stronger bonds between the participants, they said.

Overcoming COVID-19

Start-ups have been hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020 was also rescheduled to begin in September instead of April, when it was held last year, because of the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of the global health crisis, many entrepreneurs consider the tournament an occasion for them to support young entrepreneurs in getting over the adversities of the pandemic, especially since it is currently under control in Vietnam.

“The current situation is different from last year’s. The pandemic has presented start-ups with difficulty in accessing funds as almost all companies are impacted by the coronavirus,” Binh remarked.

“Of course [potential investors] must fight for the survival of their own companies first before considering investing in others."

According to Binh, in 'the new normal,' customers are likely to spend less so start-ups in the fields of services, travel, and food would be considerably impacted.

“Despite that, I am not quite pessimistic because there are always opportunities in challenging situations,” Binh said.

The chairman of Mat Bao Group believes that during the pandemic, entrepreneurs who can flexibly adapt to the new situation will emerge victorious and even achieve new breakthroughs.

“Tuoi Tre’s golf tournament for start-ups will offer them the opportunity to do so,” Binh said.

Lawyer Nguyen Thi Thanh Nha, legal director of the investment firm Openasia Group, said her experience as a shareholder in a few start-ups when she was younger helps her understand the advantages that start-ups have, such as youth, ambition, and knowledge.

But she also acknowledges the rigors they must face on the way to success such as networking, calling for suitable investors, and developing relationships with other start-ups.

“Participating in the [golf tournament] will help them partly solve these problems and build more new business relationships,” said Nha, who has played golf for 12 years.

“Business opportunities may come to them unexpectedly during this tournament, who knows?”

Honoring 25 excellent start-ups

With the aim of promoting and empowering the start-up community both in Ho Chi Minh City and the rest of Vietnam, Tuoi Tre and partners jointly present the Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020.

The tourney will also mark the 75th anniversary of Vietnam’s National Day (September 2), the 89th founding anniversary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union (March 26), and the 45th anniversary of the founding of Tuoi Tre (September 2).

Dozens of inspiring start-up stories have been published in Tuoi Tre in various formats since July in the lead-up to the tournament.

The opening gala is scheduled to take place on September 18 at the Long Thanh Golf Club in Dong Nai Province, 35 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For students from poor families, education is the best way to help themselves and their families get out of their plight and lift their communities out of poverty. Ironically, after all the effort of studying in difficulty throughout 12 years from elementary to high school, these students even with high academic records to enter college are unable to live their dreams because of their family’s financial situations. They simply cannot afford tuition fees and other expenses of higher education.

The “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” scholarship program of Tuoi Tre Newspaper has made great strides in helping these poor students. This program gave the first scholarship in Quang Tri Province in 2003. It has gradually spread to other provinces and now it covers the whole country.

Over 17 years, this scholarship program has helped more than 19,000 new college students who otherwise would not be able to afford higher education. Last year, there were more than 1,200 new college students from all over the country receiving scholarships.

Each poor student is given a standard scholarship of VND10 million (US$430). Very poor students are granted special scholarships worth VND15 million (US$645) each.

This year due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be more poor new college students in need of help, although the donation could be less than last year.

We would like to appeal for new and current donors to “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” so that at least 1,000 poor students around the country, among them 80 from Thua Thien-Hue Province, could receive scholarships this academic year.

Please send your donation to Bao Tuoi Tre, bank account: 113000006100 (for VND) at VietinBank, Branch 3, HCM City; or bank account: 0071370195845 (for USD) or 0071140373054 (for EUR) at Vietcombank, HCM City Branch, Swift Code: BFTVVNVX007; for “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” Scholarship Program.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A charity initiative administered 700 care packages on the weekend to workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Binh Tan District, as well as Lao and Cambodian students in the Pre-University College of Ho Chi Minh City.

The initiative was undertaken by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, supermarket chain Saigon Co.op, and e-commerce platform Shopee, with support from the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.

The organizers prepared essentials, including rice, cooking oil, and fish sauce, and divided them into thousands of gift packages, each of which was priced at VND145,000 (US$6.3) on Shopee.

The packages were delivered on Saturday directly to the beneficiaries, including 500 workers who are struggling financially in Binh Tan District, 200 Lao and Cambodian students and those of Vietnam's ethnic minorities at the Pre-University College in District 5.

Among the recipients was Tran Ngoc Sang, a manufacturing worker in Binh Tan District who hails from Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta.

“I feel blessed to receive these essential items, which will help ease the burden on my family during social distancing,” said the sole breadwinner for the family of seven.

Other demographics, including youths in locked-down areas of Hoc Mon District, as well as unofficial workers in Cat Lai Ward of Thu Duc City, also received the care packages of the initiative.

After the first run on Saturday and Sunday, the organizers plan to hand another 2,500 packages to struggling people in cordoned-off areas in Ho Chi Minh City on July 22 and 25.

They are currently accepting donations on Shopee and ShopeePay.

In June and early July, many working-class residents in Ho Chi Minh City suffered from lay-offs or reduced income as the southern metropolis emerged as Vietnam’s coronavirus epicenter, with its caseload rising in the thousands daily.

The alarming situation has prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home, effectively cutting off the livelihoods of many unofficial workers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In his ongoing sketch project, Ho Chi Minh City-based artist Le Sa Long strives to portray the small acts of generosity among residents, a virtue that has once again been highlighted during the tough time of social distancing in the southern city.

An established painter in the domestic art scene who has multiple solo exhibitions and awards under his belt, Long picked up urban sketching as a habit in mid-May.

He wandered the city which he has called home for over 30 years for live sketches for a few weeks, until it began to be put under social distancing measures on May 31 and later a citywide ban on non-essential travels on June 15.

Cooped up at home under this hibernation phase, Long decided to create a new series of sketches inspired by heartwarming photos of Saigonese that he spotted on social media and in newspapers.

He has so far portrayed 40 vignettes on paper and is planning to create more.

“These images of Saigonese residents helping each other out during hard times touched my soul," he said.

"I was inspired to translate these moments and put them under a new light through the language of art.”

A standout in his collection is the vignette of a five-year-old wearing PPE overalls, standing by herself, waving goodbye to the camera before boarding an ambulance to enter quarantine.

Another sketch pays tribute to pop singer Ha Anh Tuan, who donated 25 metric tons of rice to help the struggling citizens.

Other optimistic news stories, including no-cost grocery stores for the needy, community fridges, and charity efforts benefiting pandemic-struck people, are also portrayed.

The sketches have earned Long showers of praises after they were posted on his social media account.

Many individuals have even asked to buy his pieces online, despite not having seen them in person, Long revealed.

He plans to auction several slice-of-life works to raise funds for charity causes for underprivileged people in the city, while portrait pieces of Ha Anh Tuan or frontline doctors will be gifted to the respective subjects as a tribute.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Authorities in several Vietnamese localities, including Hanoi, have required all students to stay home and switch to remote learning from Tuesday due to the complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The northern provinces of Ha Nam, Vinh Phuc, and Yen Bai, central Quang Nam Province, and central Da Nang City took similar moves.

The students will not go to school until further notice.

The timeline for tests and examinations will remain unchanged in the meantime.

Representatives of the education departments of Hanoi, Ha Nam, Yen Bai and Vinh Phuc said they would consider delaying the end of the school year and propose adjustments to the schedules for entrance exams to middle schools and high schools and the national high school graduation exam if the school closure lasts more than two weeks.

At least 37 local infections have been recorded in multiple Vietnamese localities, including Hanoi, Ha Nam, Vinh Phuc, Yen Bai, Quang Nam and Da Nang, since April 27 after Vietnam had gone about a month without detecting any community transmission.

The country has confirmed 2,985 coronavirus infections, including 1,607 local cases and 35 deaths, since the virus first struck the country on January 23, 2020, according to the health ministry’s data.

Recoveries reached 2,560 as of Tuesday morning.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@K-12 schools in Ho Chi Minh City will be closed down from Monday next week for fear of COVID-19 spread, the municipal People’s Committee said in a fiat on Thursday.

The closure is to be enforced even when only one local case has been recorded in the city since the coronavirus re-emerged in Vietnam last week.

Preschools will shut down from Monday while other levels will switch to remote learning, according to the fiat.

The 2020-21 school year is scheduled to end within this month in accordance with a plan by the People’s Committee.

More than 91,000 teachers, employees, and students left and returned to Ho Chi Minh City during a four-day holiday starting on Friday last week, the local Department of Education and Training said on Wednesday.

One employee and 14 students flew on the same flight as a COVID-19 patient in Dong Nai Province, which borders the city.

They live in Phu Nhuan District, Tan Binh District, Tan Phu District, Binh Thanh District, District 1, District 5, and Thu Duc City.

“Those people have been quarantined and had their samples taken for COVID-19 testing,” the department said.

The department has also identified 134 people who came into direct contact with these 15 and asked them to self-isolate at home.

Vietnam has confirmed 120 domestically-transmitted cases in over a dozen provinces and cities since April 27, when the virus made a comeback after the country had spent over a month detecting zero local infections, according the Ministry of Health’s data.

Only one of the patients was registered in Ho Chi Minh City.

Health workers have warned the city is at high risk as it is a busy economic hub, while border jumpers from China and Cambodia, which is grappling with severe outbreaks, have been detected there over the past few weeks.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For most of Vietnam’s fresh graduates, life after their university graduation is much tougher than those four years of being a student.

It has been a growing and worrying trend in Vietnam over the last few years that fresh graduates, even those with a master’s degree, fail to land a suitable job and have to accept working in fields that have nothing to do with the majors in which they are professionally trained.

It is not uncommon to see people with university degrees do laborious jobs, become shopkeepers or even xe om (motorbike taxi) drivers, where no qualifications are needed.

There are now some 100,000 university graduates doing unskilled jobs, according to the military-run Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People’s Army) newspaper.

By the end of this year, Vietnam is expected to see yet another 200,000 young people become unemployed after graduation, Radio the Voice of Vietnam reported in mid-February.

Dao Quang Vinh, head of the labor science institute under the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs, confirmed the gloomy outlook with the Hanoi-based radio station.

Experts have pointed the finger at the training quality of local universities, with impractical and outdated curricula, and suggested that the number of graduates is bigger than the labor market demand.

The issue has caught the media’s attention again after more and more have chosen to become GrabBike drivers, or ‘hi-tech’ xe om, as a temporary solution to their unemployment.

Quick and immediate cash

T.D.M., who graduated from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Law in 2014, is now a full-time GrabBike driver.

The reason, M. said, is simple: he makes more money from the unskilled job than a position at a law office, and more importantly, the cash comes straight into his pocket on a daily basis.

“You don’t have to wait until the monthly salary day,” he told Thanh Nien (Young People) newspaper in August.

There were times when M. could make VND4 million (US$176) a week, or an ample VND16 million ($700) a month.

“A job at a law office pays me VND2.5 million ($110),” he said.

M. said he is happy working as a xe om driver, with ‘fresh cash’ earned every day that helps him support his parents back home in the central province of Quang Ngai.

The biggest problem, however, is that he has to hide his real job from the family.

“Never do I dare to tell them that I am a xe om,” he said. “My parents still believe I am working at a law office.”

For many families in rural areas, having a child complete a college degree in Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi is a huge source of pride.

“My parents would definitely be unable to accept the truth,” M. said.

Raison d'être

According to experts, one of the main reasons for the glut of university graduates unable to find a suitable position is that what they are trained is of little use in the actual job market.

“Many business leaders have pointed out that the curricula of many universities in Vietnam are problematic and outdated,” Prof. Truong Nguyen Thanh, vice chancellor of Hoa Sen University in Ho Chi Minh City, told Thanh Nien.

“While technology is changing rapidly – we will have a new piece of tech every six months or a year – what is taught in the four-year university program [in Vietnam] remains unchanged for decades.”

Prof. Thanh added that in the U.S., there are also graduates who have to do jobs different from their majors. “But the jobs are of the ‘same level’ as their qualifications,” he noted.

“For example, an IT graduate can work as a PC repairman, but not jobs that have nothing in common with his trained skills.”

In an opinion piece on Radio the Voice of Vietnam in July, writer Vu Hanh put the blame on the training program.

It is not really difficult to enter college these days in Vietnam.

Some private universities are willing to admit students with average entrance scores or lower, so long as they meet their enrolment targets every new academic year.

These students will easily graduate, but as “a weak human resource base” that fails to meet the high demand of recruiters, Hanh wrote.

“There are job fairs with thousands of vacancies available but the recruiters fail to find any suitable candidates,” she said.

“Even when an employer decides to recruit fresh graduates, that company will have to waste time on ‘retraining’ these candidates so they can really start doing their job.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many universities in Ho Chi Minh City have provided coronavirus vaccination for more than 10,000 students, with priority given to frontline volunteers.

One of the schools is the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, where nearly 3,000 students have registered for their second vaccine shots, said Truong Van Dat, head of the university’s student affairs department.

“Such registration is applied to those students who have got the first jabs at least six weeks before. The school has planned to give the second injections to them from August 13 to 22,” the department head said.

The university has given the first injections to all of its students staying in the city since late June, with priority intended for those who have engaged in COVID-19 frontline activities, Dat added.

To date, more than 4,800 students, including 1,600 frontline volunteers, of the medical school have got their first doses.

The municipal Center for Disease Control has since June coordinated with the university hospital to offer COVID-19 inoculation to students from all universities and colleges participating in epidemic prevention and control efforts. As yet, thousands of such students have been inoculated.

Dr. Ha Thanh Dat, from the University of Medicine Pham Ngoc Thach, said that more than 3,000 students of the school have been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, of whom 200 have received two full doses.

At the Ho Chi Minh City University of Industry, the first vaccine shots have been given to 250 students, of whom 180 are boarders while the rest partake in the COVID-19 fight, said university president Phan Hong Hai.

“Our volunteer students are going to receive the second jabs. The school has made a list of 2,500 students who are living in Ho Chi Minh City for vaccination,” the president added.

Meanwhile, 89 boarders of the University of Science have been provided with the first jabs, said Tran Vu, head of the school’s student affairs department.

The Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology also said all 850 students and staff at its dormitory in District 10 have been given the first doses.

Throughout the city, the numbers of people receiving the first and second injections have so far reached more than 3.85 million and 118,000, respectively, according to the Ministry of Health’s data.

Since the pandemic hit the country in early 2020, the city has documented 135,224 COVID-19 cases including 3,582 deaths, while the corresponding figures of the country are 241,543 and 4,487, the ministry reported on Thursday morning.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sixty-five among every 100 high school students in Ho Chi Minh City suffer from a mental disorder when preparing for exams, recent research showed.

The findings are featured in the research titled “Tỉ lệ rối nhiễu tâm trí và các yếu tố liên quan ở học sinh THPT” (The portion of mental disorder on high school students and related factors) by Nguyen Thi My Chi, a bachelor of public health from the HCMC Medicine and Pharmacy University.

The study which was carried on 500 students in the 10th, 11th and 12th grades in the city was released last July and presented at the conference of young scientists of the university early this year.

According to the research, there is a strict relation between a student’s mental disorder and their studying.

Specifically, the pressure from the school curricula, exams and the relation with teachers are the main causes of the illness.

Over 73 percent of surveyed students suffer a mental disorder because of their curricula and 69.2 percent of them have the illness due to the pressure from exams, while 71.3 percent are mentally disordered due to pressure from teachers.

Students under pressure from school curricula and teachers have 1.12 times higher mental disorder than students without the pressure.

“This is a high rate. It is maybe because students today don’t have much time to entertain themselves due to the tense schedule of studying and the large amount of homework,” Nguyen Thi My Chi said. “This is a common situation in modern society. Vietnamese people always think that studying is a way to get out of poverty so family and school usually put a lot of pressure on students.”

Hard to be diagnosed

According to Huynh Ho Ngoc Quynh, an instructor from the HCMC Medicine and Pharmacy University’s Public Health Department, mental disorder is the situation in which mental heath deviates beyond one’s limit to self-control.

The patient’s ability to recover is very high if the illness is diagnosed soon. However, mental disorders are hard to diagnose and the situation will turn into depression or schizophrenia if the ailment is not found out soon.

A student with mental disorder in the first phase will not have clear expressions of the illness and can study and work like a normal person.

To identify who is at risk needs specialized measurements. Asian, especially Vietnamese people, have still had a taboo on the phrase “mental illness” so it is not easy to identify the risk of mental disorder in the community.

The World Health Organization statistics show that mental disorder ranks 5th on the list of ten causes for human illness.

The organization has also recently identified that mental illness will become common in the future, ranking first in human illness lists, beating over HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular and infectious diseases.

Solutions

Instructor Quynh also said that solutions for the situation, like reducing the class time or reforming school curriculum, have been carried out loosely and the current education system still has not had very efficient reformation.

The research’s author My Chi suggests that schools create channels for students to speak their thoughts through mailboxes, Facebook pages or forums because most students do not have a place to ease their stress.

Mental health care also needs to be brought to school in order to discover students with mental disorder before it becomes serious.

Family is also an important factor to help students overcome the illness by understanding, respecting and saving time for them.

Students themselves should join outdoor clubs, balance their school schedule and entertaining activities and not to use stimulants and violence to ease stress.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police in Ho Chi Minh City are searching for the directors of two English language centers after they were accused of appropriating tuition fees from many learners.

Officers under the municipal Department of Public Security confirmed on Saturday they were verifying the accusation against Eagle Education International English Center and Eagle English International School.

The two facilities reportedly charged learners’ tuition fees but did not run enough courses as promised.

Early reports showed that the directors of the two venues, Tran Minh Tuan and Nguyen Truong Giang, had left their places of residence since December 2020.

Officers thus announced they were searching for Tuan, a 30-year-old man from the northern province of Hai Duong, and Giang, a 22-year-old person from the northern province of Ha Nam.

The two are required to contact the police station at 674 3 Thang 2 Street in Ward 14, District 10, Ho Chi Minh City (phone number: 0914840681).

Residents who have information on Tuan and Giang’s whereabouts are advised to contact police officers at the above address and phone number.

If the two individuals do not show up within 15 days, officers will conclude that they have run away and will deal with the case according to the law.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The abrupt enforcement of a new movement declaration system at COVID-19 checkpoints in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday baffled the majority of commuters and clogged up traffic flow for hours.

The novel movement declaration requirement, devised by the Ministry of Public Security and considered part of the national population database, was simultaneously introduced at COVID-19 checkpoints in the city around 1:00 pm on Saturday.

This is meant to keep track of people's travels in case contact tracing is needed to stall coronavirus spread.

As witnessed by a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper correspondent, all commuters passing these checkpoints would be pulled over and could only leave when they scanned a QR code on their phones, completed their movement declaration online, captured a new QR code, and presented it to checkpoint officers to see if it matched the database.

The steps were deemed rather complicated and time-consuming by the public due to a variety of reasons, including the reduced sensitivity of mobile phone cameras for QR scanning under broad daylight, or the lack of Internet connection at checkpoints.

Several officers were ill-prepared for their duties, as the batteries on their mobile devices died while they logged commuters’ information.

“Some senior citizens had their smartphones with them, but did not know how to declare the information on the apps and required officers' help,” an checkpoint officer explained.

“Some individuals took as long as 15 minutes to complete their declaration.”

The unoptimized process impeded traffic flow, causing lines of delayed vehicles to snake out as far as a few kilometers.

On Phan Dang Luu and Le Van Duyet Streets in Binh Thanh District, hundreds of motorbikes were seen struggling to inch toward the checkpoints, where officers were still strictly upholding the declaration protocol.

“Residents can scan the QR code and declare their information at home," said Senior Lieutenant Colonel Huynh Thi Thu Trang, a senior official at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Public Security.

"They will receive another QR code, which they can save to their phone and use for the next three days.

“When passing the checkpoints, they only need to bring up the QR image so officers can instantly check their information, reducing processing time and avoiding congestion.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Students in middle and high schools in Vietnam will be allowed to use their mobile phones in class for educational purposes, according to a new charter.

On Tuesday, the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training adopted a circular which sets out a new charter for middle schools and high schools across the Southeast Asian nation.

The circular, which is slated to take effect in early November this year, lifts an earlier outright ban on the use of mobile phones in class.

In this regard, Sai Cong Hong, deputy director of the ministry’s Secondary Education Department, told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper that the change aims to be aligned with the application of information technology in teaching.

“Students are allowed to use phones during class time, but only to serve learning purposes with their teachers’ permission,” said Hong, who added that the use of smartphones in the teaching and learning process is necessary.

In some practical situations, he said students need to use several features of their devices in order to fulfill their learning needs, such as to look up information and browse reference materials.

Second thought needed

The new rule has raised public concern in Vietnam over its supposed “detrimental” effects on students.

Anh Hoa, a Tuoi Tre reader, commented that students should not be allowed to use mobile phones during lesson time no matter the reasons.

The reader said it would be impossible for teachers to supervise students’ use of their devices to make sure it is for the right purposes.

Worse still, Hoa said, students will become reliant on online knowledge and information whose accuracy has yet to be verified.

Nguyen Bich Trang, the mother of a sixth grader at Tran Van On Middle School in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, told Tuoi Tre that the school has banned students from using mobile phones within its campus since the beginning of the 2020-21 academic year.

“The new rule by the Ministry of Education and Training gives parents like me a shock,” said Trang.

“Allowing students to use modern devices, including computers, tablets, or smartphones, is an inevitable need of today’s education, but I don’t think it is necessary for students to bring their phones into class to apply modern forms of teaching,” she explained.

The principal of a high school in the city’s Tan Phu District said, “We have banned students from using their mobile phones at school because they bring much more harm than benefits.”

The head teacher feared students would use their phones to set up gaming sessions with their peers after school, chat online in class, or arrange fist fights when there is conflict among them.

“Students will also sneakily visit their Facebook accounts or play games in class. It would be tough for teachers to supervise their students, due to overcrowded class sizes,” said the principal.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@More than 50 percent of students in both cities and rural areas are involved in school violence, according to a study released this week.

The research was done by Dr. Pham Minh Muc, from a research center under the Vietnam Institute of Education Sciences, and reported at a conference on reasons and solutions for school violence held by the institute in Hanoi on Wednesday.

According to Dr. Muc’s study, among 11 behaviors considered to be school violence, 38.49 percent of the students surveyed agreed that the most common is insulting.

Meanwhile, 38.49 percent thought school violence is a fight between two students and 35.32 percent chose scuffles between two groups of students.

Some others which are less common are mugging, hiring people to beat a schoolmate or assaulting teachers.

Meanwhile, the research showed that the most typical reaction of students under physical and mental school violence is keeping silent or asking for help from friends.

There has been a lack of counseling from schools, parents, and psychological experts.

Dr. Mac Van Trang, from the same institute, said the number of school violence cases is not as important as how serious they are.

“We only had fights between schoolboys before, now we have seen more and more brawls between schoolgirls,” Dr. Trang said.

“Female students also hire people to beat their schoolmates, besides insulting, stripping off their clothes, and filming and then posting it on the Internet,” he added. “In some cases, fights start not from conflicts but simply from a suggestion of class presidents.”

Reasons and solutions

According to Dr. Muc’s research, 60 percent of the causes of school violence often come from family and parent issues.

Dr. Trang also said cruel fights between students can be the result of adults’ lifestyle, as well as violent games and movies.

Dr. Nguyen Thi Thanh Mai from the education sciences institute said school violence is an expression of the crisis of adolescence when young people are easily affected by their living environment, and do not receive enough sharing, counseling and educating from adults.

In addition, experts at the conference also mentioned the heavy school curriculum and the lack of healthy playgrounds and fondness from families as reasons for school violence.

In Dr. Muc’s research, 80 percent of the people polled said it is an urgent need to have counseling rooms at schools for the problem.

Though the model of consulting rooms has been adopted during the last few years, it has been not very efficient and has not become a must-do at schools either.

At the conference, many experts concurred that there should be a legal framework for schools and educational management agencies to run psychological counseling courses in schools.
