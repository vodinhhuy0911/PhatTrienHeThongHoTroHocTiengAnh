E-commerce giant Shopee has officially announced the rebranding of food delivery service Now in Vietnam to ShopeeFood from August 18.

Now is a food delivery platform run by local tech firm Foody Corporation, 82 percent of whose shares were acquired by Singapore-based Internet company Sea Group in 2017.

According to the firm, the change of name will help it unify the brands in its ecosystem that includes e-commerce platform Shopee and e-wallet ShopeePay, which was renamed from AirPay in June, in order to enhance customer experience.

Following the rebranding, all existing rights of users and partners will remain the same, the company stated.

Users will only need to update their Now app to access the revamped services while account information, balance, and related benefits will not be affected.

In addition to food delivery app Now, the NowShip service will be renamed ShopeeExpress Instant.

Other food delivery brands operating in Vietnam include GrabFood powered by tech unicorn Grab, GoFood by Gojek, Baemin backed by South Korean unicorn Woowa Brothers, and homegrown Loship.

According to online statistics portal Statista, revenue from online food delivery in Vietnam stood at US$302 million in 2020 and is estimated to reach $557 million in 2024.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fertilizer prices have constantly soared from the beginning of this year and are forecast to jump further in the remaining months, concerning farmers and authorities in many rice farming places, heard a meeting organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Sunday.

Authorities in several provinces in the Mekong Delta region, which is the largest rice farming area in Vietnam, have called for solutions for stabilizing fertilizer rates.

Prices of domestically produced fertilizers have rocketed 24.3-83.7 percent, whereas those of imported products have soared 50-72.9 percent.

According to the Plant Protection Department (PPD) under the agriculture ministry, prices of the main raw materials for fertilizer production have advanced sharply in the past seven months.

Sulfur prices surged 233 percent to US$221 from $95 per metric ton, sulfuric acid jumped 232 percent, ammonia gas rose 220 percent, and apatite ore increased 7.7 percent.

Rising oil prices and a shortage of empty containers may have led freight rates to escalate three to five times.

Those factors are possibly the main reasons for fertilizers to have become more expensive over the past time, according to the PPD.

The department also forecast that fertilizer rates will shoot up further in August and remain high for the remainder of this year.

“In no way can farmers stand such price spikes,” said Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Tran Thanh Nam at Sunday’s meeting.

The prices of animal feed have also skyrocketed, according to Nam.

Meanwhile, agricultural products tend to get cheaper, according to deputy chairman of Soc Trang Province Duong Quoc Nam.

Echoing Nam's stance, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Minh Hoan expressed his concern, fearing that farmers may shun production activities in the coming rice farming seasons.

“This jeopardizes national food security as well as local and national development,” Hoan said.

The minister requested the Ministry of Industry and Trade to come up with solutions for lowering fertilizer prices.

“Enterprises should consider making a commitment not to increase prices and provide adequate agricultural materials for farmers,” Hoan suggested.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam’s leading private conglomerate Vingroup has launched a trial for level-four electric autonomous vehicles and expects to put its technological products into operation next year.

Vingroup Big Data Institute (VinBigdata) has researched and developed electric self-operating cars for use in tourist sites, resorts or smart cities.

The trial is underway on Hon Tre Island, Nha Trang City, Khanh Hoa Province, VinBigdata said.

At level four, a self-driving car can run at 30 kilometers per hour and provide its 23 passengers a smooth travel experience without the need for a driver at all.

The automated vehicle is equipped with a high-resolution map covering an area of up to 10 square kilometers, and has an optimal positioning ability with an error of only about five centimeters.

It is capable of identifying obstacles on its routes such as pedestrians, other vehicles, and signs with high accuracy thanks to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

In addition, it combines data between two lidars, which are distance sensors by light, and six 102-degree viewing angle cameras.

The autonomous vehicle can automatically decelerate from a distance of 30 meters, shift between lanes from a distance of 10 meters upon detection of obstacles, and automatically park, among other features.

The car can steer itself to another lane to avoid obstacles and then return to the initial lane, or it is able to operate on complex terrains such as hills.

VinBigdata’s electric self-driving cars are expected to be in use in 2022.

Current autonomous vehicle development can be divided into five levels.

The vehicle at level one can assist with some functions, but the driver still has to take the main responsibility for steering.

At level two, the vehicle can be partially self-operated, but the driver still has to monitor and intervene in a timely manner.

For vehicles at level three, they can drive by themselves under certain conditions without constant supervision.

A level-four vehicle is a fully autonomous system that requires no driver supervision, but is used in certain areas only.

Vehicles reaching level five have self-driving ability with all automated functions and operations as if they were directly steered by drivers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) has decided to close its office while still keeping the trading operations running after a slew of COVID-19 cases were detected among its stay-in staffers.

The country’s main exchange is currently listing 469 stocks with a combined market cap of over VND4,920 trillion (US$214 billion), or 78 percent of Vietnam's 2020 GDP.

The market announced on Monday that it has detected several coronavirus-positive cases after screening the 'three-on-the-spot' workers, also known as those working, having meals, and resting after work on the premises to maintain their duty while also reducing COVID-19 transmission risks.

The HOSE management has immediately informed authorities of the cases and rolled out safety measures as prescribed by current guidelines, including an office closure that started on Monday.

All in-person reception at the premises will be halted, while requests from company listings, stock trading firms, and related stakeholders will be handled online.

Meanwhile, stock trading operations on HOSE will be kept running as prepared in the stock market’s COVID-19 scenarios.

According to the State Securities Commission of Vietnam, HOSE has planned out responses for all conceivable circumstances, and it is capable of switching its control center to a new server in the system rather than being dependent on one physical location.

The stock exchange has prepared a secondary location in case of contingency, while all of its staffers have been put on rotating shifts since the fourth outbreak started in Vietnam in late April.

The market will be kept up and running in all scenarios, a State Securities Commission representative declared.

Vietnam had documented 215,560 COVID-19 cases by Monday morning, with 71,497 recoveries and 3,397 deaths, according to the health ministry.

The country has recorded 211,630 local infections in 62 provinces and cities, including 124,153 cases in Ho Chi Minh City, since the fourth wave began on April 27.

The mini-supermarket model is operated by Grove Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Store Chain and the municipal Department of Industry and Trade.

The bus is parked at one specific location each day and is often situated far away from regular markets and supermarkets.

Open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, it offers fresh meat, vegetables, fruits, and other essential products.

According to the observation of Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper reporters on Saturday, the bus was parked at 33 Chuong Duong Street in Linh Chieu Ward, Thu Duc City.

The mobile supermarket provided more than 100 kilograms of meat and 400 kilograms of fruits and veggies to local residents in the morning.

Nguyen Thi Ngoan, who resides in Thu Duc, said she was surprised that the products were fresh and sold at very reasonable prices.

A representative from Grove Fresh stated that only two to three customers are allowed to shop at the mini-supermarket at a time to ensure safety.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@VVietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has ordered the Ministry of Health to assist a local enterprise in purchasing Sputnik V vaccine from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), amid the Southeast Asian country’s thirst for vaccine supply to curb the raging coronavirus pandemic.

Prime Minister Chinh on Saturday directed the health ministry to support Vimedimex Medi - Pharma JSC (Vimedimex) in buying Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine from Royal Strategic Partners, a unit of Abu Dhabi Capital Group in the UAE.

The direction was made in response to a request from Vimedimex for help in dealing with the vaccine supplier, from which the Vietnamese company said it will buy 10 million Sputnik V vaccine doses.

After the vaccine arrives in Vietnam, people can get vaccination on demand at prices regulated by the health ministry.

Established as a state-owned enterprise by the ministry in 1984, Vimedimex was partly privatized in 2006 and listed on the Vietnamese stock market four years later.

The company is one of the 36 businesses licensed by the ministry to import and export vaccines and drugs, as well as to provide related warehousing services.

Earlier, four trade associations, including the Vietnam Leather, Footwear and Handbag Association (LEFASO), Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS), Vietnam Electronic Industries Association (VEIA), and Handicraft and Wood Industry Association of Ho Chi Minh City (HAWA), made the same request to the government.

These associations proposed that the central government either speed up the national vaccination drive or assist businesses in buying vaccines so that they can inoculate their workers for free soon to ensure epidemic prevention while maintaining business operations.

Such proposals have come in the context that Vietnam’s State President Nguyen Xuan Phuc has recently asked health authorities to promptly authorize Nano Covax, a vaccine being developed domestically, to make the first Vietnamese vaccine available soon to drive back the coronavirus spread.

Vietnam aims to secure 150 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to inoculate about two-thirds of its 98 million-strong population to reach herd immunity, but it has so far got only over 19 million doses in total from different sources, including COVAX Facility, contractual purchases, and donations, the health ministry said.

As of Sunday morning, nearly 8.9 million COVID-19 vaccine shots have been administered nationwide, with the numbers of people receiving the first and second shots topping eight million and some 888,000, respectively, the ministry reported.

Since the pandemic hit the country in early 2020, Vietnam has registered 205,656 patients, including 203,313 domestic and 2,343 imported cases, of which 66,637 have recovered and 3,250 have died, the ministry’s data shows.

Among the domestic infections, as many as 201,743 cases, or 99.2 percent, have been recorded since April 27, when the pandemic’s fourth wave erupted in Vietnam.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A conference to mark the start of the longan harvest season for overseas markets was held in Chi Linh City in the northern Vietnamese of Hai Duong on Thursday.

The event was co-hosted by the Hai Duong Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Hai Duong Department of Industry and Trade, and the authorities of Chi Linh City.

This year, 740 hectares of longan-growing areas in Chi Linh have produced an estimated output of 4,000 metric tons.

Notably, more than 40 hectares of the longan-growing areas have been granted cultivation area codes for exports to demanding markets such as the European Union (EU), Singapore, the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand, with an expected output of approximately 250 metric tons.

A representative of FUSA Organic Agriculture Joint Stock Company said that the firm will start to purchase and process longan for the Europe market in the next few days.

The company expects to export between 20 and 30 metric tons of Chi Linh longan to 300 supermarkets in the UK and EU member countries in 2021.

Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Chi Linh City authorities have cooperated with exporters, food stores, supermarkets, and ecommerce platforms to sell longan.

Thanks to the efforts, the local specialty has become available on the ecommerce platform voso.vn of the parcel courier service provider Viettel Post at a price of VND93,000 (US$4) per three-kilogram pack.

Bui Van Thang, director of the Hai Duong Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that potential new markets in Vietnam’s central and southern regions are Chi Linh longan’s next targets after gaining popularity in Hanoi and the northern provinces of Quang Ninh and Bac Ninh, and Hai Phong City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The People’s Committee of Dong Nai Province in southern Vietnam has given instructions to enterprises that have wished to end the implementation of two operation models required for companies in coronavirus-hit areas after discovering infections among their workers.

Authorities have requested companies in Vietnam to follow either the ‘three-on-the-spot’ or ‘one road, two places’ model in order to maintain operations during the pandemic prevention time.

In the first model, enterprises and employees must conduct production, have meals, and rest after work at the same place.

Enterprises and employees following the second protocol must arrange isolated production and accommodations at two separate locations, connected by a single transport route for workers to commute every day.

After one month of applying the first scheme, many enterprises and employees in Dong Nai have sought approval to cancel it, according to the provincial Department of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs and the Dong Nai Industrial Zones Authority (DIZA).

The People’s Committee of Dong Nai issued a document in response to them on Thursday night.

Accordingly, enterprises are responsible for testing all employees for COVID-19 after receiving the approvals for the cancelation from the Department of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs, DIZA, and the district-level People’s Committees.

Employees are only allowed to leave enterprises when they have a negative test result within three days and are received by staff of the People’s Committees of their home districts.

Further, to drop the ‘stay-at-work’ mechanism, enterprises must ensure that all of their employees test negative for the coronavirus.

If an employee tests positive for the virus, the enterprise must not let them leave its facility without permission.

Enterprises shall report test results to the People’s Committees of the districts or cities where their employees reside.

Chairman of Dong Nai Province Cao Tien Dung insisted that enterprises provide referrals, COVID-19 test results, and reception letters from the district-level People’s Committees for each employee and guide them to prepare necessary documents to pass through medical checkpoints before leaving the companies.

Besides, the employers will take full responsibilities before the law for any staff returning home without complying with the aforementioned regulations or allowing them to leave their facilities without authorities’ permission.

They may even face legal proceedings if the employees spread the disease in their residential areas.

Approximately 136,000 employees have practiced the two said protocols at more than 1,150 enterprises in Dong Nai, according to DIZA’s statistics.

However, many of them have contracted the coronavirus and formed large clusters of infections at the enterprises, of which two have been suspended from operating as the situation worsened.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Loship, a one-hour ecommerce delivery startup in Vietnam, has announced that it successfully raised US$12 million in a pre-Series C round of equity financing.

This round of financing was jointly led by venture capital firm BAce Capital backed by Ant Group and the direct investment department of Sun Hung Kai Co. Ltd.

The co-investors are MetaPlanet Holdings - Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn’s investment vehicle, Wealth Well from Saudi Arabia, Prism Ventures from Singapore, and SQ Capital Group from Hong Kong.

The round comes just after Loship’s undisclosed bridge funding round led by MetaPlanet in February.

Loship said it will use the proceeds from the latest round to deepen its presence in key markets, expand the business into new regions, and fuel growth in the B2B delivery services.

“We have a very clear path to profitability as well as strategic plans on how to get there,” said co-founder and CEO Nguyen Hoang Trung.

“Next on our agenda is to bring Loship services to customers living in all parts of Vietnam, especially the lower-tier markets.

“We will also use the funding to drive forward instant commerce delivery in under an hour.”

Founded in 2017, the startup traces its roots to Lozi, a review app that allowed users to find food, beverages, and coffee shops.

It was then transformed into a delivery service platform and now provides one-hour delivery for a variety of products and services, including food, online ride-hailing, medicine, and B2B supplies.

The company claims to have more than 70,000 drivers and 200,000 merchants serving approximately two million customers in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang City, Can Tho City, and Bien Hoa City under Dong Nai Province.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam has overtaken Bangladesh as the second-biggest garment exporter in the world, according to the latest data released by the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Vietnam sold US$29 billion worth of apparel merchandise to the global market in 2020, while Bangladesh’s garment exports were valued at $28 billion, the World Trade Statistical Review revealed.

As a result, Bangladesh’s share in global garment exports slipped to 6.3 percent last year from 6.8 percent a year earlier.

Meanwhile, Vietnam’s share improved to 6.4 percent in 2020 from 6.2 per cent in 2019.

China remained the largest apparel exporter in 2020, despite a seven-percent year-on-year drop to $142 billion, or 31.6 percent of the global total.

According to Nguyen Thi Tuyet Mai, deputy secretary of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS), Vietnam’s ascension to the second rank in global apparel exportation, as reported by WTO’s data, is “a match with the state of production and operation of domestic garment businesses in 2020.”

Although Bangladesh proves to have an edge on cheap labor, plus the ability to fulfill large orders with low prices, the country’s garment industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing international partners to redistribute orders to other countries, including Vietnam.

In the meantime, thanks to the early success in containing the epidemic, plus the country’s participation in international trade agreements, Vietnam has given its garment manufacturing industry a leg-up in attracting global demand.

From a mere 2.9 percent in 2010, Vietnam’s share in global apparel exports has jumped beyond twofold in just ten years, Mai pointed out.

However, Vietnam’s newly-acquired position is no longer a given in 2021, considering the country’s advantage in COVID-19 safety and control has been leveled.

As the coronavirus flared up in Vietnam in late April, inflicting damage of unprecedented level and forcing many factories to either close down or shrink production to ensure safety, domestic garment firms will face more struggles in the last quarter of the year, Mai predicted.

According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Vietnam’s garment export revenue amounted to $18.6 billion between January and July in 2021, a 14.1 percent surge compared to the previous year.

As of Wednesday morning, Vietnam had documented 174,461 coronavirus cases, with 50,831 recoveries and 2,071 deaths, according to the health ministry.

The country has recorded 170,563 local infections in 62 out of 63 provinces and cities since the flare-up on April 27.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Processors (VASEP) has put forward a proposal to Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Minh Hoan to seek help for the seafood industry to coexist with the COVID-19 in the long run.

The association came up with the solution after the 'three-on-the-spot' mechanism, a model that many firms in Vietnam have followed to maintain economic growth during the pandemic prevention time, has proved to be ineffective, it said on Monday.

Enterprises and employees applying this scheme must conduct production, have meals, and rest after work at the same place.

According to VASEP, only about 30 percent of seafood enterprises in the southern region can afford the 'three-on-the-spot' mechanism.

However, even at financially strong companies, only 30-50 percent of their workers are going to work now, while the others have to quit jobs or take unpaid leave.

As a result, the average production capacity has dropped by 50 to 60 percent.

The association estimated that raw materials for production and export in the last months of this year will fall short by 20 to 30 percent.

VASEP assessed that the 'stay-at-work' mode is only a temporary measure that medium enterprises can afford in two to three weeks and large companies for four to five weeks, regarding the heavy expenses to maintain production and pandemic prevention regulations at the same time.

The association thus called for giving COVID-19 vaccine priority to workers at enterprises following the 'three-on-the-spot' model in the seafood industry as an immediate solution.

In the long term, VASEP suggested seafood enterprises to apply sustainable measures to survive the pandemic.

It proposed the Ministry of Health complete a set of rules and organize training for local authorities and enterprises to implement the so-called 'on-site medical.'

Accordingly, firms will proactively make use of their own medical teams and factories’ medical stations to hold COVID-19 sampling drives for employees twice a month.

Local health agencies will test the samples, with the results being widely recognized for circulation in production and transportation activities.

Municipal and provincial centers for disease control will conduct another test once a month so that each employee will be tested three times monthly.

The Ministry of Health will also need to give instructions for timely handling infected workers, conducting contact tracing and medical isolation, disinfection, and other measures to effectively and appropriately control sources of infection, thus reducing losses to businesses’ and workers’ incomes while ensuring the pandemic prevention.

In addition, VASEP pushed for more support for workers and enterprises in need, including reducing bank interest rates, cutting electricity bills by 30 percent at least until the end of 2021, and lowering the payment ratio of union dues from two percent of staff salary to one percent.

Market surveillance officers of Ba Ria - Vung Tau discovered the failure in price listing at two Bach Hoa Xanh stores and the sale of expired goods at another outlet of the chain in Vung Tau City.

After booking the two cases, the agency on Monday issued a decision to fine Bach Hoa Xanh Trading JSC and its general director Nong Van Dung VND4 million (US$174) and VND1.6 million ($70) for the said violations, respectively.

The expired items were also confiscated.

On the same day, Bach Hoa Xanh stores in Vung Tau removed or covered up the ‘no photography’ signs on their doors following a request by the provincial People’s Committee.

The signs were previously stuck on the stores’ glass doors to prevent customers from taking photos of the chain’s selling prices while food stores are not places where photography is prohibited according to the Vietnamese law.

Following the detection of an infection cluster at Thanh Nga Food Co. Ltd., a major meat supplier to several modern retail chains in the capital city on Sunday, at least 37 VinMart supermarkets and VinMart+ convenience stores had been suspended as of Monday afternoon, according to Khuc Tien Ha, a director of the VinMart/VinMart+ chain.

Despite the suspension, the Ministry of Industry and Trade affirmed that authorities still ensure the supply of goods, especially food, for people in the capital city.

According to the Hanoi Department of Industry and Trade’s report to the ministry, it had directed distributors and retailers to proactively find alternative suppliers.

At traditional markets, supplies of food and other commodities remained stable, with no abnormal price fluctuations reported.

There has been only a slight increase in the prices of some fresh foods in the past few days due to higher transportation costs.

People also tend to buy larger quantities of food on each shopping trip as they are allowed to go out to buy groceries only two to three times a week under the prevailing social distancing implementation.

“In general, the supply of goods at markets is well maintained and people have easy access to the commodities,” the Ministry of Industry and Trade affirmed.

Retailers have also promoted online sales.

Besides, the Hanoi Department of Industry and Trade has published a list of 7,866 essential goods supply points and 455 traditional markets in the city for its residents’ reference.

Vietnam had documented 165,339 COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday morning, with 46,965 recoveries and 1,881 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health.

The country has recorded 161,482 local infections in 62 out of its 63 provinces and cities, including 1,571 cases in Hanoi, since the fourth wave began on April 27.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade has asked authorities in provinces and cities to give COVID-19 vaccination priority to workers in the transport and logistics industries for securing smooth circulation of goods.

Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Do Thang Hai made the request in an urgent dispatch sent to the provincial and municipal authorities on Friday, after receiving many reports from related associations and enterprises on the current congestion of goods and production material transportation in several localities.

According to the reports, there has been inaccurate judgment of the role of transport and logistics forces in production, business and consumption activities, which has resulted in the poor circulation of goods in recent time.

Local authorities have only focused on whether the transported goods is essential, not urgent issues in pandemic prevention.

As a result, workers in the sectors have suffered complicated quarantine processes, causing time waste and soaring costs to businesses.

The problem has greatly obstructed the government's dual goal of preventing and controlling the pandemic while ensuring economic development, as the role of transport and logistics staff is as important as that of frontline medical workers, the reports said.

As a solution to this issue, the Ministry of Industry and Trade has requested authorities in provinces and cities to prioritize COVID-19 vaccines for transport and logistics workers, especially drivers, drivers’ assistants, interprovincial transport workers, and employees at seaports and border gates.

At the same time, the ministry has also proposed the Ministry of Health consider amending regulations and guidelines on priority groups for free COVID-19 vaccination to include the aforementioned subjects.

Authorities have administered nearly six million vaccine shots, since Vietnam rolled out inoculation on March 8.

About 588,800 people have been fully vaccinated.

Vietnam on Saturday morning reported 4,060 new cases of COVID-19, including 2,503 cases in Ho Chi Minh City, increasing the country’s tally to 141,122, with 35,484 recoveries and 1,161 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health.

Ho Chi Minh City has recently led the nation with 88,566 cases reported in the ongoing infection wave and thousands of patients registered per day.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many lenders in Ho Chi Minh City have applied the ‘three-on-the-spot’ mechanism, one of two models required for production companies in virus-hit areas, to deal with difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

To maintain economic growth during the pandemic prevention time, many firms in Vietnam have followed either the ‘three-on-the-spot’ or ‘one road, two places’ model.

In the first model, enterprises and employees must conduct production, have meals, and rest after work at the same place.

Enterprises and employees following the second protocol must arrange isolated production and accommodations at two separate locations, connected by a single transport route for workers to commute every day.

Under no obligation to implement any of the two aforementioned mechanisms, many banks in Ho Chi Minh City, including the Vietnam Export Import Commercial Joint - Stock Bank (Eximbank), the Ho Chi Minh City Development Joint Stock Commercial Bank (HDBank), and the Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Sacombank), still stick to the stay-at-work mode to maintain normal operations during the current social distancing drive.

Eximbank has temporarily suspended transactions at more than 50 of its branches and transaction offices, according to the bank’s representative.

It has continued providing services at only about 30 venues, which are advantageous for pandemic prevention and health protection for customers and employees.

At the 30 active facilities, Eximbank’s employees have followed the ‘three-on-the-spot’ model.

In addition, employees at HDBank and Sacombank are subject to COVID-19 testing every five days and on a weekly basis, respectively, and work alternatively in different shifts.

As city authorities have enforced a ban on outdoor travels betweem 6:00 pm and 6:00 am the next day since July 26, it is hard for bank employees to finish their work before 5:00 pm every day and return home prior to the restriction hours.

The ‘three-on-the-spot’ implementation is expected to help bankers complete their tasks without spending time traveling and allow lenders to have a backup workforce, in case many of their workers are infected with the coronavirus or their residential areas are locked down.

“We have also prepared contingency plans to ensure smooth operation in unexpected situations,” a representative of Sacombank said.

The Ministry of Health on Friday morning confirmed 4,987 new domestic COVID-19 cases, including 2,740 infections in Ho Chi Minh City, taking the country’s tally to 133,405, with 31,780 recoveries, as recorded since early 2020.

Since April 27, when the pandemic’s fourth wave appeared in Vietnam, the city has accounted for 84,521 cases in the country’s total of 129,622 domestic infections and recently led the nation in daily new infections, with thousands of patients registered per day.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam's domestic coffee prices edged up on Thursday on upbeat global prices and limited supplies at the end of the harvest season, traders said.

Farmers in the Central Highlands, Vietnam's largest coffee-growing area, sold coffee COFVN-DAK at 36,900-38,000 dong ($1.61-$1.65) per kg, up from the 36,500-37,200 dong range a week ago.

London prices LRCc2 on Wednesday settled up $18, or 1%, at $1,943 per tonne, its highest level since 2018, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.

"Adverse weather conditions in Brazil was a push for global prices. Domestic prices inched up this week following a skyrocket in London," said a trader based in the coffee belt.

"However, farmers have almost no beans left to sell, while demand is low due to the COVID-19 restrictions and as the container crunch is still hampering exports."

Vietnam's coffee exports in the first seven months of the year are expected to register a drop of 9.3% from a year earlier to 953,000 tonnes, official data showed.

Traders in Vietnam offered 5% black and broken-grade 2 robusta COFVN-G25-SAI at a discount of $230 per tonne to the September contract, compared with the $80-$90 discounts last week.

Meanwhile, discounts on Indonesia's Sumatran robusta widened this week as supplies remained abundant amid harvests while the worsening coronavirus outbreak dampened demand, traders said.

In Lampung province, one trader offered a $120 discount to the November contract, compared with the $50-$60 discount range last week.

Another trader offered a $100 discount to the September through November contracts, unchanged from last week.

"It's pretty similar with last week. There are plenty of beans, but not that many buyers because of the COVID-19 outbreak," the second trader said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Stringent travel restrictions as part of Ho Chi Minh City’s pandemic response efforts have troubled delivery services for online grocery shopping, which has reported surging demand from people in the southern metropolis.

Staff of many supermarket and food store chains in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday had significant issues finding delivery workers to transport packed orders to customers.

City chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong has requested companies to reduce the number of their active delivery workers to a minimum level and by at least ten percent compared to July 22, when more extensive social distancing rules started to be enforced in the city.

With the number of delivery workers already thin, active employees could not make it through checkpoints between different wards due to inconsistent judgment on whether the delivered goods were essential, according to retailers.

As a result, many points of sale had no choice but to announce the suspension of their online sale services.

“Now we only focus on delivering old orders placed by phone, text message, and our app,” said a representative of Japanese supermarket chain AEON.

“At the same time, we have stopped accepting new orders by phone and through Grab and Now applications."

The number of grocery stalls on multi-service apps Grab and Now announcing their suspension on Monday also skyrocketed compared to Sunday.

“We focus on serving customers in our ward, limiting deliveries to other wards,” said the representative of food store S., which decided to turn off its operation on on-demand grocery service GrabMart from 10:00 am on Monday.

Meanwhile, a representative of MM Mega Market said that the supermarket’s essential goods delivery activities were still stable as it was focusing on orders for vegetables, tubers, meat, and fish.

But to avoid a backlog, the supermarket’s online ordering system has accepted only a limited number of orders.

Retailers have reported the delivery problems to the municipal Department of Industry and Trade for support.

Ho Chi Minh City authorities began implementing escalated social distancing regulations in line with the prime minister’s Directive No. 16 from July 22.

Accordingly, people are requested to stay home unless they go out for food, medicine, duties at essential businesses, or other emergencies.

All non-essential businesses as well as public transport, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing vehicles, are suspended.

Tech-based and package delivery services are only allowed to transport essential goods, with their workers required to exhibit relevant documents at checkpoints.

The measures are Ho Chi Minh City’s response to the adverse development of the fourth wave of coronavirus infections, which emerged in late April and has infected 68,271 city dwellers so far.

Vietnam had documented 109,111 COVID-19 cases by Tuesday afternoon, with 18,570 recoveries and 524 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health’s statistics.

In the fourth bout, the country has recorded 105,338 local infections in 62 out of its 63 provinces and cities.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam received $10.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first seven months of the year, up 3.8% from a year earlier, the Ministry of Planning and Investment said on Monday.

FDI pledges -- which indicate the size of future FDI disbursements -- dropped 11.1% from a year earlier to $16.7 billion, the ministry said in a statement.

Of the pledges, 47.2% are due to be invested in manufacturing and processing, while 32.8% are targeting gas, water and electricity distribution, it said.

Singapore was the top source of FDI pledges in the period, followed by Japan and South Korea, it added.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Many retail outlets in Ho Chi Minh City have decided to close five hours earlier than normal every day starting Monday, as a response to fresh outdoor travel restrictions imposed by local authorities.

Such adjustment has been made after the municipal administration banned residents from going outdoors from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am the next day, from Monday until further notice, as part of the measures to reduce surging COVID-19 infections.

Many retailers of food and other essential goods have said they will open 30 minutes or one hour earlier and shutter by 5:00 pm, instead of 10:00 pm previously.

Specifically, many supermarkets will operate between 6:30 am and 5:00 pm.

As the travel curbs begin at 6:00 pm, a number of retail stores said they will even shut down earlier, by 4:00 pm, to enable their staff to get home before the effective outdoor travel restriction time.

A representative of AEON Vietnam said that it has informed customers that it will close earlier than normal so both employees and customers can go home before 6:00 pm.

Meanwhile, MM Mega Market Vietnam said that it will cease business by 5:00 pm and open at 6:30 am, 30 minutes later than before.

VinMart and VinMart+ have also announced the new operation time, from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, applicable to their 500 outlets in Ho Chi Minh City.

Similarly, the same working hours will be adopted at MEATDeli stores in the city.

Along with such early closures, supermarkets have planned to increase mobile sales and boost online trading to meet the demand of customers, given the outdoor travel restrictions and other epidemic prevention measures.

City authorities have been enforcing control rules under the prime minister’s Directive 16, including the closure of non-essential businesses and services, a stay-home order, a ban on gatherings larger than two people, and the suspension of public transport.

Accordingly, residents are completely prohibited from going out, except for seeking medical treatment and buying food at designated points.

Since early 2020, when the pandemic erupted in Vietnam, the city has documented over 62,900 COVID-19 cases, including more than 14,700 recoveries and 561 deaths, the municipal Center for Disease Control reported on Monday morning.

Nationwide, the total number of patients has so far reached 101,173 cases, including 19,342 recoveries, according to the Health Ministry’s data.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The ITU Virtual Digital World 2020, an event co-organized by Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), kicked off on Tuesday evening.

Themed ‘Building A Digital World. Together,’ the three-day online event brings together more than 50 ITU member countries.

The technological foundation used during the event was developed by Vietnam's military-run Viettel telecom group.

In his opening remarks, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said the Vietnamese government has paid attention to telecommunication infrastructure development and considered IT one of the top priorities.

Digital transformation has been regarded as a crucial solution for helping the country develop more rapidly and sustainably, Dam added.

The deputy PM reiterated the Vietnamese government’s commitments to supporting and coordinating with the ITU and its member countries in building a digital world for peace, cooperation, and prosperity.

Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said Vietnam’s digital infrastructure is now ready for a digital-based economy and society.

Vietnamese technologies not only deal with domestic but also global issues, the minister said, adding that the country is striving to make technology a driver of development and global cooperation.

ITU Secretary General Houlin Zhao said Vietnam is an important partner in many markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean region, which has made the nation become a bright example in IT development to many other developing countries.

ITU is a United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies.

The first ITU telecom event was held in 1971. Since its 40th anniversary in 2011, the event has been held on an annual basis in a different location worldwide.

The 2020 edition is named ITU Digital World and takes place online from October 20 to 22.

The ITU Digital World 2021 will be back in its usual form in Hanoi in October next year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A golf tournament aimed at supporting Vietnamese start-ups first organized by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper last year is set to return for the second edition this September.

‘Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020’ is meant to support start-ups in the beginning period of their business by helping to connect young entrepreneurs with seasoned and successful business people.

During the tourney, which will be launched on September 18, the organizers will also present awards to the most excellent entrepreneurs of the start-up community.

Excited to participate

Many entrepreneurs, who are experienced golfers, are excited to take part in this year's competition. In their opinion, the tournament will give them a chance to both play golf and help the upcoming generation of business people.

“I appreciate Tuoi Tre for holding such a golf competition to promote start-ups and help experienced entrepreneurs have another approach to supporting them,” said Le Hai Binh, founder and chairman of the IT services company Mat Bao Group, who is also a golfer taking part in the tournament.

“The competition will provide young entrepreneurs with opportunities to meet with their potential investors among the golfers who participate in the tournament."

The competitors interviewed by Tuoi Tre applauded the paper's idea to create ‘a playground’ for start-up owners.

Meeting with other entrepreneurs on the golf course is certain to bring a different vibe than traditional environments like offices or working space, and may help generate stronger bonds between the participants, they said.

Overcoming COVID-19

Start-ups have been hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020 was also rescheduled to begin in September instead of April, when it was held last year, because of the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of the global health crisis, many entrepreneurs consider the tournament an occasion for them to support young entrepreneurs in getting over the adversities of the pandemic, especially since it is currently under control in Vietnam.

“The current situation is different from last year’s. The pandemic has presented start-ups with difficulty in accessing funds as almost all companies are impacted by the coronavirus,” Binh remarked.

“Of course [potential investors] must fight for the survival of their own companies first before considering investing in others."

According to Binh, in 'the new normal,' customers are likely to spend less so start-ups in the fields of services, travel, and food would be considerably impacted.

“Despite that, I am not quite pessimistic because there are always opportunities in challenging situations,” Binh said.

The chairman of Mat Bao Group believes that during the pandemic, entrepreneurs who can flexibly adapt to the new situation will emerge victorious and even achieve new breakthroughs.

“Tuoi Tre’s golf tournament for start-ups will offer them the opportunity to do so,” Binh said.

Lawyer Nguyen Thi Thanh Nha, legal director of the investment firm Openasia Group, said her experience as a shareholder in a few start-ups when she was younger helps her understand the advantages that start-ups have, such as youth, ambition, and knowledge.

But she also acknowledges the rigors they must face on the way to success such as networking, calling for suitable investors, and developing relationships with other start-ups.

“Participating in the [golf tournament] will help them partly solve these problems and build more new business relationships,” said Nha, who has played golf for 12 years.

“Business opportunities may come to them unexpectedly during this tournament, who knows?”

Honoring 25 excellent start-ups

With the aim of promoting and empowering the start-up community both in Ho Chi Minh City and the rest of Vietnam, Tuoi Tre and partners jointly present the Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020.

The tourney will also mark the 75th anniversary of Vietnam’s National Day (September 2), the 89th founding anniversary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union (March 26), and the 45th anniversary of the founding of Tuoi Tre (September 2).

Dozens of inspiring start-up stories have been published in Tuoi Tre in various formats since July in the lead-up to the tournament.

The opening gala is scheduled to take place on September 18 at the Long Thanh Golf Club in Dong Nai Province, 35 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For students from poor families, education is the best way to help themselves and their families get out of their plight and lift their communities out of poverty. Ironically, after all the effort of studying in difficulty throughout 12 years from elementary to high school, these students even with high academic records to enter college are unable to live their dreams because of their family’s financial situations. They simply cannot afford tuition fees and other expenses of higher education.

The “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” scholarship program of Tuoi Tre Newspaper has made great strides in helping these poor students. This program gave the first scholarship in Quang Tri Province in 2003. It has gradually spread to other provinces and now it covers the whole country.

Over 17 years, this scholarship program has helped more than 19,000 new college students who otherwise would not be able to afford higher education. Last year, there were more than 1,200 new college students from all over the country receiving scholarships.

Each poor student is given a standard scholarship of VND10 million (US$430). Very poor students are granted special scholarships worth VND15 million (US$645) each.

This year due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be more poor new college students in need of help, although the donation could be less than last year.

We would like to appeal for new and current donors to “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” so that at least 1,000 poor students around the country, among them 80 from Thua Thien-Hue Province, could receive scholarships this academic year.

Please send your donation to Bao Tuoi Tre, bank account: 113000006100 (for VND) at VietinBank, Branch 3, HCM City; or bank account: 0071370195845 (for USD) or 0071140373054 (for EUR) at Vietcombank, HCM City Branch, Swift Code: BFTVVNVX007; for “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” Scholarship Program.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A charity initiative administered 700 care packages on the weekend to workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Binh Tan District, as well as Lao and Cambodian students in the Pre-University College of Ho Chi Minh City.

The initiative was undertaken by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, supermarket chain Saigon Co.op, and e-commerce platform Shopee, with support from the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.

The organizers prepared essentials, including rice, cooking oil, and fish sauce, and divided them into thousands of gift packages, each of which was priced at VND145,000 (US$6.3) on Shopee.

The packages were delivered on Saturday directly to the beneficiaries, including 500 workers who are struggling financially in Binh Tan District, 200 Lao and Cambodian students and those of Vietnam's ethnic minorities at the Pre-University College in District 5.

Among the recipients was Tran Ngoc Sang, a manufacturing worker in Binh Tan District who hails from Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta.

“I feel blessed to receive these essential items, which will help ease the burden on my family during social distancing,” said the sole breadwinner for the family of seven.

Other demographics, including youths in locked-down areas of Hoc Mon District, as well as unofficial workers in Cat Lai Ward of Thu Duc City, also received the care packages of the initiative.

After the first run on Saturday and Sunday, the organizers plan to hand another 2,500 packages to struggling people in cordoned-off areas in Ho Chi Minh City on July 22 and 25.

They are currently accepting donations on Shopee and ShopeePay.

In June and early July, many working-class residents in Ho Chi Minh City suffered from lay-offs or reduced income as the southern metropolis emerged as Vietnam’s coronavirus epicenter, with its caseload rising in the thousands daily.

The alarming situation has prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home, effectively cutting off the livelihoods of many unofficial workers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In his ongoing sketch project, Ho Chi Minh City-based artist Le Sa Long strives to portray the small acts of generosity among residents, a virtue that has once again been highlighted during the tough time of social distancing in the southern city.

An established painter in the domestic art scene who has multiple solo exhibitions and awards under his belt, Long picked up urban sketching as a habit in mid-May.

He wandered the city which he has called home for over 30 years for live sketches for a few weeks, until it began to be put under social distancing measures on May 31 and later a citywide ban on non-essential travels on June 15.

Cooped up at home under this hibernation phase, Long decided to create a new series of sketches inspired by heartwarming photos of Saigonese that he spotted on social media and in newspapers.

He has so far portrayed 40 vignettes on paper and is planning to create more.

“These images of Saigonese residents helping each other out during hard times touched my soul," he said.

"I was inspired to translate these moments and put them under a new light through the language of art.”

A standout in his collection is the vignette of a five-year-old wearing PPE overalls, standing by herself, waving goodbye to the camera before boarding an ambulance to enter quarantine.

Another sketch pays tribute to pop singer Ha Anh Tuan, who donated 25 metric tons of rice to help the struggling citizens.

Other optimistic news stories, including no-cost grocery stores for the needy, community fridges, and charity efforts benefiting pandemic-struck people, are also portrayed.

The sketches have earned Long showers of praises after they were posted on his social media account.

Many individuals have even asked to buy his pieces online, despite not having seen them in person, Long revealed.

He plans to auction several slice-of-life works to raise funds for charity causes for underprivileged people in the city, while portrait pieces of Ha Anh Tuan or frontline doctors will be gifted to the respective subjects as a tribute.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The recent formation of Thu Duc City under Ho Chi Minh City has sparked interest across all sectors, from economy and finance to culture and society.

As a result, the ‘new’ city has seen an influx of diverse investors, particularly from within the real estate segment.

Real estate: Vietnam’s most promising sector

Despite the ongoing effects of COVID-19, Q1/2021 saw the Vietnamese GDP increase to 4.48 percent, a growth rate of 3.68 percent compared to the same period last year.

Citing this increase, experts suggest the country’s real estate market remains the most stable investment channel, particularly for visionary developers who are quick to respond to buyers’ strict and evolving requirements.

According to CBRE Vietnam, Q1 also saw an 80 percent absorption rate among new projects, a positive sign, particularly as the high-end and luxury segments lead the market.

Eastern Ho Chi Minh City, a strategic imperative for Masterise Homes

Following the January 1, 2021 merger of three eastern districts – District 2, District 9, and Thu Duc District —Thu Duc City sits at the forefront of Ho Chi Minh City’s Industrial Revolution 4.0.

Dubbed a ‘creative urban area,’ the eastern hub is fast becoming the epicenter of economic and educational development.

More than a name change, many anticipate the creation of Thu Duc City as a bright opportunity for the whole city, particularly closely related sectors like real estate, as the area already accounts for 47 percent of property supply.

Sharp and deeply knowledgeable about the market, international developer Masterise Homes has an acute vision for Vietnam’s future of real estate.

Seeing great promise and potential for Thu Duc City, the prestigious developer is taking advantage of the incredible transformation and introducing a strategically relevant, international-standard project in the heart of the new megacity.

The new project, Masteri Centre Point, will serve as a connection gateway to neighbouring provinces, while its prime location within Grand Park gives residents a particularly unique advantage.

Close to the under-construction Long Thanh International Airport, buyers will soon benefit from higher investment value and liquidity, ensuring lasting return on investment for buyers and investors.

A new reference for international-standard living

As a well-known developer with many high-end real estate brands in the market, Masterise Homes is a pioneer in bringing branded residences to Vietnam, namely Grand Marina Saigon, One Central, and The Grand Hanoi (Hang Bai).

The developer works in cooperation with leading international brands in luxury real estate such as Marriott International, including Marriott, JW Marriott, and The Ritz-Carlton, to introduce iconic projects to Vietnam’s thriving real estate market.

Masteri Centre Point, a high-end haven in Thu Duc City, Ho Chi Minh City

Masterise Homes’ prestige is further confirmed by the quality of the projects it continuously delivers from the south to the north.

The developer is a driving force for the country’s real estate market, potentially elevating it to be on a par with such luxury destinations as Dubai, New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

Marking a shift in interest in health-centric and sustainable living environments, Masterise Homes’ introduction of Masteri Centre Point could not be timelier.

The large-scale, meticulously planned urban community is a beacon for those who wish to avoid the chaos caused by rapid urbanization and lagging infrastructure.

Customized with buyers in mind, the ten-tower development is a harmonious haven that will accommodate a need for a safe, modern, and sustainable living space.

In keeping with a desire to ensure a high-end fit-out, the developer has included such brands as Kohler, Häfele, and Daikin in each apartment.

An international team with partnerships all over the world, Masterise Homes is acclaimed for delivering professional, meticulous, and high-quality developments.

The developer’s most recent partnerships include Marriott, JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, and Techcombank.

In collaboration with the latter, Masterise Homes introduces a seamless housing solution – Home for Home – that allows buyers to expedite the purchasing process and own a new home without a cash deposit.

Home for Home is an exchange solution allowing participants to own within one of Masterise Homes’ high-end residential projects, namely Masteri Centre Point in Ho Chi Minh City and Masteri Waterfront or Masteri West Heights in Hanoi.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@American management consulting firm McKinsey said in a recently-published article that Vietnam’s tourism sector could recover by 2024 if domestic travel continues to grow and the country maintains its low infection rate.

According to McKinsey, Vietnam’s tourism sector relies heavily on international travel – a sector of the economy which took a dramatic plunge last year.

International flights to Vietam dropped 80 percent in October 2020 compared to the same time period a year earlier.

Meanwhile, hotels throughout the country only reached 30 percent occupancy.

The sharp drop in foreign travelers, who spend significantly more than their local counterparts, has had a tremendous impact on the tourism sector and Vietnam’s economy as a whole.

In 2019, a year in which the tourism industry accounted for 12 percent of the country’s GDP, international travelers made up just 17 percent of the total number of tourists in Vietnam, yet accounted for more than half of all tourism spending, with them spending an average of US$673 each compared to the $61 spent by each domestic traveler.

The sharp dive in revenues from tourism also stunted the country’s food and beverage and retail industries.

As a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of international tourism may be far off, the travel sector’s short-term revival could depend on local tourism, McKinsey said.

In 2019, Vietnamese tourists shelled out $15.5 billion, $5.9 billion of which was spent overseas.

Now, due to the pandemic, the majority of tourists are unable to leave the country and are therefore looking to scratch their travel itch with domestic vacations.

Travel companies should therefore rise to the occasion and capture value from this opportunity, McKinsey suggested.

On the other hand, the firm said that even with favorable tailwinds driven by domestic tourism, Vietnam will be dependent on international markets, which represent around $12 billion in spending.

The majority of Vietnam’s international tourists come from Asian countries, with those from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan accounting for around 80 percent of the nation's foreign tourism spending.

Vietnam’s strong economic ties with these countries could lead to a relatively fast tourism-industry recovery compared with other key tourist destinations in Europe and North America.

The zero-case-first strategy the country has pursued since the start of the pandemic, as well as its association with markets in which COVID-19 transmission rates are low, has resulted in a relatively high rate of traveler confidence, at least on the domestic level.

With this approach, combined with Vietnam’s resilient local economy and proactive government campaigns, McKinsey believes that the country’s tourism sector could recover to pre-crisis levels by 2024.

Under this scenario, three paradigms – namely tourists’ shifts to high-end domestic trips, price cuts which are not sustainable for the long term, and international travel bubbles – must be explored with caution, according to the American firm.

Action plan

As travel companies reimagine their pathways to recovery, McKinsey said it is important to address the risks and anxieties related to COVID-19, while also solving the pain points and leveraging the trends that existed before the crisis.

It thus suggested six actions that could jump-start Vietnam’s tourism recovery, including:

-- A focus on domestic travelers: Revitalizing local demand by focusing on emerging destinations with joint cooperation from local governments, online travel agencies, attractions, hotels, and airlines. To further tap into domestic opportunities, operators must focus on affordability while striving to maintain high-quality products and experience.

-- The consideration of new pricing models to rebuild demand: Rebuilding demand and propelling volume through discounts and pre-sales should be key tactics during the early stages of recovery, especially for high-end operators that will not be able to tap into international demand for some time. Companies can also explore opportunities to bundle products, which can offer upselling and cross-selling opportunities, as well as diversify their revenue streams and enhance premium product and pricing.

-- The adoption of mobile and digital tools: Strategic collaborations, such as online travel agencies providing ticket-booking services via instant messaging and social media platforms, could offer an opportunity for increased market penetration. At the same time, travel companies should revamp their online touchpoints and experiences to improve customer experience. Furthermore, companies could also think about placing digital tools in new places within the customer's journey.

-- Laying the groundwork for inbound demand: Travel companies will need to be flexible and nimble in order to capture early international travel demand. They should be prepared to implement strict health and safety protocols that fulfill the stipulations of both domestic and destination security policies.

-- There should be a reinvention of the traveler’s experience beyond accommodations and tourism investments should be redistributed toward unconventional and more diverse destinations.

-- The reimagining of the government’s role in tourism: In the short term, the government and industry associations need to ensure the survival of operators. The government can experiment with new and sustainable financing options such as hotel revenue pooling, in which a subset of hotels operating at higher occupancy rates share revenue with others. In the midterm, government-backed digital and analytic transformation is necessary, especially to level the playing field for small and medium-sized enterprises, which made up more than 50 percent of travel suppliers in 2018. The government can play a vital role as a matchmaker, connecting suppliers to distributors and intermediaries to create packages attractive to a specific segment of tourists, and then use tourist engagement to provide further analytical insights for travel intermediaries. Governments and industry associations can also leverage the overall momentum of the country, as well as the expected return of international travel, to boost demand.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shareholders of Phu Nhuan Jewelry Joint Stock Company (PNJ), based in Ho Chi Minh City, have approved the issuance of 15 million shares to increase the brand’s charter capital.

PNJ’s board of directors asked their shareholders to vote for the plan to issue 15 million shares, equivalent to 6.6 percent of the outstanding volume, during an annual general meeting last week.

Speaking at the event, PNJ CEO Le Tri Thong stated that the market size of the jewelry industry in the Asia-Pacific region shrank more than 30 percent last year.

Along with that, the collapse of some parts in the global supply chain and the uncertainties in the local stock market due to the COVID-19 pandemic forced PNJ to make drastic changes in their operations to absorb the impacts, the CEO said.

PNJ also sped up its store opening plans, invested in more prime locations, and kept themselves on trend with new designs.

In 2020, PNJ opened 29 new stores and closed 36 others to refinance the new outlets.

According to its financial report, the core business of PNJ continued to grow sharply thanks to the increasing market share.

Its retail sales grew 10 percent year on year in 2020 thanks to the efficient introduction of digitalization into product creation and communication a year before.

By the end of 2020, PNJ's revenue had been over VND17.5 trillion (US$759 million) and its net profit had topped VND1 trillion ($46.3 million), which were respectively 21 percent and 28 percent higher than expected.

The company is valued at $93.1 million by Forbes Vietnam, a rise of 18 percent compared to 2019.

Noticeably, PNJ stated its revenue from online business in 2020 jumped 300 percent against 2019.

Even in the first quarter of 2021, this sales channel also climbed 400 percent year on year, according to its recent statement.

However, CEO Thong acknowledged his company had to struggle with the same difficult market context as any brands in the luxury industry.

Although the company's turnover ascended three percent, its profit slipped 10 percent compared to the previous year.

In 2021, PNJ sets a goal for VND21 trillion ($909 million) in revenue, or a 20 percent growth rate versus last year.

The company’s gross profit is expected to reach more than VND4,047 billion ($175 million) and its net profit will be above VND1,229 billion ($53 million), up 18 percent and 15 percent compared to 2020, respectively.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The abrupt enforcement of a new movement declaration system at COVID-19 checkpoints in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday baffled the majority of commuters and clogged up traffic flow for hours.

The novel movement declaration requirement, devised by the Ministry of Public Security and considered part of the national population database, was simultaneously introduced at COVID-19 checkpoints in the city around 1:00 pm on Saturday.

This is meant to keep track of people's travels in case contact tracing is needed to stall coronavirus spread.

As witnessed by a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper correspondent, all commuters passing these checkpoints would be pulled over and could only leave when they scanned a QR code on their phones, completed their movement declaration online, captured a new QR code, and presented it to checkpoint officers to see if it matched the database.

The steps were deemed rather complicated and time-consuming by the public due to a variety of reasons, including the reduced sensitivity of mobile phone cameras for QR scanning under broad daylight, or the lack of Internet connection at checkpoints.

Several officers were ill-prepared for their duties, as the batteries on their mobile devices died while they logged commuters’ information.

“Some senior citizens had their smartphones with them, but did not know how to declare the information on the apps and required officers' help,” an checkpoint officer explained.

“Some individuals took as long as 15 minutes to complete their declaration.”

The unoptimized process impeded traffic flow, causing lines of delayed vehicles to snake out as far as a few kilometers.

On Phan Dang Luu and Le Van Duyet Streets in Binh Thanh District, hundreds of motorbikes were seen struggling to inch toward the checkpoints, where officers were still strictly upholding the declaration protocol.

“Residents can scan the QR code and declare their information at home," said Senior Lieutenant Colonel Huynh Thi Thu Trang, a senior official at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Public Security.

"They will receive another QR code, which they can save to their phone and use for the next three days.

“When passing the checkpoints, they only need to bring up the QR image so officers can instantly check their information, reducing processing time and avoiding congestion.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Three Vietnamese banks have pledged to lend 4 trillion dong ($173.8 million) to Vietnam Airlines to help the troubled flag carrier weather the impact of the pandemic and avoid bankruptcy, state media reported on Monday.

Vietnam Maritime Commercial Joint Stock Bank, Saigon - Hanoi Commercial Joint Stock Bank and SeABank would make the interest-free loans this month and early next month, the Lao Dong newspaper cited the central bank as saying.

Vietnam Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The report said a plan for Vietnam Airlines to issue new shares to its existing shareholders to raise funds would be ready by year-end.

The airline, which is 86% owned by the government, reported a net loss of 4.97 trillion dong ($215.6 million) in the first quarter.

State media last week cited the Ministry of Planning and Investment as saying the airline would likely make a net loss of 10 trillion dong ($433.8 million) in the first half of this year and was on the brink of bankruptcy.

Vietnam Airlines earlier this month said it would sell 11 Airbus A321 aircraft through an auction.
