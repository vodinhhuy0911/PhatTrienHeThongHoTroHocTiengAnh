PARIS -- Lionel Messi joined star-packed Paris St Germain on Tuesday after leaving Barcelona, the club where he had begun and expected to end his career.

Messi, a six-times winner of the Ballon d'Or for Europe's best soccer player, signed a two-year contract with an option for a third year, the club said in a statement on its website.

The move will add the Argentine, one of the best players of his generation, to an already formidable PSG attack that includes Brazil's Neymar and French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe.

"I am excited to begin a new chapter of my career at Paris Saint-Germain," PSG quoted Messi as saying. "I am determined to help build something special for the club and the fans, and I am looking forward to stepping out onto the pitch at the Parc des Princes."

The arrival of Barcelona's record scorer, with 672 goals, will boost Qatari-owned PSG's ambitions to win the prestigious, and lucrative, European Champions League for the first time.

"He has made no secret of his desire to continue competing at the very highest level and winning trophies, and naturally our ambition as a club is to do the same," PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said.

PSG wasted little time in targeting Messi after the heavily indebted Catalan club made clear it could not afford to keep him because of La Liga's financial fair play rules.

Crowds of supporters thronged to the club's Parc des Princes stadium, chanting and setting off smoke flares.

"It's going to be mad. There's a legend arriving, after all," said supporter Florent Chauveau.

Messi arrived in Paris on a private jet earlier in the day with his wife and three children, waving to hundreds of supporters gathered outside the airport before being whisked to a private hospital for a medical. He later waved to dozens of fans who had assembled beneath the balcony of his hotel room.

From tears to smiles

Only two days ago, Messi had wept as he bade farewell to his boyhood team, describing his feelings at being told he had to leave as like having "a bucket of cold water poured over me".

However, he said he wanted to carry on competing and that he still harboured ambitions to win another Champions League trophy - one that his new club has never won, despite Qatar Sports Investment's lavish spending.

Neymar and Mbappe were already the two most expensive soccer players in history, and the addition of Messi to Mauricio Pochettino's PSG line-up could rival the unstoppable triumvirate that he formed at Barcelona with Neymar and Luis Suarez.

Messi will wear the number 30 shirt, the club confirmed in a video posted on its Twitter feed, headlined "a new diamond in Paris".

Messi, who won four Champions Leagues and 10 domestic league titles with Barcelona, joins several other big names arriving at PSG on a free transfer this summer.

Spain defender Sergio Ramos was no longer wanted at Real Madrid, Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum had run down his contract with Liverpool and Italy's Euro 2020-winning goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma also joined after his contract with AC Milan ran out.

The arrival of Messi, whose last contract with Barcelona was worth a total of 555 million euros ($650 million) and reported to be the most lucrative in world sport, is also set to provoke a renewed new debate about UEFA's financial fair play rules.

Soccer's European governing body introduced the rules in 2009 in an attempt to restrict the power of free-spending owners to buy success, but their success is debatable.

The star-power of Messi, who has 245 million followers on Instagram, will be welcome news for Ligue 1 as a battle rages between broadcasters over the price of its television rights, crucial to the finances of the clubs.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lionel Messi wept on Sunday as he bade farewell to his boyhood team FC Barcelona and confirmed he was talking with French club Paris St Germain over a possible move.

The 34-year-old Argentine's emotional news conference followed Barca's announcement last week that it could no longer afford him after a glittering two decades.

French newspaper L'Equipe reported on Sunday that he will travel to Paris either Sunday or Monday to undertake a medical and finalise a deal with the Qatar Sports Investment-owned club.

Spanish newspaper Marca reported PSG formally sent their offer to Messi on Sunday morning, just as the Argentine held the news conference.

While Messi did not confirm he would definitely join the Parisians, he said his plans were to carry on playing as long as possible, adding he still harbours ambitions to win another Champions League trophy.

"As long as I go on being competitive and as long as my body responds (I'll carry on playing)," he told a news conference.

"As long as I can, I will carry on competing."

PSG declined to comment on the report that Messi would be arriving in Paris later on Sunday. "We are not in a position to confirm anything," a club spokesman said.

"I tried to behave with humility and respect and I hope that is what remains of me when I leave the club," said an emotional Messi as hundreds of fans, many wearing his No. 10 jersey, massed outside Barca's Camp Nou stadium to bid farewell to the player they called Messiah.

Messi broke down as he walked onto the stage before conducting his news conference and was handed a tissue by his wife Antonella Roccuzzo as he fought back the tears.

"This is the toughest moment of my career. When the club told me, I just froze. This is all like a bucket of cold water has been poured over me and we are still coming to terms with it," he sobbed.

"When I get home, I'm sure it'll be even worse. But I'll be surrounded by my loved ones and I'll carry on playing football, and when I do so, I'm sure it'll become a bit easier."

Financial issues

It had been widely reported by local media that Messi was set to stay at Camp Nou, with the player admitting he had agreed to a five-year deal involving a 50% pay-cut.

Barca, whose debts total way over 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion), were unable to make the deal work within the frameworks of La Liga's financial fair play regulations - prompting their surprise u-turn announcement last Thursday.

"Honestly, when the elections happened (in March), I spoke with (Barca president Joan) Laporta, we had dinner and after that I was convinced I would be staying," Messi said.

"My contract was never the issue ... What I know is that I did everything I could. The club say it could not happen because of La Liga. I can guarantee you that I did everything I could to stay. Last year I didn't want to and I said that, but this year it was different."

La Liga announced last Wednesday that it had secured a private equity injection of 2.7 billion euros from firm CVC, with the funds to be shared amongst the clubs in return for a 10% of the league's revenue.

It had been believed this would allow Barcelona to get the Messi deal over the line, however after Real Madrid rejected the proposal and said they would take legal action against La Liga, Barca also came out against it.

Laporta told a news conference on Friday that Barca's finances were in worse shape than he had thought after conducting an audit.

He added the league informed him that accepting this injection was the only way they would approve a new contract for Messi, but rejected that saying he had to put the long-term interests of the club above any player.

Marca also reported on Sunday that Barca fans had hired a French lawyer, who had lodged a case with the Paris Appeals Court to try and block Messi's move to PSG.

Record breaker

Messi, Barca's all-time record goalscorer with 682 in 21 years, received a lengthy standing ovation from the media, current and former team mates and coaches in attendance.

It was noticeable that he was not accompanied by Laporta or any of the other Barcelona directors.

All 35 trophies he won during his time at the club were laid out for what the club described would be a private photo session after the news conference.

Barcelona face Juventus in a pre-season friendly on Sunday, with nobody given Messi's No.10 shirt for the game.

The club have not confirmed if they plan on leaving it vacant for the new season.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@YOKOHAMA -- Brazil retained their Olympic football title with substitute Malcom scoring an extra-time winner in a 2-1 victory over Spain in the men's gold medal match on Saturday.

After the game ended 1-1 in normal time, Malcom raced onto a diagonal ball from Antony and got the better of Jesus Vallejo before driving the winner into the far corner in the 108th minute to ensure Brazil repeated their Rio 2016 triumph.

"This was the most important goal of my life," a beaming Malcom told reporters, "It is such a unique moment".

Dani Alves, Brazil's 38-year-old captain, who had led the team as an over-age player in a bid to win a major global tournament with his country, collapsed to his knees at the final whistle and buried his face in his hands.

"My captain Dani, he's unbelievable, he helps everyone. He lifts us up, He's unbelievable, I don't have words for him," Brazil's other goalscorer Matheus Cunha said.

The Brazilian players made up for the absence of fans in the 65,000 Yokohama stadium by going through the full repertoire of celebratory songs after the final whistle.

An Olympic gold in football will never match a World Cup title but for 120 minutes there was no doubt that this match meant plenty to both sides.

Brazil were awarded a penalty in the 39th minute when Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon came out to punch clear a cross but crashed into Cunha, only for Richarlison to blast the spot-kick high over the bar.

The South Americans grabbed the lead on the stroke of halftime, however, when a deep Claudinho cross was hooked back across the area by Dani Alves and Cunha brought the ball down to slot home.

Spain threatened little but got on level terms in the 61st minute when substitute Carlos Soler broke down the right and whipped a cross to the back post where Mikel Oyarzabal connected with a sweet left-foot volley that whistled past Santos.

With Brazil looking to break on the counter and Spain moving the ball well, the game was tightly balanced in the latter stages but the Spaniards came closest to grabbing a win in normal time.

Oscar Gil's cross shot from the right caught out Santos and struck the top of the bar in the 86th minute and two minutes later Bryan Gil's thundering shot from outside the box blasted against the bar.

That meant extra-time and the introduction of Malcom by Brazil coach Andre Jardine, which proved to be crucial as the Zenit St Petersburg winger wrote his name into Brazilian football folklore.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lionel Messi is set to join Paris St Germain after Barcelona were forced to let their Argentine talisman go as they could not afford to give him a new contract under La Liga's salary limit rules, L'Equipe reported on Friday.

Earlier on Friday, PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino said Messi was an "option" that was being evaluated by the Ligue 1 club.

A move to PSG would reunite Messi, who has officially been a free agent since July 1, with his former Barcelona team mate Neymar.

On Thursday, the six-time Ballon d'Or winner left Barcelona despite both parties having reached an agreement over a new contract, citing economic and structural obstacles to the renewal of the deal.

The 34-year-old was expected to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, which would have included a salary reduction of 50%.

Barcelona president Joan Laporta said on Friday that the club was forced to let Messi leave because his high wages coupled with strict La Liga financial rules could have jeopardised its future.

Messi had tried to leave Barcelona in August 2020, making a formal request for an exit after a breakdown in his relationship with then president Josep Maria Bartomeu but successor Laporta, who presided over the Argentine's rise to greatness, convinced him to stay.

Messi has spent his entire professional career at Barcelona, having joined the club's youth set-up aged 13, and went on to score 672 goals in 778 games across all competitions since making his debut in 2003.

PSG have been busy in the off-season, having already brought in Gianluigi Donnarumma from AC Milan, Sergio Ramos from Real Madrid and Georginio Wijnaldum from Liverpool, all on free transfers. Full back Achraf Hakimi was signed from Inter Milan.

They will begin their new Ligue 1 campaign at newly promoted Troyes on Saturday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@MADRID -- Six-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi will leave Barcelona despite both parties having reached an agreement over a new contract, the La Liga club said on Thursday, citing economic and structural obstacles to the renewal of the deal.

Messi, who joined Barca's youth set-up aged 13, is the club's all-time top scorer and appearance maker with 672 goals in 778 games in all competitions.

The Argentina forward was free to negotiate a transfer with other clubs after his deal ran out at the end of June, but Barcelona had always maintained he wanted to stay with the club.

Messi, who has spent his whole career at Barcelona, had been expected to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, which would have included a salary reduction of 50%.

Barcelona needed to financially restructure in order to get the deal over the line, which proved impossible in the end as they failed to reduce their wage bill in order and stay within La Liga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations.

"Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles (Spanish La Liga regulations)," Barca said in a statement.

"As a result of this situation, Messi shall not be staying on at FC Barcelona. Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of the player and the club will ultimately not be fulfilled.

"FC Barcelona wholeheartedly expresses its gratitude to the player for his contribution to the aggrandisement of the club and wishes him all the very best for the future in his personal and professional life."

Free agent Messi

Messi's last contract, signed in 2017, was the most lucrative in world sport according to a January report in newspaper El Mundo.

Messi had tried to leave Barcelona in August 2020, making a formal request for an exit after a break down in his relationship with then president Josep Maria Bartomeu but successor Joan Laporta, who presided over the Argentine's rise to greatness, convinced him to stay.

The Argentine, who helped Barcelona claim 10 league titles, four Champions Leagues and three Club World Cups among his haul of 35 trophies, remains without a club ahead of the 2021-22 season.

Questions rise over his future but Messi has long been linked with a move to either French club Paris St Germain (PSG) or Manchester City, where he would be reunited with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola.

PSG, managed by Messi's compatriot Mauricio Pochettino, reached out immediately after it was announced that he was leaving Barcelona, the Athletic reported.

Meanwhile, some observers believe Messi's exit announcement to be a major calling of La Liga's bluff from Barca. read more

Threatening to allow the best player in the world to leave the league because of imposed constraints may persuade La Liga to loosen their financial fair play regulations to allow him to stay, some observers have suggested.

Barcelona's financial woes

Barcelona have been struggling to reduce their wage bill to be in line with La Liga's FFP rules for the 2021-22 season.

La Liga introduced financial control measures in 2013 establishing a maximum amount of money each club can spend on its playing squad and coaching staff each season, conditioned by their income.

Barca have the highest revenues in world soccer according to this year's Deloitte Money League, although income dropped by 125 million euros last year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Spanish media reported Barca had been in talks with their top-earning players such as vice-captains Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Sergi Roberto about reducing their salaries by 40% in return for contract extensions.

Barca had also been trying to sell high-earning players including Antoine Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho, Samuel Umtiti and Martin Braithwaite but have not yet found suitors for them.

But the club, along with rivals Real Madrid and Serie A's Juventus are still clinging on to their plans for the European Super League after a court ruled that governing body UEFA terminate disciplinary proceedings against founding members of the breakaway project.

The Catalan club's president Joan Laporta will hold a news conference on Friday morning in the wake of departure of Messi, who celebrated his first major international title with Argentina last month when they beat rivals Brazil in the Copa America final.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Vietnamese delegation to the Tokyo Olympics has left the Games without a medal of any kind as its athletes had an unsuccessful campaign compared to other Southeast Asian friends.

Among other regional representatives, Indonesia took home five medals, the Philippines won two, Thailand and Malaysia secured one each, as of Wednesday afternoon.

Meanwhile, Vietnamese athletes were eliminated from all of their events before gradually making their way home while the Games have yet to be concluded.

All medal hopefuls fail

Vietnam had a total of 18 official and honor tickets to compete in 11 sports at the Tokyo Olympics, which began on July 23 and will close on August 8, after being postponed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The team had set a target to win a medal at the global competition.

However, that modest goal was missed as all of its medal hopefuls had unsuccessful performances, making it the first time that the country has left an Olympics empty-handed since 2004.

In track and field, all eyes were on Quach Thi Lan as she was the only Southeast Asian representative who made it to the women’s 400-meter hurdles semifinals with a result of 55.71 seconds in the qualifying round.

However, Lan’s performance worsened in the semifinals, given the undesirable weather.

The result of 56.78 seconds was pale in comparison with runners from other strong teams and could not help the Vietnamese athlete progress to the finals.

In badminton, Nguyen Thi Linh and veteran Nguyen Tien Minh both stopped in the qualification round.

Linh beat two stronger competitors from France and Switzerland, but was defeated by the world number one, Taiwan's Tai Tzu Ying, while 38-year-old Minh lost both of his matches.

Hoang Thi Duyen also missed the most promising opportunity in the women’s 59-kilogram weightlifting event.

Duyen’s failure came as a surprise to spectators as she was anticipated to win a silver medal by the Associated Press.

Her teammate, Thach Kim Tuan, who was also hopeful for a bronze medal, failed in all of his three attempts in the men’s 61-kilogram category.

Vietnam’s hopes in martial arts were dashed as judo fighter Nguyen Thi Thanh Thuy and boxer Nguyen Thi Tam both lost their first match while Taekwondo fighter Truong Thi Kim Tuyen and boxer Nguyen Van Duong won their first matches, but lost their second.

Even the biggest medal hopefuls, shooter Hoang Xuan Vinh, who captured the men’s 10-meter air pistol gold medal and the 50-meter pistol silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and national-record holding swimmer Nguyen Thi Anh Vien, were eliminated after the qualification rounds.

Vietnamese athletes in other sports, including rowing, gymnastics, and archery, could not produce any surprise either.

Regional achievements tell nothing

The zero medal run at the Tokyo Olympics has proved that the achievements at the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, where Vietnam has always been among the top leaders of the medal tally, unnecessarily reflect the development of sports in the country as well as its peers in the region.

Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines won a total of 41, 30, 28, and 19 slots to the Olympic Games in Japan -- all higher than Vietnam’s 18 tickets.

From the 2016 Olympics and earlier, Thailand had also won a total of 33 medals, including nine gold medals, while Indonesia had garnered a combined number of 32 medals, with seven of them being gold.

Thailand claimed its first medal at the 1976 Olympics, while Indonesia did so at the 1998 Games.

Vietnam has secured only five Olympic medals so far, including one gold, three silvers, and one bronze, with the first-ever medal taken home by taekwondo fighter Tran Hieu Ngan at the 2000 Olymlic Games in Sydney.

In contrast to the Olympic results, the Philippines ranked first with 149 gold medals, Vietnam was the runner-up with 98 gold medals, Thailand followed in third with 92 gold medals, Indonesia placed fourth with 72 gold medals, and Malaysia finished fifth with 55 gold medals at the 2019 SEA Games.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Tokyo last hosted the Olympics, in 1964, Itsuo Masuda was deeply depressed, struggling with his sexuality. This year he watched openly gay and transgender athletes compete with pride.

The 2020 Tokyo Games has been described as the most diverse Olympics yet in terms of participation by sexual minorities, with OutSports reporting a record 179 out LGBTQ athletes taking part.

It's a world away from Masuda's recollection of Tokyo's first Games.

Being LGBTQ "was a big taboo, absolutely!"

"It had to be a secret. I am sure there were LGBTQ people around, but no one talked about it," he told AFP.

Now 73, Masuda is now an out gay man and owner of gay bar "Kusuo", a well-known spot in the city's LGBTQ district Shinjuku Nichome where he once hosted Freddie Mercury, but he had a difficult time as a teenager.

"I admired men, but I didn't even know that it was about my sexuality. I was so troubled by it," said Masuda, who was 16 at the time of the 1964 Games.

"I would often write to my mother that I wanted to die, which just made her cry all the time."

A virus state of emergency means Masuda's bar is currently closed, and he watches the Games there alone.

But he is delighted to see how things have changed from his childhood, and even improved from the last Games. There are triple the number of out athletes participating in Tokyo than in Rio, according to OutSports, a US-based site.

'Nothing to feel ashamed about'

"We live in a good world now. We can make choices," he told AFP.

"There's nothing to feel ashamed about."

While Japan has some protections for LGBTQ people, it remains the only G7 country that does not recognise same-sex unions, and many couples say they can struggle to rent apartments together and are barred from hospital visits.

And transgender people who wish to change their official documents must meet strict criteria, including being designated as without reproductive capacity, which effectively requires most people to be sterilised to meet the standard.

Tokyo's Games are the first to feature an openly transgender woman -- New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard, who competed Monday in the weightlifting.

The 43-year-old, who was born male and competed as a man before transitioning, has faced a tsunami of negative social media commentary, and Masuda expressed sympathy as he watched her compete.

"The poor thing, facing such criticism," he said. "She is only human."

'Pave the way'

The Games come at a time when many in Japan's LGBTQ community are pushing for greater rights.

Ahead of the Olympics, campaigners said the country was at a "turning point" and that they hoped the Games would help galvanise support for an anti-discrimination bill.

Pride House, a centre of the community that is also part of the official Olympic programme, has said it hopes the Games' momentum will bring changes both in Japanese sports and society.

Its head, Gon Matsunaka, said Hubbard's participation in the Games sent a message of inclusivity but warned there was a long road ahead for LGBTQ people, both in Japan and abroad.

"They shouldn't need to be courageous just because they are transgender," he said.

"We need to make a world in which those people who have long been left out of sports can enjoy taking part just like everyone else."

Masuda said Hubbard's presence would "pave the way for future generations".

"We'll remember this Tokyo Olympics decades from now and think 'Oh, that's how it used to be'," he said.

"Eventually it will be natural to see it (LGBTQ participation) as normal," he added.

"We'll just need to live a little longer so we can watch the fun."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The risk of developing neurodegenerative disease in former professional soccer players varies by position and career length but not by playing era, according to a landmark study.

Research from Professor Willie Stewart, who leads the FIELD (Football's Influence on Lifelong Health and Dementia Risk) study, previously found that former footballers are 3.5 times more likely to die with dementia than the general public.

New research has shown that outfield players were four times more likely to be diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease with the risk being highest among defenders, who are five times more likely to have dementia than non-footballers.

The study, which compared health records of 7,676 Scottish male players, found that the risk increased with the length of their careers, but the findings remained the same for players regardless of the era in which they competed.

"With the current data, we're now at the point to suggest that football should be sold with a health warning saying repeated heading in football may lead to an increased risk of dementia," Stewart said.

"The data from this paper is the missing link in trying to understand this connection between sport and dementia... There is no other proposed risk factor and this is one we could really address and eliminate this disease.

"I think football has to ask the difficult questions: is heading absolutely necessary to the game of football? Is potential exposure to degenerative brain disease absolutely necessary? Or can some other form of the game be considered?"

Last week, the Football Association (FA), Premier League and other governing bodies announced guidelines limiting "high-impact" headers to 10 per week in training from the 2021-22 season.

Stewart criticised the rules, which were implemented as a precautionary measure, arguing they were based on "unscientific guesswork".

"There is no basis on which to say 10 headers of a certain level will somehow produce no risk or even make a great difference to risk. It is a best guesstimate and we would have to wait 30 or 40 years to see the impact," he said.

The research, funded by the FA and the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), was conducted by the University of Glasgow and published in the journal JAMA Neurology on Monday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TOKYO -- Canada stunned world champions the United States on Monday, handing them a shock 1-0 defeat in the semi-finals of the women's Olympic football tournament to set up a clash with Sweden in Friday's showpiece match.

The Swedes beat Australia 1-0 thanks to a 46th-minute goal from Fridolina Rolfo to return to the final after their silver medal in Rio five years ago.

Canada celebrated their first win over the U.S. in over 20 years after Jessie Fleming's 75th minute penalty settled the contest.

The crucial moment, in a game which had produced little incident, came when U.S. defender Tierna Davidson challenged Deanne Rose on the edge of the penalty area. After a video review, a spot kick was awarded.

Canada's veteran striker Christian Sinclair initially had the ball in her hands, but Fleming took the responsibility and kept her cool to slot home.

The U.S, pre-Games favourites for the gold medal, went close to an equaliser when Carli Lloyd struck the bar with a header but Canada held on for a famous victory - and their first appearance in an Olympic final.

The Americans have won the gold medal four times and have not lost to Canada for over 20 years. It is only the fourth time the Canadians have beaten their neighbours in 62 meetings.

"It has been a long time coming to beat those guys," said Fleming. "We want to come away with gold now but it is really special for us to put our flag on the map," she said.

Triple substitution

The game was a dull affair until a triple substitution saw Megan Rapinoe, Lloyd and Christen Press brought on -- a change which brought new life to the American attack.

The first effort on goal finally arrived in the 65th minute with a curling shot from Lloyd which was tipped over by Stephanie Labbe, and moments later the Canada keeper did well to keep out a glancing header from Julie Ertz.

But just as the Americans were piling on the pressure, a Canada break led to the penalty award and the end of the road for Vlatko Andonovski's side.

"It sucks. Obviously you never want to lose, you never want to lose in a world championship, you never want to lose to Canada, obviously, and you never want to lose playing the way we did," said Rapinoe.

Sweden, who lost to Germany in the Rio final, fired an early warning with a Rolfo shot rattling the crossbar.

Australia, seeking a first Olympic final, thought they had gone ahead just before the break with a Sam Kerr effort but the goal was ruled out for a foul.

It was the Swedes who took the lead when Matilda's keeper Teagan Micah could only push a looping, deflected shot from Filippa Angeldal against the bar and Rolfo hooked in the loose ball.

Australia were reduced to 10 players in stoppage time when Ellie Carpenter was sent off for pulling down Sweden substitute Lina Hurtig as she ran goalwards.

"It is amazing, I am so happy," said Angeldal, "I think we learnt a lot from this game, we worked so hard as a team and we will have to bring that to the final."

"It feels like I am in paradise. I love to play with this team, we have a great team spirit," she added.

Kerr said she was disappointed with the ruling out of her goal.

"Obviously, we are disappointed because we wanted to be in the gold medal match but at the end of the day, we have got a game against the U.S and the bronze medal is at stake," she said.

The bronze medal game will be held in Kashima on Thursday with the gold medal match at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo on Friday.

The men's semi-finals will be held on Tuesday with Mexico taking on Brazil and Japan up against Spain.

Brazil should have had the outcome decided by the interval given the amount of chances they created but Germany struck twice in the second half, despite going down to 10 men in the 63rd minute.

Brazil found plenty of space from the outset and Matheus Cunha could have put them ahead in the fifth minute but his low shot at the near post was kept out by keeper Florian Mueller.

Two minutes later though the Brazilians had the lead when Richarlison burst through the inside right channel and after his first shot was parried he made no mistake with his second attempt, drilling the ball past Mueller.

The German defence was all at sea and Mueller was busy again to foil Richarlison as the forward attempted to round him and then kept out Claudinho’s effort from the loose ball.

It was no surprise when Brazil doubled their advantage with Guilherme Arana, in acres of space down the left, taking his time to pick out Richarlison in the middle and the Everton striker’s powerful header flashed past Mueller.

Richarlison completed his hat-trick with a superbly taken solo goal, curling the ball into the far corner after being set up by Matheus Cunha.

It should have been 4-0 shortly before the interval but Cunha saw his penalty kick well saved by Mueller after Benjamin Henrichs handled the ball inside the box.

The chances kept coming for Brazil after the break but Stefan Kuntz’s Germany side did manage to get a goal back, against the run of play, with a 57th minute Nadiem Amiri effort which keeper Santos should have kept out.

A miserable night for the Germans got worse when Max Arnold was sent off in the 63rd minute, rather harshly, for a second yellow card.

Germany gave themselves a lifeline six minutes from the end when Ragnar Ache powered in a header from a David Raum cross to make it 3-2.

But with Germany pushing forward, Brazil caught them on the break in stoppage time, Paulinho finishing off a counter-attack with a fine shot into the top corner.

The match was a repeat of the gold medal game from Rio five years ago and was played at the venue where Brazil beat Germany in the World Cup final in 2002.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Japan's women's softball team got the Tokyo 2020 Olympics off to a winning start for the hosts on Wednesday, a boost for the pandemic-postponed Games that the World Health Organization sees as "a celebration of hope" even as COVID-19 cases surge.

Olympics and Japanese officials have forged ahead with the sports spectacle despite opposition in the country to hosting more than 11,000 athletes, staff and media.

But spectators have been barred and restrictions imposed in host city Tokyo in an effort to minimise health risks and contain a mounting number of infections.

WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Games should go ahead to demonstrate to the world what can be achieved with the right plan and measures.

"May the rays of hope from this land illuminate a new dawn for a healthy, safer and fairer world," he said, holding aloft an Olympic Games torch as he addressed the International Olympic Committee members at their session in the Japanese capital. "It is my sincere hope the Tokyo Games succeed."

But Tedros warned the world was in the early stages of another wave of infections and criticised the vaccine discrepancies between countries.

"The pandemic will end when the world chooses to end it. It is in our hands," he said. "We have all the tools we need. We can prevent this disease, we can test for it and we can treat it."

Japan, with about 34% of the population having had at least one dose of the vaccine, has been concerned the Olympics could become a super-spreader event.

In a recent poll in the Asahi newspaper, 68% of respondents expressed doubt about the ability of Olympic organisers to control coronavirus infections, with 55% saying they were opposed to the Games going ahead.

Japanese domestic media reported that government adviser Shigeru Omi said Tokyo daily COVID-19 infections may spike to a record level of 3,000 in the first week of August.

That would cause an extremely high risk of pressuring on the already-stretched medical system.

Underscoring the downsized Games due to the pandemic, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will only meet with less than 20 country leaders on the sidelines of the Olympics, down from as many as 120 originally scheduled, the Mainichi Shimbun daily reported.

The softball match between a gold-medal contender Japan and Australia was held amid buzzing cicadas and polite applause from a few hundred staff as a trio of two-run homers cleared the fence after spectators were banned at the stadium.

The game ended after five innings due to a mercy rule.

Players standing along the benches under the scorching sun - 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) by midgame - shouted at the hitters all morning, giving the game a Little League feel.

The match was held in Fukushima, the area devastated by the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl, which was triggered by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Two more softball games as well as the first six women's soccer matches are scheduled for later Wednesday. The opening ceremony is Friday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Vietnamese delegation of 43 members to the Tokyo Olympics departed late on Sunday night and arrived at the athletes’ village in the Japanese capital on Monday morning.

All of the 43 members have been admitted to the Olympic Village after testing negative for the coronavirus as per local regulations.

The delegation comprises 18 athletes in gymnastics, athletics, swimming, shooting, taekwondo, archery, badminton, rowing, boxing, judo, and weightlifting, and two doctors, four officials, one reporter, and 18 coaches, experts, and team leaders.

They boarded flight JL752 that took off at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi at 11:20 pm on Sunday (Vietnam time) and landed at Narita International Airport in Tokyo at 6:00 am on Monday (Japan time).

Upon their arrival at Narita, they underwent rapid COVID-19 tests before being transported over 60km to the Olympic Village.

The delegation has been placed under quarantine for three days, after which the Vietnamese athletes can begin practicing for their competitions at the Games unless a member tests positive for the virus then.

The team has set a target to win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8, after being postponed for a year due to the global pandemic.

The Vietnamese government and sponsors have pledged to reward Vietnamese athletes with VND1.85 billion (US$80,450) for winning a gold medal, VND1.02 billion ($44,350) for claiming a silver medal, and VND640 million ($27,830) for scoring a bronze medal at the global sporting event.

Vietnam left the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with one gold and one silver medals in the men’s air pistol categories.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As global interest in women's football approaches fever pitch, former champions Japan are eyeing a return to glory with the country's first professional league for female players.

A decade since winning the 2011 Women's World Cup, Japan has fallen behind, even as the sport becomes more popular and lucrative elsewhere.

But the new league's organisers hope it will bring prestige and fresh talent to Japanese clubs when it kicks off in September, tapping into growing enthusiasm across the region ahead of the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

"We had a sense of urgency, as we felt that Japan would be left behind globally if it didn't go pro now," said Kikuko Okajima, chair of the WE League -- short for Women Empowerment.

"We're in the middle of a pandemic, but we decided not to delay the tournament and to launch the pro-league," she told AFP.

Japan is currently 10th in the FIFA women's rankings, behind several European teams and the number-one US side, who were led to victory at the last World Cup by star winger Megan Rapinoe.

The national team -- nicknamed "Nadeshiko" after a pink flower that symbolises femininity in Japan -- won silver at the London 2012 Olympics but failed to qualify for Rio, and its chances of a medal this summer on home turf are slim.

Okajima says Japan's clubs are finding it harder to keep up as teams in Europe and elsewhere go professional, meaning "the level of women's football is rapidly rising".

But players at Chifure AS Elfen Saitama, one of the WE League's 11 inaugural clubs, see a bright future.

Goalkeeper Natsumi Asano, 23, called the league's launch a "very important step".

"I am hopeful, and I also feel responsible as a player" for the game's success, she told AFP as her teammates practised headers and talked tactics at their training ground near Tokyo.

Female footballers aren't always recognised for their talents in Japan, Asano said, recalling her surprise when she was greeted with loud cheers at an under-17s match in the United States.

She hopes that will change as the league grows.

"If we can show we're just as great as men's football teams... there will be more sponsors and supporters," she said.

'A dream and a goal'

Okajima hopes to raise the profile of the sport in Japan and attract new fans, especially women in their teens and twenties.

Just 1,300 supporters on average turn up to games in the country's top semi-professional women's league, while a popular team in the US can draw a crowd of 20,000, she said.

And only 3.3 percent of registered Japanese players are women, with the number of female players staying roughly the same over the past 10 years.

It's still common for female players in Japan to have a day job and train in the afternoon, while many teams don't have permanent grounds.

"Women couldn't earn a living with football. But once it goes pro, becoming a footballer can be a dream and a goal for girls," said AS Elfen midfielder Emi Yamamoto.

The 39-year-old spent several years at teams in Italy and the US, and says many others have done the same because they could not go pro in Japan.

"If the league reaches the top level worldwide, everyone, including foreign players, will want to play here," she said.

'Social message upfront'

In another boost to players' international ambitions, a women's Asian Champions League is set to launch in 2023, the regional football governing body said earlier this year.

Meanwhile the WE League, which is funded through sponsorship and subsidies, has another goal closer to home -- to create more jobs for women in the male-dominated sports sector.

The league's clubs are required to have at least one female coach, while half the staff and one decision-maker must be women.

"It's a league that displays its social message upfront," Okajima said.

The main challenge for the WE League might be launching in a pandemic.

Pre-season matches had to be held without spectators due to surging cases, but Okajima says the team is trying to drum up support online, reaching a deal with an online streaming platform to air their tournament.

And goalkeeper Asano is confident that glory could once again beckon for the Japanese side.

"The level of the Japan team will go up if the level of the league rises," she said.

"That way, I think we will step closer to winning the World Cup again."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The debate will rage on but Novak Djokovic believes he is the best player in the modern era after claiming a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title by beating Italy's Matteo Berrettini in the Wimbledon final on Sunday.

By adding a sixth Wimbledon title to the second French Open he won last month and the ninth Australian crown he earned in February, the 34-year-old Serb has put together a sensational year which has moved him alongside Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal at the top of the list of men's Grand Slam winners.

With Swiss Federer close to his 40th birthday and Spaniard Nadal, 35, having lost his grip on Roland Garros after losing to Djokovic this year, the Serb is destined to forge ahead.

"I consider myself best and I believe that I am the best, otherwise I wouldn't be talking confidently about winning slams and making history," Djokovic, who withstood the ferocious firepower of Berrettini to win 6-7(4) 6-4 6-4 6-3 in a fever-pitch atmosphere on Centre Court, told reporters.

"But whether I'm the greatest of all time or not, I leave that debate to other people. I said before that it's very difficult to compare the eras of tennis.

"We have different rackets, technology, balls, courts. It's just completely different conditions that we're playing in, so it's very hard to compare tennis from 50 years ago to today."

Djokovic declared himself "honoured to be part of the conversation" but the evidence is stacking up in his favour after his third successive Wimbledon title.

Golden Trio

Djokovic is the only one of the golden trio to win every Grand Slam title at least twice and he is the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the year's first three Grand Slams.

Should he win a fourth U.S. Open later this year he will match Laver's calendar-year Slam of 1969 that has proven beyond all the greats since, including Federer and Nadal.

He also holds the record for most weeks ranked number one on the ATP rankings -- 328 and counting after surpassing Federer's mark of 310 weeks in March.

Incredibly, when Djokovic won his second Grand Slam title in 2011, Federer already had 16 and Nadal nine.

The relentless Serb said it was not until a few years ago that he thought he could challenge their duopoly.

"I probably started thinking about trying to reach the record of most Grand Slams won, most weeks at number one, probably two to three years ago," he said.

"Before that it seemed a little bit out of reach. I've always kind of believed that I could play my best tennis in Grand Slams and give myself a good chance to win any slam really on any surface because I know what I'm capable of.

"I know I have a very complete game that has proven to be successful on all surfaces in the past.

"It's really fortunate for me and incredible that it's all coming together in the same year. That's something that I didn't expect, but I always dream of achieving the biggest things."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ROME -- Italians poured into streets and squares in massive numbers on Sunday as the national soccer team beat England to win Euro 2020, celebrating a success widely seen as a rebound from the heartbreak failure of not qualifying for the last World Cup.

Fireworks and music broke out across the country after the 3-2 shootout win, following a 1-1 draw after extra time, as flags waved and euphoric fans sang out in the hot summer night after the final played at London's Wembley stadium.

"It's incredible, it's incredible, you can't feel better than this, it is amazing, we won the final," said Stefano Gucci, a fan in the crowds at Piazza Del Popolo in Rome.

Italians praised national team coach Roberto Mancini for leading the country out of the depths of disappointment when they missed out on qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia and for guiding them to their first Euro title since 1968.

"Great gratitude to Roberto Mancini and our players who have represented Italy well and have brought honour to sports," President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella said in a statement.

Joy erupted in cities from the north to the south of the country after the final save by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Bukayo Saka. Fans filled the central Milan Duomo square and cars beeped their horns in Naples.

Supporters gathered to celebrate also in Jesi, the central Italian hometown of coach Mancini.

"It is very important for Italy, and especially for us," a fan in Jesi holding a giant Italian flag told SkyTg24.

It is the first major international success for Italian soccer since the 2006 World Cup victory. The 'Azzurri' have suffered repeated failures since then, including a crushing defeat against Spain at the Euro 2012 final.

"You have given us a magical night," said Italian Olympic Committee chief Giovanni Malago.

Italy, where people have suffered during the coronavirus crisis and the deep economic recession provoked by the curbs, has welcomed the success with hope and relief.

"It's like living in a dream you don't want to wake up from. Italy has woken up from the nightmare of the pandemic," said fan Gianluca Iannilli, 25, who is studying to be an interpreter in Rome.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LONDON -- Italy claimed the European Championship for the first time since 1968 as penalties came back to haunt England at Wembley on Sunday, Gianluigi Donnarumma saving twice as the Azzurri won a shootout 3-2 after the game finished 1-1 following extra time.

The giant goalkeeper saved from Jadon Sancho and, decisively, Bukayo Saka after Marcus Rashford hit the post, as Federico Bernardeschi, Leonardo Bonucci and Domenico Berardi all scored for the Italians in the shootout.

Luke Shaw had given England a dream start with a superb goal after two minutes but Italy, who offered almost nothing in response in the first half, gradually took command and deservedly levelled through Bonucci after 67 minutes.

It was the first final decided on penalties since Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in 1976 and was wildly celebrated in Italy after they lost the final in 2000 and 2012.

For England coach Gareth Southgate, who missed from the spot when they lost in the Euro96 semi-final to Germany, it was another shootout horror show.

The two players he sent on late in extra time with penalties in mind missed their penalties, as did 19-year-old Saka, who crumpled under the pressure of taking the final kick.

Italy, have now won five and lost six of their 10 major tournament shootouts, including one win and one loss in World Cup finals, while England’s dismal record now reads seven losses from nine.

But England fans dreaming of a second title to add to the 1966 World Cup can hardly complain they were robbed this time, after their team followed a strong start by surrendering the initiative despite the support from most of the 67,000 crowd.

The match statistics told the story as Italy had 66% possession and 19 shots to England's six and, until the shootout, Donnarumma barely touched the ball.

Italy are now unbeaten in 34 matches, underlining the stunning turnaround fashioned by coach Roberto Mancini who took over after the country's humiliating failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.

"It was impossible even to think about this, but the guys were extraordinary," Mancini said. "I don’t have words for them, this is a magnificent group. We were great, we conceded an early goal and had some problems but then we dominated."

Bright start

It had all started so well for England when Harry Kane spread the ball wide to Kieran Trippier and he instantly repaid coach Southgate’s faith in recalling him by sending over a curling deep cross that Shaw met on the half volley to hammer inside the post for his first international goal.

England had taken an early lead in their 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia before being outplayed and losing in extra time but for a while they stayed on top, with the Italians arguing and running to Mancini for instructions as they struggled for a foothold.

England’s well-drilled defence, which had conceded one goal, via a Denmark free kick, in their six previous tournament games, looked safe enoughbut the players in front gradually began to concede more and more territory.

Jordan Pickford had to save from Lorenzo Insigne andFederico Chiesa as Italy cranked up the pressure and it paid dividends when Bonucci pounced from close range after the keeper had turned Andrea Belotti’s header onto a post.

England could have no complaints after inviting their opponents on and offering almost nothing in attack.

It was a similar story in extra time, though England did briefly force their way back into the game, albeit without creating much to reward the crowd for their waves of noise.

England briefly sensed glory in the shootout when Pickford saved from Belotti, and Kane and Harry Maguire put them 2-1 ahead. The keeper kept the hosts in it again when he saved from Jorginho, only for Donnarumma to have the final word when he blocked Saka's weakly-struck shot.

"The penalty takers are my call," said Southgate. "We know they were the best takers we had left on the pitch, and we tried to get those players on to the pitch.

"The players have given everything, not only tonight but throughout the whole tournament. They should hold their heads high... but the devastation of getting so close is difficult to put into context.

"At the moment the pain of the defeat is huge, we wanted to give our nation one more special night and a first European championship and we haven't quite been able to do it."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Argentina won their first major title in 28 years on Saturday when an Angel Di Maria goal gave them a 1-0 win over Brazil and a record-equalling 15th Copa America.

Di Maria started for just the second time in the Copa and he justified his selection by scoring the opener midway through the first half.

Renan Lodi failed to cut out a long ball forward from Rodrigo De Paul and Di Maria lobbed the stranded Ederson with aplomb.

Brazil piled on the pressure in an exciting second half but even with five strikers on the field they could not get an equaliser against an Argentine defence protected by the outstanding Rodrigo De Paul.

Argentina’s win was a particular triumph for Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, who picked up his first ever title in a blue and white shirt after more than a decade of club and individual honours.

Messi finished the tournament’s joint top goalscorer with four goals and was elected joint best player along with Neymar. But he was quiet throughout and uncharacteristically missed a golden opportunity to wrap the game up with two minutes remaining.

When the final whistle went, Argentina TV declared “Argentina Champions, Lionel Messi Champion!”

The victory was Argentina’s 15th Copa America triumph and means they draw level with Uruguay as the all-time leading winners.

Their win extended their sequence of undefeated matches to 20 under Lionel Scaloni and handed Brazil their first competitive defeat since they lost to Belgium in the quarter-finals of the 2018 World Cup.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Southeast Asian Games, which were due to take place in Vietnam this year, have been postponed because of the pandemic and will most likely be held in 2022, a member of the organising council said Thursday.

The regional Olympics were scheduled to be held in Hanoi and 11 other locations from November 21 to December 2.

But Vietnam is struggling to contain a new coronavirus outbreak, and many Southeast Asian Games events were planned in provinces hard-hit by the fresh wave of infections.

"Definitely, the 31st SEA games will not (be hosted) this year as scheduled in November," said Varin Tansuphasiri, Games Council member and deputy secretary of the Thai Olympic Committee.

"Vietnam wants to postpone the Games until next year, 2022."

The postponement was due to the pandemic, he said, with Vietnam proposing to host the Games in April or May next year.

The decision comes after Vietnam announced nine million people in Ho Chi Minh City would go into lockdown for two weeks in the early hours of Friday.

Hanoi, which was to be at the centre of the SEA Games, has had fewer cases but on Thursday suspended transport links with at least 14 cities and provinces to fight the virus' spread.

Virus clusters have appeared up and down the country, including in the northern industrial provinces of Bac Ninh and Bac Giang, where Games events were due to take place.

One badminton venue in Bac Giang has been turned into a field hospital.

Vietnam's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters Thursday that authorities had recommended to "postpone the hosting of 31st SEA Games to a more appropriate time".

'Too many games next year'

But Tansuphasiri said it was not straightforward to find a suitable time in next year's sporting calendar.

"There's already too many games next year," he said, citing the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022 and the Commonwealth Games in July next year.

"There will be a bit (of) trouble for Vietnam to host in 2022."

Vietnam was once a model for virus containment due to its extensive contact-tracing and strict quarantines, but it has struggled to procure and roll out vaccines.

It is currently facing its worst virus outbreak so far, with nearly 23,500 cases now recorded and 105 deaths.

Prior to this outbreak, which began in late April, fewer than 3,000 cases had been recorded across the country.

Its regional neighbours are faring much worse -- with Indonesia detecting tens of thousands of new cases each day and Thailand mulling harsher restrictions after a record daily death toll on Thursday.

"The SEA Games Federation members praised the work done thus far by the Vietnam Organising Committee but took note of the current conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic in the South-East Asian region," said a statement by the Olympic Council of Malaysia, which confirmed the postponement.

Vietnam previously hosted the SEA Games in 2003. It has allocated a budget of around $69 million for the Games.

The multisports competition is expected to attract nearly 20,000 participants, including about 7,000 athletes, from 11 countries, according to state media.

As well as Olympic disciplines, sports are likely to include billiards and snooker, bodybuilding, chess, bowling and kurash, an ancient form of Uzbek wrestling.

At the 2019 SEA Games, the Philippines -- the host nation -- topped the medal table, with 149 golds. Vietnam came second with 98 gold medals.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LONDON -- England and their long-suffering fans finally have the chance to add another trophy to the 1966 World Cup after they overcame Denmark 2-1 in extra-time on Wednesday to reach the European Championship final for the first time.

Harry Kane's goal, following up after his penalty had been saved, finally saw off battling Denmark to set up a Sunday showdown against Italy, also looking to shake off the '60s as they seek to win the title they last lifted in 1968.

On a night to remember in front of almost 60,000 roaring fans, England fell behind to Mikkel Damsgaard's superb free kick, equalised with an own goal, dominated the game and then won it via their captain, albeit somewhat unconvincingly, in the 104th minute.

"Unbelievable - what a game though," said Kane. "We dug deep and we got there when it mattered. We reacted really well - we're in a final at home, what a feeling."

It was of course a particularly special night for coach Gareth Southgate, whose penalty shoot-out miss sent England out of the semi-finals of Euro 96. "We said to the players at some point we're going to have to show resilience and come back from setbacks, and we did that tonight," he said.

"The most pleasing thing is that we've given our fans and our nation a fantastic night and the journey carries on for another four days. We've said we want to create memories I've said to the young ones 'it isn't always like this'."

It was a tough way for Denmark to end their emotional ride from the fear and distress of Christian Eriksen’s opening game collapse to their first semi-final since their shock Euro 92 win, but their exhausted players left Wembley with socks rolled down but heads held high.

"I am proud of this group and everyone who has been on this journey. It has been fantastic to be involved. I am hungry and empty, but I am also proud," said Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.

Crowd stunned

Having swept past Ukraine 4-0 in the quarter-finals, England knew they faced a considerable step up on Wednesday and the quality in the Danish ranks was amply illustrated after 30 minutes when Damsgaard fired a powerful, dipping 25-yard free kick over the wall and beyond the diving Jordan Pickford.

England had reached the semis without conceding a goal and the crowd were stunned. The question of how England would respond to their first real setbackwould now be addressed.

The answer was calmly and patiently, as they passed their way back into the ascendancy. Raheem Sterling was denied at point-blank range by Kasper Schmeichel before the 39th-minute equaliser, when Bukayo Saka hit the byline and fizzed over a low cross that Simon Kjaer bundled over his own line in his attempt to stop the ball reaching Sterling.

Schmeichel was on hand again with an excellent diving save to palm away a Harry Maguire header and England began to turn the screw in the second half, but, despite their relentless passing and probing around the box, they struggled to carve out a clear opening and the match rolled into extra time.

The extra 30 minutes became a virtual attack v defence exercise, as Schmeichel saved again from Kane and Jack Grealish and the fear of penalties began to rise among the home fans.

The ever-dangerous Sterling continued to drive into the box though and was eventually brought down by Joakim Maehle for the VAR-reviewed penalty that Kane struck poorly and Schmeichel blocked, only for the captain to tuck home the rebound.

England then negotiated the last 15 minutes to spark the loudest, and surely most confident rendition of "Football's Coming Home", ever to ring around Wembley.

"When you’ve waited as long as we have to get through a semi-final, the players - considering the limited international experience some of them have - have done an incredible job," Southgate said.

"We suffered in Moscow (in the 2018 World Cup semi-final defeat by Croatia) on a night like this and we've managed to put that right. It's an incredible occasion to be a part of. The fans were incredible all night. There was mayhem on the pitch and I was part of it. We’ve got to enjoy the fact we're in the final but there's one more massive hurdle to conquer."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BRASILIA -- Emiliano Martinez was the hero for Argentina as he saved three times in a shootout to take his team into a Copa America final match-up with Brazil after Tuesday's semi-final against Colombia finished 1-1 after 90 minutes.

Martinez, who tried to distract Colombia's players in the shootout with a barrage of trash talk, saved from Davinson Sanchez, Yerry Mina and Edwin Cardona.

Lionel Messi, Leandro Paredes and Lautaro Martinez scored for Argentina as they booked a spot against the host nation in Saturday’s final at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium.

“I’m speechless,” said Argentine keeper Martinez. “They took us to penalties and that’s a question of luck, today it was my turn for glory.”

Both sides had chances to win in an intense, end-to-end match punctuated by 46 fouls and 10 yellow cards.

Argentina are seeking to win their first major international title since lifting the Copa America in 1993 and once again Lionel Messi was the star man, notching up his fifth assist of the tournament to add to his four goals.

Taking a superb pass from Giovani Lo Celso after six minutes, Messi rolled the ball to Lautaro Martinez to fire home a low shot and give Argentina the lead.

Colombia found their feet soon after and hit the woodwork twice in a minute towards the end of the first half when Wilmar Barrio’s deflected shot struck the post and then Mina watched his header hit the bar from the resulting corner.

Their equaliser came on the hour mark when Luis Diaz finished from a tight angle to complete a surprise counter attack.

Argentina are now unbeaten in 19 games, with their last loss coming to Brazil in the semi-final of the 2019 Copa America. They were also the last team to beat Brazil, in November 2019 when Messi got the only goal of the game in a friendly in Saudi Arabia.

Since then Brazil, who beat Peru 1-0 on Monday to reach the final, have won 12 and drawn one.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The ITU Virtual Digital World 2020, an event co-organized by Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), kicked off on Tuesday evening.

Themed ‘Building A Digital World. Together,’ the three-day online event brings together more than 50 ITU member countries.

The technological foundation used during the event was developed by Vietnam's military-run Viettel telecom group.

In his opening remarks, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said the Vietnamese government has paid attention to telecommunication infrastructure development and considered IT one of the top priorities.

Digital transformation has been regarded as a crucial solution for helping the country develop more rapidly and sustainably, Dam added.

The deputy PM reiterated the Vietnamese government’s commitments to supporting and coordinating with the ITU and its member countries in building a digital world for peace, cooperation, and prosperity.

Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said Vietnam’s digital infrastructure is now ready for a digital-based economy and society.

Vietnamese technologies not only deal with domestic but also global issues, the minister said, adding that the country is striving to make technology a driver of development and global cooperation.

ITU Secretary General Houlin Zhao said Vietnam is an important partner in many markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean region, which has made the nation become a bright example in IT development to many other developing countries.

ITU is a United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies.

The first ITU telecom event was held in 1971. Since its 40th anniversary in 2011, the event has been held on an annual basis in a different location worldwide.

The 2020 edition is named ITU Digital World and takes place online from October 20 to 22.

The ITU Digital World 2021 will be back in its usual form in Hanoi in October next year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A golf tournament aimed at supporting Vietnamese start-ups first organized by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper last year is set to return for the second edition this September.

‘Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020’ is meant to support start-ups in the beginning period of their business by helping to connect young entrepreneurs with seasoned and successful business people.

During the tourney, which will be launched on September 18, the organizers will also present awards to the most excellent entrepreneurs of the start-up community.

Excited to participate

Many entrepreneurs, who are experienced golfers, are excited to take part in this year's competition. In their opinion, the tournament will give them a chance to both play golf and help the upcoming generation of business people.

“I appreciate Tuoi Tre for holding such a golf competition to promote start-ups and help experienced entrepreneurs have another approach to supporting them,” said Le Hai Binh, founder and chairman of the IT services company Mat Bao Group, who is also a golfer taking part in the tournament.

“The competition will provide young entrepreneurs with opportunities to meet with their potential investors among the golfers who participate in the tournament."

The competitors interviewed by Tuoi Tre applauded the paper's idea to create ‘a playground’ for start-up owners.

Meeting with other entrepreneurs on the golf course is certain to bring a different vibe than traditional environments like offices or working space, and may help generate stronger bonds between the participants, they said.

Overcoming COVID-19

Start-ups have been hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020 was also rescheduled to begin in September instead of April, when it was held last year, because of the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of the global health crisis, many entrepreneurs consider the tournament an occasion for them to support young entrepreneurs in getting over the adversities of the pandemic, especially since it is currently under control in Vietnam.

“The current situation is different from last year’s. The pandemic has presented start-ups with difficulty in accessing funds as almost all companies are impacted by the coronavirus,” Binh remarked.

“Of course [potential investors] must fight for the survival of their own companies first before considering investing in others."

According to Binh, in 'the new normal,' customers are likely to spend less so start-ups in the fields of services, travel, and food would be considerably impacted.

“Despite that, I am not quite pessimistic because there are always opportunities in challenging situations,” Binh said.

The chairman of Mat Bao Group believes that during the pandemic, entrepreneurs who can flexibly adapt to the new situation will emerge victorious and even achieve new breakthroughs.

“Tuoi Tre’s golf tournament for start-ups will offer them the opportunity to do so,” Binh said.

Lawyer Nguyen Thi Thanh Nha, legal director of the investment firm Openasia Group, said her experience as a shareholder in a few start-ups when she was younger helps her understand the advantages that start-ups have, such as youth, ambition, and knowledge.

But she also acknowledges the rigors they must face on the way to success such as networking, calling for suitable investors, and developing relationships with other start-ups.

“Participating in the [golf tournament] will help them partly solve these problems and build more new business relationships,” said Nha, who has played golf for 12 years.

“Business opportunities may come to them unexpectedly during this tournament, who knows?”

Honoring 25 excellent start-ups

With the aim of promoting and empowering the start-up community both in Ho Chi Minh City and the rest of Vietnam, Tuoi Tre and partners jointly present the Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020.

The tourney will also mark the 75th anniversary of Vietnam’s National Day (September 2), the 89th founding anniversary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union (March 26), and the 45th anniversary of the founding of Tuoi Tre (September 2).

Dozens of inspiring start-up stories have been published in Tuoi Tre in various formats since July in the lead-up to the tournament.

The opening gala is scheduled to take place on September 18 at the Long Thanh Golf Club in Dong Nai Province, 35 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For students from poor families, education is the best way to help themselves and their families get out of their plight and lift their communities out of poverty. Ironically, after all the effort of studying in difficulty throughout 12 years from elementary to high school, these students even with high academic records to enter college are unable to live their dreams because of their family’s financial situations. They simply cannot afford tuition fees and other expenses of higher education.

The “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” scholarship program of Tuoi Tre Newspaper has made great strides in helping these poor students. This program gave the first scholarship in Quang Tri Province in 2003. It has gradually spread to other provinces and now it covers the whole country.

Over 17 years, this scholarship program has helped more than 19,000 new college students who otherwise would not be able to afford higher education. Last year, there were more than 1,200 new college students from all over the country receiving scholarships.

Each poor student is given a standard scholarship of VND10 million (US$430). Very poor students are granted special scholarships worth VND15 million (US$645) each.

This year due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be more poor new college students in need of help, although the donation could be less than last year.

We would like to appeal for new and current donors to “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” so that at least 1,000 poor students around the country, among them 80 from Thua Thien-Hue Province, could receive scholarships this academic year.

Please send your donation to Bao Tuoi Tre, bank account: 113000006100 (for VND) at VietinBank, Branch 3, HCM City; or bank account: 0071370195845 (for USD) or 0071140373054 (for EUR) at Vietcombank, HCM City Branch, Swift Code: BFTVVNVX007; for “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” Scholarship Program.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A charity initiative administered 700 care packages on the weekend to workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Binh Tan District, as well as Lao and Cambodian students in the Pre-University College of Ho Chi Minh City.

The initiative was undertaken by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, supermarket chain Saigon Co.op, and e-commerce platform Shopee, with support from the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.

The organizers prepared essentials, including rice, cooking oil, and fish sauce, and divided them into thousands of gift packages, each of which was priced at VND145,000 (US$6.3) on Shopee.

The packages were delivered on Saturday directly to the beneficiaries, including 500 workers who are struggling financially in Binh Tan District, 200 Lao and Cambodian students and those of Vietnam's ethnic minorities at the Pre-University College in District 5.

Among the recipients was Tran Ngoc Sang, a manufacturing worker in Binh Tan District who hails from Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta.

“I feel blessed to receive these essential items, which will help ease the burden on my family during social distancing,” said the sole breadwinner for the family of seven.

Other demographics, including youths in locked-down areas of Hoc Mon District, as well as unofficial workers in Cat Lai Ward of Thu Duc City, also received the care packages of the initiative.

After the first run on Saturday and Sunday, the organizers plan to hand another 2,500 packages to struggling people in cordoned-off areas in Ho Chi Minh City on July 22 and 25.

They are currently accepting donations on Shopee and ShopeePay.

In June and early July, many working-class residents in Ho Chi Minh City suffered from lay-offs or reduced income as the southern metropolis emerged as Vietnam’s coronavirus epicenter, with its caseload rising in the thousands daily.

The alarming situation has prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home, effectively cutting off the livelihoods of many unofficial workers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In his ongoing sketch project, Ho Chi Minh City-based artist Le Sa Long strives to portray the small acts of generosity among residents, a virtue that has once again been highlighted during the tough time of social distancing in the southern city.

An established painter in the domestic art scene who has multiple solo exhibitions and awards under his belt, Long picked up urban sketching as a habit in mid-May.

He wandered the city which he has called home for over 30 years for live sketches for a few weeks, until it began to be put under social distancing measures on May 31 and later a citywide ban on non-essential travels on June 15.

Cooped up at home under this hibernation phase, Long decided to create a new series of sketches inspired by heartwarming photos of Saigonese that he spotted on social media and in newspapers.

He has so far portrayed 40 vignettes on paper and is planning to create more.

“These images of Saigonese residents helping each other out during hard times touched my soul," he said.

"I was inspired to translate these moments and put them under a new light through the language of art.”

A standout in his collection is the vignette of a five-year-old wearing PPE overalls, standing by herself, waving goodbye to the camera before boarding an ambulance to enter quarantine.

Another sketch pays tribute to pop singer Ha Anh Tuan, who donated 25 metric tons of rice to help the struggling citizens.

Other optimistic news stories, including no-cost grocery stores for the needy, community fridges, and charity efforts benefiting pandemic-struck people, are also portrayed.

The sketches have earned Long showers of praises after they were posted on his social media account.

Many individuals have even asked to buy his pieces online, despite not having seen them in person, Long revealed.

He plans to auction several slice-of-life works to raise funds for charity causes for underprivileged people in the city, while portrait pieces of Ha Anh Tuan or frontline doctors will be gifted to the respective subjects as a tribute.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam were beaten 0-2 by China in the 2016 Olympics Asian women's football final qualification round in Japan on Monday.

The Chinese girls dominated the game, scoring both goals in the second half to secure a victory in their opening game at the tournament in Osaka.

China are the world’s number 17, while the Vietnamese women are a dozen notches below, in 29th place.

Vietnam managed to defend as China staged strong attacks, even denying a penalty kick in the 53rd minute, with goalie Kieu Trinh disappointing Li Dongna.

However, Gu Yasha netted the first goal inside the box in the 57th minute, before Rui Zhang nailed the game with a penalty goal five minutes later.

Despite the loss, the Vietnamese women and their coach, Mai Duc Chung, were lauded for their brave and strong spirit.

Running from February 29 to March 9, the Osaka event is the final round of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers for the Rio 2016 women’s football tournament, according to FIFA.

The six-team tournament sees Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea, Australia and Vietnam challenge one another for only two tickets to Brazil.

The Rio 2016 Summer Olympics takes place from August 5 to 21 in Rio de Janeiro, with a 12-team tournament for women’s football.

At the Osaka tourney, Vietnam will face Australia on March 2, North Korea on March 4, Japan on March 7 and South Korea on March 9.

Chung and his players in fact have little hope to book a spot in Rio, as Japan were the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup winners and London 2012 silver medalists, whereas North Korea are the three-time Asian champions.

China and Australia, in the meantime, were both quarterfinalists of the 2015 World Cup in Canada.

The women’s football category at the Olympics has been described as a ‘mini World Cup,’ featuring three nations in the FIFA/Coca-Cola Women’s World Ranking top ten, five in the top 20, and some of the best female footballers on the planet.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnamese swimmer Nguyen Huy Hoang has secured a berth in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo after smashing a Southeast Asian (SEA) Games record and taking home the gold medal in men’s 1,500m freestyle at the ongoing 30th SEA Games in the Philippines on Thursday.

Hoang finished the 1,500m freestyle at the New Clark City Aquatics Center in 14 minutes and 58.14 seconds, shattering the SEA Games’ previous record, which he also set, of 15:20.10.

Aflah Fadlan Prawira of Indonesia and Vietnam’s Nguyen Huu Kim Son brought home the silver and bronze medals in the event, respectively.

Hoang’s lightning-fast 14:58.14 finish not only earned him a gold medal, but also a spot in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

“Breaking my own record is great,” Hoang was quoted as saying by the Inquirer.

“It is the sweet result I earned from working very hard to prepare for the Games."

"It is my contribution to the country by pushing myself.”

Team Vietnam captain Tran Duc Phan told the Inquirer he has high hopes for Hoang’s performance at next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo.

“The coaches told me [Hoang] could win gold and an Olympic berth prior to the Games,” Phan was quoted as saying.

“He is a special athlete. He will receive more support at the next level."

"I believe Hoang can do something in Tokyo.”

The SEA Games are a biennial event governed by the Southeast Asian Games Federation under the supervision of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Olympic Council of Asia.

The first edition was held in 1959 and it has since grown to be one of the region’s largest sporting events, hosting athletes from the 11 countries that make up Southeast Asia.

This year’s SEA Games kicked off in the Philippines on November 30 and will last until December 11 as athletes compete in 530 events across 56 sports.

Vietnam’s delegation to the 2019 SEA Games consists of 568 athletes competing in 43 sports.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BUDAPEST -- Tomas Holes and Patrik Schick scored second-half goals to take the Czech Republic into the Euro 2020 quarter-finals as they took advantage of a red card for the Netherlands to upset their more fancied opponents and win 2-0 in Budapest on Sunday.

Holes powered home a 68th-minute opener after being set up by Tomas Kalas, as the Dutch watched on hopelessly in their own penalty area.

Schick made sure of the Czechs’ surprise success with a close-range finish 10 minutes from fulltime, his fourth goal of the tournament, in front of a capacity crowd that provided a deafening wall of noise for most of an absorbing last-16 contest.

“They were the favourites in this game, it is an unreal feeling to beat such a team 2-0,” said goalscorer Holes.

“They were better with the ball, we struggled, but thanks to our team performance, we did not give them much space.”

It was a calamitous outcome for the Dutch, who imploded after Matthijs de Ligt was sent off for a cynical handball 10 minutes into the second half, and they will now undergo some serious soul searching.

De Ligt was sent off after a VAR review by Russian referee Sergei Karasev after punching away the ball as he tumbled to the ground in a tussle with Schick.

“We lost the game actually because of an action by me. We were in control before that and I feel responsible,” an emotional De Ligt told Dutch television.

Moment of madness

Before that pivotal moment, the Dutch had looked to get on top of their opponents with their overlapping runs and passing ability, but a moment of madness from their 21-year-old centre back swung the balance of the contest towards the Czechs, who needed no second invitation to grab the initiative.

The Czechs are now through to face a quarter-final clash with Denmark in Baku on Saturday, turning around their Euro 2020 fortunes having only reached the knockout phase after finishing third in their group.

The Dutch could have gone ahead before being reduced to 10 men, with fullbacks Denzel Dumfries and Patrick van Aanholt creating several chances with their overlapping runs.

Yet striker Memphis Depay looked out of sorts and Donyell Malen hesitated with several opportunities -- no more so than when sprinting through the Czech defence to go one on one with Tomas Vaclik, before having the ball snatched away from his feet as he tried to round the keeper.

There was an opportunity for the Czechs when stand-in captain Tomas Soucek glanced a difficult header wide in the 22nd minute and Antonin Barak blasted past the target from a tight angle 16 minutes later.

Once De Ligt was dismissed, the Czechs assumed control and the goal came as the Dutch defence was caught static by a set piece that saw Kalas climb above the defence to head back for Holes to score, with veteran Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg caught in no man’s land.

The Dutch then sought to throw on some attacking artillery but quickly wilted in the searing heat as Schick made it 2-0 with Holes pulling the ball back for the striker to finish clinically.

“It was an off day, we didn’t handle the pressure in midfield and couldn’t create our own space,” said Netherlands captain Giorgino Wijnaldum.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SEVILLE, Spain -- Belgium knocked defending champions Portugal out of Euro 2020 with a 1-0 victory in the last 16 on Sunday to set up a mouth-watering quarter-final tie against Italy.

A 43rd-minute strike from Thorgan Hazard secured the win for Roberto Martinez's team, who survived plenty of pressure from the Portuguese in the second half.

But with the finishing touch missing, it was the end of the road for Cristiano Ronaldo and a Portugal team who had triumphed in Paris five years ago.

Ronaldo bows out with five goals from four games, and is currently the tournament's top scorer. Yet it remains to be seen if the 36-year-old will return for a sixth Euros in Germany in 2024 or if the competition's all-time top scorer will bow out of national team duty after the Qatar World Cup next year.

Belgium were among the pre-tournament favourites but this was a stodgy and uninspired display and they will need to raise their game significantly if they are to get past Roberto Mancini's Azzurri who are unbeaten in 31 matches.

Thorgan Hazard's fine goal was their only effort on target in the whole 90 minutes and there was little invention or flair from their midfield.

"In the first half we were playing high and putting pressure on Portugal, but looking at that second half, we are lucky to win," said Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen.

The task against Italy could be even more difficult if Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard, who both came off with knocks in the second half, are unable to recover from their latest injury woes.

Portugal began brightly and Diogo Jota wasted a great chance in the sixth minute, dragging his shot wide after Renato Sanches had broken from midfield and found him in a promising position on the left.

Ronaldo then tested Belgium keeper Thibaut Courtois with a low-struck free kick as Fernando Santos's team continued to apply pressure.

But Belgium grew into the game with De Bruyne increasingly influential and they grabbed the lead three minutes before the interval.

'Grab your chances'

A smart passing move ended with Thomas Meunier feeding Thorgan Hazard, whose wickedly swerving shot flew past the wrong-footed Portugal keeper Rui Patricio.

Patricio stepped to the right in anticipation of a near post shot but was unable to get back across and was beaten by an effort that flew in centrally.

"In these kinds of games you have to grab your chances with both hands and voila, the goalkeeper expected me to choose the other corner, so the ball went in," said the scorer.

Belgium suffered a blow when De Bruyne limped off with an injury three minutes after the break and Santos sought to breathe life into his side's attack by introducing Bruno Fernandes and Joao Felix from the bench.

Ronaldo, cutting in from the right, did well to find Jota in the box but again the forward's effort was off target as Belgium struggled to contain their opponents.

Belgium's attempts to counter were increasingly rare and Portugal turned up the heat in the final 10 minutes as they searched desperately for an equaliser.

Courtois punched away a thundering Ruben Dias header from a corner and then Raphael Guerreiro struck the post with a sweet first-time shot from the edge of the box.

Deep in added time, Portugal created one final opportunity but Felix's drive flashed just wide of Courtois's right-hand post.

"I didn't have a lot of work to do in the previous three games, but I knew that wasn't going to be the case against Portugal," said Courtois.

"I am proud of my team mates; they defended very well. Italy will be difficult too, but we have proved today that we are ready for it," he said.

Eden Hazard, who has struggled with injuries over the past two seasons, went off with what looked like a hamstring strain three minutes from the end.

Belgium will face Italy, who beat Austria 2-1 on Saturday, in Munich on July 2.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Legs stiff from long days in the rice terraces of northern Vietnam, scores of female farmers dressed in colourful cloth headbands and skirts gather on a gravel pitch for a game of football.

The all-female squads of Huc Dong commune, a mountainous village only 40 kilometres from the Chinese border, have little time to practice and may spend months away from the sport when it's time to tend their crops.

But the commitment of the women, who hail from the San Chi ethnic minority group, has earned them respect -- plus a little money and fame -- in football-mad Vietnam.

Since they began playing in 2016, the women have featured regularly in national press and across social media.

But they are far from the only success story in women's football in Vietnam, with the national side multiple South East Asian championship winners.

Trying to catch a pass from her teammate, striker May Thi Kim bumps against her competition as she aims for the goal on the community's gravel hilltop stadium overlooking the paddy and bamboo-covered valley.

Her team from Mo Tuc village is facing off against friends from neighbouring Luc Ngu in a sports event that is part of the traditional Soong Co festival on Saturday.

As the team dribbles the ball closer to the goalposts, spectators -- many of whom are their husbands, children and tourists -- cheer the women on.

"I used to watch football on TV," Kim, 29, told AFP, recalling the beginnings of the team five years ago. "I told the youth union they must let us women play."

Skirts shortened, shirts loosened

Kim and her fellow players in Huc Dong commune -- 14 in all across two teams -- play in black skirts, long-sleeved blue shirts and headbands that have been part of their traditional dress for generations.

"There is no difference playing football in either the traditional clothes or sportswear," Kim told AFP before the match.

That said, their skirts have been shortened, shirts loosened -- and some of the women play with colourful long football socks.

Midfielder La Thi Thao, 15, says she might be more comfortable in regular shorts and T-shirt, but is happy to show off the clothing of her tiny community, which numbers just over 2,000.

It helps "people, including tourists, understand us better", she said.

Some of the players have even passed their passion for football on to their children. Photo: AFP

'It hurt every muscle'

All the players in Huc Dong, including Kim, make a living from hard grind on the terraced paddy fields and in the forests, where they grow cinnamon, star anise and pine trees.

Their step count climbs into the tens of thousands each day as they traverse hills and navigate rocky streams.

But although strong, the women did not have the physical agility at the outset that football demands.

"When we first started, it hurt every muscle," Kim said, admitting they had very little time to train due to the combined pressures of farming and housework.

Coach May A Cang has trained them hard to improve their flexibility, asking the women to run regularly to limber up their muscles.

It was tough work at first, with the women soaking their legs in warm salted water and medicinal leaves for pain relief -- but gradually their bodies adapted to the training.

While Cang has taken on a coaching role, he admits that even he was initially hesitant when his wife, a squad member, wanted to join the team.

"I thought her playing could hurt her legs and then she could not go to the field to work," he said.

"But she told me she would train and would know how to play properly."

The women believe they have proved their doubters wrong -- some have even transferred their passion on to their daughters.

"Even if it hurts, we are ok to take it for our love of football," Kim said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam had another scoreless tie against Thailand in the second round of 2022 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers in Hanoi on Tuesday, remaining atop their group with 11 points.

The regional derby at My Dinh National Stadium was action-packed with both sides targeting a three-point victory.

Thailand dominated from the start but Vietnam showed confidence with sharp counterattacks.

The Thai pressure caused Vietnam’s Doan Van Hau to make a mistake by bringing down Manuel Tom Bihr in the penalty box after a corner kick, resulting in a penalty awarded to the War Elephants in the 27th minute.

Theerathon Bunmathan took the spot kick, but Vietnam’s keeper Dang Van Lam denied him in a ‘magical’ moment with his right leg despite diving the wrong way.

A responding chance came to Vietnam almost immediately when Bui Tien Dung headed Nguyen Quang Hai’s cross from the corner, but the goal was disallowed due to a debatable foul on Thailand goalkeeper Kawin Thamsatchanan.

The Golden Dragons sent the ball into the Thai net for the second time following a left-footed volley by Nguyen Tien Linh in the first third of the second half, only for it to be ruled off-side.

Thailand threatened with several clear opportunities in the remaining time but most were denied by Van Lam, who pulled off good saves.

Eventually, neither side was able to find a way through.

The goalless draw means Vietnam will go into 2020 as Group G’s leaders with 11 points from five matches.

Thailand descended to third place with eight points after Malaysia defeated Indonesia 2-0 on the same day and took the second spot with nine points.

Vietnam will not have to play any game in the second round of 2022 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers until June 2020 while Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the UAE, who lost 0-1 to the Golden Dragons last Thursday, will resume their qualifying campaign in March next year.

As per the Asian Football Confederation’s confirmation in March, the UAE have been selected as the host for Group G, which consists of Southeast Asian challengers Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand.

The VFF further informed the press of Vietnam team’s schedule in the qualifiers on Thursday.

Accordingly, Vietnam will compete against Indonesia at Al Maktoum Stadium on June 7, Malaysia at the same venue on June 11, and the UAE at Zabeel Stadium on June 15.

All of these three matches will take place at 11:45 pm (Vietnam time).

Next Media, a Vietnamese digital content provider, exclusively owns the broadcasting rights of the matches on all platforms.

The Asian qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar are in its second round, played by 40 teams drawn into eight groups of five to play home and away round-robin matches from September 5, 2019.

The remaining games in the qualifiers, which also serve as the road to the 2023 Asian Cup in China, have been pushed back twice due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Currently, Vietnam are leading Group G with 11 points from five matches, followed by Malaysia with nine, Thailand with eight, the UAE — who are one game behind — with six points.

Indonesia are in the bottom of the group with zero points after five matches and stand no chance of advancing to the next qualifying round.

Vietnam aim to maintain the first place and reach the third qualifying round for the first time in the country’s football history.

In preparation for the upcoming three important games, the national team members will gather for a call-up on May 10.

From then to May 18, the squad will undergo training in Quy Nhon City, located in south-central Binh Dinh Province.

A friendly game with Topenland Binh Dinh FC on May 17 is also in the schedule for the team.

They will continue training in Hanoi from May 19 to 26 before leaving for the UAE on May 27.

The VFF is coordinating to set up a friendly match between Vietnam and an undecided team in West Asia before the Golden Dragons officially enter the qualifiers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam claimed a 1-0 victory over Thailand with a dramatic stoppage-time winner in their first match at the U19 Bangkok Cup 2019 in the Thai capital city on Thursday night.

The teams played 90 goalless minutes with few noteworthy situations before substitute Van Tung scored a close kick in the fourth injury minute of the second half.

Tung’s late goal left the hosts in regret for the chances they had missed, including a finish in the 62nd minute that was excellently saved by Vietnamese keeper Lam Hao.

The remaining time was not enough for the Thai players to find an equalizer as the referee blew the final whistle shortly thereafter.

Vietnam will face South Korea, who had thrashed Uzbekistan 5-1 in a preceding match, in the final of the four-team U19 Bangkok Cup 2019 tomorrow, October 12.

The U19 Bangkok Cup 2019 is held on October 10-12 as a warm-up tournament for the 2020 Asian championship qualifiers next month, which will decide the participating teams of the 2020 AFC U19 Championship.

Thursday night apparently treated Vietnamese football fans well as their national football team also snatched a slim win over Malaysia in their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier in Hanoi.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the first of its kind in the country, the Vietnam Baseball Softball Federation (VBSF) was established at its weekend congress, where its first head was elected.

Tran Duc Phan, deputy chief of the General Department of Sports and Physical Training, was voted in as as president of the VBSF at its first congress held in Hanoi on Saturday.

Four deputy presidents were also elected at the event, while Nguyen Thi Thuy, from the Hanoi Youth Baseball Club, was placed in the position of the VBSF’s general secretary.

Coming into being in the U.S., baseball is a team sports that has had a history of more than 80 years of development.

The two sports were introduced to Vietnam many years ago, mainly through foreign companies that invested and operated in the country.

Currently, the two sports, which are rather new to Vietnam, are played in many localities, including Hanoi, Hue, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City.

In Hanoi, the Hanoi Teenager Baseball Club, the oldest club, was established in August 2008.

A year later, the club sent its under-11 team to the Open U11 Tournament of the Little League Baseball Association in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Currently, the club yearly sends its baseball and softball teams to U.S. competitions.

Meanwhile, the Ho Chi Minh City Baseball Association was established in 2011 and the local baseball team regularly practices at Phu Tho Sports Complex with foreign coaches.

In 2011, Vietnam for the first time sent its 20-member national baseball team to attend the 26th Southeast Asian Games in Indonesia.

The same year saw Vietnam’s U12 baseball team defeat their Indonesian and Philippine rivals, becoming the Southeast Asian champion at the Pony Youth Baseball Tournament held in Seoul, South Korea.

After its inception, the VBSF will boost the development of these two rather young sports in Vietnam and act as the lead agency for conducting international training and competition activities.

The federation will also focus on spurring baseball and softball practice among students, and promoting the inclusion of five-person baseball in school curricula as well as at national sports festivals for K-12 students.

It is very likely for Vietnam’s baseball and softball teams to win medals at SEA Games tournaments or Asian competitions, the VBSF admitted.

Baseball and softball are played in many other countries besides Vietnam, such as Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, and Japan.

In April 2013, the 141-member World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) was established as a merger of the International Baseball Federation and the International Softball Federation.

At the upcoming 2021 Tokyo Olympics, baseball and softball are included in the list of the event’s official sports.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ho Chi Minh City TV will organize an annual national cycling tournament next month, with the largest-ever prize money to be given to riders this year.

The HTV Cup tourney will take place from April 6 to 30, organizers said at a press conference on Thursday.

Cyclists will have to cover 2,350km of the competition’s 22 stages from Cao Bang Province in the north to Ho Chi Minh City in the south.

Each lap win will earn a cyclist VND20 million ($865).

The best cycling team will receive VND100 million ($4,324).

The tourney’s prize money totals VND2 billion ($86,480), the largest ever.

Fifteen teams have confirmed their participation in the HTV Cup, including the junior national squad. Each team can register seven riders, according to the tourney’s rules.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The abrupt enforcement of a new movement declaration system at COVID-19 checkpoints in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday baffled the majority of commuters and clogged up traffic flow for hours.

The novel movement declaration requirement, devised by the Ministry of Public Security and considered part of the national population database, was simultaneously introduced at COVID-19 checkpoints in the city around 1:00 pm on Saturday.

This is meant to keep track of people's travels in case contact tracing is needed to stall coronavirus spread.

As witnessed by a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper correspondent, all commuters passing these checkpoints would be pulled over and could only leave when they scanned a QR code on their phones, completed their movement declaration online, captured a new QR code, and presented it to checkpoint officers to see if it matched the database.

The steps were deemed rather complicated and time-consuming by the public due to a variety of reasons, including the reduced sensitivity of mobile phone cameras for QR scanning under broad daylight, or the lack of Internet connection at checkpoints.

Several officers were ill-prepared for their duties, as the batteries on their mobile devices died while they logged commuters’ information.

“Some senior citizens had their smartphones with them, but did not know how to declare the information on the apps and required officers' help,” an checkpoint officer explained.

“Some individuals took as long as 15 minutes to complete their declaration.”

The unoptimized process impeded traffic flow, causing lines of delayed vehicles to snake out as far as a few kilometers.

On Phan Dang Luu and Le Van Duyet Streets in Binh Thanh District, hundreds of motorbikes were seen struggling to inch toward the checkpoints, where officers were still strictly upholding the declaration protocol.

“Residents can scan the QR code and declare their information at home," said Senior Lieutenant Colonel Huynh Thi Thu Trang, a senior official at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Public Security.

"They will receive another QR code, which they can save to their phone and use for the next three days.

“When passing the checkpoints, they only need to bring up the QR image so officers can instantly check their information, reducing processing time and avoiding congestion.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane struck late goals as England reached the Euro 2020 quarter-finals with a 2-0 win over Germany at Wembley on Tuesday, their first knockout victory over their old rivals since the 1966 World Cup final.

England will play either Sweden or Ukraine, who meet later on Tuesday in Glasgow, in the last eight after a victory which sent the home crowd of over 40,000 into wild celebration.

It was England's first ever knockout round win at the Euros inside 90 minutes and after a build-up dominated by talk of historic and bitter tournament losses to Germany, their focus will now be on making some history of their own.

The visitors' defeat marked the end of Joachim Loew's time as Germany coach after 15 years in charge, during which he guided them to the 2014 World Cup title in Brazil.

Debate will continue about England manager Gareth Southgate's selections but it was telling that both goals came after midfielder Jack Grealish was introduced from the bench in the 69th minute when the entire tempo and mood of the game changed.

Six minutes after Grealish came on he was involved in a flowing passing move which ended with left wing back Luke Shaw deftly slipping the ball across the face of the goal for Sterling to slide in his third goal in four Euro 2020 games.

Yet shortly after scoring Sterling almost gifted the Germans a leveller when he gave the ball away on the halfway line and Kai Havertz sent Thomas Mueller through on goal.

The experienced World Cup winner had only England keeper Jordan Pickford to beat but dragged his shot wide of his right-hand post, leaving Sterling, who watched in anguish on his knees, to leap to his feet in relief.

After that reprieve, and with the crowd roaring England on, Grealish was the direct provider for the second goal, crossing from the left for captain Kane to beat keeper Manuel Neuer with a stooping header.

It was Kane's first goal of the tournament and his return to scoring ways will be another positive for Southgate as he looks ahead at a potential route to the final.

Cautious lineup

Southgate's decision to play a five-man defence and two holding midfielders was a cautious one, but England did start the game brightly.

Sterling tested Neuer in the 16th minute, cutting in from the left flank and finding room to unleash a drive towards the far corner which the Germany keeper did well to get across to.

Much of England's probing was coming from Kieran Trippier down the right and he found Harry Maguire in a promising position with a lofted ball to the back post but the centre half's header was over the bar.

Germany were enjoying plenty of possession in midfield with England sitting deep but they provided a warning of their threat when Havertz slipped through Timo Werner, although Pickford was out quickly to smother.

Just before the break Mats Hummels had to intervene quickly to clear as Kane looked to pounce after Sterling's burst into the box had caused chaos.

After the interval Germany sensed England had lost their way and went close when Havertz's powerful drive was superbly tipped over by Pickford.

The game was in the balance but then came Grealish, whose name had been sung by the England fans throughout the game and who lived up to those hopes and expectations by providing the spark England had been missing.

England will head into their quarter-final in Rome on Saturday knowing victory will set-up a semi and potentially a final on home turf back at Wembley.

"Any team will be looking at us and know that we're dangerous. We want to go all the way so need to keep it up," said Kane.

"There isn't anything bigger than this when the expectation is on and we delivered so we should be proud but we can't stop here. We have a vision of where we want to go and we can't stop now. Hopefully we'll be back here in the semi-finals and the final."

Southgate, though, is as restrained with his words as he is with tactics and said he had been quick to calm his players down.

"We played extremely well, we deserved the win, but I've had to say to them straight away, I'm the party pooper; if we don't capitalise on that on Saturday, it doesn't count for anything."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The organizers of the Vietnam Professional Basketball League (VBA) announced on Thursday that the 2021 Tip-Off Cup and all of its related activities would be canceled regarding the complicated development of COVID-19 in the country.

The cancelation had been approved by the Vietnam Basketball Federation (VBF).

The 2021 VBA Tip-Off Cup was originally scheduled to take place from May 16 to 23 as a kick-start to the official tournament of the VBA that would follow thereafter and last until September.

“This is a very difficult decision because it is the first time the VBF and Vietnam Basketball JSC have introduced the VBA Tip-Off Cup to the fans,” the organizers said in their announcement on Thursday.

“But we chose to cancel the tournament anyway, as we always put public health and the safety of the players and the coaching staff on top.

“The VBA hopes to bring back the tournament as soon as possible when the situation returns to normal.”

Initiated in 2016, the VBA is contested by eight teams this year -- the Saigon Heat, Cantho Catfish, Danang Dragons, Hanoi Buffalo, Hochiminh City Wings, Thanglong Warriors, Nhatrang Dolphins and Hoop Dreams.

Despite the Tip-Off Cup’s cancelation, the VBA will kick-off its sixth season from June 4 as scheduled.

Vietnam has been grappling with the re-emergence of COVID-19 since April 27 after the country had gone about a month without detecting any community transmission.

It has seen 121 community infections since then in Hanoi, Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and a dozen other provinces.

The country added one local coronavirus case on Friday morning, bringing its caseload to 3,091 patients, according to the Ministry of Health.

Recoveries remain at 2,560 and deaths at 35.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ho Chi Minh City Television (HTV) has acquired the screening rights for the 2021 Copa America in Vietnam from digital firm Next Media.

The Copa America redistribution package allows HTV to air 28 games in the tournament on its HTV7, HTV9, HTV The Thao, and HTV1 channels and the HTVC mobile app.

Copa America, the championship of South American nations, is the oldest football competition of national teams in the world and considered one of the top three international tournaments, next to the Euro and World Cup.

This year’s tourney was initially scheduled to be held in Argentina and Colombia.

However, due to the new outbreaks of COVID-19 in these two countries, the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) eventually changed the location to Brazil.

With the participation of ten CONMEBOL teams, who are divided into two groups, the event commenced on Monday morning (Vietnam time) and will run until July 11.

Group A includes Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, and Paraguay while Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela compete in Group B.

Brazil routed Venezuela 3-0 in Monday morning’s one-sided opener.

The top four of each group will advance to the quarterfinals.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AMSTERDAM, March 24 -- Johan Cruyff, one of soccer's greatest players and most influential and visionary coaches, died aged 68 on Thursday after a five-month battle with lung cancer.

His death was announced on his website and soon after by the De Telegraaf newspaper, for whom he wrote a weekly column that was often controversial but always eagerly anticipated.

An ex-smoker who had heart surgery in 1991, Cruyff joined Ajax Amsterdam as a long-haired teenager before emerging as one of the world's greats in the early 1970s.

He helped Ajax Amsterdam win three European Cups in a row from 1971-73 and also named European Footballer of the Year in 1971, 1973 and 1974.

Born Hendrik Johannes Cruyff, he joined Barcelona for a then world record transfer fee of $2.0 million, and it was Barcelona that would later define his coaching career, helping the Catalan club to win their first La Liga title in nearly 15 years in 1974.

He was also a key player in the great Netherlands team that reached the 1974 World Cup final when, for the first time, during the tournament a global audience saw him perform the now-famous "Cruyff turn" the movement in which the player with the ball plays it behind their own leg before swerving away in the direction of the ball.

The Dutch also got to the World Cup final but lost again in 1978, this time without Cruyff who had quit the national side, saying years later he walked away after an armed kidnap attempt.

Following stints at Los Angeles Aztecs and Washington Diplomats in the old NASL, then Levante in Spain, Cruyff returned to Ajax before ending his playing career at their bitter rivals Feyenoord in 1984.

In 1999, he was voted European Player of the Century while he is often bracketed alongside Brazil's Pele and Argentina's Diego Maradona as the three best players ever to grace the sport.

The Barca 'Dream Team' Cruyff coached won four straight La Liga titles between 1991 and 1994 and beat Sampdoria 1-0 for the club's maiden European Cup triumph in 1992.

The possession-based playing style Cruyff promoted, with an emphasis on relentless attack, has been widely copied and is credited with underpinning Barca's subsequent successes, as well as those of the Spanish national team.

Former England captain Gary Lineker, who played under Cruyff at Barcelona, summed up the Dutchman's contribution by saying on Twitter: "Football has lost a man who did more to make the beautiful game beautiful than anyone in history."

Cruyff had announced last October that he was suffering from lung cancer but continued to write his newspaper column and earlier this month travelled to Israel to visit his son Jordi, who is technical director at Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Only last month he said he was "2-0 up in the first half" of his battle against lung cancer. Poignantly that turned out to be one of the last public statements made by the man whose footballing pronouncements were eagerly sought after by soccer fans around the globe.

He died surrounded by friends and family at home in Barcelona, his website added.

His death prompted Dutch radio and television stations to suspend regular programming, with Ronald de Boer, another Dutch international who played at Barcelona, declaring: "He was the best footballer we ever had."

Former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said: "RIP @JohanCruyff, a genius, a legend and the man who changed the mentality of the @FCBarcelona."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Saigon FC have become the first football team in the world to again accession to an association of Japanese companies abroad.

The V-League 1 club officially joined the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Ho Chi Minh City (JCCH) on Wednesday, according to the chamber.

They want football to be a link between Vietnamese and Japanese firms, explained Tran Hoa Binh, chairman of the club.

“The presence of the brand name Saigon FC in Japan will tremendously benefit our Vietnamese sponsors,” Binh said.

“I expect football to become a bridge between Vietnamese and Japanese companies.”

The JCCH said that Saigon FC are the first foreign football team in the world to join an overseas network of Japanese companies.

The club have followed in the footsteps of the Japan Professional Football League when it comes to their long-term development.

Saigon FC sent their midfielder Cao Van Trien and V-League 1 side Viettel FC's forward Tran Danh Trung to J2 League club FC Ryukyu in February.

The Vietnamese club have said they will announce another partnership with a J3 League side in the coming time.

FC Tokyo, who play in the J1 League, are helping Saigon FC with overall club management while providing consulting in establishing a football academy.

Saigon FC currently rank fourth in the 14-team V-League 1 table, earning six points from three games.

The 2021 V-League 1 season is poised to resume on Saturday after a two-month hiatus over the COVID-19 pandemic.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam’s national women’s football team have ended 2019 in the 32nd place in the world as they climbed two notches in the latest FIFA Women's World Ranking, after winning their sixth gold medal in Southeast Asian Games 2019 women’s football in the Philippines last week.

FIFA revealed its final women’s world ranking of 2019 on Friday, considering a number of international and regional tournaments at which the Vietnamese women had delivered their good performances.

The Golden Girls defeated Thailand 1-0 to defend their gold medal in women’s football at Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila, the Philippines, on December 8.

In the 2019 ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Women's Championship in August, the team clinched their third AFF title after beating hosts Thailand 1-0 in the finale.

In April this year, they also qualified for the final round of the FIFA Olympic Qualifying 2020 after thrashing Jordan 2-0 at Transportation Institute Stadium in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.

The streak of achievements in 2019 saw Vietnam’s national women’s football team promoted from the 34th position in the FIFA Women's World Ranking announced in September to the 32nd place in the new ranking.

It also maintained the team as the sixth best-ranked side in Asia behind Australia (7th), Japan (10th), North Korea (11th), China (15th) and South Korea (20th).

However, this is not Vietnam’s highest position in the FIFA Women's World Ranking as the country once ranked 28th in the world in June 2013.

Meanwhile, Thailand's national women’s football team, who appear to be Vietnam’s archrivals, improved one place to the 38th in the world and stayed seventh in the continent.

The FIFA Women's World Ranking is published four times a year, normally, in March, June, September and December.

In the newly-released ranking, the U.S. women’s national team continue to be the No. 1 side in the world, ahead of second-placed Germany and the Netherlands at third.
