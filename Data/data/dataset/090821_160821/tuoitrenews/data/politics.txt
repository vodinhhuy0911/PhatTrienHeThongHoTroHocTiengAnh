The Czech Republic is willing to transfer 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses and a number of rapid test kits to Vietnam, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh during their online talks on Monday.

PM Babis thanked the valuable support of the Vietnamese government and Vietnamese community in the Czech Republic for Czech people during the early stages of the pandemic.

Although the pandemic situation in the Czech Republic remains complicated, the local government will further support and cooperate with Vietnam in the fight against COVID-19.

The European country is willing to transfer 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses and a number of rapid test kits to Vietnam, PM Babis stated.

He added that the Czech Republic will also call on other European countries to provide Vietnam with COVID-19 vaccines such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, and Sinopharm, which are being widely used in the region.

PM Chinh thanked the Czech government for its assistance, as well as for the decision to donate 250,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Vietnam, which was announced on July 26.

The Vietnamese leader affirmed that the timely and valuable support demonstrates the good traditional friendship between the two countries over the past 70 years.

During the conversations, both sides also discussed measures to bolster the traditional friendship and step up cooperation in the auto industry, transportation, education-training, and national defense-security.

Regarding trade and investment ties, Chinh suggested that the two nations closely coordinate to maximize the potential of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA).

He took the occasion to invite Babis to visit Vietnam as early as possible, while the Czech PM said he wishes to visit the country this year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam has demanded that China stop carrying out a military exercise in the former's Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelago as the action violates the Southeast Asian country’s sovereignty.

Vietnam has sufficient historical evidence and legal grounds to prove its sovereignty over the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagoes in accordance with international law, Le Thi Thu Hang, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated during a regular press conference on Thursday afternoon.

“China’s military drill in Hoang Sa has violated Vietnam’s sovereignty over the islands and gone against the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the [East Vietnam Sea] (DOC),” Hang said.

The action complicated the situation, hampered current negotiations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on a Code of Conduct for the East Vietnam Sea (COC), as well as affected the maintenance of peace, stability, and cooperation in the maritime area.

Vietnam required China to respect its sovereignty over Hoang Sa, stop and not repeat similar violations that further complicate the situation in the waterway.

China on Wednesday announced that its military drill would take place from Friday to Tuesday in an over-100,000-square-kilometer area in the northern section of the East Vietnam Sea.

The area includes large parts of the Hoang Sa islands, which belong to Vietnam.

Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday claimed during the ASEAN-China session, part of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting and related meetings, that the situation in the East Vietnam Sea has been stable thanks to the joint efforts of China and ASEAN.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kamala Harris will become the first United States vice-president to visit Vietnam to boost ties during a trip that will also include Singapore next month, the White House announced Friday.

During the trip, the vice-president will discuss with the leaders of Vietnam and Singapore regional security, the global response to COVID-19, climate change, and joint efforts to promote a rules-based international order, the White House said.

The trip to the two Southeast Asian countries is aimed to strengthen relationships and expand economic cooperation with two critical Indo-Pacific partners of the U.S., Harris’s spokeswoman Symone Sanders said in a statement.

The visits will also enhance the strong cultural and people-to-people relations between the U.S and these countries, the statement said, without providing details on the dates of the trip.

“Vice-President Harris will be the first vice-president to ever visit Vietnam,” said Sanders.

“President Biden and Vice President Harris have made it a top priority to rebuild our global partnerships and keep our nation secure, and this upcoming visit continues that work,” the White House said.

The specific dates for Harris’s trip are still being worked on, Reuters said, citing diplomats.

The travel to Vietnam and Singapore by Harris demonstrates the U.S.’s long-term commitment to a prosperous and secure Southeast Asia, the Straits Times quoted Dr. Patrick Cronin, chair for Asia-Pacific security at the Hudson Institute in Washington, as saying.

Harris’s visit would be significant to highlight Washington’s commitment to Southeast Asia, Reuters cited analysts as saying.

Some analysts also think that it could result in more pledges of U.S. vaccines to this region, which has recently suffered from COVID-19.

The upcoming trip of Harris is the second international trip in office after she visited Guatemala and Mexico in June in an effort to lower numbers of migrants from this area to the U.S.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam always is paying close attention to the situation in Cuba and believes that Cuba will overcome the challenges caused by COVID-19 and a U.S.-imposed trade embargo, Le Thi Thu Hang, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Friday.

A number of protests broke out in Cuba on July 11, but the situation has returned to stability, Hang noted.

Vietnam believes that Cuba will overcome its current socio-economic problems including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences of the financial and trade blockades and embargo enforced by the U.S., the diplomat continued.

Cuba will successfully implement policies to update its socio-economic model, and continue to promote the country's great achievements in education, healthcare, and science and technology.

Vietnam always treasures the spirit of solidarity and the valuable support that Cuba has given to the country in the past years, Hang stressed, adding that the Southeast Asian nation will try its best to help Cuban people.

The spokesperson called on the U.S. to end its "hostile policy and unilateral economic and financial embargo against Cuba."

The embargo, which was first implemented 60 years ago, has been getting even more stringent in recent times, aggravating the socio-economic challenges in Cuba.

"The U.S. needs to take concrete steps in the direction of normalizing relations with Cuba, for the benefits of the two peoples, and for making contributions to peace, stability, and development in the region and the world," she said.

The situation in Cuba has captured international attention after protests erupted in Havana and other locations.

The reasons behind these demonstrations are believed to be the shortage of food and medicine alongside rising inflation.

The Prensa Latina news agency last week quoted President Diaz-Canel as saying that the main cause of the problems lies in the U.S. blockade imposed on Cuba’s economy, trade, and finance.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police forces in the northern Vietnamese province of Son La have conducted a drill for anti-terrorism, hostage rescue, and other operations that could happen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The drill, with the coordination of the provincial Military Command, took place on Monday, based on scenarios of combating terrorists, rescuing hostages, mine clearance, firefighting, and salvage.

The scenarios were designed to include incidents conducted by terrorists and saboteurs attempting to take advantage of the pandemic spread in many areas of Vietnam.

One of the assumed incidents was that reactionary individuals and organizations at home and abroad, supported by hostile forces, might carry out sabotage and terrorism activities.

Another fictional scenario was hi-tech criminals conducting attacks on a bank’s database systems to take control of its clients’ accounts and appropriate money from them.

Other scenarios include hostage situations, explosives, and arson that require effective response from local police.

In the 45-minute drill, local police forces, including a mobile police battalion, fought and seized terrorists and saboteurs, rescued hostages, stamped down fires, evacuated people from dangerous areas, searched for and removed explosives, and restored order and security.

They also completed necessary steps that serve the handling of terrorist acts and other crimes in accordance with the law.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The USCGC John Midgett, a U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat, is on its way to Vietnam where it will be transferred to the Vietnamese Coast Guard, the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam said on Wednesday.

Operated by a Vietnamese crew, the patrol boat left Seattle, the United States for Vietnam on Tuesday.

This is the second ship delivered to Vietnam’s Coast Guard under the U.S. Excess Defense Articles program, an initiative which provides excess military equipment to U.S. partners and allies to support their modernization efforts.

This Hamilton-class ship was re-painted to feature the Vietnamese words 'Vietnam Coast Guard,' before delivery to the Southeast Asian country.

The USCGC John Midgett was renamed CSB 8021 and will be added to the Vietnam Coast Guard Region 3 patrol fleet this summer.

Two Vietnamese crews were sent to the U.S. for training on the ship in November 2020 and February this year.

The USCGC John Midgett, the last in a series of 12 large Hamilton-class patrol boats formerly employed by the U.S. Coast Guard, was built in 1971 and retired in 2020.

The patrol boat is 115 meters long and 13 meters wide. It has a displacement of 3,050 metric tons and is equipped with four engines.

The vessel has a maximum speed of 54 kilometers per hour and is capable of operating at sea for 45 consecutive days.

It has a range of 20,000 kilometers.

As a large-sized patrol boat, the USCGC John Midgett will be an important supplement to the Vietnam Coast Guard fleet, which is currently limited to include boats with displacements ranging from less than 1,000 to around 2,500 metric tons.

The delivery of retired ships and other military equipment to Vietnam is a prime component of the regional security partnership between the U.S. and Vietnam, the U.S. Embassy commented.

The first U.S. Coast Guard vessel delivered to Vietnam, the USCGC Morgenthau, docked in the Southeast Asian country in May 2017.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The ITU Virtual Digital World 2020, an event co-organized by Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), kicked off on Tuesday evening.

Themed ‘Building A Digital World. Together,’ the three-day online event brings together more than 50 ITU member countries.

The technological foundation used during the event was developed by Vietnam's military-run Viettel telecom group.

In his opening remarks, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said the Vietnamese government has paid attention to telecommunication infrastructure development and considered IT one of the top priorities.

Digital transformation has been regarded as a crucial solution for helping the country develop more rapidly and sustainably, Dam added.

The deputy PM reiterated the Vietnamese government’s commitments to supporting and coordinating with the ITU and its member countries in building a digital world for peace, cooperation, and prosperity.

Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said Vietnam’s digital infrastructure is now ready for a digital-based economy and society.

Vietnamese technologies not only deal with domestic but also global issues, the minister said, adding that the country is striving to make technology a driver of development and global cooperation.

ITU Secretary General Houlin Zhao said Vietnam is an important partner in many markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean region, which has made the nation become a bright example in IT development to many other developing countries.

ITU is a United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies.

The first ITU telecom event was held in 1971. Since its 40th anniversary in 2011, the event has been held on an annual basis in a different location worldwide.

The 2020 edition is named ITU Digital World and takes place online from October 20 to 22.

The ITU Digital World 2021 will be back in its usual form in Hanoi in October next year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A golf tournament aimed at supporting Vietnamese start-ups first organized by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper last year is set to return for the second edition this September.

‘Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020’ is meant to support start-ups in the beginning period of their business by helping to connect young entrepreneurs with seasoned and successful business people.

During the tourney, which will be launched on September 18, the organizers will also present awards to the most excellent entrepreneurs of the start-up community.

Excited to participate

Many entrepreneurs, who are experienced golfers, are excited to take part in this year's competition. In their opinion, the tournament will give them a chance to both play golf and help the upcoming generation of business people.

“I appreciate Tuoi Tre for holding such a golf competition to promote start-ups and help experienced entrepreneurs have another approach to supporting them,” said Le Hai Binh, founder and chairman of the IT services company Mat Bao Group, who is also a golfer taking part in the tournament.

“The competition will provide young entrepreneurs with opportunities to meet with their potential investors among the golfers who participate in the tournament."

The competitors interviewed by Tuoi Tre applauded the paper's idea to create ‘a playground’ for start-up owners.

Meeting with other entrepreneurs on the golf course is certain to bring a different vibe than traditional environments like offices or working space, and may help generate stronger bonds between the participants, they said.

Overcoming COVID-19

Start-ups have been hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020 was also rescheduled to begin in September instead of April, when it was held last year, because of the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of the global health crisis, many entrepreneurs consider the tournament an occasion for them to support young entrepreneurs in getting over the adversities of the pandemic, especially since it is currently under control in Vietnam.

“The current situation is different from last year’s. The pandemic has presented start-ups with difficulty in accessing funds as almost all companies are impacted by the coronavirus,” Binh remarked.

“Of course [potential investors] must fight for the survival of their own companies first before considering investing in others."

According to Binh, in 'the new normal,' customers are likely to spend less so start-ups in the fields of services, travel, and food would be considerably impacted.

“Despite that, I am not quite pessimistic because there are always opportunities in challenging situations,” Binh said.

The chairman of Mat Bao Group believes that during the pandemic, entrepreneurs who can flexibly adapt to the new situation will emerge victorious and even achieve new breakthroughs.

“Tuoi Tre’s golf tournament for start-ups will offer them the opportunity to do so,” Binh said.

Lawyer Nguyen Thi Thanh Nha, legal director of the investment firm Openasia Group, said her experience as a shareholder in a few start-ups when she was younger helps her understand the advantages that start-ups have, such as youth, ambition, and knowledge.

But she also acknowledges the rigors they must face on the way to success such as networking, calling for suitable investors, and developing relationships with other start-ups.

“Participating in the [golf tournament] will help them partly solve these problems and build more new business relationships,” said Nha, who has played golf for 12 years.

“Business opportunities may come to them unexpectedly during this tournament, who knows?”

Honoring 25 excellent start-ups

With the aim of promoting and empowering the start-up community both in Ho Chi Minh City and the rest of Vietnam, Tuoi Tre and partners jointly present the Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020.

The tourney will also mark the 75th anniversary of Vietnam’s National Day (September 2), the 89th founding anniversary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union (March 26), and the 45th anniversary of the founding of Tuoi Tre (September 2).

Dozens of inspiring start-up stories have been published in Tuoi Tre in various formats since July in the lead-up to the tournament.

The opening gala is scheduled to take place on September 18 at the Long Thanh Golf Club in Dong Nai Province, 35 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For students from poor families, education is the best way to help themselves and their families get out of their plight and lift their communities out of poverty. Ironically, after all the effort of studying in difficulty throughout 12 years from elementary to high school, these students even with high academic records to enter college are unable to live their dreams because of their family’s financial situations. They simply cannot afford tuition fees and other expenses of higher education.

The “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” scholarship program of Tuoi Tre Newspaper has made great strides in helping these poor students. This program gave the first scholarship in Quang Tri Province in 2003. It has gradually spread to other provinces and now it covers the whole country.

Over 17 years, this scholarship program has helped more than 19,000 new college students who otherwise would not be able to afford higher education. Last year, there were more than 1,200 new college students from all over the country receiving scholarships.

Each poor student is given a standard scholarship of VND10 million (US$430). Very poor students are granted special scholarships worth VND15 million (US$645) each.

This year due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be more poor new college students in need of help, although the donation could be less than last year.

We would like to appeal for new and current donors to “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” so that at least 1,000 poor students around the country, among them 80 from Thua Thien-Hue Province, could receive scholarships this academic year.

Please send your donation to Bao Tuoi Tre, bank account: 113000006100 (for VND) at VietinBank, Branch 3, HCM City; or bank account: 0071370195845 (for USD) or 0071140373054 (for EUR) at Vietcombank, HCM City Branch, Swift Code: BFTVVNVX007; for “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” Scholarship Program.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A charity initiative administered 700 care packages on the weekend to workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Binh Tan District, as well as Lao and Cambodian students in the Pre-University College of Ho Chi Minh City.

The initiative was undertaken by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, supermarket chain Saigon Co.op, and e-commerce platform Shopee, with support from the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.

The organizers prepared essentials, including rice, cooking oil, and fish sauce, and divided them into thousands of gift packages, each of which was priced at VND145,000 (US$6.3) on Shopee.

The packages were delivered on Saturday directly to the beneficiaries, including 500 workers who are struggling financially in Binh Tan District, 200 Lao and Cambodian students and those of Vietnam's ethnic minorities at the Pre-University College in District 5.

Among the recipients was Tran Ngoc Sang, a manufacturing worker in Binh Tan District who hails from Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta.

“I feel blessed to receive these essential items, which will help ease the burden on my family during social distancing,” said the sole breadwinner for the family of seven.

Other demographics, including youths in locked-down areas of Hoc Mon District, as well as unofficial workers in Cat Lai Ward of Thu Duc City, also received the care packages of the initiative.

After the first run on Saturday and Sunday, the organizers plan to hand another 2,500 packages to struggling people in cordoned-off areas in Ho Chi Minh City on July 22 and 25.

They are currently accepting donations on Shopee and ShopeePay.

In June and early July, many working-class residents in Ho Chi Minh City suffered from lay-offs or reduced income as the southern metropolis emerged as Vietnam’s coronavirus epicenter, with its caseload rising in the thousands daily.

The alarming situation has prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home, effectively cutting off the livelihoods of many unofficial workers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In his ongoing sketch project, Ho Chi Minh City-based artist Le Sa Long strives to portray the small acts of generosity among residents, a virtue that has once again been highlighted during the tough time of social distancing in the southern city.

An established painter in the domestic art scene who has multiple solo exhibitions and awards under his belt, Long picked up urban sketching as a habit in mid-May.

He wandered the city which he has called home for over 30 years for live sketches for a few weeks, until it began to be put under social distancing measures on May 31 and later a citywide ban on non-essential travels on June 15.

Cooped up at home under this hibernation phase, Long decided to create a new series of sketches inspired by heartwarming photos of Saigonese that he spotted on social media and in newspapers.

He has so far portrayed 40 vignettes on paper and is planning to create more.

“These images of Saigonese residents helping each other out during hard times touched my soul," he said.

"I was inspired to translate these moments and put them under a new light through the language of art.”

A standout in his collection is the vignette of a five-year-old wearing PPE overalls, standing by herself, waving goodbye to the camera before boarding an ambulance to enter quarantine.

Another sketch pays tribute to pop singer Ha Anh Tuan, who donated 25 metric tons of rice to help the struggling citizens.

Other optimistic news stories, including no-cost grocery stores for the needy, community fridges, and charity efforts benefiting pandemic-struck people, are also portrayed.

The sketches have earned Long showers of praises after they were posted on his social media account.

Many individuals have even asked to buy his pieces online, despite not having seen them in person, Long revealed.

He plans to auction several slice-of-life works to raise funds for charity causes for underprivileged people in the city, while portrait pieces of Ha Anh Tuan or frontline doctors will be gifted to the respective subjects as a tribute.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The abrupt enforcement of a new movement declaration system at COVID-19 checkpoints in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday baffled the majority of commuters and clogged up traffic flow for hours.

The novel movement declaration requirement, devised by the Ministry of Public Security and considered part of the national population database, was simultaneously introduced at COVID-19 checkpoints in the city around 1:00 pm on Saturday.

This is meant to keep track of people's travels in case contact tracing is needed to stall coronavirus spread.

As witnessed by a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper correspondent, all commuters passing these checkpoints would be pulled over and could only leave when they scanned a QR code on their phones, completed their movement declaration online, captured a new QR code, and presented it to checkpoint officers to see if it matched the database.

The steps were deemed rather complicated and time-consuming by the public due to a variety of reasons, including the reduced sensitivity of mobile phone cameras for QR scanning under broad daylight, or the lack of Internet connection at checkpoints.

Several officers were ill-prepared for their duties, as the batteries on their mobile devices died while they logged commuters’ information.

“Some senior citizens had their smartphones with them, but did not know how to declare the information on the apps and required officers' help,” an checkpoint officer explained.

“Some individuals took as long as 15 minutes to complete their declaration.”

The unoptimized process impeded traffic flow, causing lines of delayed vehicles to snake out as far as a few kilometers.

On Phan Dang Luu and Le Van Duyet Streets in Binh Thanh District, hundreds of motorbikes were seen struggling to inch toward the checkpoints, where officers were still strictly upholding the declaration protocol.

“Residents can scan the QR code and declare their information at home," said Senior Lieutenant Colonel Huynh Thi Thu Trang, a senior official at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Public Security.

"They will receive another QR code, which they can save to their phone and use for the next three days.

“When passing the checkpoints, they only need to bring up the QR image so officers can instantly check their information, reducing processing time and avoiding congestion.”
