A young Vietnamese woman and a Frenchman have teamed up for a meaningful project, 'Viet Nam Oi Co Len!' (Be Strong, Vietnam!), to give away more than 3,000 free meals each day for the last four weeks.

Tran Ngoc Anh, the young woman, told Tuoi Tre News she canceled her scheduled trip to Canada at the last minute to remain in Ho Chi Minh City.

“As a resident of Saigon, I chose to stay here instead of returning to Canada,” Anh said, referring to the old name of Ho Chi Minh City.

“Vietnam is currently struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, and I want to contribute my modest part to the war against the coronavirus.

"I hope along with others, I can help make Vietnam beautiful again and Saigon as dynamic as before."

“What can I do to help my compatriots immediately?” Anh asked herself and then discussed it with her close friend, Jerome Ly -- co-founder of Savyu Company.

They thought carefully and decided to support the unprivileged communities and frontline medical workers with free meals as a practical way of help.

“I still remember that day," recalled Anh.

"When the city was put under Directive No. 16 on July 9, I wanted to spend some days watching the situation first before doing something, but Ly pushed me to act right away.

"He said that if we did not do anything quickly, there would be more people running into trouble.

"So we managed to help people seek a way out, especially the most unprivileged."

On the following day, the two launched a kitchen preparing 1,000 meals, which surprised even Anh.

“We started with a small and humble step, without any pretension, we just wanted to help as much as possible," Ly said.

"However, it soon got bigger and drew the attention of many people, the media, and trade associations.

"Many reached out to us to either give support or ask for support.

"We got swarmed but we are still trying to do our best every day."

Although he had managed various large organizations in the past, this is the first time he has helped extremely needy communities.

“I’m learning every day and I hope to serve more and more people and bring them a small moment of happiness in their daily life,” Ly told Tuoi Tre News.

Despite his humble story, as an experienced entrepreneur with over 15 years of international management experience covering Europe, Asia, and Brazil, Ly has really become a perfect partner for Anh on the project.

From the beginning, both defined and organized the daily operations of 'Viet Nam Oi Co Len!'

He has worked hand in hand with Anh in logistics, supply chains, human resources, communication, and technology to support the project so that it could grow and benefit more people.

They called the mission 'Viet Nam Oi Co Len!' (Be Strong, Vietnam!) with the intention of supplying meals free of charge to as many needy and frontline medical workers as they can.

In the 28 days since the project launched, 'Viet Nam Oi Co Len!' has given out more than 70,000 meals including 33,800 vegan portions and 37,500 meat ones.

'We are all behind Vietnam now'

On the first day of offering free meals to people, Ly and Anh drove around to learn what people needed. They saw a poor mother and her son pushing a cart on the street.

Anh was moved to tears looking at the boy’s empty eyes, whose despair and hopelessness could be felt.

“We can stay home if we are not allowed to go out, we can cook by ourselves," she said.

"But if we can’t buy something to eat, what can the poor -- like the boy and his mother -- do now if they don’t know where to return."

The unforgettable memory became a source of energy that made Anh and Ly continue to try their best each day to bring meals to many more people.

“I don’t know how many free meals we would be able to provide, but each day, we do our utmost to find more financial support to continue our mission,” said Anh.

Ly wants to help people and bring them some moments of joy through a healthy meal.

“Doctors fight so hard to protect us all, they haven’t been back to their home and family for months and my thoughts go to them, we are just arranging healthy food to support them," he said.

“Same goes for needy communities on the streets that were hit hard, we are here for you all, as much as we can do."

The Frenchman acknowledged that their mission can only be made possible thanks to all the amazing support from the communities and to the dedication of various organizations, including the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Vietnam (CCIFV) and the Vietnam - Hong Kong Business Association.

From the beginning, the entire French community and other large international communities were incredibly supportive of their mission, he added.

“I think they are all behind Vietnam at this moment,” Ly said.

“We all love Vietnam and want to help as much as we can.

"Many expats, French, and other nationalities contacted us to offer their support either as volunteers or meals. This is very meaningful and heartwarming."

His kindness toward Vietnamese people during the pandemic inspires Anh very much.

“As a foreigner, he tries his best to help the Vietnamese, which makes me feel heartwarming and want to try to do more despite being fatigued sometimes,” shared the young woman.

'All boys his age should be playing with their friends' I remember our first day of delivering meals, I saw a little boy with his mom pushing a cart (their home) in the middle of the street without really knowing where they were going. When we stopped, the little boy stood still for seconds with completely emotionless eyes. This gave me a strong feeling and encouraged me to do more. All boys his age should be playing with their friends, not wandering in despair in the middle of an empty street under Saigon's scorching sun! Jerome Ly, co-founder of Savyu company

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It was a sunny day in early April when Chu Dinh Hoa, 71, visited Truong Son National Martyrs' Cemetery in Quang Tri Province, central Vietnam, where he played violin to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers.

“I want to say thanks to those who sacrificed for our homeland,” Hoa explained why he played the song 'Homeland.'

Quang Tri Province was part of Hoa’s trip through Vietnam’s southern region nearly 50 years after the country’s reunification.

After seven years serving in the military, Hoa was demobilized in 1978.

He moved to the southern province of Binh Phuoc where he ran a farm for over 20 years before returning to his hometown in north-central Nghe An Province.

In his seventies, Hoa had always dreamed of visiting Truong Son Cemetery, National Road 9 Martyrs' Cemetery in Quang Tri, and other places where he carried memories of the war.

In April this year, that dream suddenly came true thanks to Hoang Tien Dat, a young neighbor from Nghe An.

Two men, one car, 4,000km

Tien Dat, 22, was a neighbor of Hoa in Nghi Loc District’s Khanh Hop Commune.

Despite their age gap, the two had been friends for years before Dat found out Hoa was one of his late grandfather’s close friends.

Knowing Hoa and his grandfather used to talk about visiting the southern region together but could not make it, Dat felt urged to do something.

“Recently I’ve learned that Hoa is very passionate about music and always wished to come to the Central Highlands region to see people playing T’rung [a traditional bamboo xylophone used by ethnic people]. Also, the story of him and my grandfather encouraged me to organize a trip for him,” Dat told Tuoi Tre News.

It was a win-win situation for Dat, who was working for a newspaper in Hanoi, as he also prepared some stories to work on the road.

The duo departed from Nghe An, traveled along central coastal roads to the southern province of Vung Tau, then visited Cu Chi Tunnels in Ho Chi Minh City before heading to the Central Highlands and returning home.

After 25 days, Dat and Hoa traveled nearly 4,000km by car through 20 cities and provinces.

When Dat took the wheel, Hoa cheered up the atmosphere with his singing.

“He wanted to visit places like the old battlefields, martyrs’ cemeteries, museums, and pagodas which are more peaceful than famous tourist destinations, so I set up my plan to take him to historic sites,” Dat shared.

The two men on the road even made headlines on local social media after Dat shared the experience on a Facebook group of travel enthusiasts in Vietnam.

Many people had hit the 'love' button and expressed their respect for the two as well as their interesting relationship which led to a 'strange' journey: a young man traveling through half of Vietnam with his grandpa’s friend.

People also adored Dat for his time and effort to help Hoa have the trip of his life.

However, Dat was not flattered, calling what he did just 'a normal thing.'

But to Hoa, the trip was something that would make him smile whenever he thinks of it.

“I’m really happy that Dat could take me on such a trip at such an old age,” he said.

“All the places I visited reminded me of a lot of things.

“I told Dat it’s such a great thing to see what older generations left for us, to see our homeland developing rapidly.

“In the past, we had to walk for months to reach the southern region but now we only needed almost two days."

According to Dat, one of his biggest concerns during the trip was Hoa’s health.

However, it turned out that Dat was knocked out by the road and weather while Hoa stayed healthy during the whole trip.

“I only worried about him getting tired because he had to drive the whole time,” Hoa said.

Another dream of Hoa

Besides the desire to visit the old places, one motivation for Hoa to be on the road was his wish to see people playing T’rung.

After performing music while serving in the army, Hoa developed a strong passion for it.

He said the April trip gave him many opportunities to meet and exchange with people who shared his passion.

Hoa has been into creating musical instruments from daily items such as cooking pots, bricks, light bulbs, beer bottles, kettles, and more.

An 'invention' he has been most proud of is an instrument called 'Sao Tu Tam,' which means 'a flute made from the heart.'

During his years in war, Hoa witnessed his comrades being injured by bombs and bullets many times.

After the war, he continued to see civilians become disabled by remnants of explosives and toxic chemicals.

All prompted him to do something to bring joy to those people.

It took Hoa more than 10 years to bring his idea of disability-friendly musical instruments to life.

'Sao Tu Tam' is a set of metal pipes combined with no holes like a regular flute.

The instrument is designed with a strap system for people with disabilities to easily carry on their body.

Hoa knows his instrument is not good-looking, but all he wants is to cheer up disabled people.

“I only want to have the opportunity to teach disabled people at some shelters to play my instruments so that they can feel a little joy in life,” Hoa said.

“If it works, maybe they can find a way to earn a living with that.

“Provided they like it and want to learn.

“I don't need any payment, now that I'm over 70, I'm just afraid that I won't have much time.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Military Command of Khanh Hoa Province in south-central Vietnam, in collaboration with the provincial Youth Union, on Saturday presented food to 100 Russian citizens in need residing in Nha Trang City.

The donation included 200 boxes of instant noodles, 50 cartons of milk, 500kg of rice, and hundreds of kilograms of vegetables.

The recipients are 100 Russian nationals, who are living in Nha Trang and have suffered from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The donation was funded by the local budget, contributions from officers and soldiers of the armed forces in the province, and the provincial Youth Union’s COVID-19 support fund.

“Thank you for the gifts,” said Klina Alena, a 39-year-old woman who has lived and worked in Nha Trang for more than three years.

Before the pandemic, Alena rented a store to sell clothing. However, her business has been shuttered in accordance with social distancing rules for COVID-19 prevention.

Alena and her four family members have been living on savings ever since.

“I don’t speak the local language, so it has been quite tough,” she shared with Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper.

Logunos Tachia, a Russian music teacher, also expressed her gratitude for the donation as it has been difficult for her to go grocery shopping during the restriction period, regardless of helps from locals and her compatriots.

“Your gifts make us feel happy and cared about,” said Tachia.

“I hope the pandemic will wane quickly so that the Russian community can go back to work.”

This is not the first support of its kind that the Khanh Hoa Military Command has carried out in the south-central province.

The military unit previously organized stalls selling goods worth a total of nearly VND1 billion (US$43,450) at zero cost to people in local quarantine facilities and medical isolation areas.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As COVID-19 has deprived Vietnam’s tourism sector of international visitors over the past year, a tour guide in Hanoi found a way to push on with his job, bringing authentic experiences to tourists through live streams.

Le Hoang, 28, was blessed to have a job that he is passionate about.

Being a tour guide to foreign visitors, he got to travel around Hanoi’s famous sightseeing places and coffee shops, sharing his love and knowledge of the capital city to others.

It was not until early 2020, when the pandemic started hitting Vietnam, effectively blocking all international tourists from entering the country, that Hoang started to worry about his line of work.

Yet coincidentally enough, the pandemic also opened up a new opportunity to the Hanoian tour guide.

“In April 2020, a British tourist asked me to bring my signature coffee tour online," Hoang recalled.

"That was the point I started thinking about online tours as a possibility.”

Starting out with an ultimately streamlined setup, a smartphone, a tripod, a noise-canceling mic, Vietnamese coffee and a filter, a tiny plastic chair, and a foldable table, Hoang hits the street, seeking to bring the bona fide Hanoi coffee experience to tourists sitting thousands of miles away from him.

For each session of roughly one hour, Hoang brings the virtual customers to idiosyncratic spots in the Vietnamese capital, trying out iconic street foods, while unfolding the lore that underlies the city’s nooks and crannies.

Hoang even offers live tutoring sessions on coffee-making, with step-by-step guidance for tourists to brew a proper cup of Vietnamese coffee at home.

“Vietnamese coffee is really strong, so you might be overwhelmed," Hoang wrote in his tour description on AirBnB.

"Don't worry, with my instruction, hopefully you can see all the layers in a sip of Vietnamese coffee, to find out why it's highly addictive."

The young tour guide revealed that a large number of his customers are home-bound people in Western countries who cannot get out due to existing COVID-19 restrictions in their countries.

Struggling with a dearth of human connection, these tourists seek out virtual tourism as a mode of escapism which offers them just as much knowledge and experience as the real thing.

During the downtime between coronavirus outbreaks in Vietnam, Hoang has managed to show international tourists not only his home city but also other world-famous destinations in the Southeast Asian country, including Mu Cang Chai Town in northern Yen Bai Province, the ancient town of Hoi An, and the coastal city of Da Nang.

However, seeing the Delta coronavirus variant has been wreaking havoc in Vietnam during the past weeks, Hoang started to restrict his journeys, only bringing his customers to nearby places in the capital city to do his part in stemming the spread of the epidemic.

Just a few days ago, Hanoi began to be placed under an elevated social distancing mandate that requires all residents to stay home, which brought his tour activity to an abrupt halt.

However, Hoang remains rather positive as he receives uplifting messages from customers in various countries in the world, who wish him and the citizens of Vietnam a quick recovery from the current hard time.

Meanwhile, many others have shown respect to Vietnam’s impressive achievements in containing the virus, and expressed their wishes to visit the country when the worldwide crisis falls away.

“I think the connection between tour guides and tourists did not vanish, it just got switched to a different platform," Hoang said.

"I still get to make new friends from all over the world every day, while they get to experience Hanoi as they wish.

“We all hope that the pandemic will soon recede, so we can finally meet up in real life.”

New movements

According to Hoang, the demand for virtual tours has gone through the roof since the pandemic started.

Many tourism platforms have jumped into the market, helping tour guides sell tickets for virtual tours or experiences to tourists.

At the outset, Hoang simply transferred the content of his existing coffee tours to live-stream mode, but he later added more services as his customers wished, even letting them design their own tours.

Being confident in his knowledge of Hanoi, Hoang said he is capable of making new itineraries and designing new tours on the spot to appease customers’ tastes.

Although the new platform requires less effort, he still exhibits an unchanged level of commitment to the job, while striving to improve his delivery, professionalism, and tour content on a daily basis.

All this has gained him a new customer base and helped him stay afloat during the tourism hibernation.

As the impact of the coronavirus seems to be visible on tourism in the years to come, virtual school trips are another gold mine that the industry should keep an eye on, Hoang pointed out.

In the past year, many school trips and student cultural exchange programs were halted, but they are returning in the form of virtual tours, allowing students to immerse in new experiences with reduced expenses, which could come as an opportunity for Vietnamese tourism firms if they enter the game early, the tour guide argued.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two Vietnamese entries to the International Federation of Photographic Art’s (FIAP) 29th Color Biennial earned a combined three honorable mentions by the panel of judges, the Vietnam Association of Photographic Artists (VAPA) recently announced.

FIAP is an international umbrella organization for 91 national photography associations, including the VAPA.

This year, the VAPA has obtained two honorable awards at the FIAP Color Biennal for ‘Traditional Crafts’ and ‘Vietnam Viewed from Above,' two photography collections that the Vietnamese institution curated from a body of works submitted by its active members.

‘Traditional Crafts,’ a collection of 10 photos, ranked sixth out of 36 entries in the print photography category, while ‘Vietnam Viewed from Above,’ a collection of 20 photos, earned fifth place out of 42 entries the digital category.

In terms of individual recognition, Vietnamese photographer Dzung Nguyen won an honorable mention for ‘Phoi Chieu Coi’ (Drying Sedge Mat), a photo in the VAPA’s ‘Traditional Crafts’ collection.

Biennial photo contests are some of FIAP’s most well-known events, with color photography biennials being held every other year on odd years and black and white and nature biennials being organized every other year on even years. The events rotate between FIAP-member countries.

According to a statement released on FIAP’s website, judges at biennials not only consider the quality of the individual work, but also the coherence of each collection, with inspiration, conception, execution, and presentation all evaluated.

The 29th FIAP Color Biennial 2021 was held in France. Each member federation was responsible for compiling and naming its own collections.

Print collections were limited to 10 photographs while digital color images were restricted to 20 pieces.

The UK was named the winner in the print category, thanks to its collection ‘Minimalistic Landscapes’ while Russia triumphed in the digital section with a collection titled ‘On the Nature of Female Beauty’.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ansapa, a tourism complex in Sa Pa Town of Lao Cai Province in northern Vietnam that went viral three months ago for its notoriously camp replica of the Statue of Liberty, has come under scrutiny once again for its ill-proportioned statue of Elsa -- the protagonist of Disney’s animated feature ‘Frozen.’

A picture of the statue has circulated on social media and garnered mixed reactions from netizens after it was posted on a Lao Cai Province-themed Facebook page on Sunday.

The majority of comments on the post mocked the sculpture’s bizarre looks, while others criticized it for ruining the natural landscape of the tourism hub Sa Pa.

In her comment, Facebook user N.P.L. argued that tourists come to Sa Pa for the untouched scenery and indigenous culture, not the “half-hearted, unaesthetic projects” like the Elsa statue.

“Let’s take a look at developed countries, see how their structures harmonize with natural scenery, and stop ruining the views with ignorance like this,” she criticized.

Answering Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, Ansapa owner Nguyen Ngoc Dong confirmed that the statue is located in his complex.

He also showed his dismay at the unfair Internet scrunity that was aimed at his business, which he claimed to be the work of his competitors.

According to Dong, the Elsa statue was completed long ago, but has only recently been installed.

As seen from the photo, the project is still underway, with a glass floor that still needs to be completed.

Dong refered to the statue as a gift to his daughter An, a big fan of Elsa, who even calls herself Anna -- the sister of the protagonist in the ‘Frozen’ movie.

It was An who inspired Dong to make an Elsa statue in order to give tourists a delight when they come to his complex, the owner added.

He justified his modern work as necessary for a demographic of visitors, while those who seek traditional culture also have the choice of visiting the surrounding villages that are doing an excellent job of preserving time-honored values.

Ansapa is located in an obscure corner that does not block the views of Sa Pa as many have been concerned, Dong assured.

Addressing the Statue of Liberty replica, the other controversial sculpture on his premises, Dong revealed that it remains a popular structure that is sought after by many visitors to his complex.

His version of the Statue of Liberty faced a harsh Internet backlash for its off-kilter proportions some three months ago, but Dong has not changed any of its features since, claiming “no one can pinpoint a definitve measure of beauty.”

The Statue of Liberty as well as the Elsa sculpture are two among various structures that have been erected as photo ops for visitors to Sa Pa Town in recent years.

As the culture-information office of Sa Pa stated, photo op structures in the area must undergo appraisal and obtain permits before construction.

According to national radio VOV, authorities in Sa Pa on Monday investigated the issue and ordered the Elsa statue to be pulled down before Wednesday.

“The owner of the Elsa statue didn’t seek the permission of the local tourism board before building it," Pham Cao Vy, head of the Sa Pa Tourism Association, told VOV.

"Otherwise, we would have discussed the pros and cons with them.

“Now, the developer has spent a hefty amount of money on the statue, the image of Sa Pa has been blackened, and tourists have come to think of Sa Pa as a town of vanity.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The drama ‘Vi' (Taste), the winner of the Encounters category at the 71st Berlin International Film Festival, has been explicitly banned from public screening in Vietnam, according to a decision by the Vietnam Cinema Department under the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism.

The decision was endorsed by Vi Kien Thanh, head of the Vietnam Cinema Department, on Monday.

It was settled on after a vetting process that collected opinions from the Central Council on Film Evaluation and other culture agencies, Thanh stated during a discussion with Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper.

The official cited nude scenes, including full-frontal ones, that last over ten minutes as grounds for the ban.

He pointed to a sequence of the film where four middle-aged, working-class women and one Nigerian footballer are seen walking and dining inside a house naked.

Thanh said he had no criticism on the general messages of the movie, even recognizing its novel artistic directions, but the full-frontal scenes, which are considered 'in conflict with Vietnamese and Asian cultures' and violating Vietnam’s Law on Cinema, made the whole work a 'lost cause.'

Meanwhile, film director Nguyen Hoang Diep, a new member of the Central Council on Film Evaluation, spoke highly of the movie and its director Le Bao.

Having observed the movie’s progress since its inception in 2015, Diep was convinced enough to extol Le Bao as one of the most talented and creative young directors in Vietnam, who figured out a ‘splendid’ cinematic language for himself.

Earlier in April, the producers of ‘Vi' were fined VND35 million (US$1,513) by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism for submitting the movie without a publishing permit to the Berlin International Film Festival 2021.

‘Vi’ is the debut feature film of director Le Bao, which was produced by Le Bien Pictures and Singapore-based E&W Films.

It is distributed internationally by Wild Bunch International.

The 97-minute flick tells the story of a Nigerian footballer who goes to Vietnam for a professional career, but has to move in with four middle-aged Vietnamese women after his team is liquidated.

The Encounters section, in which ‘Vi’ won the Special Jury Award, was created to support new voices in cinema and make room for diverse narrative and documentary forms.

In 2020, Vietnamese drama film 'Rom' was also slapped with a fine of VND40 million ($1,739) for joining the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) without first acquiring a screening permit at home.

The fine came months after the movie won the top award at the competition.

However, unlike 'Vi,' producers of ‘Rom’ managed to show a version of the film, which was said to be heavily censored, in domestic cinemas.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nguyen Van Thai is a Vietnamese conservationist on a life mission to protect pangolins, which are critically endangered, and one of the most trafficked animals in the world.

"In Vietnam, as well as in the world, pangolins are the most-captured species. Their black market price is high, up to $200 to $300 per kilogram. That is why they are constantly being hunted and sourced."

In Asia, pangolins are trafficked for use in traditional medicine, with their parts said to be able to cure everything from cancer to male impotence.

This illegal trade is worth billions of dollars.

"When we look at them, we think they are scary because they look like a dinosaur. But in fact they are really nice and shy, incapable of attacking or posing a threat to humans, but we are the reason for their declining numbers that could lead to extinction."

Thai's passion started at a young age.

A neighbor dug up a pangolin which was in a curled-up ball - the position used as a defence mechanism by the animal to ward off predators.

It was that experience that inspired him to protect pangolins.

At first he worked as a volunteer, before starting his own rescue group called Save Vietnam's Wildlife.

Now, he employs more than 60 staff and has rescued close to 1,600 pangolins.

Thai's protection group has helped set up joint task forces with rangers and locals to patrol and destroy traps set by poachers.

His work has inspired others to get involved.

"I started from zero here. The work was completely new to me. Thai was always there to guide me, little by little."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In his ongoing sketch project, Ho Chi Minh City-based artist Le Sa Long strives to portray the small acts of generosity among residents, a virtue that has once again been highlighted during the tough time of social distancing in the southern city.

An established painter in the domestic art scene who has multiple solo exhibitions and awards under his belt, Long picked up urban sketching as a habit in mid-May.

He wandered the city which he has called home for over 30 years for live sketches for a few weeks, until it began to be put under social distancing measures on May 31 and later a citywide ban on non-essential travels on June 15.

Cooped up at home under this hibernation phase, Long decided to create a new series of sketches inspired by heartwarming photos of Saigonese that he spotted on social media and in newspapers.

He has so far portrayed 40 vignettes on paper and is planning to create more.

“These images of Saigonese residents helping each other out during hard times touched my soul," he said.

"I was inspired to translate these moments and put them under a new light through the language of art.”

A standout in his collection is the vignette of a five-year-old wearing PPE overalls, standing by herself, waving goodbye to the camera before boarding an ambulance to enter quarantine.

Another sketch pays tribute to pop singer Ha Anh Tuan, who donated 25 metric tons of rice to help the struggling citizens.

Other optimistic news stories, including no-cost grocery stores for the needy, community fridges, and charity efforts benefiting pandemic-struck people, are also portrayed.

The sketches have earned Long showers of praises after they were posted on his social media account.

Many individuals have even asked to buy his pieces online, despite not having seen them in person, Long revealed.

He plans to auction several slice-of-life works to raise funds for charity causes for underprivileged people in the city, while portrait pieces of Ha Anh Tuan or frontline doctors will be gifted to the respective subjects as a tribute.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Under the scorching sun of Hanoi, a group of young artists meticulously wield their brushes to paint colorful art murals to help combat COVID-19.

Nguyen Manh Quang, the group’s representative, said the project 'Fighting the Pandemic like Fighting Your Enemies' was aimed at honoring frontliners and calling for social awareness in protecting public health.

“We first painted a 15-square-meter mural in Hoan Kiem District’s Phuc Tan Commune," Quang said.

"We later received support to make big murals, ranging from 20 square meters to 105 square meters, in Dong Da, Ha Dong, and Tay Ho Districts.”

The next destination is Cau Giay District. The group sets a goal to cover walls of 10 to 20 square meters in the Vietnamese capital with art on the theme of COVID-19 fighting and prevention.

Quang said the project was funded by artists and some donors.

He expressed the expectation that district authorities and Hanoians could give helping hands to spread the idea, especially finding big, plain walls for these artworks.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Confined to a quarantine center after coming into direct contact with a COVID-19 patient, an art teacher has spent his time giving a facelift to the walls of the facility in the north-central Vietnamese province of Ha Tinh.

The photos of Le Duy Loi, an art teacher at Nguyen Tuan Thien Middle School in Ha Tinh’s Huong Son District, painting the walls of Son Trung Kindergarten in the same district went viral on social media platforms recently.

Loi has been placed in centralized monitoring at Son Trung Kindergarten, which has been requisitioned for quarantine purposes, since June 12 as a direct contact of a virus infection case.

The intuition of an art teacher, coupled with a lot of time to spare at the quarantine center, prompted Loi to create beautiful murals on the walls, of which the previous paint layer had mostly worn off.

After receiving the approval of local authorities, the teacher asked his family members to supply him with drawing tools and paint.

He painted whenever he was not busy with other quarantine duties.

Many other people being quarantined at the kindergarten also lent him a helping hand.

Loi’s murals depict lovely, cheerful, and encouraging activities for children.

“It’s also a way for everyone to relax and create a sense of comfort to forget the concerns over the ongoing pandemic,” Loi said.

Nguyen Truong Giang, head of the Huong Khe District Bureau of Education and Training, hailed Loi’s initiative, which did not only give a facelift to Son Trung Kindergarten but also helped quarantined people reduce stress.

Ha Tinh has recorded 73 local COVID-19 cases as of Friday afternoon since the fourth wave erupted in Vietnam on April 27.

Nationwide, 9,114 local infections have been detected in 40 out of the country's 63 provinces and cities ever since.

The overall caseload has reached 12,424 infections, with 4,653 recoveries and 62 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health.

Tay Ninh Province reported one virus-related death on Thursday but the health ministry has yet to count it in the tally.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam will submit an application to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the recognition of the Nguyen Dynasty’s nine tripod cauldrons as the world’s documentary heritage, according to the Hue Monuments Conservation Center.

Vo Le Nhat, director of the center -- which is responsible for managing, preserving, restoring, and promoting values of the Hue Monuments Complex in Hue City of central Thua Thien-Hue Province, on Wednesday afternoon said it is seeking comments and guidance from the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism before submitting the application to the UNESCO.

Comparative cultural studies in Japan, China, and South Korea showed that the set of nine tripod cauldrons currently displayed in the citadel of Hue is the only existing one of its type.

The set of nine tripod cauldrons is placed at the Imperial City’s The Mieu yard, a place to worship the kings of the Nguyen Dynasty -- the last feudal regime of Vietnam.

Made in 1836, these bronze urns are intricately carved with patterns and designs depicting the beauty of Vietnam, including the country’s Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagoes.

The highest cauldron is 2.5 meters high versus the shortest at 2.3 meters high.

The set of nine tripod cauldrons was recognized as national treasures in 2012.

The Hue Monuments Conservation Center is confident that the aforementioned factors qualify these urns as world documentary heritage in accordance with the criteria set by the UNESCO’s Memory of the World Program.

In addition to the set of nine tripod cauldrons, the Imperial Citadel of Hue boasts many other ancient works and items under the Nguyen Dynasty.

Among those, the woodblocks used to print books of Han characters, or adapted Chinese characters, were recognized as the world’s documentary heritage by the UNESCO in 2009, and the imperial records and literature on the royal architecture were acknowledged with a similar title by the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific in 2014 and 2016, respectively.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@'Bombs of seeds' thrown by young people in the Central Highlands provinces of Dak Lak and Lam Dong carry the hope for reviving the deforested hills.

The initiative, kick-started in May, has become a new Internet sensation and inspired other people to follow suit in Vietnam.

Wrapped hope

According to Pham Quang Thai, a member of the Central Highlands Association for the Protection of Natural Resources and the Environment, each bomb contains soil mixed with organic fertilizer and rice husks wrapping seeds of plants with good vitality as well as high drought tolerance.

Before being thrown away, they are moistened to ensure seeds will germinate well, helping to recreate destroyed forests.

The group’s core members paid due attention to research and selected plants that could adapt to local soil before implementing the project.

They then carried seed bombs to drop at hills that were severely damaged by deforestation.

Thai said forest regeneration using seed bombs was pioneered in India.

Based on local conditions, these seed carriers are spread by aircraft in some countries.

“In harsh areas, we dig holes to put seed bombs inside, creating favorable conditions for them to grow,” Thai explained.

Ha Vi, a 22-year-old from Dak Lak, said she found the activities interesting and meaningful.

“Wandering around hills to drop seed bombs is also a good way to exercise,” she said.

Seeds of good deeds

Inspired by the initiative, some local travel agents developed experimental tours combining tourism with forest planting.

Pham Thanh Tuan, founder of Bo Cong Anh Social Enterprise in Dak Lak, said the project did not only help to revive forests but also sow good seeds of environmental protection to students and young people.

“Therefore, we want to integrate the activity into our tour packages to attract more people to participate,” he said.

Besides seed bombs, tourists also brought bare seeds and seedlings to grow plants under the guidance of local forest rangers.

“On each plant, we hang the ID code of the person who plants it,” said Tuan.

As the Central Highlands region has many indigenous fruit trees, the group plans to call for the contribution of local farmers to create a seed bank. Collected seeds will then be sown in forests.

“It is great that those seeds we plant today will grow strongly and cover bare hills,” said eleventh grader Phan Duy Nghia.

Sharing the feeling, Pham Chi Ta, director of Vietnam Highland Travel Agency, said they also wanted to include seed bomb spreading in their tours.

The company will have to prepare legal procedures regarding areas they can plant forests, Ta said.

However, he pinned high hopes on the activity’s positive impacts on local communities.

“I usually have forest trips to develop tour packages and get chances to work with forest owners and management boards," he said.

"I look forward to bringing tourists to damaged forests to scatter seed bombs and lend a hand in re-growing them.”

Do Xuan Dung, deputy director of Dak Lak’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the initiative should be duplicated in different localities to save dying forests.

The integration of seed bomb spreading activity into tours also helps to spread this idea further.

“We have their back," he said.

"If young people and enterprises want to approach forest owners and management boards, we can help them connect."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nguyen The Loc, a 41-year-old father in Ho Chi Minh City, is building his daughter’s habit of making DIY toys to promote her creativity and decrease screen time.

Loc has spent the past year building hundreds of toys from recycled materials, each of which is designed in such a way that allows Loc and his daughter to practice essential life skills while creating the toys together.

“Playing with a kid reminds you of your own childhood,” Loc explained.

“Most adults don’t understand their own children. Playing with them is a great way to learn more about them.”

Staying far from TVs, smartphones

Loc makes spending time with his daughter a top priority.

Nearly every minute extra minute he has is spent designing toys with his daughter using materials the duo finds around their house.

Growing up in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai, Loc had a challenging childhood.

Despite his poverty, however, he would not trade his days as a teenager for the world.

Even today, he fondly remembers exploring the nature surrounding his hometown and learning about the world organically.

Now, as a parent in modern society, Loc is trying to avoid the trap of too much work and too many responsibilities, which prevents many parents from spending time with their children.

Such an attitude has led to him and his eight-year-old spending countless hours creating toys from face masks, bottle caps, and cupcake wraps.

Loc’s DIY attitude to toys was inspired by a foreign TV show. He now tries to pass that inspiration along to his daughter.

One of Loc’s most prized creations is a picture he and his daughter made from tongue depressors.

“It took me and my daughter six hours to make. That’s six hours spent together not in front of a TV or smartphone.”

Not only does Loc enjoy the time his creations allow him to spend with his daughter, but he also appreciates the benefits of helping his daughter develop a creative and inquisitive mindset.

“A child always wants to brainstorm to find solutions during making a new toy,” said Loc.

According to Loc, she has become a do-it-yourself hobbyist like her father.

She is interested in making handicrafts and reading books. Most importantly, she no longer wants to watch TV or play with a smartphone.

Loc keeps some of his daughter's creations at home. Others he sends to his daughter’s teacher who awards several students each week with gifts for creating great handmade toys.

Creating a creative space for children

Loc hopes to share his story as a way of inspiring other parents to participate in similar activities with their children.

After graduating from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Loc worked as a teacher before becoming a financial manager for a business group in the city.

He and a friend launched a creative workshop meant for inspiring STEM education in Binh Thanh District, Ho Chi Minh City after resigning from the group.

STEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Currently, Loc’s STEM curriculum is designed for elementary and secondary students.

In the creative space, children not only make toys by themselves but also design simple and complex models that can incorporate modern technology and coding.

At Loc’s STEM space, children are also able to learn and practice social and life skills.

“I teach them how to navigate using a digital compass in a park. This helps the children practice life skills,” says Loc.

“I also take them out to the street when giving them guidelines on transportation safety.”

Loc gives also uses his STEM space to share key life skills with parents.

He teaches the adults skills of dealing with drowning and offering first aid to people suffering a stroke.

He also holds trips on the weekends for children during which they pay visits to forests like Nam Cat Tien in Lam Dong Province and Ma Da in Dong Nai Province in order to learn in nature.

Loc dreams of having a piece of land large enough to build an experimental education center surrounded by nature.

He hopes to use the space for children to learn how to grow vegetables themselves and apply technical knowledge.

“I would like to create a workshop in which children, despite their age, can learn to do what is necessary for them to gain knowledge about creativity and technology,” he shared.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pan Macmillan, one of the largest general book publishers in the UK, has purchased the international rights, excluding the mother language edition in Vietnam, to two children books written by Vietnamese author Trang Nguyen.

‘Saving Sorya: Chang and the Sun Bear’ is an inspirational graphic novel adventure, based on a true story about Chang, a young conservationist who overcomes the odds to save a sun bear called Sorya and return the bear back into the wild.

The Vietnamese edition of the book was already published in Vietnam in the beginning of 2020.

‘Saving H’non: Chang and the Elephants’ has an older version of the character Chang saving an elephant that is forced to work in the logging and tourism industries for 50 years.

Hanoi-based Kim Dong Publishing House, on behalf of the author group, sold the global rights excluding Vietnam and in all languages excluding Vietnamese of the two books to Pan Macmillan.

The UK book publisher has sold the copyrights to ‘Saving Sorya: Chang and the Sun Bear’ to its partners in the U.S., Norway, Turkey, China and South Korea.

The book is slated to hit the bookshelves in the UK in September.

Meanwhile, ‘Saving H’non: Chang and the Elephants,’ still in the finalizing phase, is expected to be introduced to readers in 2022.

Trang Nguyen’s two books are illustrated by Jeet Zdung, an artist who fuses traditional Vietnamese art with Japan’s manga art using pencil, watercolors, ink, and digital tools.

Trang is the founder of WildAct Vietnam, a non-profit organization which monitors the illegal wildlife trade and organizes educational programs for youths.

She was named in the BBC 100 women 2019 and the 2020 Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia lists.

The book writer plans to donate the entire royalty payment, which was kept undisclosed but said by Kim Dong Publishing House to be a record in the Vietnamese publishing industry, to conservation groups of Free The Bears and WildAct Vietnam.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@These long distance and ultramarathon runners are not professional athletes, they are merely everyday women looking to shed some stress and triumph over their own limits.

“There is nothing as valuable as your health," said Nguyen Xuan Diu, a freelancer in Ho Chi Minh City.

"Running each day helps me balance my life and avoid negativity.

“I lace up my sneakers and hit the road whenever I feel tired.

"It releases all of my bad feelings.”

Diu first began running about two years ago after realizing that stress was causing her to put on significant weight.

In those two years, she has gone from getting winded after two kilometers to completing a full-length marathon.

Diue’s friends were so surprised at her transformation that many of them even began asking her for advice on how to get in shape.

“Some of them have even become as passionate about running as I am!” Diu said.

She owes much of her running success to AR Saigon Club, a group of runners that meets regularly to run together and share knowledge.

“My body has changed so much [over the past two years]," Diu shared.

"I can run faster and longer.

"I can even run 42 kilometers in just four hours and 11 minutes."

During the past two years, Diu has entered a race each weekend in cities across Vietnam, including Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Da Lat, but her most memorable race was on Ly Son Island in June 2020.

Despite a heatwave blanketing the island, she joined the 21-kilometer category and started the run, but disaster struck about 15 kilometers in when she began cramping.

“I wanted so badly to run between the two Vietnamese flags at the finish line that I became empowered to complete the race," Diu recalled.

"I was even lucky enough to win the amateur 21-kilometer category."

Do Thi Nguyet, 35, is another Saigonese runner who has developed a passion for the sport over the years.

Nguyet, who runs a pharmaceutical company, began running six years ago as a way to keep fit after moving from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City.

Part of her passion, she said, was fueled by the people she met after joining the Viet Runners Club.

“I made friends with many people who share a love for exercise and running,” Nguyet said.

"We practice together each week and even enter competitions."

On average, Nguyet participates in one race each year.

“My most unforgettable race was the Berlin Marathon in Germany, where I competed on behalf of the Adidas Runners Saigon Club,” Nguyet shared.

“It was an extremely emotional event for me.

"I spent most of it worrying about my friends and the other runners because the weather was cold and rainy, but that didn’t stop me from achieving my personal goal.”

Nguyen Thi Mai Suong, 38, also uses running as a vehicle to achieve her goals.

A self-proclaimed ‘weakling,’ Suong has spent the past year growing as both a human being and a runner.

“Thanks to running, I am no longer weak. I’m stronger and healthier,” Suong said, adding that running has opened her eyes to the importance of diet, weight, and overall health.

Many of the competitions Suong competes in revolve around charitable causes, such as the 'Running for the Poor' event sponsored by the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, better known as BIDV, as well as another organized by the Southern Power Corporation to support Mekong Delta farmers during a drought.

“Running helps me appreciate my life and love myself and those around me,” Suong shared.

Spreading positive messages

Nguyet has become a coach instructing newbies who want to start running.

To her, running for health is the premier cause, but apart from that, she can also share positive energy with others while doing exercise together.

Many of them asked their friends and colleagues to run with them.

Lam Ngoc Quy, 39, a mother of two children, has tried to arrange all her duties to spare time for running.

“At first I ran for health,” said Quy.

“But the more I run, the more I love it, so I asked many of my friends to run with me.”

After just two years of running, Quy has conquered many challenges like distances of 42 kilometers or even a trail marathon of 70 kilometers including walking and running through mountainous terrain that could last up to 24 hours.

“In my opinion, running helps us train our will very much as we will be easy to give up in the middle because of fatigue,” Quy said.

“I think only of the finish line and urge myself to continue stretching my steps on the way.

“In the competitions that I took part in for a charity cause, I felt that I was more encouraged to finish the race."

Khanh Van has also completed an achievement of 155 kilometers to throw her support behind a campaign launched by the Ho Chi Minh Pioneers' Organization to help the poor and underprivileged people.

“After registering for the campaign, I must force myself to complete the goal each day without anyone reminding me,” explained Van.

“In fact, my activity becomes more meaningful when I can do something to help others with it."

The running movement has blossomed in recent years in Vietnam. To runners, running is not only a useful exercise but also a small contribution to society in some way.

There are varied charity organizations that have been financed via running competitions such as Operation Smile,specializing in helping poor disabled children with cleft lip or cleft palate; NewBorns Vietnam, dedicated to helping infants; and Vietseeds and Run For Future, both among funds that help poor youth to have a chance to keep studying.

An ‘addictive’ kind of sport To female runners, running is as addictive as it is easy to learn. It appeals to the runners at the very first as they can meet with a big community of people who share with them a love for running or jogging. They will find an interesting world with people who are mostly positive, friendly, and easygoing. “Sometimes we make appointments only due to remembering friends and wanting to meet with them,” Nguyet said. “When you have a habit of running, it will be extremely difficult to stop it. "I feel uncomfortable not being able to regularly run sometimes."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Graduating from a business school yet finding the environment a bad fit, 27-year-old Tran Thi Phuong Trinh from Ho Chi Minh City’s Phu Nhuan District switched to making pressed flower displays.

Trinh gave up on the old job which brought her good income but not happiness to start doing research on creating still life behind glass.

It took Trinh six months to master the process including drying fresh flowers, developing colors, and designing her own displays.

Trinh said at first she spent two to three days on a batch of dried flowers and leaves then decided to outsource them to foreign suppliers instead to reduce the workload.

Basic steps to make a pressed flower display include cleaning the frame, arranging flowers and leaves, framing them up with two layers of glass, and then dusting.

As these displays easily get dirty by fingerprints, Trinh said it was essential that all her works be cleaned thoroughly and showcased in dry places.

“I think, at some point, I do not want to work for others but start my own business," said Trinh.

"It was hard initially creating artworks and selling them.

"The only thing I knew was these products would attract young customers and interior designers."

She is completing procedures to export her products to foreign markets which have a big demand for handmade artworks.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ten years ago, a traffic accident took away Nguyen Chanh Tin’s control over the lower half of his body; however, the condition did not stop him from living his life and finding his beloved.

Tin still recalls vividly the day that the road accident took place -- one that rendered his legs immobile when he was only 23 years old.

After going through uphill battles during treatment against the condition, Tin decided to leave the big city behind for a new life in his hometown of Binh Dinh Province in south-central Vietnam.

With no control over his legs, Tin had to turn to his mother for even the most trivial needs.

Afraid of becoming a family burden, Tin thought of every way possible to make money while being bed-ridden.

He then found a demand for mobile phones and accompanying gadgets in his hometown, as well as product supplies from a wholesaler in Ho Chi Minh City, which motivated him to open a local mobile phone repair shop.

He did not expect that the venture would lead him to Nguyen Thuy Truc, a customer from Ho Chi Minh City who would later become his girlfriend.

He referred to his love story as a ‘VND360,000 [US$16]’ one, as an inquiry about the pricing of a product sparked their first banter.

As the conversation went further, they bonded over similar stories of lost loves.

“I don’t even know exactly when we did fall in love with each other,” Tin said.

It took him a few more conversations to finally confess his love for Truc, which was immediately reciprocated.

As a couple, they spent the first two years together being 600 kilometers away from each other, which proved a challenging test of commitment for both sides.

They also had to hear malicious comments that wished their love affair ill only because of Tin’s condition.

Nevertheless, the challenges only served to consolidate their relationship further.

“I feel grounded and at peace whenever I’m with Tin,” Truc said.

“Even when he’s bed-ridden, Tin remains upbeat and optimistic.

"He enlightened me on many things, including love and perseverance.”

Early on, the couple decided to take the next step and move in together.

In their new house in District 7 of Ho Chi Minh City, Tin felt the urge to start penning his autobiography, entitled ‘Toi chon song’ (I Choose Life), which was published earlier this year.

In his new journey as a life coach, he hopes that his words will be able to inspire young people facing disadvantaged circumstances to seize the narrative to their own life.

He is also committed to philanthropist work, vowing to donate half of the profits from his book to charitable activities.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A project launched by two high school students in Ho Chi Minh City is inspiring teenagers across the city to connect with older generations.

Twelfth-graders Vo Ngoc Doan Dung and Dang Mai Chi of the High School for the Gifted under the Vietnam National University-Ho Chi Minh City established Elderly of Saigon, or ESG, in August 2019 with an aspiration to eliminate the generation gap between urban Generation Z youngsters and old people.

Generation Z cohorts have the mid-to-late 1990s as their starting birth years and the early 2010s as their ending birth years, according to researchers and popular media use.

“I have learned so many life lessons from my grandparents," said Dung.

"The ESG project aims to create a platform for young people to talk to the elderly and nurture compassion and understanding for their own loved ones so they can learn those same lessons.”

Together, ESG project members make gifts and hand them out to elderly residents across the city, using the exchange as a chance to make small talk and share stories which can be posted to ESG’s Facebook fanpage.

Through Facebook, ESG has recently launched a competition entitled 'Listening,' which calls for submissions from young people nationwide of stories told by their grandparents.

Lam Kim Dat, a 17-year-old student at the high school, said participating in the project has allowed him to go places and listen to interesting stories of times past.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@At the age of 33, Giang Thi Kim Cuc could have bought an apartment already if she had not spent so much money on courses in environmental protection and human resources management.

The woman, who lives in Thu Duc City under Ho Chi Minh City, has a soft spot for trash.

Cuc has collected garbage for so many years that many people call her ‘a trash girl.'

Collecting trash is not a boast

Cuc’s main job is in the field of business, but she also has a more important job on weekends: collecting trash.

She is not familiar with luxury clothing and everyone living around her has gotten used to the image of a woman wearing boots, a bag in her left hand, tongs in her right hand, picking up trash.

Cuc not only picks up trash in Ho Chi Minh City but she also joins a group of like-minded members to make ‘responsible trips,’ during which they have gone to 39 out of 63 cities and provinces in Vietnam to collect garbage.

Cuc and her elder sister took part in an international campaign to collect waste along with thousands of members who came from 42 countries.

“I was stunned to read that Vietnam was the fourth country in the world in discarding garbage into the ocean,” she told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper.

“I am still young, I have to do something at once to address the problem.

"I used the issue as a reason that forced me not to give up under any circumstances."

Cuc cannot go by without doing anything when she sees waste, despite being at a park, a train station, the foot of a bridge, or a contaminated channel.

She loves collecting garbage and she is willing to stop doing anything to pick it up.

“I can say for sure that picking up trash is not an action for show,” Cuc said.

“As a matter of fact, the first people who participated in our trip to collect waste before are continuing their jobs as pioneers, laying the foundation for a culture of collecting waste in Vietnam.

“They collect waste because they find it necessary.

“They love this country and want to make it greener and more beautiful."

50,000 bags of garbage

Cuc cannot remember how many garbage collection trips she has partaken in over the last three years, which have been undertaken for nothing except for the public interest.

She has set foot in 39 out of 63 provinces of Vietnam to date.

She and her friends collect garbage anywhere they pay a visit.

Cuc organizes such trips in a professional manner. The volunteers who join the trips will be supplied with hats, gloves, and tongs.

After being picked up by the members, the garbage is packed in bags, which will be transferred to factories to be processed professionally.

“More than 50,000 waste bags with a weight of over 30 kilograms each are the results we have achieved for the last three years," Cuc said.

“Sometimes we only collected around dozens of bags but in special instances, it could take us around one week to clean up the waste, and it would be normal for us to fill around 500 to 700 bags."

In fact, 50,000 bags of waste are nothing in comparison with nearly 18,000 tonnes of waste thrown out every day, according to data supplied by the Da Nang Institute for Socio-Economic Development.

Cuc understands she cannot collect waste for all her life, so she wants to find ways to raise awareness of the need for environmental protection among the people.

Because of this, Cuc has empowered herself by enrolling in various courses on the environment and human resources management domestically and internationally.

“I used a big sum of money which was enough to buy a good apartment to register for courses on the environment,” Cuc said.

“Apart from the fact that I am known for being good at collecting garbage, I would like to gain knowledge to be able to present things correctly and meaningfully,"

After completing a garbage collecting program, Cuc always holds a workshop in the local community to share knowledge about the environment and nature while showing the way to sort out the waste as well.

Cuc is confident that she can “sow” such “green seeds” via such activities after leaving an area.

In that way, there will still be people who continue to conduct their mission, which is not only to collect trash but also to heighten awareness of environmental protection.

Being inspired by the sisters of Cuc, the Green Trips Vietnam group has attracted more than 40,000 members to date.

Many of the key members of the group founded by Cuc are foreign people who are living and working in Vietnam.

They come from many countries like India, the Netherlands, Canada, the U.S., Malaysia, the Philippines, and Japan.

For a liveable Vietnam! That is the name of a trash collecting campaign that is scheduled by Cuc and her coworkers to be held on June 5 to celebrate World Environment Day. There are thousands of volunteers who will take part in picking up trash in 63 provinces and Vietnam's big islands. Cuc sets a goal in 2022 to build a community with around one million volunteers who share her ideas of protecting Mother Nature.

Themed ‘Building A Digital World. Together,’ the three-day online event brings together more than 50 ITU member countries.

The technological foundation used during the event was developed by Vietnam's military-run Viettel telecom group.

In his opening remarks, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said the Vietnamese government has paid attention to telecommunication infrastructure development and considered IT one of the top priorities.

Digital transformation has been regarded as a crucial solution for helping the country develop more rapidly and sustainably, Dam added.

The deputy PM reiterated the Vietnamese government’s commitments to supporting and coordinating with the ITU and its member countries in building a digital world for peace, cooperation, and prosperity.

Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said Vietnam’s digital infrastructure is now ready for a digital-based economy and society.

Vietnamese technologies not only deal with domestic but also global issues, the minister said, adding that the country is striving to make technology a driver of development and global cooperation.

ITU Secretary General Houlin Zhao said Vietnam is an important partner in many markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean region, which has made the nation become a bright example in IT development to many other developing countries.

ITU is a United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies.

The first ITU telecom event was held in 1971. Since its 40th anniversary in 2011, the event has been held on an annual basis in a different location worldwide.

The 2020 edition is named ITU Digital World and takes place online from October 20 to 22.

The ITU Digital World 2021 will be back in its usual form in Hanoi in October next year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A golf tournament aimed at supporting Vietnamese start-ups first organized by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper last year is set to return for the second edition this September.

‘Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020’ is meant to support start-ups in the beginning period of their business by helping to connect young entrepreneurs with seasoned and successful business people.

During the tourney, which will be launched on September 18, the organizers will also present awards to the most excellent entrepreneurs of the start-up community.

Excited to participate

Many entrepreneurs, who are experienced golfers, are excited to take part in this year's competition. In their opinion, the tournament will give them a chance to both play golf and help the upcoming generation of business people.

“I appreciate Tuoi Tre for holding such a golf competition to promote start-ups and help experienced entrepreneurs have another approach to supporting them,” said Le Hai Binh, founder and chairman of the IT services company Mat Bao Group, who is also a golfer taking part in the tournament.

“The competition will provide young entrepreneurs with opportunities to meet with their potential investors among the golfers who participate in the tournament."

The competitors interviewed by Tuoi Tre applauded the paper's idea to create ‘a playground’ for start-up owners.

Meeting with other entrepreneurs on the golf course is certain to bring a different vibe than traditional environments like offices or working space, and may help generate stronger bonds between the participants, they said.

Overcoming COVID-19

Start-ups have been hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020 was also rescheduled to begin in September instead of April, when it was held last year, because of the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of the global health crisis, many entrepreneurs consider the tournament an occasion for them to support young entrepreneurs in getting over the adversities of the pandemic, especially since it is currently under control in Vietnam.

“The current situation is different from last year’s. The pandemic has presented start-ups with difficulty in accessing funds as almost all companies are impacted by the coronavirus,” Binh remarked.

“Of course [potential investors] must fight for the survival of their own companies first before considering investing in others."

According to Binh, in 'the new normal,' customers are likely to spend less so start-ups in the fields of services, travel, and food would be considerably impacted.

“Despite that, I am not quite pessimistic because there are always opportunities in challenging situations,” Binh said.

The chairman of Mat Bao Group believes that during the pandemic, entrepreneurs who can flexibly adapt to the new situation will emerge victorious and even achieve new breakthroughs.

“Tuoi Tre’s golf tournament for start-ups will offer them the opportunity to do so,” Binh said.

Lawyer Nguyen Thi Thanh Nha, legal director of the investment firm Openasia Group, said her experience as a shareholder in a few start-ups when she was younger helps her understand the advantages that start-ups have, such as youth, ambition, and knowledge.

But she also acknowledges the rigors they must face on the way to success such as networking, calling for suitable investors, and developing relationships with other start-ups.

“Participating in the [golf tournament] will help them partly solve these problems and build more new business relationships,” said Nha, who has played golf for 12 years.

“Business opportunities may come to them unexpectedly during this tournament, who knows?”

Honoring 25 excellent start-ups

With the aim of promoting and empowering the start-up community both in Ho Chi Minh City and the rest of Vietnam, Tuoi Tre and partners jointly present the Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020.

The tourney will also mark the 75th anniversary of Vietnam’s National Day (September 2), the 89th founding anniversary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union (March 26), and the 45th anniversary of the founding of Tuoi Tre (September 2).

Dozens of inspiring start-up stories have been published in Tuoi Tre in various formats since July in the lead-up to the tournament.

The opening gala is scheduled to take place on September 18 at the Long Thanh Golf Club in Dong Nai Province, 35 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For students from poor families, education is the best way to help themselves and their families get out of their plight and lift their communities out of poverty. Ironically, after all the effort of studying in difficulty throughout 12 years from elementary to high school, these students even with high academic records to enter college are unable to live their dreams because of their family’s financial situations. They simply cannot afford tuition fees and other expenses of higher education.

The “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” scholarship program of Tuoi Tre Newspaper has made great strides in helping these poor students. This program gave the first scholarship in Quang Tri Province in 2003. It has gradually spread to other provinces and now it covers the whole country.

Over 17 years, this scholarship program has helped more than 19,000 new college students who otherwise would not be able to afford higher education. Last year, there were more than 1,200 new college students from all over the country receiving scholarships.

Each poor student is given a standard scholarship of VND10 million (US$430). Very poor students are granted special scholarships worth VND15 million (US$645) each.

This year due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be more poor new college students in need of help, although the donation could be less than last year.

We would like to appeal for new and current donors to “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” so that at least 1,000 poor students around the country, among them 80 from Thua Thien-Hue Province, could receive scholarships this academic year.

Please send your donation to Bao Tuoi Tre, bank account: 113000006100 (for VND) at VietinBank, Branch 3, HCM City; or bank account: 0071370195845 (for USD) or 0071140373054 (for EUR) at Vietcombank, HCM City Branch, Swift Code: BFTVVNVX007; for “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” Scholarship Program.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A charity initiative administered 700 care packages on the weekend to workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Binh Tan District, as well as Lao and Cambodian students in the Pre-University College of Ho Chi Minh City.

The initiative was undertaken by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, supermarket chain Saigon Co.op, and e-commerce platform Shopee, with support from the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.

The organizers prepared essentials, including rice, cooking oil, and fish sauce, and divided them into thousands of gift packages, each of which was priced at VND145,000 (US$6.3) on Shopee.

The packages were delivered on Saturday directly to the beneficiaries, including 500 workers who are struggling financially in Binh Tan District, 200 Lao and Cambodian students and those of Vietnam's ethnic minorities at the Pre-University College in District 5.

Among the recipients was Tran Ngoc Sang, a manufacturing worker in Binh Tan District who hails from Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta.

“I feel blessed to receive these essential items, which will help ease the burden on my family during social distancing,” said the sole breadwinner for the family of seven.

Other demographics, including youths in locked-down areas of Hoc Mon District, as well as unofficial workers in Cat Lai Ward of Thu Duc City, also received the care packages of the initiative.

After the first run on Saturday and Sunday, the organizers plan to hand another 2,500 packages to struggling people in cordoned-off areas in Ho Chi Minh City on July 22 and 25.

They are currently accepting donations on Shopee and ShopeePay.

In June and early July, many working-class residents in Ho Chi Minh City suffered from lay-offs or reduced income as the southern metropolis emerged as Vietnam’s coronavirus epicenter, with its caseload rising in the thousands daily.

The alarming situation has prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home, effectively cutting off the livelihoods of many unofficial workers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Three sex tapes and multiple 'private' photos purportedly featuring one of the top 40 beauty queens of the 2014 Miss Vietnam pageant were leaked online on Friday.

The sensitive photos and videos appear to be taken and filmed voluntarily by Vo Hong Ngoc Hue and her partner.

It is not clear if this is a case of revenge porn or someone had stolen the sex tapes and shared them online.

Hue, born 1995 in the south-central province of Phu Yen, is currently a senior student at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Medicine and Pharmacy.

Hue first became known as a talented beauty in 2013, when she attended HotVteen, a teenage beauty contest, where she won over the judge panel and audience with impressive education records and taekwondo skill.

She also won the heart of fans at the 2014 Miss Vietnam, even though she could make it only to the top 40, apparently because of her modest height of 1.65m.

Hue has led a quiet life away from media spotlight, so the sex tape scandal has left her fans in shock.

The beauty queen has not responded to any media contact as of Sunday noon.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The coronavirus-inspired murals on the external walls of a house in Hanoi are still the apple of local reasidents’ eye even after the COVID-19 crisis has raged around the world for more than a year.

Le Long, a street artist, secured the house owner’s consent to paint his murals in late March 2020, when Vietnam was resolutely battling COVID-19.

The wall paintings remain to command the full attention of passers-by at the Van Phu residential quarter in Ha Dong District, Hanoi.

Everyone stops to have a look at the coronavirus, vaccine, or earth imagery whenever they go past the four-story building.

Long spray-painted all the images in order to convey the message “Stay Strong – Let’s Stay Home.”

He had searched for information and images on the Internet and transformed them into colorful murals.

He even hired a crane to reach the walls as high as 20 meters on the top floor.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A viral challenge calling on netizens to go outside, pick up trash, and post their ‘before and after’ photos is sweeping through social media, and young Vietnamese people do not want to stay away from the trend.

Challenge for Change, or the #Trashtag Challenge, has become a global viral sensation, inspiring youth to make a difference in their community, one trash bag at a time.

The #Trashtag Challenge is simple – find an outdoor area that has been overrun with litter, gather a group of friends to help clean it, and post 'before and after' photos to social media.

In Vietnam, a country labeled as one of the world’ top polluters, young locals have been quick to jump on the #trashtag bandwagon, posting dozens of photos of freshly cleaned areas in cities across the country, including Vinh, Da Nang, Da Lat, and Ho Chi Minh City, and several more.

“I’ve never participated in a challenge on social media, but this time I made an exception,” Huong Ly, winner of Vietnam's Next Top Model, said.

Wanting to make a difference in her own community, Ly convinced her brother to join her in cleaning up the area under the Phu My Bridge in District 7, Ho Chi Minh City.

“I saw all these people partaking in a meaningful trash-cleaning challenge and I just thought that lending a hand to make our surroundings prettier and spreading positivity would help convince others to do the same,” the model explained.

It took the two about five hours over the course of two days to collect all the trash that had been dumped under the bridge by nearby households and restaurants, but Ly says it was worth the effort.

“Everyone can help make each corner of the city clean. If more people participate, the city will be cleaner,” she shared.

Doan Hoang, a 22-year-old student at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, is another local youth who rolled up his sleeves for the #Trashtag Challenge.

His impressive 'before and after' shots of the riverbank he cleaned near the Ong Cay Bridge in District 2, Ho Chi Minh City are a shining example of just how much a single person can do to make a difference.

“Not everyone can do big things, but we can all do small things with a big love,” the caption of the 'before and after' photos he posted to Facebook reads.

“Together, we can make a big change.”

Hoang acknowledged that he was happy to help improve his community, but was quick to add that permanent change will only happen when people stop littering instead of waiting for others to clean up.

In Vinh, the capital of Nghe An Province in north-central Vietnam, Nguyen Manh Tuan and three friends took it upon themselves to clear Cua Lo Beach of the trash that had accumulated there over the years.

In Da Nang, Huynh Ba Luc, 26, and his cousin spent a whole afternoon filling dozens of trash bags on Son Tra Peninsula, around ten kilometers northeast of the city center.

“There were so many different types of trash, like dishes and bowls, beer bottles, plastic bags, and single-use containers left by the tourists,” Luc said.

This was not the first time he had participated in a clean-up activity. In the past, Lu joined a cleaning event in Tho Quang Fishing Village in Da Nang, but the area became polluted again not long after.

“People’s awareness is still a problem,” he commented.

“I keep cleaning up but they litter right after. I hope that these challenges will raise awareness of this issue,” he said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marcus Manh Cuong Vu’s ‘Memento Mori: Water’ and Nguyen Phan Linh Dan’s ‘If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood’ will represent Vietnam in the Asian Project Market (APM) category under this year’s Busan International Film Festival (BIFF).

APM said it has selected 26 movies out of 429 film submissions to present to the judges at BIFF 2021, which is slated for October 12-14.

Among the 26 shortlisters are ‘Memento Mori: Water,’ produced by Nguyen Hoang Diep, Nguyen Trinh Hoan and directed by Vu.

This supplied photo shows film director Marcus Manh Cuong Vu.

It is the second piece in the ‘Memento Mori the Movie’ trilogy, an adaptation of Dang Hoang Giang’s 2018 hit nonfiction book ‘Diem Den Cua Cuoc Doi’ (The Destination of Life).

Through the story of Ha, a mother who accompanies her son Nam’s journey to battle bone cancer, 'Memento Mori: Water' delves into the heavy subject of near-death experience through the lens of empathy, humanity, sharing, and enlightenment.

The casting process for ‘Memento Mori: Water’ has been completed in 2019, while filming is anticipated to start in 2022 and the official launch slated for one year later.

The first volume of the trilogy -- 'Memento Mori: Earth' -- is still being crowdfunded for its post-production and is expected to be released next year.

Speaking with Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, Vu showed his excitement at the APM result.

“It is an honor for us to be included in the Busan International Film Festival this year, as this marked the first major recognition for our project,” he stated.

“All independent filmmakers in Asia want to be chosen for APM in their first production phases, as it is an apt opportunity that supports and motivates them to complete their films.”

The milestone proves even more meaningful for Vu due to the countless struggles that his production crew and other filmmakers in Vietnam are facing in the current COVID-19 slump.

This supplied photo features director Nguyen Phan Linh Dan (middle) at the 2019 Busan International Film Festival in South Korea.

Also coming to APM 2021 is ‘If Wood Could Cry, It Would Cry Blood,’ the debut feature of director Nguyen Phan Linh Dan, whose portfolio includes the director of photography role in BIFF 2019 participant ‘Bi Mat Cua Gio’ (The Secret of the Wind) as well as directing work for various commercials and music videos.

Film directors will have to pitch their movies to a panel of international producers and investors in order to win their cash prizes.

In APM 2020, Tran Thanh Huy, director of BIFF 2019 grand prize winner ‘Rom,’ acquired the US$10,000 prize for his new project ‘Tick It.’

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A non-fungible token (NFT) created by Ho Chi Minh City-based teen artist Xeo Chu titled ‘The Lucky Apricot Blossom’ recently raked in US$23,000 in an auction on Binance’s NFT marketplace.

Pho Van An, who goes by the alias Xeo Chu, has been honing his craft for nearly a decade, producing over 200 pieces of art and showcasing his oeuvre in exhibitions at home and abroad.

Back in July, 14-year-old Xeo Chu launched an online exhibition entitled ‘Pandemic Painting,' in which he showcased three inspirations for his work – flowers, terraced fields, and the sea.

On July 18 and 20, he sold eight of these artworks in a live auction on his Facebook page, pulling in VND320 million ($14,000) for one of the paintings and VND80-230 million ($3,500-10,000) for each of the other seven.

He then donated the total proceeds of the auction – VND2.9 billion (127,000) – plus donations from failed bidders to the Ho Chi Minh City University Medical Center for support in purchasing medical equipment necessary to combat COVID-19.

This screenshot shows Xeo Chu’s NFT artwork ‘The Lucky Apricot Blossom’ sold at $22,899 on Binance.

On August 6, he put up ‘The Lucky Apricot Blossom,’ his very first NFT, for auction on Binance with the opening bid of 5,000 Binance USD (BUSD) – a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the U.S. dollar.

The bidding topped out at BUSD22,899 in less than 24 hours, marking the highest sum a piece produced by a Vietnamese artist has yielded on the platform.

This supplied photo shows artist Xeo Chu in his studio.

Xeo Chu’s virtual exhibition ‘Pandemic Painting’ is live-streamed by telepresence robot Ohmni.

NFTs are a blockchain-powered digital signature allowing anyone to verify the ownership and authenticity of an item. In other words, the NFT makes each piece of digital content unique and, henceforth, appealing to collectors.

Various digital assets, including drawings, music, and even Internet memes, can be sold as NFTs, but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital artwork on online platforms.

Aside from Xeo Chu, two other Vietnamese artists have also been selling their works on Binance. Artist Phong Luong’s highest sale was $3,000 while artist Tu Na’s highest sale hit $5,000.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper contributor recently had a chance to visit Itaewon Ward in Seoul, the setting for hit South Korean television series ‘Itaewon Class,’ and made interesting observations about the cultural hotspot there.

Known for its vibrant nightlife and international flair, Itaewon is Seoul's most diverse and foreigner-friendly district.

It is located in Yongsan District, north of the Han River and south of Myeong-dong, Seoul’s main shopping and tourism neighborhood.

There are about 22,000 residents living here, including natives, tourists, and foreigners.

The venue was recently chosen as the setting for ‘Itaewon Class,’ a TV series based on an eponymous webtoon about an ex-convict who opens a bar-restaurant in Itaewon, striving toward success.

Premiering on South Korean broadcaster JTBC on January 31, Itaewon Class is the second-highest rated drama on the cable channel.

The show, which is also available on Netflix, has captured the interest of many Vietnamese K-drama fans who praise the plot and acting of the cast.

In the real-life Itaewon, visitors will be surprised to find a large selection of restaurants serving authentic international cuisines of Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Pakistan, India, and some Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam.

Such diverse cuisines are not easily found in other parts of South Korea. There are also Korean, Chinese, and Japanese restaurants in Itaewon famous for their traditional fare.

The majority of these restaurants are found along the street behind the Hamilton Hotel near Exit 2 of Itaewon’s subway station.

Thanks to the craze around ‘Itaewon Class,’ the DanBam bar-restaurant has become one of the most popular destinations for Koreans and foreigners alike. Fans are excited to come here for pictures. Recently, the film crew had planned to hold a fan meeting at this restaurant but eventually had to postpone the event due to the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. Photo: Le Dung / Tuoi Tre

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A 22-year-old Vietnamese woman who sparked public criticism shortly after winning the 2017 Miss Ocean Vietnam last year has received yet another blow when the country’s performing arts watchdog has requested that her crown be revoked.

Le Au Ngan Anh shocked the country with her winning the beauty pageant in October 2017, with members of the public believing that her physical appearance does not deserve the title.

The 2017 Miss Ocean Vietnam contest was held by Vo Viet Chung International Co. Ltd., owned by Vo Viet Chung, a famed local designer.

On Thursday, the Department of Performing Arts under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism requested that Vo Viet Chung International void the result of the contest and strip Anh of her title for breaking competition regulations regarding eligibility.

The young student was announced winner of the beauty pageant even when she was known to have undergone a nose job, which violates the contest’s eligibility rule.

Anh has admitted to have got a plastic surgery to add cartilage grafts to her nose, before removing them to sign up for the beauty contest.

The contest organizer has previously been slapped with an administrative fine of VND4 million (US$175) for “sending ineligible contestants to beauty and model contests.”

The organizer has now been asked to take one step further to revoke the crown of the winner, “to ensure fairness for the [Miss Ocean Vietnam] contest,” according to the performing arts department.

Upon receiving public criticism for awarding the title to Anh, Chung defended the judge’s decision and claimed that the young woman, hailing from the southern province of Tien Giang, “met many requirements, from looks to knowledge.”

Regarding reports that Anh had undergone cosmetic surgery, which is a taboo, before attending the contest, Chung said he had nothing to explain as the winner had passed an anthropometric test.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The abrupt enforcement of a new movement declaration system at COVID-19 checkpoints in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday baffled the majority of commuters and clogged up traffic flow for hours.

The novel movement declaration requirement, devised by the Ministry of Public Security and considered part of the national population database, was simultaneously introduced at COVID-19 checkpoints in the city around 1:00 pm on Saturday.

This is meant to keep track of people's travels in case contact tracing is needed to stall coronavirus spread.

As witnessed by a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper correspondent, all commuters passing these checkpoints would be pulled over and could only leave when they scanned a QR code on their phones, completed their movement declaration online, captured a new QR code, and presented it to checkpoint officers to see if it matched the database.

The steps were deemed rather complicated and time-consuming by the public due to a variety of reasons, including the reduced sensitivity of mobile phone cameras for QR scanning under broad daylight, or the lack of Internet connection at checkpoints.

Several officers were ill-prepared for their duties, as the batteries on their mobile devices died while they logged commuters’ information.

“Some senior citizens had their smartphones with them, but did not know how to declare the information on the apps and required officers' help,” an checkpoint officer explained.

“Some individuals took as long as 15 minutes to complete their declaration.”

The unoptimized process impeded traffic flow, causing lines of delayed vehicles to snake out as far as a few kilometers.

On Phan Dang Luu and Le Van Duyet Streets in Binh Thanh District, hundreds of motorbikes were seen struggling to inch toward the checkpoints, where officers were still strictly upholding the declaration protocol.

“Residents can scan the QR code and declare their information at home," said Senior Lieutenant Colonel Huynh Thi Thu Trang, a senior official at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Public Security.

"They will receive another QR code, which they can save to their phone and use for the next three days.

“When passing the checkpoints, they only need to bring up the QR image so officers can instantly check their information, reducing processing time and avoiding congestion.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Vietnamese song has recently stirred up controversy, as it sounds suspiciously like Charlie Puth’s hit, ‘We Don’t Talk Anymore.’

‘Chung Ta Khong Thuoc Ve Nhau’ (We Don’t Belong to Each Other) is the latest music video by Son Tung M-TP, an emerging young singer.

The piece of music tells the story of a guy, starring Son Tung, who tries hard to look for a girlfriend but continuously fails due to his selfishness.

Unusual similarities

Both works of Tung and Puth were released on August 2 on YouTube and attracted a huge number of viewers.

A few hours from the release, Vietnamese listeners quickly realized similarities between the two songs, questioning the origin of Tung’s work.

On his Facebook fan page, DJ Heyder, the artist involved in the production of ‘We Don’t Talk Anymore,’ posted a status on August 3 saying the Vietnamese track sounds “quite similar” to his remix.

The post received 13,000 likes and over 2,000 shares.

The reactions came mainly from those Vietnamese who had already recognized the similarities between the two songs.

Heyder later answered questions from some local reporters who wished to find out the truth regarding the copyright of the song.

In an interview with news website VnExpress on August 9, the 25-year-old DJ called ‘Chung Ta Khong Thuoc Ve Nhau’ the “Vietnamese version” of his remix.

“You don’t need to be professional to point out the similarities. I think the audience can also see that,” he was quoted as saying.

The Vietnamese song has so far received over 29 million views.

Questions from K-pop fans

Not only is its beat said to plagiarize the U.S. hit but local K-pop fans have also found out that the song’s chorus is similar to that of a song named ‘Fire’ by BTS, a Korean boy band.

Some scenes made audiences think about artworks by famous Korean artists such as G-Dragon or Big Bang.

On YouTube, users have made a number of video mashups to prove that Tung’s song is unusually similar to those international artworks.

This is not the first time Tung has stirred debate over his songs.

Last year, the singer, now 22, released his hit ‘Chac Ai Do Se Ve’ (Maybe Someone Will Come Back) and quickly captured public attention, not merely because of its strange melody but also due to its highly questionable origin.

Vietnamese K-pop fans said the song’s beat was borrowed from ‘Because I Miss You’ by Korean singer Jung Yong Hwa.

The case was so serious that the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Department of Performing Arts and Copyright Office of Vietnam had to step in.

Tung was finally forced to change the beat of the song.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Ho Chi Minh City teacher with a love for the environment has discovered a passion for upcycling fabric scraps, which she uses to make various creations and launch a project called Made by Zy.

Nguyen Thanh Ngoc Thao, a young teacher who is nicknamed Zy, is known as a person who is enthusiastic about leftover fabric and do-it-yourself projects.

Thao developed a passion for creating things as a student with the goal of being financially independent.

In 2015, Thao was able to sell enough handmade accessories like bracelets and various pieces of jewelry to cover her tuition instead of asking her parents for it.

Thao began using fabric scraps to make accessories at the end of 2019. She started selling the products to support a community project to provide fresh water in the northern mountainous province of Lao Cai.

She paid a lot of attention to fabric remnants after paying a visit to a relative’s tailor shop in the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho at the beginning of 2020.

Taking the trimmings to the home, the young teacher tried out creating some accessories as gifts for herself.

Regarding them as only a way to play with her passion, Thao was surprised by the welcome and support from her close friends and acquaintances.

The project Made by Zy that specializes in making accessories out of fabric leftovers was officially launched at that moment.

Currently, apart from her main job as a STEM teacher in Ho Chi Minh City, Thao immerses in her own sewing project to play with fabric scraps on weekends.

“I would like to be always ready to work. I can do what I want to at the moment," she said.

"I believe in the future, I would have many precious memories when I look back to this time, and I would never regret anything."

Thao’s aunt, who is a tailor shop owner, has given her very much support as she understands how useful and practical her project would become. The aunt has supplied Thao with a lot of craft materials.

“The fabric scraps have now been able to be recycled in a useful way instead of being thrown away like before,” shared Thao.

“My aunt suggested some craft ideas that can be made out of trimmings."

When Thao’s project gained traction, the sources of fabric scraps have definitely increased with more contributions from other tailor shops.

Like Thao’s aunt, the tailor shops’ owners hope a huge amount of fabric leftovers would be given a new lease of life in a more useful manner instead of being dumped in a landfill.

Under the young woman’s skillful and creative hands, soon-to-be discarded trimmings can be transformed into beautiful items like colorful headbands, ribbons, envelopes, earrings, water bottle holders, and bags.

Learning from mistakes

Thao was not hesitant to talk about mistakes she made during her interview with Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper.

As a young entrepreneur, she occasionally found herself in troublesome situations that she had to struggle to overcome.

She had to spend one hour making one headband during the first days. That was when Thao did not know how to cut, combine, and sew the scraps together properly and beautifully.

In addition, customers did not welcome her first products due to their uncompetitive prices.

“I was turned down by so many people that I felt extremely disappointed,” recalled Thao. Some of her co-workers those days decided to leave for more stable jobs as well.

“My feelings were ambiguous and stressed at that time,” she added. Thao is determined to get out of her comfort zone to challenge herself in the business area.

Despite several obstacles in the beginning, Thao tried her best to figure out efficient ways of making headbands from fabric scraps.

It takes her just two to three minutes to complete a headband now, and she can make around 100 pieces each day.

Thao took part in a group sharing her ideas of transforming fabric leftovers into headbands. Her dedication to the idea caught the fellow community members’ attention.

Eventually, she got an offer from a stranger of one online community to bring her products to present in their store, which she considered as 'light at the end of the tunnel' then.

Thao has run into some problems while pursuing her passion and she found herself growing up after such challenges.

She becomes more careful in choosing potential partners by the time thanks to those sad experiences.

Thao failed to conduct a process of collecting and recycling second-hand clothes in February 2021 due to a shortage of staff, and she could not control the collected clothes’ quality either.

After the failure, she held many mini-workshops where participants brought their old clothes to and repurposed them into new things like headbands and ribbons by themselves.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Thao went online to sell her handmade products. She connected with some e-commerce sites specializing in selling eco-friendly goods to reach her potential customers.

The woman intends to explore more new kinds of craft materials besides fabric scraps, especially plastic waste, in creating more practical and useful items in the near future.

Promoting creativity, decreasing screening time Thao said her upcycled products’ prices are affordable to students in general. She hopes that easy access will encourage the young to choose environment-friendly products and lead a greener life. The young teacher holds some workshops on clothes for children from six to 12 years old. She teaches the children to know how to distinguish kinds of cloth and let them understand how it would become dangerous to the environment if they were thrown away irresponsibly. Thao is always willing to give financial support to projects relating to environmental protection conducted by students. As for children, she hopes that her workshops not only help them get used to recycling but also decrease children’s screen time on electronic devices. As a STEM teacher, Thao would like to encourage the kids' curiosity and creativity while they are learning how to play with trimmings. STEM teachers are educators who teach science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.
