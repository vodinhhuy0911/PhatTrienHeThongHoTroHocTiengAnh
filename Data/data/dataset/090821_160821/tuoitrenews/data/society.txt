Police in the northern Vietnamese province of Bac Giang have captured a man who allegedly stabbed to death his elderly neighbor and seriously injured the victim’s wife over a noise conflict.

A police official in Yen Dung District, Bac Giang Province confirmed to Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper on Wednesday morning that officers had arrested 53-year-old Nguyen Huu Phu.

Phu is the prime suspect in the murder of his neighbor – 74-year-old Nguyen Viet Chung.

Preliminary information showed that Phu broke into the yard of Chung’s house at 1:15 am on Monday and started shouting.

As Chung opened the door, Phu attacked him with a knife, killing the victim on the spot.

The man then headed into the house and assaulted Chung’s wife – 70-year-old Phan Thi Sau – with the same weapon.

Sau was severely injured and was later admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment.

Phu ran away after the incident and was arrested at 9:40 pm on Tuesday when he was hiding at a location about three kilometers from the murder scene.

The suspect did not resist when he was captured by officers.

At the police station, Phu admitted to committing the crime over a conflict with the victims.

Phu said he got irritated by the noise that Chung often made when he opened or closed the gate of his house.

Further investigation is ongoing.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hanoi chairman Chu Ngoc Anh on Tuesday approved a plan to carry out a massive COVID-19 testing drive until August 17 with a target to collect 1.3 million samples.

Although authorities have enforced social distancing measures since July 24, Anh said, the pandemic situation in the capital has remained complicated as the number of daily new cases averages from 60 to 80, with the sources of infection at many clusters staying unknown.

Anh requested functional forces to take advantage of all resources to conduct a large-scale COVID-19 testing program during the extended social distancing period, in combination with testing cases discovered by contact tracing, to completely isolate infections from the community.

“[We must] mobilize all resources to implement this large-scale testing plan throughout the city, ensuring the correct test assignment in areas at risk and to the right target groups, along with expanding the testing drive to representatives of households,” Anh said.

The chairman requested the units to ensure absolute safety and appropriate distance during the implementation to avoid cross infections.

The authorities will assess the risk in each area by categorizing them into three types.

The red type includes areas in very high-risk and high-risk communes and wards, high-risk cases with high mobility and high exposure such as workers in supply chains and markets and pandemic prevention workers, as well as other areas according to epidemiological expertise.

The orange type consists of factories, enterprises, production facilities, agencies, markets, supermarkets, hospitals, medical examination and treatment establishments, areas located in at-risk zones as prescribed by the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, and other areas according to epidemiological expertise.

The green type covers cases with little movement in infection-free areas.

Regarding testing representatives of households in high-risk districts, a representative sample will be taken from the most at-risk member.

At the same time, the organization of testing for COVID-19 patients, their direct contacts, arrivals and returnees from virus-hit areas, and other subjects must be carried out regularly according to regulations.

Medical forces will use both real-time RT-PCR testing and rapid test kits.

The Ministry of Health on Wednesday morning confirmed 4,802 new COVID-19 infections, including 2,128 cases in Ho Chi Minh City, taking the national tally to 232,937 patients, with 80,348 recoveries and 4,145 deaths.

Since April 27, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi have accounted for 131,879 and 2,143 infections, respectively, out of the country’s total of 228,990 cases.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the death toll of the latest COVID-19 outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City piles up, members of a special team under the city’s military feel the sorrow as they travel door to door, bringing the cremated remains of the deceased to their families.

On Sunday, a group of soldiers departed the Military Command of Ho Chi Minh City’s Binh Thanh District, heading to a funeral house in Binh Tan District on a coach to receive urns of cremated remains.

By the time they arrived at the funeral house, the urns had been carefully packaged and grouped in accordance with their respective destination districts.

They were all placed behind an altar with burning incense sticks, a way of paying homage to the dead in Vietnamese funerals.

Representing the cohort, Major Le Trung Chanh signed for the ashes, before the group loaded the 14 urns onto the coach.

In the past weeks, Ho Chi Minh City has emerged as one of the gravest COVID-19 epicenters in Vietnam, recording 3,321 out of the country’s total of 4,145 deaths.

Cremation of the deceased is being carried out at four venues in the city, including Da Phuoc Cemetery in Binh Chanh District, Phuc An Vien Cemetery in Thu Duc City, Thap Long Tho Cemetery in Cu Chi District, and Binh Hung Hoa Cemetery in Binh Tan District.

“I feel heavy-hearted every time I arrive here, seeing the ashes of my fellow Vietnamese packaged in urns,” Chanh said.

“Each table represents a district, so it feels easier seeing one with only a few boxes.

"Otherwise, it feels like I’m choked from holding back tears.”

During the rest of the journey, the boxes of ashes were placed on the back seats, being held by one soldier as he sat down on the car floor to make sure they stayed intact through bumpy roads.

As the car pulled up to the Military Command of District 10, half of the boxes were handed over to the servicemen there, who had already prepared an altar to tend to the victims’ souls before their families came to pick them up.

After being informed by authorities, Danh Tan Phat, a resident of District 10, showed up at the local military command to collect the ashes of his mother, whose COVID-19 infection was exacerbated by an underlying condition.

“I am at a loss for words at the moment," Phat spoke in tears.

"I just want to express my gratitude to local authorities for helping to bring my mom back.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnamese scientists have announced the results of their research into a kind of herbal anti-coronavirus medicine, which has been approved for use in clinical trials on patients after successful animal tests.

The outcome of the research, conducted by Dr. Le Quang Huan and his associates at the Biological Technology Institute, was announced by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology at a press conference on Tuesday.

The herbal-based research drug, named VIPDERVIR, has been created in the form of compressed tablets and is ready for production to serve COVID-19 patients, the conference was told.

VIPDERVIR’s acute toxicity and semi-permanent toxicity have been evaluated at the Central Institute of Drug Testing and Hanoi Medical University, while its inhibition of H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 pathogens has been assessed at the Institute of Biotechnology and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, respectively.

The drug has also been appraised for immunity enhancement at the Pharmacology Department of Hanoi Medical University.

Based on these evaluations, the research team has conducted trials of VIPDERVIR on rabbits and found that the drug is capable of preventing SARS-CoV-2 from sticking to host cells, making it impossible for the virus to enter the cells.

VIPDERVIR also inhibits the multiplication of the virus in host cells while activating immune cells so that they can recognize, block, and eliminate it.

The drug has been prepared, experimentally produced, and tested for stability at Vietnam Chemical Pharmaceutical Joint Stock Company.

The research results have proved that VIPDERVIR is safe and effective in impeding the development of SARS-CoV-2, as well as H5N1 virus, the Academy of Science and Technology Vietnam said.

The drug has also showed its immune-enhancing effect during the animal trials, the academy added.

Last Saturday, the health ministry’s ethics council approved a clinical study of the drug on COVID-19 patients being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

After paperwork is completed, the drug will be tested on mild and moderate COVID-19 patients, said the ministry.

The research outcome was announced in the context that Vietnam has recorded nearly 225,000 COVID-19 cases, including 3,757 deaths, since the pandemic hit the country in early 2020, the ministry reported on Tuesday morning.

In an urgent dispatch issued on Monday, chairman of the city’s administration Nguyen Thanh Phong has approved the Industry and Trade Department’s proposal to permit a number of employees of such outlets to go to work from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am the next day.

The approval was made as a step to facilitate the transport and delivery of essential goods to local residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has hit Vietnam since early 2020.

Accordingly, a certain number of employees of supermarkets and convenience stores will be entitled to come to the designated places during the 12-hour period to do their assignments, including premises disinfection, logistics preparation, and arrangement of goods for sale.

The department is required to coordinate with relevant agencies to confirm the lists of assigned workers and integrate them into the database of its information portal for purposes of management, extraction, and comparison.

Based on the department's confirmation, the retail outlets’ management will grant passes or certificates to their staff for use during travel.

Police are requested to facilitate the workers with required identifications in their travel to their workplaces, the dispatch said.

The city has imposed the outdoor travel ban since July 26, along with other restrictions under the prime minister’s Directive No. 16, as an additional measure to better contain the coronavirus spread, which has recently caused thousands of infections per day.

Directive No. 16, applied in the city since July 9, includes the closure of non-essential businesses and services, a stay-home order, a ban on gatherings larger than two people, a minimum two-meter distance between people, and the suspension of public transport.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police in the northern Vietnamese province of Bac Ninh have broken up a ring that provided fake COVID-19 test results, with nine suspects arrested.

The provincial Department of Public Security confirmed on Tuesday morning that the nine suspects are being probed for forging seals and documents of agencies and organizations, as well as using fake seals and documents of agencies and organizations.

The leader of the illicit racket is Phan Dinh Hai, 25, residing in Ngoc Xa Commune, Que Vo District.

Being a long-haul truck driver, Hai is required to test negative for the novel coronavirus to pass local COVID-19 checkpoints in accordance with regulations.

He came up with a way to fake these negative test results and forged the seal of Bac Ninh-based Hoan My International Hospital.

Hai first used the bogus test results for his own travel and later sold them to his peers.

One of his buyers, 34-year-old Nguyen Ba Tu, also resold the documents to other long-haul truckers at higher prices for profit.

Tu admitted to buying the rapid test results from Hai at VND180,000 (US$8) each and real-time RT-PCR test results at VND500,000 ($22) each.

The rapid and RT-PCR test results were then resold at VND200,000 ($9) and VND600,000-650,000 ($26-28), respectively.

Multiple truck drivers bought the fake documents from Hai and Tu to pass COVID-19 checkpoints.

After the tests expired, they submitted them to their employers for a refund of the testing fee.

Officers said they had confiscated a computer set, a round seal of Hoan My International Hospital, and other related exhibits.

Forging and using fake COVID-19 test results are serious violations, police stressed, adding that the actions may cause the virus to further spread to the community and undermine pandemic prevention and control efforts in the province and country in general.

Bac Ninh has so far recorded 1,724 local infections since the fourth COVID-19 hit Vietnam on April 27.

The Ministry of Health has set the prices for rapid COVID-19 testing at VND238,000 ($10.3) and real-time RT-PCR testing at VND734,000 ($32).

It is expected that the number of samples taken from the high-risk areas, including outbreak clusters and those with a high population density, will be 186,000 while 114,000 samples will be collected from the high-risk groups, such as transportation service workers, retailers, drivers, workers in industrial parks, and public sanitation workers.

Dao Huu Than, head of the Department of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control at the Hanoi Center for Disease Control (HCDC), told a meeting on Sunday that the pandemic situation in the capital has remained complicated as the number of cases has increased in recent days, with many of them coming from unknown sources.

Of 1,369 patients documented in the last three weeks, 634 cases were detected during community test programs, accounting for 46 percent.

These cases mostly belonged to outbreak clusters in Tho Am Village in Thanh Tri District, Hoa Voi residential area in Quoc Oai District, and Phung Market in Thach That District.

Khong Minh Tuan, deputy director of the HCDC, emphasized that the city’s health authorities must take advantage of the 15 days under the extended social distancing phase to isolate infection cases from the community.

Deputy director of the Hanoi Department of Health Vu Cao Cuong assigned the HCDC and district-level authorities to assess the risk in each area by categorizing them into three types -- red zones or areas at the highest risk, yellow zones or areas at high risk, and other areas or at-risk areas.

Relevant units are requested to conduct COVID-19 sampling and tests swiftly and return testing results within 24 hours.

The organization of taking samples for COVID-19 testing will be carried out by the local medical forces and assisted by nearly 1,000 students of the Hanoi Medical College.

“We need to take advantage of every minute, by all means, to make the most of the golden period of social distancing to control the pandemic and bring the city back to the new normal state,” Cuong said.

Vietnam reported on Tuesday morning 5,149 new cases of COVID-19, including 2,490 infections in Ho Chi Minh City, increasing the country’s tally to 224,894 with 75,920 recoveries, according to the Ministry of Health.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hanoi authorities have prepared a scenario in which treatment is needed for 8,000 moderate, severe, and critical patients among 40,000 people infected with the novel coronavirus in the Vietnamese capital city.

The scenario was outlined in a decision issued on Sunday by chairman of the Hanoi administration Chu Ngoc Anh, the commander of the city’s COVID-19 fight, amid the complicated developments of the pandemic, which has recently caused 60 to 80 infections per day in the city.

According to the anticipated treatment plan, 8,000 beds, along with medical equipment and supplies, food, and other necessities, will have to be made available for serving moderate to critical patients.

At the same time, necessary measures should be taken to ensure safety for all health workers engaging in the treatment and care of COVID-19 patients.

This scenario is divided into three phases, including the first requiring 2,000 beds in the event of 10,000 infections, and the second and third needing 4,000 and 8,000 beds for 20,000 and 40,000 cases, respectively.

The municipal health authorities on Monday morning announced nine new coronavirus infections, including eight in quarantine facilities and one in the community.

Since late April, when the pandemic’s fourth wave kicked off in Vietnam, the city has registered 1,792 patients, of which 1,075 were detected in the community and the rest from the isolated areas.

Nationwide, 215,560 infections, including 213,200 domestic and 2,360 imported cases, have been recorded since early 2020, when the pandemic hit the country, the Ministry of Health reported on Monday morning.

Among the total patients, 71,497 have recovered and 3,397, including 26 in Hanoi, have passed away.

During the fourth epidemic wave, 211,630 domestic cases, or 99.2 percent of the tally, have been documented across the country, the ministry said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Leaders of Binh Duong Province in southern Vietnam on Sunday sent a request to the Ministry of Health asking for COVID-19 vaccines as many of its wards had to cancel vaccinations due to a serious shortage of doses.

In the request, Binh Duong chairman Vo Van Minh said it is anticipated that local authorities will have to vaccinate over two million residents out of a 2.6 million-strong population this month and in September to ensure a sufficient number of active workers.

Vaccinations are crucial in the cities of Di An, Thuan An, and Thu Dau Mot and Tan Uyen Town, which form an important economic zone in the south of the province and areas adjacent to Ho Chi Minh City, especially when they have recorded high rates of infections, Minh emphasized.

Binh Duong has become the second leader in terms of infections, only after Ho Chi Minh City.

However, when the inoculation progress has just been sped up with a target of 100,000 doses administered per day, several communes and wards in Binh Duong had to cancel their vaccination schedules due to a dearth of vaccines.

The health ministry has allocated the province 544,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses, which is insufficient to immunize workers at nearly 30 local industrial parks, not to mention the whole citizenry.

In comparison, other localities with fewer infections have received more vaccines than Binh Duong.

The provincial People’s Committee thus underscored in the request that more vaccines are urgently needed for workers in the province.

Vietnam has given more than 9.4 million doses to its people, with over 945,800 citizens fully inoculated.

The respective numbers in Binh Duong are over 131,700 and 11,000.

The Ministry of Health reported 5,140 new domestic COVID-19 infections, including 2,349 cases in Ho Chi Minh City and 1,725 others in Binh Duong, on Monday morning, raising the national tally to 215,560 patients, with 71,497 recoveries and 3,397 deaths.

Since the dreadful bout hit the country on April 27, Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong have accounted for 124,153 and 29,364 infections, respectively, out of the national caseload of 211,630 cases.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The ITU Virtual Digital World 2020, an event co-organized by Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), kicked off on Tuesday evening.

Themed ‘Building A Digital World. Together,’ the three-day online event brings together more than 50 ITU member countries.

The technological foundation used during the event was developed by Vietnam's military-run Viettel telecom group.

In his opening remarks, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said the Vietnamese government has paid attention to telecommunication infrastructure development and considered IT one of the top priorities.

Digital transformation has been regarded as a crucial solution for helping the country develop more rapidly and sustainably, Dam added.

The deputy PM reiterated the Vietnamese government’s commitments to supporting and coordinating with the ITU and its member countries in building a digital world for peace, cooperation, and prosperity.

Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said Vietnam’s digital infrastructure is now ready for a digital-based economy and society.

Vietnamese technologies not only deal with domestic but also global issues, the minister said, adding that the country is striving to make technology a driver of development and global cooperation.

ITU Secretary General Houlin Zhao said Vietnam is an important partner in many markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean region, which has made the nation become a bright example in IT development to many other developing countries.

ITU is a United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies.

The first ITU telecom event was held in 1971. Since its 40th anniversary in 2011, the event has been held on an annual basis in a different location worldwide.

The 2020 edition is named ITU Digital World and takes place online from October 20 to 22.

The ITU Digital World 2021 will be back in its usual form in Hanoi in October next year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A golf tournament aimed at supporting Vietnamese start-ups first organized by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper last year is set to return for the second edition this September.

‘Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020’ is meant to support start-ups in the beginning period of their business by helping to connect young entrepreneurs with seasoned and successful business people.

During the tourney, which will be launched on September 18, the organizers will also present awards to the most excellent entrepreneurs of the start-up community.

Excited to participate

Many entrepreneurs, who are experienced golfers, are excited to take part in this year's competition. In their opinion, the tournament will give them a chance to both play golf and help the upcoming generation of business people.

“I appreciate Tuoi Tre for holding such a golf competition to promote start-ups and help experienced entrepreneurs have another approach to supporting them,” said Le Hai Binh, founder and chairman of the IT services company Mat Bao Group, who is also a golfer taking part in the tournament.

“The competition will provide young entrepreneurs with opportunities to meet with their potential investors among the golfers who participate in the tournament."

The competitors interviewed by Tuoi Tre applauded the paper's idea to create ‘a playground’ for start-up owners.

Meeting with other entrepreneurs on the golf course is certain to bring a different vibe than traditional environments like offices or working space, and may help generate stronger bonds between the participants, they said.

Overcoming COVID-19

Start-ups have been hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020 was also rescheduled to begin in September instead of April, when it was held last year, because of the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of the global health crisis, many entrepreneurs consider the tournament an occasion for them to support young entrepreneurs in getting over the adversities of the pandemic, especially since it is currently under control in Vietnam.

“The current situation is different from last year’s. The pandemic has presented start-ups with difficulty in accessing funds as almost all companies are impacted by the coronavirus,” Binh remarked.

“Of course [potential investors] must fight for the survival of their own companies first before considering investing in others."

According to Binh, in 'the new normal,' customers are likely to spend less so start-ups in the fields of services, travel, and food would be considerably impacted.

“Despite that, I am not quite pessimistic because there are always opportunities in challenging situations,” Binh said.

The chairman of Mat Bao Group believes that during the pandemic, entrepreneurs who can flexibly adapt to the new situation will emerge victorious and even achieve new breakthroughs.

“Tuoi Tre’s golf tournament for start-ups will offer them the opportunity to do so,” Binh said.

Lawyer Nguyen Thi Thanh Nha, legal director of the investment firm Openasia Group, said her experience as a shareholder in a few start-ups when she was younger helps her understand the advantages that start-ups have, such as youth, ambition, and knowledge.

But she also acknowledges the rigors they must face on the way to success such as networking, calling for suitable investors, and developing relationships with other start-ups.

“Participating in the [golf tournament] will help them partly solve these problems and build more new business relationships,” said Nha, who has played golf for 12 years.

“Business opportunities may come to them unexpectedly during this tournament, who knows?”

Honoring 25 excellent start-ups

With the aim of promoting and empowering the start-up community both in Ho Chi Minh City and the rest of Vietnam, Tuoi Tre and partners jointly present the Golf Tournament for Start-up 2020.

The tourney will also mark the 75th anniversary of Vietnam’s National Day (September 2), the 89th founding anniversary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union (March 26), and the 45th anniversary of the founding of Tuoi Tre (September 2).

Dozens of inspiring start-up stories have been published in Tuoi Tre in various formats since July in the lead-up to the tournament.

The opening gala is scheduled to take place on September 18 at the Long Thanh Golf Club in Dong Nai Province, 35 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For students from poor families, education is the best way to help themselves and their families get out of their plight and lift their communities out of poverty. Ironically, after all the effort of studying in difficulty throughout 12 years from elementary to high school, these students even with high academic records to enter college are unable to live their dreams because of their family’s financial situations. They simply cannot afford tuition fees and other expenses of higher education.

The “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” scholarship program of Tuoi Tre Newspaper has made great strides in helping these poor students. This program gave the first scholarship in Quang Tri Province in 2003. It has gradually spread to other provinces and now it covers the whole country.

Over 17 years, this scholarship program has helped more than 19,000 new college students who otherwise would not be able to afford higher education. Last year, there were more than 1,200 new college students from all over the country receiving scholarships.

Each poor student is given a standard scholarship of VND10 million (US$430). Very poor students are granted special scholarships worth VND15 million (US$645) each.

This year due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be more poor new college students in need of help, although the donation could be less than last year.

We would like to appeal for new and current donors to “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” so that at least 1,000 poor students around the country, among them 80 from Thua Thien-Hue Province, could receive scholarships this academic year.

Please send your donation to Bao Tuoi Tre, bank account: 113000006100 (for VND) at VietinBank, Branch 3, HCM City; or bank account: 0071370195845 (for USD) or 0071140373054 (for EUR) at Vietcombank, HCM City Branch, Swift Code: BFTVVNVX007; for “Give a Helping Hand to Needy New College Students” Scholarship Program.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A charity initiative administered 700 care packages on the weekend to workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Binh Tan District, as well as Lao and Cambodian students in the Pre-University College of Ho Chi Minh City.

The initiative was undertaken by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, supermarket chain Saigon Co.op, and e-commerce platform Shopee, with support from the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.

The organizers prepared essentials, including rice, cooking oil, and fish sauce, and divided them into thousands of gift packages, each of which was priced at VND145,000 (US$6.3) on Shopee.

The packages were delivered on Saturday directly to the beneficiaries, including 500 workers who are struggling financially in Binh Tan District, 200 Lao and Cambodian students and those of Vietnam's ethnic minorities at the Pre-University College in District 5.

Among the recipients was Tran Ngoc Sang, a manufacturing worker in Binh Tan District who hails from Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta.

“I feel blessed to receive these essential items, which will help ease the burden on my family during social distancing,” said the sole breadwinner for the family of seven.

Other demographics, including youths in locked-down areas of Hoc Mon District, as well as unofficial workers in Cat Lai Ward of Thu Duc City, also received the care packages of the initiative.

After the first run on Saturday and Sunday, the organizers plan to hand another 2,500 packages to struggling people in cordoned-off areas in Ho Chi Minh City on July 22 and 25.

They are currently accepting donations on Shopee and ShopeePay.

In June and early July, many working-class residents in Ho Chi Minh City suffered from lay-offs or reduced income as the southern metropolis emerged as Vietnam’s coronavirus epicenter, with its caseload rising in the thousands daily.

The alarming situation has prompted authorities to put the city under a tightened social distancing mandate that forbids public gatherings of over two, bans non-essential businesses and services, and requires people to stay home, effectively cutting off the livelihoods of many unofficial workers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In his ongoing sketch project, Ho Chi Minh City-based artist Le Sa Long strives to portray the small acts of generosity among residents, a virtue that has once again been highlighted during the tough time of social distancing in the southern city.

An established painter in the domestic art scene who has multiple solo exhibitions and awards under his belt, Long picked up urban sketching as a habit in mid-May.

He wandered the city which he has called home for over 30 years for live sketches for a few weeks, until it began to be put under social distancing measures on May 31 and later a citywide ban on non-essential travels on June 15.

Cooped up at home under this hibernation phase, Long decided to create a new series of sketches inspired by heartwarming photos of Saigonese that he spotted on social media and in newspapers.

He has so far portrayed 40 vignettes on paper and is planning to create more.

“These images of Saigonese residents helping each other out during hard times touched my soul," he said.

"I was inspired to translate these moments and put them under a new light through the language of art.”

A standout in his collection is the vignette of a five-year-old wearing PPE overalls, standing by herself, waving goodbye to the camera before boarding an ambulance to enter quarantine.

Another sketch pays tribute to pop singer Ha Anh Tuan, who donated 25 metric tons of rice to help the struggling citizens.

Other optimistic news stories, including no-cost grocery stores for the needy, community fridges, and charity efforts benefiting pandemic-struck people, are also portrayed.

The sketches have earned Long showers of praises after they were posted on his social media account.

Many individuals have even asked to buy his pieces online, despite not having seen them in person, Long revealed.

He plans to auction several slice-of-life works to raise funds for charity causes for underprivileged people in the city, while portrait pieces of Ha Anh Tuan or frontline doctors will be gifted to the respective subjects as a tribute.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam’s NanoDragon satellite was transported to Japan on Wednesday night ahead of its planned launch into outer space.

The NanoDragon satellite (NDG), a nano-layer cubesat satellite which weighs about four kilograms and is the size of three rack units (U), was developed by the Vietnam National Space Center (VNSC) under the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology.

NanoDragon is expected to be launched into orbit in September, marking the tenth anniversary of the VNSC.

The satellite is the product of a project to create a nano-scale satellite under the national space technology program during the 2016-20 period.

The process of researching, designing, integrating, and testing the satellite's functions was undertaken completely in Vietnam by VNSC researchers.

In addition, the whole mechanical structure and source distribution circuit for the satellite were produced in the Southeast Asian country.

The NDG completed an environmental testing phase which simulated the launch and space environments at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan from March 9 to April 9, according to Assoc. Prof. Dr. Pham Anh Tuan, director of the VNSC.

A ground station to operate the satellite after launch was designed and constructed at the VNSC headquarters at Hoa Lac Hi-Tech Park in Hanoi.

NanoDragon will have two main tasks, namely the monitoring of marine vehicles with an automatic identification system and the use of an optical imaging device to verify the quality of the satellite's position controller when operating in orbit.

The NDG is expected to operate in a solar synchronous orbit at an altitude of about 560 kilometers, according to the VNSC.

Before NanoDragon, the VNSC also successfully built the PicoDragon supermicro satellite, which weighs one kilogram and was launched into orbit and obtained signals in 2013.

After that, the 50-kilogram MicroDragon satellite, which was manufactured by a group of 36 staff members of the VNSC under the guidance of Japanese experts, was launched into orbit in January 2019 and sent photos to the ground station in Japan.

A Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper source at the provincial Department of Public Security confirmed on Wednesday that the deceased officer was Le Huynh Nhat Minh, deputy chief of the police unit in Phuoc Thanh Commune, Go Dau District.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nguyen Phuoc Quy Thanh, a resident in Tan Phu District, Ho Chi Minh City, is hoping his art will give the city the boost it needs to overcome the fourth wave of COVID-19.

Thanh specializes in making artworks from used buttons and painting vivid images on medical face masks as a way of heightening COVID-19 awareness in the community.

Thanh’s work is not just about battling COVID-19.

The 28-year-old chemical engineering student uses buttons as a medium to highlight the dangers of plastic waste.

Each of Thanh’s posters goes through a series of stages before being released to the public.

First, he brainstorms what ideas and messages he wants to share.

Next, he sketches the poster, chooses suitable plastic buttons and beads, and harmonizes colors.

Lastly, he frames the poster.

While some of his smaller works take two to three hours, larger pieces can take as long as four to five days.

“I try to share useful messages with people amid the COVID-19 pandemic so that I can remind them to be more careful,” explained Thanh.

“I gave some of my works to frontline medical workers as a way of showing my gratitude to them.

"I hope that all of us can stand with each other in the fight against the virus so we can put the pandemic under control and return to normal life."

Ho Chi Minh City has recorded over 137,000 local infections in this fourth wave, which broke out in Vietnam on April 27.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police in the north-central Vietnamese province of Nghe An have arrested two residents after they were caught illegally raising 17 tigers inside their houses last week.

The provincial People’s Procuracy confirmed on Wednesday it had approved the decision to arrest and initiate legal proceedings against Nguyen Van Hien, 39, for violating regulations on the protection of endangered, precious, and rare animals.

Hien was discovered raising 14 tigers, each weighing nearly 200 kilograms, at his home in Do Thanh Commune, Yen Thanh District, on Wednesday last week.

Police in Yen Thanh District have also taken into custody 50-year-old Nguyen Thi Dinh, who was caught raising three adult tigers at her house on the same day, to assist their investigation.

The two claimed they had bought the wild animals from Laos when they were cubs.

Hien turned an 80-square-meter section of his house into a tiger farm, while Dinh built a 120-square-meter basement to raise the big cats and avoid being detected by authorities or neighbors.

This is the largest number of endangered animals that have been found being illicitly raised in Nghe An, Colonel Nguyen Duc Hai, deputy director of the provincial Department of Public Security, said during a press meeting on Monday.

Keeping endangered animals in captivity as well as hunting and slaughtering them are punishable by up to 15 years in prison, Hai quoted the Penal Code as saying.

The police official stated that the 17 tigers were anesthetized and taken to Muong Thanh Dien Lam ecological area for care and investigation.

However, eight of them later died of unknown reasons, he continued, adding that competent authorities have been working to identify the causes.

According to Nghe An Forest Protection Department, only two establishments are licensed to raise tigers in the province, thus it is illegal for local residents to keep the wild animals in captivity.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Authorities should inform people about the type of vaccine they will get before their travel to the inoculation sites, Nguyen Van Nen, secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee, said after an inspection at a COVID-19 vaccination venue in Hoc Mon District on Friday afternoon.

Friday was the last vaccination day in the district’s Hoc Mon Town, according to Nguyen Le Trong Tam, the town’s chairman.

“Today’s vaccine is Vero Cell, which is warmly received by many people,” Tam reported to the Party chief at a vaccination site set up at Nguyen An Khuong Middle School.

Only 300 cases under medical isolation are expected to be inoculated later at their homes.

Nen talked with some vaccine recipients being monitored post vaccination at the venue.

He asked the people whether they knew the brand of the vaccine doses they received and if doctors had given them clear consultancy before administering shots, to which many replied with an affirmative answer.

“I have researched a lot of information and waited until today to get vaccinated,” said Huynh Phu Noa, a 54-year-old local man, claiming that authorities had informed him that the designated vaccine is Vero Cell in advance.

“It’s good to get a COVID-19 vaccine shot, regardless of brands,” Noa added.

After the inspection, Nen mentioned the incident occurring at an immunization venue in District 1 on Friday morning, when some people expressed their disappointment to receive Vero Cell vaccine jabs.

Functional forces at the aforementioned venue followed the existing vaccination procedure, in which people only know the type of vaccine they will be injected with after undergoing all screening steps at the inoculation facilities.

“We should draw experience [from the case in District 1] and inform people about the type of vaccine in advance, so only those who accept the vaccine will travel to get the shots,” Nen advised.

“We don’t have choices at the moment,” the Ho Chi Minh Party chief added as he said about Vietnam’s COVID-19 vaccine sourcing.

“We have tried to access a lot of sources, but the supply is extremely limited.

“I assert that it’s not the case that we have options to choose and buy preferred vaccines but we don’t buy them.

“According to WHO, the best vaccine is the one that comes first.”

The batch of Vero Cell vaccine that Ho Chi Minh City is possessing is sponsored by Saigon Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. and has been carefully inspected by the Ministry of Health, according to Nen.

The municipal authorities rejected the borrowing proposals of many localities to prioritize the use of this vaccine for people in the city, he explained.

“Our goal is to get through this difficult time in a month, and our key to success is vaccination,” the leader said.

“In the current vaccine scarcity, the support and cooperation from the people plays a decisive role,” he affirmed.

Currently, about 4.3 million people in Ho Chi Minh City have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to Duong Anh Duc, deputy chairman of the municipal People’s Committee.

“The city sets a target of at least seven million people getting vaccinated, and many more later,” Duc said.

“When we reach that coverage, we will achieve herd immunity.

“And once herd immunity is achieved, many activities can return to normal like before.”

Nationwide, over 14 million vaccine shots have been administered in Vietnam since the country rolled out vaccination on March 8, with some 1.2 million people having been fully vaccinated.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Medical staff at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi on Friday successfully performed the caesarean deliveries of two babies whose mothers have been sickened by COVID-19.

Both of the mothers hail from north-central Ha Tinh Province.

The first mother, 28, was transferred from Ha Tinh to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases with respiratory failure and her baby in breech position on Thursday evening at the 38th week of pregnancy.

On Friday morning, the woman was prescribed a caesarean section.

The surgery was a success, with a baby boy weighing 3.3 kilograms being safely taken out of the mother’s abdomen.

The boy was in stable health and was cared for by two nurses in the pediatric department.

After the surgery, the mother was transferred to the emergency department for further treatment.

The second case is a 25-year-old woman, who was admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases on August 8 at the 36th week of pregnancy and diagnosed with severe pneumonia due to COVID-19.

The woman developed extreme respiratory failure and needed the use of intubation and mechanical ventilation on Tuesday.

As her fetus developed heart failure signs, doctors ordered a caesarean section for her.

As the newborn, weighing 2.7 kilograms, showed signs of asphyxia, a condition of deficient supply of oxygen to the body that arises from abnormal breathing, after birth, he was promptly resuscitated by doctors.

The boy is being monitored at the Vietnam National Children’s Hospital.

The mother was transferred to the emergency department for further treatment.

The mother and the child are currently in a stable condition.

The two cases marked the seventh and eighth babies born to coronavirus patients at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An aid package of 13 metric tons of medical supplies worth over US$5.3 million from the Swiss government arrived in Ho Chi Minh City on Friday.

The relief shipment, sent by the Swiss Humanitarian Aid which is part of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, included 30 ventilators, 500,000 antigen test kits, and 300,000 antibacterial masks.

A cargo plane transporting the supplies departed from Zurich for Ho Chi Minh City, which is currently Vietnam’s biggest coronavirus hotspot with 140,539 infections recorded in the on-going fourth wave.

The donation was earlier announced during the visit to Vietnam by Swiss Vice President and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis from August 4 to 6.

During the visit, the Swiss Vice President shared the difficulties that Vietnam is facing.

He agreed that the two countries should continue to share experience in COVID-19 prevention and control while pursuing economic recovery and strengthening bilateral health cooperation, particularly the transfer of production technology for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.

The medical supplies were transported to Cho Ray Hospital for storage after arriving at Tan Son Nhat International Airport.

They are expected to be distributed to pandemic prevention units later.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A court in south-central Vietnam has sentenced a local man to nine months in prison for his non-compliance with COVID-19 prevention regulations and insulting law enforcement officers, just four days after his offence.

The People’s Court of Tay Hoa District, Phu Yen Province, on Thursday gave the nine-month jail term to Phan Van Thong, 51, for his resisting on-duty law enforcement officers, under Vietnam’s Penal Code.

Earlier on August 9 morning, an inspection team of the district’s Hoa Dong Commune caught Thong and his wife violating the COVID-19 social distancing rules under the Prime Minister’s Directive 16 by selling meat and vegetables at home.

The team asked them to stop their business, but they did not follow, claiming that the team was causing difficulty to their family.

Thong even cursed and insulted the team’s members with vulgar words, chased the law enforcement officers out of his house yard, and prevented them from making a report on his violation.

Despite the fact that Dinh Ngoc Sum, the team’s head and the deputy chairman of the commune, remained in the yard, Thong then locked the house gate.

Thong insisted not to open the gate despite requests from the other members of the team.

Police were called to the scene and they forced Thong to open the gate and detained him.

At court, Thong admitted his crime and showed a repentant attitude.

Considering Thong committed the offence for the first time, the court decided to award him nine months imprisonment.

It was thanks to the shortening of court proceedings by local law agencies that the case was brought to trial only four days after Thong’s offence.

Two similar cases occurred in the province in late July with three men sentenced on the same charge as Thong.

In one case, 28-year-old Tran Minh Luan got 12 months in prison, while Pham Van Hieu, 34, and Nguyen Tan Thach, 29, received a nine-month jail term each in the other.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After a city leader alluded to citywide movement restrictions to prevent the coronavirus spread in the next few days, residents of Da Nang in central Vietnam on Thursday poured into local wet markets and supermarkets to stock up on groceries.

Da Nang recorded 1,473 coronavirus cases with 13 deaths from July 10 to August 11, said Nguyen Van Quang, secretary of the municipal Party Committee, during a meeting of the People’s Council on Thursday.

Local authorities are mulling more stringent epidemic prevention measures on top of the existing curbs, such as banning people from going to the beach and restricting outdoor travels to essential duties only.

“The People’s Council has settled on a plan to introduce more rigid measures in the ‘stay where you are’ tenet if the situation does not improve over the next four days,” Quang said.

More specifically, city residents will be required to stay home, while factories and construction sites must prepare to let their workers stay on the spot for seven days, he elaborated.

A citywide screening for COVID-19 to pull infections out of the community is also planned.

Following the statement, many Da Nang dwellers flocked to local supermarkets and wet markets to accumulate groceries to prepare for the imminent movement curb.

Many sellers in traditional markets compared Thursday’s footfall to that of the Lunar New Year holiday, the peak season for grocery selling in Vietnam, with the most sought-after items being meat, fish, and veggies.

Tran Thi Chin, a veggie peddler at Dong Da Market in Da Nang, said her stall had sold out early since the demand was upped a few times compared to normal.

Customers could be seen crowding the remaining stalls, vying for the fresh groceries without giving heed to safe distancing.

Likewise, the majority of meat and fish stalls in the market were out of stock early after the demand shot up around 9:00 am.

Hurrying customers, one of them being Le Thi Ngoc Phuong from Dong Da Street of Hai Chau District, could be seen making the way through the crowd with big bags of fresh items.

According to Phuong, she and many other residents had dashed to the grocery stalls as soon as the city leaders discussed the possible elevated movement curb on TV.

A crowd also gathered at Big C Da Nang Supermarket, where the most in-demand items were reported to be groceries, canned foods, and dried foodstuffs.

Refuting rumor of dried-up stocks, the supermarket assured that their supply of veggies, meat, fish, frozen foods, dairy products, dried foods, and instant noodles remains sufficient.

Safety measures such as mandatory distancing and medical declaration are imposed upon all customers, while their staffers are provided with gloves, face masks, and the lines at their check-out counters are marked with tape to remind customers not to cluster up while they wait to pay.

The epicenter of the second coronavirus outbreak in July and August last year, Da Nang has recorded 1,801 local COVID-19 cases since the fourth wave hit Vietnam in late April.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam's business hub Ho Chi Minh City will extend its coronavirus restrictions to the end of August, state media reported on Friday, as new infections and deaths rise further in the epicentre of the country's worst outbreak yet.

"We have to prepare for a prolonged battle," Phan Van Mai, standing deputy secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee, was quoted as saying by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper.

After successfully containing the virus up until late April, Vietnam has seen infections rise rapidly and has introduced movement restrictions across about a third of the country to try to curtail the spread.

It comes at a time when vaccines are in short supply and only about one percent of the population has been fully inoculated, including 130,000 people in Ho Chi Minh City, which accounts for half of Vietnam's cases and by far the majority of its more than 4,800 deaths.

Of most concern is the high mortality rate, which city authorities said was an average 241 deaths per day.

By comparison, Vietnam's overall coronavirus fatalities one month ago were just 138.

Authorities have called for faster vaccinations, with about one million doses now being administered nationwide each day.

A fifth of those are in Ho Chi Minh City, where about two-thirds of its nine million residents have received a first dose.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City have fined a 31-year-old local man VND7.5 million (US$330) for operating an illegal service transporting people from the city to other localities under the cover of charitable trips.

Ho Le Tan Phat, a resident of District 1, was charged with “driving a vehicle against infectious disease prevention and control regulations” on Thursday.

A task force of District 1 police noticed suspicious signs from a seven-seater car traveling from Nguyen Thi Minh Khai - Cong Quynh Intersection to Ly Thai To Roundabout at 4:00 pm on Tuesday.

The car was marked with a poster that reads ‘Man Tu VeGan charitable kitchen - Vehicle for pandemic prevention support.’

As police officers stopped the car, they discovered that driver Ho Le Tan Phat failed to apply COVID-19 prevention measures in the vehicle.

In addition, five passengers in Phat’s car were unable to present relevant papers and reasons for their outdoor travel upon the functional force’s request.

The task force thus took them to the local police station for further clarification.

At the station, Phat confessed that he charged each of the five passengers at least VND5 million ($219) to transport them to their hometowns.

The longer the distance from Ho Chi Minh City to their hometowns, the more money Phat asked them to pay.

Ho Le Tan Phat’s car is marked with a poster that reads ‘Man Tu VeGan charitable kitchen - Vehicle for pandemic prevention support.’

He advertised his illegal service on Facebook.

The driver used the charitable kitchen poster to deceive functional forces and pass COVID-19 checkpoints.

Following the case, District 1 police have advised people against using such illegal service and returning to their hometowns without local authorities’ permission.

Internal migrants wishing to travel back to their hometowns should contact authorities in the areas where they are residing for support.

Ho Chi Minh City authorities began implementing escalated social distancing regulations in line with the prime minister’s Directive No. 16 from July 22, in an effort to curb the fourth wave of coronavirus infections, which emerged in late April and has infected 137,008 city dwellers so far.

People are requested not to leave their houses unnecessarily while all non-essential businesses as well as public transport, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing vehicles, are suspended.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ho Chi Minh City authorities are considering calling on recovered COVID-19 patients to participate in pandemic control efforts, according to a document signed by city chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong.

Phong has requested the city’s Department of Health to give advice to the municipal steering committee for COVID-19 prevention and control regarding the plan, particularly on tasks to be assigned to the recovered patients and their benefits.

In the document, the chairman also asked the department to collaborate with a unit of the Ministry of Health in the city to review the operations of COVID-19 treatment establishments so as to provide suitable consultancy for the committee in terms of resource coordination, procedures for patient transfer and treatment, and medical guidelines.

The department was also ordered to regularly update the patient admission capacity of each treatment establishment.

Huynh Thanh Nhan, director of the municipal Department of Home Affairs, previously said that the city needs over 12,000 more health workers, including 2,800 doctors, 8,200 nurses, and 1,000 volunteering medical lecturers and students, to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The city’s manpower coordination team for COVID-19 prevention and control, which is led by Nhan, proposed the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of National Defense, and the government’s special working group mobilize medical forces from other localities, especially doctors and nurses capable of performing resuscitation, to assist in treatment efforts.

Vietnam had documented 246,568 COVID-19 cases as of Thursday evening, with 89,145 recoveries and 4,813 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health.

The country has recorded 242,603 local infections in 62 provinces and cities since the fourth transmission wave began on April 27.

Ho Chi Minh City is the hardest-hit locality with 137,008 cases.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has urged competent authorities to exert more efforts so that the country can start producing its own COVID-19 vaccines in September.

The premier on Thursday convened a meeting with scientists, businesses, and institutions participating in the production and research of made-in-Vietnam COVID-19 vaccines.

Apart from purchasing and importing vaccines, Vietnam is stepping up the transfer of vaccine production technology, as well as the research and production of homemade jabs in an effort to secure as many doses as possible for the people, PM Chinh stated.

The Ministry of Health reported at the meeting that two homegrown COVID-19 vaccines, namely Nano Covax developed by Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC and COVIVAC by the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals, had already entered clinical trials.

Vietnam has also received vaccine production technology from the United States, Japan, and Russia.

PM Chinh stressed that the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and relevant ministries must do their utmost to facilitate vaccine research, technology transfer, and production, particularly in terms of administrative procedures.

He also ordered the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, the Hanoi Medical University, the Military Medical Academy, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, and the Pasteur Institute to assist in the effort.

The premier tasked the health ministry with establishing a special working group on COVID-19 vaccines, as well as issuing a circular on circulation permits for domestic COVID-19 medicine and vaccines.

“We must exert even more efforts so that Vietnam can have its own COVID-19 vaccines,” PM Chinh stressed.

“If things go smoothly, Vietnam may be able to start the production of COVID-19 vaccines from September.”

The Southeast Asian country has so far received about 19 million doses through purchase, the COVAX Facility, and donations from other countries.

The health ministry has approved six COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, namely AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinopharm, and Johnson & Johnson.

More than 12 million doses have been administered since inoculation was rolled out on March 8, with over one million people fully vaccinated.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two shipments totaling over one million AstraZeneca vaccine jabs will be delivered contractually to Vietnam on Friday, while the country expects to receive more than 12 million vaccine doses from different sources from now through September, local sources said.

These shipments will be delivered under a 30-million dose contract between Vietnam Vaccine Joint Stock Company (VNVC) and the vaccine’s developer, British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, a source told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper on Friday.

Before the upcoming deliveries, nearly 4.4 million doses of AstraZeneca have been sent to Vietnam on several occasions under this contract, VNVC reported.

At a meeting on Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said the country will receive more than 12 million doses of vaccines from different sources from now through September.

This vaccine volume is expected to include 10 million doses developed by AstraZeneca and the remainder by Pfizer-BioNTech.

Out of the vaccine supply, 670,000 doses will be delivered to Vietnam by the end of this month or in early September as a donation from the French government through the COVAX Facility, the Ministry of Health reported.

In addition, the Hungarian government will also gift Vietnam 100,000 vaccine doses and 100,000 rapid test kits.

Last week, at a meeting with the research team that is working on the Nano Covax COVID-19 vaccine, which is being developed domestically by Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC, the ministry assessed that the vaccine is safe and produces good immunity response.

Regarding the vaccine, which officially entered the third phase of clinical trials on June 11, State President Nguyen Xuan Phuc on July 29 asked health authorities to promptly authorize it to make the first Vietnamese vaccine available soon to drive back the coronavirus spread.

Vietnam has targeted to secure 150 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to inoculate two-thirds of its 98 million-strong population to reach herd immunity as soon as possible amid surging infections in many localities across the country.

However, the Southeast Asian nation has obtained only over 19 million jabs from the COVAX Facility, contractual purchases, and donations, local sources said on Wednesday.

As of Friday morning, more than 13.36 million vaccine doses have been administered nationwide, according to the National COVID-19 Vaccination Portal.

Vietnam has documented 246,568 COVID-19 cases, including 244,173 domestic and 2,395 imported infections, since early 2020, when the pandemic kicked off in the country, the ministry reported on Thursday evening.

Out of the tally, 89,145 have recovered and 4,813 died.

Since the pandemic’s fourth outbreak erupted in the country in late April, 242,063 infections, or 99.13 percent of the caseload, have been recorded.

Currently, the country’s largest COVID-19 epicenter is Ho Chi Minh City, which detects thousands of cases per day.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Authorities in the southern Vietnamese province of Kien Giang have facilitated the return of six French students stranded on Phu Quoc Island by expediting their repatriation process and enabling their passage through various COVID-19 checkpoints.

Pham Van Nghiep, deputy chairman of Phu Quoc, on Thursday said that the students left the island for the mainland town of Ha Tien by ferry on Wednesday.

From there, they were taken to Ho Chi Minh City by car.

They were scheduled to board a flight from the southern metropolis to return to France at 3:50 pm on Thursday, according to Thanh Nien (Young People) newspaper.

Before leaving Phu Quoc, all six students tested negative for COVID-19.

Earlier, the French Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City sent a diplomatic note to Kien Giang authorities asking them to facilitate the repatriation procedures and help the stranded French students pass through medical checkpoints so that they could get to Ho Chi Minh City in time for their repatriation flight.

The students entered Vietnam on April 24 and stayed in Hanoi.

They traveled to Phu Quoc Island on July 15 as tourists and got stuck there after 19 southern localities, including Kien Giang Province, imposed strict social distancing orders on July 19.

Currently, there are about 400 foreigners in Phu Quoc, primarily working on investment projects or for high-class resorts.

While there are no official statistics on the number of tourists stuck on the island due to social distancing regulations, Phu Quoc City authorities are committed to facilitating the repatriation of stranded foreigners to their home countries.

Phu Quoc, Vietnam’s largest island, became a top tourist destination after the government rolled out a 30-day visa-free policy for foreigners in 2014.

In 2019, before the onset of the pandemic, it received over five million visitors, including 541,600 foreigners, according to the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism.

Vietnam closed its borders and canceled all international flights in March last year.

Only Vietnamese repatriates, foreign experts, diplomats, investors, highly-skilled workers, and students have been allowed in since with stringent quarantine requirements in place.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Police on Sunday asked people leaving Ho Chi Minh City for their hometowns to turn back to their current places of residence in compliance with COVID-19 travel restrictions.

The mass departure took place when local authorities have applied social distancing measures at various levels since late May to curb the coronavirus, which has caused almost 145,000 infections, including 4,315 deaths, in the city since the pandemic hit the country in early 2020.

Such restrictions, which will be in place until at least September 15 as the city has been struck hard by a fourth wave since late April, have caused job losses and business closures, putting many people in dire straits and thus driving them back to their hometowns.

On duty at many checkpoints at the city’s gateways, traffic police officers stopped the exodus, traveling on motorbikes or in cars, and advised them to return to their current residence for the sake of epidemic prevention and control.

At the Linh Xuan Overpass in Thu Duc City, officers requested hundreds of people to turn around.

On National Highway 1 in Di An City under Binh Duong Province, which borders Ho Chi Minh City, local forces also asked people to come back to their current accommodations.

N.C.K., a native of the north-central province of Thanh Hoa, told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper that he wanted to travel to his hometown after having been jobless for months due to COVID-19.

“Many people who departed earlier than me have been asked to turn back,” K. added.

The mass migration has led to traffic congestion at a number of checkpoints, especially in the Linh Xuan Overpass area.

Senior Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Van Binh told Tuoi Tre that traveling without a proper reason violated social distancing rules and such gatherings at checkpoints put many people at risk of coronavirus infection.

The same situation was seen in the Suoi Tien area in Thu Duc City, where many travelers were stopped.

As many people refused to turn around, police had to gather them in the new Eastern Bus Station area in the district and persuaded them to stay.

Tran Viet Bao, a former porter, who wanted to go back to Hue City, his hometown, told Tuoi Tre that he has been out of work for three months and has owed his landlord two months’ rent.

As the landlord could no longer allow him to default on the rent, he had to leave for Hue, Bao said.

In coping with waves of people leaving Ho Chi Minh City, the municipal police have coordinated with their counterparts in Binh Duong and Dong Nai Provinces to control the situation, give explanations to the internal migrants, and request them to turn back.

Those deliberately breaking the law were penalized but most turned around, listening to explanations given by police officers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vietnam’s Hanoi Medical University on Sunday kicked off the first phase of clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Arcturus Therapeutics, a U.S. firm that has transferred the vaccine technology to a Vietnamese company.

The vaccine, ARCT-154, will undergo the three-phase trials in Vietnam following the technology transfer from Arcturus to Vinbiocare Biotechnology JSC (Vinbiocare), a company under the Southeast Asian country’s leading private conglomerate Vingroup.

The first trial phase will enlist 100 volunteers, while 300 and 20,600 people will participate in the second and third stages, respectively.

The first-phase volunteers began to receive the first shots at the university’s Clinical Testing Center on Sunday.

Volunteers must be healthy adults aged 18 to 59, have no underlying medical conditions or history of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19.

They are also required not to take any medications on a regular basis and have yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

ARCT-154 is a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine designed to act against various coronavirus variants, including the highly contagious Delta, according to the vaccine developer.

The Ministry of Health approved the clinical trials of the ARCT-154 in Vietnam when it had entered clinical trials in the U.S., Singapore, and other countries.

In the past clinical trials, the vaccine yielded satisfactory seroconversion rates and met the requirements on safety and tolerability.

Upon completion of the trials in Vietnam, Vinbiocare will submit the results to the ministry for approval for emergency use of the vaccine in the country in December.

Vinbiocare is building a factory capable of producing 200 million ARCT-154 doses per year in Hanoi’s Hoa Lac Hi-Tech Park at a cost of over US$200 million.

The first batch of the vaccine is expected to be made available in early 2022.

ARCT-154 is the third COVID-19 vaccine to have entered clinical trials in Vietnam and the first to be developed with mRNA technology.

The first COVID-19 vaccine tested on humans is Nano Covax, developed domestically by Ho Chi Minh City-based Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC based on recombinant DNA/protein technology.

Nano Covax is in late-stage clinical trials after results from the first two phases showed that all volunteers developed antibodies against the novel coronavirus.

State President Nguyen Xuan Phuc has asked health authorities to promptly authorize Nano Covax to make the first Vietnamese vaccine available soon.

The second vaccine, Covivac, made by Vietnam’s Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals, is expected to begin phase-three testing in September.

The country is accelerating immunization to drive back the COVID-19 spread, with the numbers of people receiving the first and second shots topping 12.5 million and 1.2 million, the health ministry reported on Saturday evening.

Vietnam has targeted to secure 150 million doses of vaccines to inoculate two-thirds of its 98-million population to reach herd immunity, said the ministry.

However, the country has so far obtained only over 20.5 million doses from different sources, including the COVAX Facility, contractual purchases, and donations.

Since the pandemic hit the country in early 2020, Vietnam has recorded 265,464 COVID-19 cases, including 5,437 deaths, ranking 80th and 69th in terms of infection and fatality rates among 222 countries and territories in the world, according to the health ministry.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hanoi authorities have adopted a special resolution to aid demographics impacted by the coronavirus pandemic that were not included in a relief package ratified by the national government last month.

The new assistance was approved by the municipal People’s Council as a supplement to Resolution No. 68, which was issued by the central government in July and seeks to provide VND26 trillion (US$1.1 billion) to help struggling individuals and businesses hit by COVID-19, the local People’s Committee said on Saturday.

According to the municipal Department of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs, the new resolution will provide support worth VN345 billion ($15.2 million) to 324,000 residents under specific demographics.

It aims to help poor and near-poor households, as well as social security beneficiaries, namely war invalids, elders in the community, and residents in social protection centers who have returned to their families due to the epidemic.

Contract workers who have insurance but were unable to claim unemployment pay after the business households they work at were shuttered for COVID-19 prevention will also benefit from the new package.

Employees at private trade schools and K-12 facilities who got their contracts terminated but were not eligible for unemployment benefits will be included as beneficiaries in Hanoi's upcoming policy.

Also on the beneficiary list of Hanoi's supplementary aid package are private preschools and day-care centers that were closed down over epidemic prevention measures.

Through the Hanoi branch of the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies, city authorities will make VND500 billion ($22 million) available as loans for pandemic-hit employees and employers to revamp their production after the current outbreak wanes.

As of August 10, Hanoi has allocated VND150 billion ($6.6 million) worth of funding to support businesses and workers, and has delivered VND140.4 billion ($6.2 million) out of the sum.

The capital city of Vietnam has recorded 2,395 COVID-19 cases since the fourth outbreak started in late April.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The abrupt enforcement of a new movement declaration system at COVID-19 checkpoints in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday baffled the majority of commuters and clogged up traffic flow for hours.

The novel movement declaration requirement, devised by the Ministry of Public Security and considered part of the national population database, was simultaneously introduced at COVID-19 checkpoints in the city around 1:00 pm on Saturday.

This is meant to keep track of people's travels in case contact tracing is needed to stall coronavirus spread.

As witnessed by a Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper correspondent, all commuters passing these checkpoints would be pulled over and could only leave when they scanned a QR code on their phones, completed their movement declaration online, captured a new QR code, and presented it to checkpoint officers to see if it matched the database.

The steps were deemed rather complicated and time-consuming by the public due to a variety of reasons, including the reduced sensitivity of mobile phone cameras for QR scanning under broad daylight, or the lack of Internet connection at checkpoints.

Several officers were ill-prepared for their duties, as the batteries on their mobile devices died while they logged commuters’ information.

“Some senior citizens had their smartphones with them, but did not know how to declare the information on the apps and required officers' help,” an checkpoint officer explained.

“Some individuals took as long as 15 minutes to complete their declaration.”

The unoptimized process impeded traffic flow, causing lines of delayed vehicles to snake out as far as a few kilometers.

On Phan Dang Luu and Le Van Duyet Streets in Binh Thanh District, hundreds of motorbikes were seen struggling to inch toward the checkpoints, where officers were still strictly upholding the declaration protocol.

“Residents can scan the QR code and declare their information at home," said Senior Lieutenant Colonel Huynh Thi Thu Trang, a senior official at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Public Security.

"They will receive another QR code, which they can save to their phone and use for the next three days.

“When passing the checkpoints, they only need to bring up the QR image so officers can instantly check their information, reducing processing time and avoiding congestion.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A shipment of one million COVID-19 vaccine doses has been delivered to Ho Chi Minh City as part of a contract between a local firm and China’s Sinopharm.

The jabs arrived at Tan Son Nhat International Airport in the southern Vietnamese city on Saturday morning.

The vaccine batch was transported via a charter flight operated by national carrier Vietnam Airlines, which had departed from Beijing.

The doses are part of the five million shots that Saigon Pharmaceutical Company (Sapharco) had purchased with the Ministry of Health’s support.

Sinopharm previously delivered one million jabs on July 31. The vaccines were then kept at Sapharco’s storage.

The health ministry issued a document on August 10 to allow Ho Chi Minh City to use these shots.

The Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control (HCDC) on Thursday allocated 44,000 Sinopharm jabs to local districts.

More than 17,900 of the shots were administered to residents on Friday, with no serious postvaccinal reactions recorded.

The HCDC distributed another 118,000 shots to 17 districts and Thu Duc City on Saturday.

Vietnam has so far received about 20 million COVID-19 vaccine doses through purchase, the COVAX Facility, and donations from other countries.

They include 11.5 million AstraZeneca shots, 12,000 Sputnik V doses, 746,000 Pfizer jabs, over five million Moderna doses, and 2.5 million Sinopharm shots.

More than 13.7 million doses have been administered since inoculation was rolled out in Vietnam on March 8, with over 1.2 million people fully vaccinated.

The Southeast Asian country had documented 265,464 COVID-19 cases by Sunday morning, with 96,985 recoveries and 5,437 deaths.

It has recorded 261,463 local infections in 62 out of 63 provinces and cities since the fourth wave broke out on April 27.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A man has passed away at his home in Vietnam after five healthcare facilities refused to provide him with emergency care.

The deceased man, 57-year-old N.D., hailed from the Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh and resided with his family members in a tenanted house in Di An City under southern Binh Duong Province.

At around 8:00 pm on Friday, D. began vomiting excessively, his daughter Ngo Phuong recalled, adding that the family was unable to contact any ambulance.

A neighbor then agreed to help carry him to the hospital on his truck.

They first arrived at Di An City Medical Center, but doctors refused to take him in as the facility was focusing on treating COVID-19 patients.

D. was later brought to Ngoc Hong Clinic, where he and his family members tested negative for the novel coronavirus via rapid testing.

After finding out the patient suffered from high blood pressure and had a history of stroke, doctors stated that his condition was too serious, requiring treatment from higher-level hospitals.

D. was taken to three other facilities that night, including Quan Doan 4 Hospital, An Phu General Hospital, and Nam Anh General Clinic, none of which agreed to provide treatment.

They said that their doctors had been mobilized for COVID-19 prevention and control efforts, adding that they did not have sufficient equipment for emergency treatment.

The family took D. back to their tenanted house at 1:00 am on Saturday.

He died three hours later.

The provincial People’s Committee on Thursday issued a document stating that hospitals, medical centers, and clinics must not turn down treatment for patients in emergency health situations.

Healthcare facilities that do not accept patients in emergency cases will be penalized in accordance with regulations, while a criminal charge may also be filed if necessary.

Binh Duong is currently the second-largest COVID-19 epicenter in Vietnam, with over 41,000 local infections recorded since the fourth wave started on April 27.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hanoi residents are collectively losing 79,933 years of life expectancy due to fine particle pollution, a recent research paper from environmental nonprofit Live&Learn and Vietnamese universities suggests.

The result, announced in an online conference on Thursday, was drawn from a scientific report on the impact of fine dust pollution on public health in the Vietnamese capital, as measured in 2019 by Live&Learn Vietnam, the Hanoi University of Public Health, and the University of Engineering and Technology under the Vietnam National University (VNU-UET).

The report is described as the first to use locally provided data to evaluate the burden of disease on public health due to PM2.5 exposure in Hanoi, and was carried out within the Collective Actions for Clean Air project funded by the United States Agency for International Development.

Speaking at the conference, Dr. Nguyen Thi Nhat Thanh from VNU-UET revealed that the annual average concentrations of PM2.5, or airborne particles that have aerodynamic diameters of 2.5 μm or less, in Hanoi's districts range between 28,15 and 39,4μg/m3, with such downtown districts as Dong Da, Ba Dinh, and Hai Ba Trung seeing more pollution than suburban ones.

However, the lowest PM2.5 concentration in the city, recorded at 28,15 μg/m3 in the mountainous district of Ba Vi, is still higher than the upper limit of 25 μg/m3 in the national air quality standard.

Such a level of pollution is taking a toll on public health in the capital, as pointed out by a finding on deaths attributed to PM2.5 exposure among local residents in the research.

More specifically, PM2.5 exposure was attributable to 2,855 premature fatalities, equivalent to around 35.5 premature deaths per 100,000 people and accounting for 12 percent of the total toll in Hanoi residents aged 25 and above, Dr. Do Thi Trang Nhung from the Hanoi University of Public Health pointed out.

Consequently, the total years of life lost due to PM2.5 exposure was 79,933 years and the loss of life expectancy was 908 days, equivalent to 2.49 years.

If it had not been for the PM2.5 pollution, the average life expectancy of Hanoi residents could have been 81.49 rather than 79 as of today, Dr. Nhung indicated.

Based on their findings, the researchers provided a series of recommendations for policymakers, which include establishing and implementing an inter-sectoral emergency plan with health protection guidelines and emission control measures, an air quality forecasting and air pollution early warning system, and awareness-raising campaigns of the current status of air quality, to respond to high levels of air pollution.

A representative of the Hanoi Department of Resources and Environment affirmed that the city has made many attempts to improve local air quality, including the curb of straw burning and charcoal stove usage.

However, they have not achieved much success in changing the public’s behaviors.

In 2020, air quality in the Vietnamese capital ranked the 12th worst among cities in the world, despite seeing an eight-percent reduction in PM2.5 levels compared to the previous year, said IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology and monitoring company in their report released in March.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Hanoi man has been arrested for allegedly murdering his creditor before dismembering the victim’s body and dumped the parts in the drains.

The municipal Department of Public Security confirmed on Sunday it had apprehended and initiated legal proceedings against Vuong Van Doan, 32, for murder and robbery.

Preliminary information showed that Doan borrowed VND4 million (US$175) from 39-year-old N.T.D. in July and gave him his silver necklace as collateral.

As Doan wanted to take back his necklace and pocket more money, he offered to pledge his motorbike, but D. had to give him the necklace and loan him another VND25 million ($1,100).

Doan suggested that the transaction take place at his farm in Ung Hoa District.

D. arrived at the farm on August 9 and gave Doan back his silver necklace along with only VND20.2 million ($887).

The creditor stated that Doan still owed him VND4 million as part of their previous deal, adding that he also charged Doan another VND800,000 ($35) for the new loan.

Doan disagreed, before the two had an argument that soon led to violence.

Doan attacked D. with a machete and knocked him on the ground as he tried to run away.

Following D.’s struggle, the two ended up at a riverbank.

Doan eventually drowned the victim in the river.

He wrapped the victim’s body up with a tarpaulin sheet and submerged it in his fish pond by placing bricks on top.

On the following day, Doan decided to mutilate D.’s body and dumped the parts in the drains at his farm.

D.’s family reported his missing on August 11.

Police launched an investigation and summoned Doan to their station on August 13.

Doan tried to conceal his crime at first, but he eventually admitted to killing the victim.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A middle-aged man in Ho Chi Minh City was injected with two consecutive doses of Vero Cell vaccine in less than one minute on the weekend.

Pham Quoc Bao, a 49-year-old resident in Go Vap District, narrated his unusual case to Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper on Sunday afternoon.

On Sunday morning, Bao came to a vaccination point at Nguyen Du Middle School in the district’s Ward 11 for a COVID-19 vaccine shot.

After having his heart rate and blood pressure measured, he was directed to a vaccination table where a nurse gave him a shot of Vero Cell vaccine, developed by China’s Sinopharm.

After the injection, the nurse wrote on the screening sheet that the man had received the first COVID-19 vaccine jab.

When Bao stood up, another nurse at the next table asked him to come over and sit down, and just in the blink of an eye, he was administered the second shot.

“I saw that nurse holding a piece of medical cotton so I thought she would give my injection site some more antiseptic," Bao told Tuoi Tre.

"When I felt pain and turned to the nurse, she had finished the second injection."

The nurse then said she had done it by mistake when questioned by Bao, the man recited.

He felt headache and suffered hypertension 10 minutes later.

A representative of the inoculation point came and blamed Bao for letting the nurses give him two shots in a row, the man recounted.

He got home at noon and his self-measured heart rate amounted to 124 beats per minute.

In panic, Bao phoned the resuscitation doctor at the immunization point and was asked to return there for a vaccination certificate.

The person who gave him the certificate blamed him for the regretful incident.

“That person said I was at fault as I did not leave after receiving the first shot, but sat down at the next table for the second jab,” Bao recounted.

On the evening of the same day, a representative of the Ward 11 authorities confirmed the incident and said that they had visited Bao and assigned a doctor to monitor his health.

Dr. Vu Van Dao, who was in charge of resuscitation at the immunization point, told Tuoi Tre that Bao was in stable health conditions.

Asked whether the health of a person is affected after receiving two consecutive vaccine shots, the doctor said that such an incident would generally not affect the vaccinated person’s health much.

“I have given Bao my phone number and Zalo [a chat app] connection for contact any time when necessary,” Dr. Dao said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A woman has been taken into custody for hitting and biting an on-duty officer after she was stopped at a COVID-19 checkpoint in Ho Chi Minh City.

A source close to Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper confirmed on Sunday that police in Thu Duc City had apprehended 43-year-old Pham Thi Thuy D. for obstructing law enforcement officers.

At around 9:00 am the same day, D. rode a motorbike from her home in Thanh My Loi Ward to Le Van Thinh Hospital in Binh Trung Tay Ward for COVID-19 testing.

After reaching a COVID-19 checkpoint on Nguyen Duy Trinh Street in Binh Trung Tay Ward, D. was required to file a health declaration and present her documents in accordance with regulations.

The woman did not cooperate and began insulting on-duty officers.

As she attempted to leave on her motorbike, an officer held on to her vehicle to stop her.

D. then bit the officer’s arm, took off his anti-droplet face mask, and hit his face.

She was eventually apprehended and escorted to the police station.

According to the law, obstructing law enforcement officers is punishable by a fine worth VND500,000-5 million (US$22-220), an up-to-three-year non-custodial reform, or six months to three years in jail.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Some 400 out of over 2,000 people returning to Ninh Thuan Province from Dong Nai Province in southern Vietnam on July 31 have contracted the coronavirus, the People’s Committee of the former locality said on Sunday afternoon.

The number of infections detected from this multitude of returnees, most of whom worked at factories in Dong Nai, is still increasing, according to the Ninh Thuan Center for Disease Control.

On Sunday evening, 11 positive cases related to this group were reported.

All of the patients were sent to Ninh Thuan General Hospital for treatment.

Many Ninh Thuan people started traveling back to their hometown from Dong Nai, an industrial park hub, on motorbikes since the end of July, with more than 2,000 of them returning on July 31.

As the number of returnees has overwhelmed Ninh Thuan’s centralized quarantine centers, Le Huyen, deputy chairman of the provincial People’s Committee, on Sunday proposed authorities in Dong Nai create conditions for Ninh Thuan people to continue staying in the southern province and not let them leave the locality before the end of social distancing.

Ninh Thuan will execute a plan to receive its returnees in a well-organized way once southern and south-central localities finish social distancing and the central government gives directions for repatriation, Huyen said.

The Ninh Thuan leader also suggested the People’s Committee of Binh Thuan Province, which links Ninh Thuan and Dong Nai, order functional forces stationed at checkpoints on National Highway 1, the major route for traveling through the three localities, to strictly prevent the homecoming.

Vietnam had documented 275,044 COVID-19 cases as of Sunday evening, with 102,504 recoveries and 5,774 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health.

The country has recorded 271,037 local infections in 62 provinces and cities, including 13,616 cases in Dong Nai and 607 patients in Ninh Thuan, since the fourth transmission wave began on April 27.

Ho Chi Minh City is the hardest-hit locality with 149,286 cases.

All 19 southern localities, including Dong Nai, have been under strict social distancing since July 19 while south-central localities, counting Ninh Thuan, have enforced restrictions at different levels, depending on the infection situation.
