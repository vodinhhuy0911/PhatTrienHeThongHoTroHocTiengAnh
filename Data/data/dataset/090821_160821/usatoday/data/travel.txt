DETROIT — Amtrak is betting big on a return of ridership.

The nation’s passenger railroad wants to replace its nearly half-century-old fleet with state-of-the-art trains that can operate on electricity or diesel fuel. It plans to spend $7.3 billion to buy 83 trains made by Siemens, with options to buy more if ridership increases. Funding must still be approved by Congress, but William Flynn, Amtrak's CEO, says he's confident it will happen.

If it doesn't, then Amtrak will finance the trains and repay its debt with money from state train services and passenger fares.

The more efficient trains, which will be built in California, are scheduled to start running in 2024. They will have more comfortable seating, better ventilation systems, power outlets and USB ports, Wi-Fi and panoramic windows. Many can run on either diesel fuel or battery power when needed.

►High-speed rail from Las Vegas to LA:Brightline still on track to break ground

►Full speed ahead:See US, Canada, Europe, Vietnam by rail

The Associated Press spoke recently with Flynn about the new trains, how Amtrak ridership is recovering from the pandemic and how infrastructure measures may boost intercity rail service.

The interview was edited for clarity and length.

How will these new trains help passengers?

These are 125 mph operating speed trains. They’ll make some trips shorter because in some states we have to change locomotives from electric to diesel. The new trains are dual-mode. It will absolutely be a better passenger experience in the cabin itself. We're very focused on our (Americans with Disabilities Act) riders and have worked with the ADA community to make sure we have incorporated attributes that are important to them. Certainly in some cases where track is reconstructed, speeds and trip times will improve.

How fast can these trains go?

125 mph. The limiting factor in most cases is track construction, where we’re talking about 90 mph and less, depending on the state and the condition of the track. We’re talking about track that, for the most part, is owned by freight railroads that we have access to.

Will these 83 trains replace what you already have, or will you be able to expand service?

It is more like-for-like replacement than expansion of capacity. We’re replacing 73, with a near-term option for 10. We have options on another 130 train sets. We’re replacing this 40-to-50-year-old fleet with a fairly similar amount of capacity. As we work to build out what we call our Amtrak Connects strategy, growing ridership by 20 million riders per year, going from 32 million to 52 million, we can buy additional trains.

Are the Acela high-speed trains in the Northeast Corridor covered by this?

Separate contract, separate manufacturer. The Acela is made by Alstom. It’s being fabricated in upstate New York.

►East Coast escape:Savannah, Georgia, is a perfect Amtrak starting point

In 2019, before the pandemic, didn’t ridership hit records?

Yes, it was 32.4 million passengers. I think our ability to recover, post-pandemic, looks very encouraging. We’re at about 62% or so of 2019 ridership, with strong bookings into the fall. A little bit ahead of what we expected. People have a desire to travel. We’re feeling that demand.

Being in a confined space with others is still a concern. Do you see people getting past that once they’re vaccinated?

I do. If you think about our trains, in our coach seating areas, it’s two-by-two, not three-by-three. There’s substantial leg room. Our coach seats feel much more like a domestic first-class (airplane) seat. We’ve worked with researchers at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins. We wanted to make sure we really understood air flow, exchanging fresh air every four to five minutes. Our passengers are still required to wear masks under CDC guidelines, as is our crew.

How close are you to resuming a normal schedule?

Pre-COVID, we were operating around 300 to 310 trains per day. We’re operating around 210 today. Our long-distance trains are fully restored. We had congressional direction and funding to do that. Our Northeast Corridor is largely back in service. So the difference is really the state-supported network. As we head into September and October, our expectation is, we’ll be largely restored.

►All aboard again:Amtrak restores long-distance service on routes following COVID cutbacks

Will these new trains reduce pollution?

We’re really excited about the environmental and sustainable considerations here. Riding a train per seat mile is 83% more fuel-efficient in some cases than driving and less environmentally impactful than flying. We just can’t rest there. We’re buying trains for the long term. While we’re operating in diesel mode, our general reductions in emissions (from current trains) include an 85% reduction in volatile organic compounds, a 70% reduction in carbon monoxide, an 85% reduction in nitrogen oxide and a 95% reduction in particulate matter. We’re refining those numbers. It’s something our riders certainly ask about.

How do the infrastructure proposals by President Joe Biden and Congress play into your plans?

This would provide substantial funding for intercity passenger rail and substantial funding for Amtrak. It would allow us to make the necessary investment we need to fix infrastructure in the Northeast Corridor. We’ve got bridges and tunnels, stations to some extent from Washington to Boston. Our oldest tunnel was built in 1873. A 128-year-old tunnel across the Hudson River, 110- to 120-year-old key bridges. The other part is the expansion, introducing some 39 or 40 new routes, expanding service on another 20 routes outside the Northeast Corridor.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Follow live coverage of Canada's border reopening here.

When the clock struck midnight on Monday, Canada reopened its borders to U.S. citizens after more than a year of only allowing essential travel.

Although some Americans were not going to wait a minute longer than necessary to get into Canada, Detroit’s ports to Canada didn’t get much attention early Monday. Wait times for the Ambassador Bridge hovered around 10 minutes, with the Detroit-Windsor tunnel following closely.

But the Ambassador saw some families reunite and couples return to empty properties across the river.

Asawari Kaur of Indiana, along with her family, huddled together at Detroit’s duty free shop minutes before midnight. Some of Kaur’s family hadn’t seen her brother, who got married in April, in almost two years.

“We were all so eagerly waiting for that day,” Kaur said. “As soon as it hits midnight, we’re gonna enter the border.”

Carolyn Ferroni and David Bruns of Columbus, Ohio, hadn’t seen their lake house across the border in almost two years. The minute Canada's border reopened, the couple was ready to go.

“It’s just part of a family culture and tradition — we go there every year,” Ferroni said.

If not for close kept friends on the other side, Ferroni said their well-loved family lake house of 50 years could’ve been in disarray.

Now, Ferroni and Bruns said they plan to resume their yearly visits to the St. Anthony property.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@American tourists can now visit Canada for the first time since the pandemic.

Canada opened its borders to fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents at 12:01 a.m. Monday.

The moment couldn't arrive any sooner for loved ones who've been apart for more than a year.

“We were all so eagerly waiting for that day,” Asawari Kaur of Indiana told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, while waiting in Detroit's duty-free shop minutes before midnight.

Many Canadian business owners are excited for vaccinated American visitors.

“Let’s get this thing going,” said Joel Villanueva, owner of Primo's Mexican Grill in White Rock, British Columbia. “A lot of our customers are from the United States, and we are literally minutes from across the border. We welcome our Americans, and we depend on their foot traffic.”

►'Maybe ... give us a little break?':Canadian businesses rush to ready for border reopening

Can we visit Canada now?

While Canadian borders have reopened, Americans can't just hop in a car or on a plane. Travelers will need to submit proof of vaccination and other travel details to the Canadian government's ArriveCAN platform at least 72 hours before arriving in the country, whether traveling by land or air.

Donna Deerkoski of Jersey City, New Jersey, learned that the hard way after she and her friends waited an hour at Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, New York. Canadian border patrol turned them away Monday because they hadn't known to upload all their information.

"We tried to do everything right," Deerkoski told The Democrat & Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network. She said they were handed a piece of paper and told to go back the way they came in.

"We're sitting there baffled," she said. "We didn't realize we were being rejected."

Wait times to enter Canada by land varied widely by location on Monday. There was no delay at the Cornwall entry near Rooseveltown, New York, and Douglas Peace Arch near Blaine, Washington. However the wait was two hours long at St. Stephen 3rd Bridge near Calais, Maine, and seven hours long at the Fort Frances Bridge near International Falls, Minnesota. Travelers can check the latest wait times by clicking here.

What do I need to travel to Canada?

Most Americans will need to be fully vaccinated to visit Canada, having received their last shot at least 14 days before entering the country.

Unvaccinated children who are under age 12 or dependent due to a mental or physical condition can enter Canada with a fully vaccinated parent or guardian who is eligible to enter the county.

People with health conditions that prevent them from becoming fully vaccinated can qualify for eased quarantine and testing requirements but must follow a modified quarantine.

Vaccinated travelers don't need to quarantine unless they show COVID-19 symptoms. However, all visitors must prepare quarantine plans.

Regardless of vaccination status, everyone will also need to provide negative COVID-19 test results and upload all their travel information to the ArriveCAN platform.

“At this point, we’ll just do whatever we have to do,” Lisa Docherty said before getting a nasal swab at a pharmacy clinic offering same-day COVID-19 test results in Buffalo, New York. She and her husband, who are both from Buffalo but now live in South Carolina, were hoping to visit their cottage in Ridgeway, Ontario, for the first time since 2019.

Travelers are advised to keep their test results, proof of vaccination and a list of close contacts and locations visited on hand.

Do Americans need a passport to go to Canada?

U.S. travelers need a valid passport to visit Canada. However, a tourist visa is not required for stays under 180 days.

Passport appointments have been scarce for months as hopeful travelers flood passport offices with applications. Pent-up demand has ballooned wait times to 12-to-18 weeks, according the State Department.

The State Department has advised Americans to "reconsider travel" to Canada, among other countries, due to the ongoing pandemic.

When can Canadians visit America?

It's not yet clear when the U.S. will reopen to Canadian tourists. Last month, the U.S. extended travel restrictions on nonessential travel from Canada and Mexico through Aug. 21 amid growing COVID-19 cases across the country. U.S. borders were first closed in March 2020 and restrictions have been extended monthly since then.

On Monday, U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow urged the Biden Administration to reopen the U.S. border to Canadian travelers "without further delay."

“Canada is America’s largest international travel market source and accounted for 26 percent of all inbound traffic in 2019," Dow said in a statement.

►Reopening U.S. borders:U.S. reportedly plans to require COVID-19 shots for foreign travelers

"Reopening the U.S. land border to fully vaccinated Canadians would mark a good starting point towards rebuilding our own travel economy, and the Biden administration should reciprocate this policy decision," he added.

Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: "Any decisions about resuming travel will be guided by our public health and medical experts. ... I wouldn’t look at it through a reciprocal intention.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Canadian border is now open to fully vaccinated Americans

Canada reopened its border to fully vaccinated Americans at 12:01 a.m. Monday, and the moment couldn't come any sooner for families and businesses.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Americans should avoid travel to France, Israel, Iceland and other destinations regardless of vaccination status, according to new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The health agency moved several destinations into its highest travel advisory tier, "level 4: very high level of COVID-19," on Monday. Travelers should avoid travel to those destinations, but those who must travel should make sure they are fully vaccinated, the CDC said.

The countries that moved up to Level 4 include:

The changes to come on the same day France began requiring a virus pass to access cafes, restaurants and long-distance travel.

►COVID travel:CDC says travelers should avoid Greece, Ireland and other destinations, regardless of vaccination status

►'Do not travel':CDC, State Department raise UK travel alert after spike in COVID cases

France's special pass is issued to people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 or have proof of a recent recovery from the virus, or who have a recent negative coronavirus test. The measure also applies to tourists visiting the country.

Greece, Ireland, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other destinations were added to the CDC's Level 4 advisory list earlier this month as countries around the globe grapple with the highly contagious delta variant.

In an interview with the USA TODAY Editorial Board last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said CDC guidance urging people to limit themselves to travel only when necessary still holds.

The CDC recommends all travelers, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks, self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and get tested three to five days after they travel. On top of those travel precautions, the agency also recommends that unvaccinated travelers get tested one to three days before leaving the U.S. and that they self-quarantine after travel for up to 10 days.

All passengers ages 2 and older flying into the United States must present a negative coronavirus test taken no more than three days before their flight or proof they recovered from the virus within the past three months.

ROME – Pompeii's archaeological park offers free swab tests, the Vatican Museums posted refund instructions and tourists whipped out smartphones to show QR codes along with admission tickets Friday as a COVID-19 certification rule took effect in Italy as part of the government's plan to rein in a summer surge in coronavirus infections.

A “Green Pass” is required to enter archaeological sites, gyms, theaters, indoor pools and the indoor sections of restaurants, bars and cafes. To obtain a certificate, individuals must show they have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine approved for use in the European Union, recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months or have negative lab results from a test within the previous 48 hours.

The government announced the rule July 22. About 50 million of Italy's 60 million residents had downloaded the certification by late July.

Vaccine certificates issued by the United States, Canada, Japan and Israel will be accepted for tourists arriving from those countries.

Need to share proof of vaccine? Here's how to store your COVID-19 vaccination card on your smartphone

Get paid to move to Italy? Yes, this region offers new residents $33,000

Along the sidewalk flanking Vatican City's walls, visitors to the Vatican Museums – one of the world's most popular attractions – got ready to show their QR certificates on their cellphones to staffers at the entrance. The line moved briskly.

Visitors from France found the Italian system familiar. Their country introduced entrance requirements even tougher than Italy’s, applying to outdoor dining as well.

“It is good for everybody’s safety. It is positive for the economy, too,'' French tourist Alexine Prentignac said.

Though many find it convenient to flash their Green Pass on a phone, paper certification is acceptable in Italy. The Vatican Museums website cautioned visitors to have an identity document handy, so staff could “verify actual ownership” of the Green Pass. For anyone unwilling or unable to comply, the website offered instructions on how to request a ticket refund.

At Pompeii, one of Italy's most-visited tourist sites, officials teamed up with the city of Naples to offer coronavirus tests during the opening hours of the sprawling park featuring the ancient Roman city's ruins. The tests are given free of charge.

During the pandemic, "it’s the task of those who manage a culture site to reconcile as best as possible the needs of health and public safety with our mission to be an inclusive place,″ accessible to all, said Pompeii's director general, Gabriel Zuchtriegel.

Business owners wove the change into their customer routines. Fabrizio De Falco, the owner of a cafe near St. Peter’s Basilica with an outdoor terrace and indoor tables, regarded it a necessary adjustment during the pandemic.

“It is one more duty. It is an additional workload, but it is worth it if it will get us out from this situation,'' De Falco said.

The Green Pass rule applies to those 12 or older, since children under that age aren't eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in Italy.

Much of leisure life in Italy during warm months is spent outdoors. Gyms, cinemas and theaters frequently close in August since staff and clients opt for vacations during the month. Since air conditioning is still relatively new for many businesses, dining outdoors at trattorias and cafes is a summertime tradition in much of the nation.

Right-wing leader Matteo Salvini, whose League party is part of Italy's coalition government, had voiced worry that Green Pass requirements for long-distance travel would discourage domestic and international tourism. The tourist industry accounts for 13% of Italy's GDP.

Thursday evening, Premier Mario Draghi's Cabinet approved a rule making such certification obligatory starting Sept. 1 for those taking flights, high-speed or inter-regional trains or ships sailing between regions. An exception was made for ferries that frequently ply the narrow strait between Sicily and Calabria, a route taken by many commuters and students.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings will be allowed to require passengers to present proof of COVID-19 vaccination when they board cruises departing from Florida – at least for now.

Late Sunday, the parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises was granted a preliminary injunction by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams, temporarily blocking Florida's law that bans cruise companies from asking for proof of a COVID-19 vaccine to board.

"This order will now allow the company to operate in the safest way possible with 100% vaccination of all guests and crew when sailing from Florida ports," the cruise company said in a news release issued late Sunday.

Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Gem ship is scheduled to depart from Miami on Aug. 15. The cruise line hasn't sailed from Florida since the cruise industry shut down in March 2020. It resumed operations late last month with a sailing in Greece.

In April, the cruise company announced it would require passengers and crew members to be fully vaccinated at least two weeks before boarding.

Norwegian asked Williams on Friday to block the state law that prohibits cruise lines and other businesses from asking for vaccination proof. The company filed a lawsuit against the state last month.

The lawsuit challenges the state’s “vaccine passport” ban, which was signed into law in May by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

►Florida cruises:The state's 'vaccine passport' ban creates ocean of confusion

►Six COVID-19 cases emerged on my cruise:Here's why I didn't panic

In a nearly 60-page ruling, the judge said Florida failed to “provide a valid evidentiary, factual, or legal predicate” for banning requests for vaccination proof. Williams said the cruise company “has demonstrated that public health will be jeopardized if it is required to suspend its vaccination requirement.”

Norwegian contends that the law is an unconstitutional infringement on the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee. The lawsuit names state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees, who leads the Florida Department of Health. The state’s attorney, Pete Patterson, said the law’s aim is to prevent discrimination against passengers who don’t get vaccinated.

Frank Del Rio, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, said in a statement Sunday that the company's commitment to safe cruising is demonstrated by the lengths it has gone to keep the vaccine requirement in place.

"We want nothing more than to sail from Miami, the cruise capital of the world, and from the other fabulous Florida ports, and we welcome today’s ruling that allows us to sail with 100% fully vaccinated guests and crew, which we believe is the safest and most prudent way to resume cruise operations amid this global pandemic,” he said.

According to a statement from Gov. DeSantis' office, provided by press secretary Christina Pushaw, the state will appeal as they "disagree with the judge's legal reasoning."

"A prohibition on vaccine passports does not even implicate, let alone violate, anyone’s speech rights, and it furthers the substantial, local interest of preventing discrimination among customers based on private health information," DeSantis' office said.

Special to Courier Journal

COX'S CREEK, Ky. — What do you do if you grow up in a family legendary for its hospitality, where stories of family ties to the Jesse James gang flow like bourbon? If you’re eighth-generation whiskey maker Rob Samuels of Maker’s Mark Distillery, well, you buy the 200-year-old family home and fling open the doors to bourbon tourists.

Last week, I had the chance to step inside the 1820s manor near Bardstown for a sneak preview of The Samuels House, and it was a step into Kentucky's illustrious bourbon history – which is exactly what Rob Samuels and his father, Bill Samuels, Jr., want.

This is "Night at the Museum," bourbon edition, with the home as steeped in the Samuels Maker's Mark legacy as a barrel stave is in whiskey. The Samuels House is a showcase of the family’s whiskey-making roots. And those roots run as deep as the majestic mature trees out front.

► Kentucky's historic bourbon disasters:From 'bourbonado' and Jim Beam's fire to massive bourbon spills and natural disasters in recent history

“My namesake Robert Samuels had first made whiskey for George Washington's army,” Rob said during a sneak peek tour last week. “He brought a 60 gallon still as he moved south and settled in what would eventually become Kentucky on the land grant, so he settled in that area where the house was eventually built in 1784. His grandson John Samuels built the house in 1820.”

Now The Samuels House, located in Cox's Creek, just 40 minutes away from the Maker's Mark Distillery in Loretto, is offering an immersive, only-in-Kentucky experience with overnight lodging at the Federal-style manor home. Presiding over two acres of bluegrass perfection, complete with mature oak trees and horse pastures, the home melds its two-century history with luxury and 21st-century essentials in all the right places.

But how this historic home, which slipped out of Samuels family in the 1950s, was transformed to a decadent destination steeped in bourbon lore and American history is a winding journey, just like the history of Maker's Mark itself.

Parties, gangsters and good bourbon

The Samuels House was near two distilleries that the Samuels family had in the area, and played host to untold family gatherings, parties ... and some gangster-laced Kentucky and U.S. history.

Bill Samuels loves to recount that history, so his son, Rob, grew up on the tales.

► From father to grandson:How this family built Angel's Envy bourbon from the ground up

“If you were at the distillery with my dad for half a day, he would spend an hour on this topic,” Rob said.

But what’s the news bite version?

“TW Samuels, who is my fourth great grandfather,” Rob said, “his first cousin Reuben Samuels married Frank and Jesse James’ mother. So Reuben Samuels was Frank and Jesse James’s stepdad.”

Wow.

“And then Wilson Samuels, who had lived in the house, in the 1800s two of his daughters actually married James gang members and they stayed for a number of months,” he went on. “In the third floor ... they cut out an escape hatch where if the law was ever moving in on them, they could get out quickly through that third-floor escape hatch and then there's a tree on both sides of the house, so they could slide down.”

► We live in Bourbon Country, but..:Here's why you need to give Kentucky gin a chance

Are you having family history envy yet? Pour a drink, there’s more.

“Jesse James had never surrendered,” Rob said, “but Frank James, in September of 1865, they had orchestrated a surrender. It was organized by TW Samuels, who was the distillery owner but he was also the three-time sheriff of Nelson County.

"The surrender took place in the front yard of the Samuels house,” Rob said. “He handed over the pistol and he was later pardoned.”

That pistol, Bill told me as he showed me around the property, may have been the final firearm surrendered in the Civil War.

And what do you think you’ll see when you walk into the foyer of the home? That very pistol, and the pardon.

The house is positively brimming with family heirlooms and memorabilia like that. Numerous historic photos line the walls, weaving the story of the Samuels family legacy. You'll also see the deep fryer where Rob’s grandmother, Margie Samuels, experimented with dipping bottles into the now-iconic red wax; a photo of Bill Samuels belting out a tune at a party with Little Richard; dozens of bottles of whiskey representing points along their 150 years of distilling — including the very first bottle of Maker’s Mark off the production line.

From family home to bourbon tourism destination

Eventually, like other family farms, it changed hands when the next generation wasn't interested in farming and the home was sold in the 1950s.

But the tales of that property and its importance to the brand that one day became Maker's Mark never left.

It seems Rob took an inkling one day to learn more about the house after hearing so much about it during his childhood and driving past it so many times. He connected with the homeowners, who’d meticulously cared for the place, and went for a visit. They were really gracious, Rob said, and he was immediately captivated by the house.

“They swung open the door that led into that kitchen, and it almost knocked me out with that fireplace," he said.

He shared his vision: open up to the home to travelers — bourbon enthusiasts, history buffs, folks coming to Kentucky in search of a deeper experience than a distillery tour.

They loved it, sold him the house, and he got to work. In a matter of months, working with Jeffrey James Design and rc3 architect + builder, and combing through family archives, they prepared The Samuels House for its next chapter.

Three suites and a number of beautifully designed indoor and outdoor spaces will accommodate up to eight people. As if sleeping surrounded by history isn’t enough, guests will have the chance to bring in Bill Samuels for stories and cocktails (based on availability, of course).

Friends, I will tell you. People buy up unicorn bottles in a frenzy, pay outrageous prices on the secondary market, and camp out for a chance to nab a limited release. But the real priceless Kentucky bourbon experience in my book? Listening to stories from the legacy whiskey makers like the Samuels family, the Noes of Jim Beam, and the Russells of Wild Turkey.

For a bourbon lover with the cash to spend, it’d be worth the cost of admission (and yep, it’s steep, starting at $1,250 a night — but that is for the entire group) to stay at the house just to have the chance to hang with Bill. Donations for the experience will go to the Margie Samuels endowed scholarship for the Women of Color Entrepreneur Leadership Program at Bellarmine University.

Guests can also book chef Newman Miller, who was the chef-in-residence at Maker’s Mark, for a paired cocktail dinner. And, buckle in, serious bourbon lovers: Rob dropped this little tidbit when we chatted last week.

► 'We can't forget':Kentucky is (slowly) recognizing the role of slaves in bourbon's legacy

For the first time, Maker’s is also offering the chance for a private evening experience at the distillery.

Samuels House guests “can essentially have the Maker's Mark distillery to themselves,” Rob said. “Your group of six or eight would be the only group on the property, all 100 acres ... [have a] tasting overlooking the lake, and then a private meal in the restaurant.”

So basically a bourbon dream trip: sleep at The Samuels House, hang out and sip bourbon with Bill Samuels Jr., eat with chef Miller, and call the distillery your own for the night.

When people ask me as a Kentuckian if we consider ourselves part of the South, my answer is always that we claim those aspects of the South that suit us. And namely, that’s hospitality. It makes me proud as a Kentuckian and a bourbon lover to see one of the biggest names in the industry stepping up the offerings available to bourbon’s biggest fans.

I’ve long heard that we want to be “the next Napa,” and I’ve long wished we’d stop saying that. What we have is uniquely Kentucky, and we should be proud to celebrate that. Cheers to the Samuels family for sharing their legacy, and for showing just what Kentucky hospitality is about.

JUNEAU, Alaska – Federal investigators hoped Sunday to recover the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that crashed in southeast Alaska, killing six people, but the timing of the recovery depended on the weather, a National Transportation Safety Board official said.

The wreckage was in a rugged, steep area that is heavily forested, said Clint Johnson, chief of the agency’s Alaska region.

“Very challenging conditions,” Johnson said, adding that the wreckage would have to be removed by helicopter.

He said Sunday morning he had not yet received an update from the team as to their status in trying to recover the wreckage.

Johnson said the site was at 1,800 feet (548.6 meters) to 2,000 feet (609.6 meters) “up on the side of a mountain,” and that weather has been an issue. The site is about 12 miles northeast of Ketchikan, Johnson said.

Interviews also were planned Sunday with the airplane operator and others in Ketchikan, he said.

The flight was returning to Ketchikan on Thursday from a tour of Misty Fjords National Monument when it crashed, Johnson said.

The plane carried five passengers and the pilot. The Alaska State Troopers identified the pilot as Rolf Lanzendorfer, 64, of Cle Elum, Washington. Troopers identified the passengers as Mark Henderson, 69, and Jacquelyn Komplin, 60, both of Napa, California; Andrea McArthur, 55, and Rachel McArthur, 20, both of Woodstock, Georgia; and Janet Kroll, 77, of Mount Prospect, Illinois.

Troopers and Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad members reached the scene via a chartered helicopter Saturday afternoon and recovered the bodies, which were being taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Anchorage, the troopers said.

Kathleen Grayson, Henderson’s sister, told the Napa Valley Register that Henderson and Komplin had sent messages during their trip “talking about how gorgeous” it was in Alaska. “They were having so much fun,” she said.

Henderson was retired but had worked as a public defender, while Komplin was a registered nurse and instructor at Pacific Union College, the news outlet reported.

One recent post on Kroll’s Facebook page showed Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau in the background. Another was captioned: “I finally made it to Alaska! Hooray!”

Lanzendorfer’s Linkedin profile said he had worked for Southeast Aviation as a pilot since May 2015. Bri Kelly, a media contact for Southeast Aviation, did not provide any details about the pilot’s tenure with the company and directed questions related to the accident to Johnson.

Holland America Line confirmed the five passengers on the flight had been traveling on the company’s ship Nieuw Amsterdam, which was nearing the end of seven-day Alaska cruise.

Ketchikan is a popular stop for cruise ships visiting Alaska, and sightseeing excursions, such as those to Misty Fjords National Monument, are among the options for exploring the area while off the ship.

The cruise line said the excursion the passengers were on was not sold by Holland America Line.

Southeast Aviation, in a statement Thursday, said it was cooperating with the agencies involved. “All of us share in the anguish of this tragic incident, and our prayers go out to all affected,” the statement said.

The plane’s emergency beacon was activated about 11:20 a.m. Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard has said.

A helicopter company reported seeing wreckage on a ridgeline in the search area, and Coast Guard crew members found the wreckage around 2:40 p.m. They reported no survivors, the Coast Guard said.

Weather conditions at the site included mist and light rain, the Coast Guard said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vaccinated American travelers will get the green light to cross Canada's borders on Monday, but the process won't be as simple as it was before the pandemic.

The country has implemented new health measures to keep the coronavirus at bay, such as asking visitors to provide additional documentation – including proof of vaccination and a coronavirus test – before crossing the land border. Air travelers also need to submit information, including coronavirus test results, before boarding a plane to Canada. Falsifying information could result in hefty fines.

Travelers can also expect longer wait times, thanks to the new public health measures.

Fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents will be permitted to enter Canada for nonessential travel starting Monday at 12:01 a.m. ETD. White House officials have yet to say when the U.S. will reciprocate and ease its own travel restrictions against its Canadian neighbors.

For Americans planning to take a trip up north soon, here are 11 things to know.

►US borders:US extends Mexico, Canada border restrictions through Aug. 21

Canada border crossing requirements: Travelers will need to be fully vaccinated

American travelers wanting to visit Canada by land, air or water must complete a COVID-19 vaccination at least 14 days before entry. The government of Canada accepts the Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccines.

Cruises are not permitted to enter Canadian waters, but the country's ban on cruise ships with more than 100 passengers is set to end Nov. 1.

Everyone needs to get a negative coronavirus test

All travelers, regardless of vaccination status, will need to show proof of a coronavirus molecular test– such as a PCR test – to enter. Fully vaccinated travelers will not need to take a post-arrival test unless they are randomly selected to do so.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website has a list of community-based testing sites for COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests travelers contact their health care provider or visit their local health department’s website to find the latest information on testing since the type of COVID-19 tests offered can differ by location.

Bring COVID-19 vaccine card, documentation

Travelers must show proof of vaccination in either English, French or a certified translation.

Airlines will verify passengers’ vaccination status through the ArriveCAN app or website before passengers board their flights. Those driving across the border must use ArriveCAN before departing. Information must be submitted within 72 hours before arrival.

Travelers are advised to carry their vaccine documentation to show officials at border entry points and should keep their test results and a list of close contacts and locations visited on hand.

Travelers without documentation will be denied boarding, and those who try to cross land borders without the proper documents will be sent back to the United States.

Travelers who try to falsify their documentation could be fined or denied entry to the country at a future date, according to Denis Vinette, vice president of the CBSA travelers branch. Two travelers who tried to enter Canada last month were fined nearly $20,000 Canadian dollars, or nearly $16,000, after providing false information related to proof of vaccination.

"We've seen quite a few instances with individuals who've attempted to make use of fraudulent documents," Vinette said. "It's just not worth it.

Check for any COVID-19 symptoms, and be prepared to quarantine

Fully vaccinated travelers won't need to quarantine upon arrival, but visitors with COVID-19 symptoms will need to self-isolate. All visitors must provide a quarantine plan.

You can expect longer wait times

The CBSA is expecting increased processing times for border crossings come Monday due to enhanced public health measures.

“The CBSA will not compromise the health and safety of Canadians for the sake of border wait times,” spokeswoman Rebecca Purdy told USA TODAY via email Tuesday.

Vinetteof the CBSA said the agency expects a 10% to 25% increase in vehicles trying to cross the border once restrictions ease Monday, which would be just 20% or so of pre-pandemic levels.

"We asked travelers to be patient but also to arrive prepared and knowledgeable of the requirements at the border," Vinette told USA TODAY. "It'll help increase passage and throughput and make the experience much more positive."

The agency’s website offers estimated border wait times at select land ports.

Dan Weingarten, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Transportation, added that the department will work to process traffic “as expeditiously as possible” through the state's toll plazas and border bridges.

“We anticipate any delays would be at the U.S. or Canadian customs checkpoints, which are not under our control,” Weingarten said.

While a CBSA employee strike threatened to further increase wait times for travelers crossing the border, strike actions were called off late Friday after labor unions reached a tentative agreement with the CBSA.

Children, others who are exempted can enter Canada

Children under the age of 12 and unvaccinated dependent children will be allowed to enter the country with a fully vaccinated parent, stepparent, tutor or guardian who is eligible to enter Canada.

People with health conditions that prevent them from becoming fully vaccinated can qualify for eased quarantine and testing requirements but must follow a modified quarantine.

►Canada border:Canada to reopen its borders to fully vaccinated Americans starting Aug. 9

You may run into other COVID-19 travel restrictions

Travelers will be required to follow public health measures, including monitoring for signs of COVID-19 and keeping a copy of vaccine documentation and test results 14 days after entry.

Canada's government suggests mask wearing in shared spaces, and certain provinces – including Quebec and Ontario – enforce mask mandates.

Travelers entering by air will need to wear a mask in Canadian airports and on flights to and from the country, regardless of vaccination status.

Some provinces impose other restrictions. Newfoundland and Labrador require a travel form to enter. Ontario has capacity limits on organized public events, retail spaces, museums, casinos, theaters and more.

The country's national parks are open and welcome visitors, but access to facilities and services may be limited.

Airlines add flights to Canada

Airlines are adding flights to Canada to accommodate the anticipated uptick of air travel demand.

Air Canada announced a summer trans-border schedule with up to 220 daily flights between the USA and Canada starting Monday. The initial schedule will include 55 routes and 34 U.S. destinations, but the airline plans to restore service to all 57 U.S. destinations previously served “as conditions allow,” according to the airline.

United, which flies to Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, said it would add flights to Toronto and Vancouver in September.

American Airlines services four airports in Canada – Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver – and is set to resume operations in Halifax, Quebec and Ottawa in the spring of 2022, according to a statement in June.

Pricing from flight search tool Skyscanner on Fridayshowed airfares for August trips from the USA to Canada start at $329 for Vancouver, $359 for Toronto and $356 for Calgary.

Effective Monday, international flights carrying passengers will be permitted to land at nine Canadian airports:

Montréal-Trudeau International Airport

Toronto Pearson International Airport

Calgary International Airport

Vancouver International Airport

Halifax Stanfield International Airport

Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport

Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport

Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport

Edmonton International Airport

Canada hotel room rates are low – but prices are rising

In June, the average daily room rate – or ADR – across Canada's hotels was $125.05 in Canadian dollars(U.S. $99.61), down 31% compared with 2019, according to hotel analytics company STR.

Hotel room prices should rebound when border restrictions ease; STR expects ADR to hit $116.22by the end of September, according to a June statement. The firm expects smaller cities and resorts to lead the recovery.

“International demand plays an incredibly important role in the recovery process, and we expect a jump in hotel leisure and corporate demand once the U.S./Canada land border reopens,”the news release read.

►More:Yes, room prices are higher. Hotel rates hit record high the week of July 4.

The majority of eligible Canadians are vaccinated against COVID-19

Canada's vaccine rollout had a slower start, but the country has surpassed U.S. vaccination rates.

More than 71% of the Canadian population has received at least one dose of the vaccine and nearly 60% were fully vaccinated as of July 31. In the U.S., 58% of the population was partially vaccinated and 50% was fully vaccinated as of Friday.

US extends Canada border closure

The United States extended border restrictions on nonessential travel last month, keeping its borders with Canada and Mexico closed through at least Aug. 21. The restrictions to entry affect land and ferry travel.

The move is meant to help the country decrease the spread of COVID-19, including the highly contagious delta variant.

International travelers who plan to return to the U.S. by air will need to get tested no more than three days before travel and show a negative test result or documentation of recovery to the airline before boarding, according to the CDC. This policy does not apply to land border crossings.

PAGE, Ariz. – A thick, white band of newly exposed rock face stretches high above boaters’ heads at Lake Powell, creating a sharp contrast against the famous red desert terrain as their vessels weave through tight canyons that were once underwater.

It’s a stark reminder of how far the water level has fallen at the massive reservoir on the Utah-Arizona border. Last year, it was more than 50 feet (15 meters) higher. The level at the popular destination for houseboat vacations is at a historic low amid a megadrought engulfing the U.S. West.

At Lake Powell, tents are tucked along shorelines that haven’t seen water for years. Bright-colored Jet Skis fly across the water, passing kayakers, water skiers and fishermen under a blistering desert sun. Closed boat ramps have forced some houseboats off the lake, leaving tourists and businesses scrambling. One ramp is so far above the water, people have to carry kayaks and stand-up paddleboards down a steep cliff face to reach the surface.

Houseboat rental companies had to cancel their bookings through August – one of their most popular months – after the National Park Service, which manages the lake, barred people from launching the vessels in mid-July.

'Red alert':Lake Mead falls to lowest water level since Hoover Dam's construction in 1930s

At the popular main launch point on Wahweap Bay, the bottom of the concrete ramp has been extended with steel pipes, so boats can still get on the lake, but that solution will last only a week or two longer, the park service said.

“It’s really sad that they’re allowing such a beautiful, beautiful place to fall apart,” said Bob Reed, who runs touring company Up Lake Adventures.

Lake Powell is the second-largest reservoir in the USA, right behind Nevada’s Lake Mead, which also stores water from the Colorado River. Both are shrinking faster than expected, a dire concern for a seven-state region that relies on the river to supply water to 40 million people and a $5 billion-a-year agricultural industry.

They are among several large bodies of water in the West that have hit record lows this summer, including the Great Salt Lake in Utah. California’s more than 1,500 reservoirs are 50% lower than they should be this time of year.

In 1983, Lake Powell’s water exceeded its maximum level of 3,700 feet (1,127 meters) and nearly overran Glen Canyon Dam. The lake reached a record low of 3,553 feet (1,082 meters) last week.

Government officials had to release water from sources upstream last month to keep the lake’s level from dropping so low it would have threatened hydropower supplied by the dam.

Less snowpack flows into the Colorado River and its tributaries, and hot temperatures parch soil and cause more river water to evaporate as it streams through the American West, which has been plagued by drought for more than 20 years.

California drought:Swipe to see how a major drought is devastating California's water resources

Fluctuating water levels have long been a staple of Lake Powell, but National Park Service forecasts didn't predict how bad 2021 would be.

Finger-pointing has started as boaters, officials and the park service debate what to do.

“The park service has failed to plan,” area homeowner Bill Schneider said. “If it gets to the point where we’re so low that you can’t put boats in the water and you can’t come up with a solution to put boats in the water, why would you come to Lake Powell?”

The 53-year-old bought a retirement home in nearby Page, Arizona, after completing 25 years of military service in February. He wanted to return to Wahweap Bay where he spent most of his childhood and teen years fishing, waterskiing and working odd jobs around the lake. After watching how the lake has been managed, Schneider said, he’s starting to regret it.

Officials said they have solutions for families and boaters who sometimes plan years ahead to explore the glassy waters that extend into narrow red rock canyons and the tourism industry that depends on them.

Water levels:Record low water at 2 major lakes poses a threat to humans and wildlife in the West

Once the severity of the drought became clear, federal officials looked for options to allow boat access at low water levels, said William Shott, superintendent of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, where Lake Powell is located. The park service discovered an old ramp on Wahweap Bay that will be built out to support houseboats and smaller motorboats.

Shott said he hopes the $3 million ramp can be completed by Labor Day weekend. The project is funded by the park service and lake concessionaire Aramark.

The agency and officials from Page, which relies on lake tourism, plan to open another old asphalt ramp to provide access for smaller boats while the larger one is updated.

Tom Materna, who has been visiting Lake Powell for 20 years, launched his family’s 65-foot (20-meter) timeshare houseboat hours before the main ramp closed but had to cut their vacation short as water levels dropped in mid-July.

“They said no more launching out of the Wahweap ramp, so we were glad we made it out,” the Los Angeles resident said. “Then the next day I think or two days later, they called us up and told us that all launch and retrieve houseboats had to be off the lake.”

Monsoon season:Southwest monsoon rain brings drought relief – but also dangerous flooding

Page Mayor Bill Diak said losing boat access to the lake could have devastating financial consequences for the city of 7,500.

He said leaders were “slow” to address dropping water levels and limited boat access, but he’s been working with park officials and concessionaires on solutions.

“We could have been a little bit more proactive on planning … but we’re moving in the right direction now, working together,” Diak said.

He stressed that the impact of climate change needs to be addressed, noting that the West could face far more pressing issues than lake access if the drought continues for another 20 years.

One silver lining, Shott said, is the park service can build boat ramps that are usable even during record drought years. More than $8 million in other low-water projects are underway.

“Even if we did have a crystal ball and we saw that these lake levels were going to get this low, we couldn’t have prevented it anyways,” Shott said. “With that said, we’re taking advantage of the low water now.”

Wildfires:Progress made, but Western wildfires bring poor air quality across US

Troy Sherman, co-owner of a business renting environmentally friendly anchors to houseboats, said the marina housing Beach Bags Anchors shut down shortly after his company launched in spring 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It relaunched this year but had to cancel 95% of its bookings in July when ramps closed to houseboats.

“Until there’s really access to a ramp again to put houseboats in, my business is kind of in a holding pattern,” Sherman said. “But we’ll totally persevere; it’s what you have to do.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Anna Pierce first heard the Canadian border would be reopening to fully vaccinated U.S. travelers, she was nearly brought to happy tears.

The vice president and general manager of Niagara Helicopters, an Ontario-based company that offers helicopter tours, described operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic as a “terrible roller coaster,” with travel restrictions for both domestic and international travelers curbing business dramatically.

"On a typical day (before the pandemic), we would do upwards of 80 flights with six passengers in each flight," she said. "It went down to as low as four flights a day last summer."

Pierce hopes Monday's border reopening date will allow Niagara Helicopters to salvage reservations in September and October, a popular time because the company can offer an aerial view of Niagara Falls' changing leaves, but the company is lacking one key component: staffing.

How much will a trip cost? Canada is reopening to vaccinated American travelers

The company has 18 employees, less than half of what it normally has this time of year. Pierce said the company needs at least 24, but employees are so in-demand that she gets a handful of no-shows every time she sets up interviews.

“People are just being snapped up left, right and center. I’ve never seen anything like that,” Pierce said. “We’re not expecting business to surge to 2019 levels, but we’re hoping for the best (when travel restrictions ease) and we hope we have enough employees to service them.”

Canadian businesses near the border have spent weeks preparing for Monday, when Canada will start allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents to cross the border. But the expected uptick in travel comes as businesses across North America face staffing shortages and supply chain issues.

That could mean travelers to Canada will have a harder time getting certain reservations or face longer wait times, according to some business owners.

How busy will Canada businesses be?

Monday’s easing of travel restrictions is expected to boost traffic to Canada, but businesses and local leaders say it will take time before tourism rates are comparable to 2019 levels.

Denis Vinette, vice president of the Canada Border Services Agency’s travelers branch, told USA TODAY the agency predicts a 10% to 25% increase in traffic toward Canada on Aug. 9 – a significant increase, but still just about 20% of historical volumes.

But even a small boost is good news for cities like Toronto, where Americans make up the majority of the nearly 30 million annual tourists it gets in a typical year. A 2020 report from Destination Toronto, the marketing organization for Toronto's tourism industry, found the city lost about $8.4 billion in economic activity after one year of the pandemic.

"It’s been devastating," said Toronto Mayor John Tory. "If you look at a lot of the major tourist destinations downtown … they’ve been vacant."

Niagara Falls, Ontario Mayor Jim Diodati said he doesn’t expect a “massive rush” come Monday, especially knowing travelers trying to cross the land border will face longer wait times thanks to enhanced public health measures such as a requirement to show proof of vaccination.

“I think the first to come across won’t be your typical tourists,” Diodati said, adding that he expects to see more Americans crossing to visit family or property.

He doesn’t anticipate international travel to pick up until next year, a long wait for a city that gets roughly half its tourism revenue from American visitors.

“The American tourists matter,” Diodati said. “(Local businesses) are already planning for next (travel) season.”

Even if travel’s resurgence will take time, businesses have already started to see an uptick in demand.

Ann Marie Nitso, owner of the Old Stone Inn Boutique Hotel in Niagara Falls, said the hotel doubled its bookings shortly after the Canadian government announced the border reopening date. She estimates about 65% of the hotel’s business comes from American visitors.

“There’s been a lot of pent-up demand,” Nitso said. “I've been receiving reservations for the Christmas period. So people are definitely more confident now that the borders have reopened.”

Canada is easing travel restrictions for vaccinated Americans: Here are 10 things to know before a trip

Don Cleary, president of Marriott Hotels of Canada, said he has started to see “positive momentum” that he expects will continue through the remainder of the summer.

“With the announcement of the border reopening, we saw a much more significant increase (in international bookings),” Cleary said. “We are starting to see a future mix closer to 2019 levels … (and) we are seeing booking windows slowly lengthen into August, September, and October.”

Staffing shortages and supply chain issues

Dan Lehmann, owner of the Duck Bay Lodge near the Lake of the Woods, said his limited staff is rushing to get the fishing resort ready for business after sitting empty two years.

“The tough part is ... the fact that the supply chain is really interrupted,” he said. “Something as simple as getting some 2-inch nails at the hardware store, it’s not available. ... All the different little parts we use with boats and motors and running the lodge aren’t necessarily available like they used to be.”

Crossing the border:Canada Border Services Agency worker strike ends, promising a smoother flow to border traffic

Staffing is also a major issues for businesses. Nitso of the Old Stone Inn said her hotel has had to outsource housekeeping jobs for the first time due to a lack of workers.

“It’s something we never thought we’d have to do,” she said.

Hanif Harji, CEO of Scale Hospitality, which owns a number of restaurants in Toronto, said the company is already struggling to keep up with demand with its current staff size. Certain restaurants have had to close for lunches or one full day each week to make sure employees get time off.

“All (the lifting of restrictions) is going to do is add to the demand, but demand is outpacing supply today,” Harji said. “The tourism business is going to be great, but it’s also going to be very challenging for people to find reservations. Restaurants are being booked up two, three, four weeks in advance right now.”

Harji said he’s trying to increase staffing levels 30% to meet current demand levels.

“Even though the border may be opening Aug. 9, I think it’s going to take a couple of weeks to staffed up and ready to manage that kind of volume,” Harji said. But “in the long term, I think (the border reopening) is going to be great for business.”

The effects are seen in Quebec as well, where Michelle Doré runs three hotels: Hôtel Champlain, Hôtel Jardin SteAnne and Auberge Place d’Armes. She estimated the business is short-staffed by about 20% after many of her former staff members left the hospitality industry.

“We will have the pleasure of having (American tourists), but it’ll be ... challenging to give the best service that we give,” she said. “Maybe we’ll ask them when they come, can you be just a little patient or give us a little break? … The service will be there, but maybe a little bit longer.”

Spirit Airlines CEO Ted Christie says things are improving after the airline had to cancel more than 2,000 flights.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Canada Border Services Agency union workers ended strike actions late Friday, allowing a smoother flow to border traffic days before Canada is set to allow vaccinated Americans to cross.

Workers started "work-to-rule action" Friday morning, in which employees at Canadian airports, land borders and other facilities performed duties to "the letter of the law." This action threatened "long and unavoidable delays" at Canada's borders and was expected to have a "dramatic impact" on plans to reopen the border to American travelers if negotiations were still ongoing Monday, according to the Public Service Alliance of Canada.

A news release from the PSAC and Customs and Immigration Union said the labor unions secured a tentative agreement for nearly 9,000 CBSA employees late Friday.

Employees had been fighting for greater parity with other Canadian law enforcement agencies, and the agreement includes better protections against “excessive discipline” at work, a new committee to address workplace culture, a paid meal allowance for uniformed members and a commitment to work toward introducing early retirement benefits. Negotiations started in January 2019, according to the release.

Even without the union strike, travelers interested in crossing the border next week can expect longer wait times than normal, since they will have to show additional documentation – including proof of vaccination and a coronavirus test – to cross.

Canada is set to open to fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents Monday at 12:01 a.m. EDT.

Special to USA TODAY 10Best

Greek wine is having a moment. Take it from wine director – and Greek wine expert – Evan Turner at Krasi Meze and Wine in Boston, Massachusetts.

"Everybody is far more adventurous with wine, spirits and food," says Turner. "Everyone wants to try something new and exciting, and to be on the cutting edge. That’s been great for Greek wine."

Turner’s first brush with the country was over 40 years ago. To this day, he still recalls the vivid details, from conversations to aura, of his first meal in Greece.

Turner went on to train as a sommelier and established Helen Greek Food and Wine in Houston, Texas. Since opening in 2015, Turner’s witnessed an uprise in Greek wines, especially in restaurants with 100 percent Greek wine lists throughout the country – he mentions Taverna Khione and Emilitsa, both in Maine, Taxim in Chicago and Milos Wine Bar at Hudson Yards in New York City.

Turner says the majority of Greek labels that make it stateside – around 85 percent – are from producers that are no more than two decades old. He clarifies, however, that the earliest winemaking in Greece dates back 6,500 years.

“There are all these beautiful old vineyards sitting around in Greece,” says Turner, who explains that when the Ottomans invaded Greece, families were still allowed to make wine for their personal use, so farmers planted vineyards in their backyards.

These are the vineyards that still exist today; some vines are as old as 400 years. Turner elaborates that due to the isolation of these vineyards, the vines avoided the phylloxera outbreak in the 1800s, and thus preserved these “unbelievably old” vines that produce grapes rich in flavor and history.

Turner emphasizes that it’s these indigenous grapes, along with the terroir, that are responsible for Greek wine’s most recognizable qualities: high acid, high tannins and lower alcohol (the average ABV runs between 12.5 to 13.5 percent).

“Everybody thinks of Greece’s beaches and white houses with blue roofs, and it’s actually one of the most mountainous nations in the world, with a lot of their soils sandy and volcanic in nature,” says Turner. “To enumerate them, Greek wines tend to be less jammy and fruity – whether they’re reds or whites – and more about these wonderful secondary flavors of earthiness, minerality and herbaceousness.”

As for what’s not in the wines, Turner explains that sugar is not added during the winemaking process, and new oak is used sparingly for aging, favoring stainless steel, used or “neutral” oak, instead. Wineries also tend to harvest early due to temperamental weather in the mountains, and in less volume, due to family-run constraints.

These minimalist techniques lend themselves to prominently natural, organic and biodynamic wines. The trending organic and biodynamic wine movement, therefore, creates a favorable opportunity in the market for Greek wine, in addition to the ongoing acceptance of orange wines. Turner says it’s these two movements, as well as the ability of sommeliers to exhibit the wines to customers, which will permit the category to thrive.

“It’s not a question of the quality of the wines, it’s a matter of getting them into customers’ hands,” emphasizes Marc Provencher, owner of Taverna Khione in Brunswick, Maine. “Most people who come in do not know about Greek wines or the grapes. It’s all about educating them.”

Tip:How a penny can save your spoiled bottle of wine

Education is especially important surrounding the grape varieties, with tongue-twisting nomenclature, like assyrtiko, aidani, limniona and moschofilero. Whether you’re a first-time consumer of these wines and unable to pronounce them or perhaps visited Greece and enjoyed a variety but don’t recall the label, Provencher suggests this difficulty as one of the hurdles for the category to overcome.

“If you have a wine that you like and cannot pronounce the name of the grape, you're probably not going to remember it for the next time,” says Provencher.

When it comes to educating diners at Krasi, Turner’s method is to relate the wines to familiar varieties. For white wines, Turner likens the crisp minerality of Santorini's assyrtiko to “the child of a stunning Sancerre and a bone-dry riesling.” Malagouzia, from northern Greece, is a richer, rounder variety that presents tropical notes and stone fruit on the nose and palate, similar to viognier.

Moschofilero from the Peloponnese (one of the coldest growing climates in all of Greece) is aromatically floral, like a white blend from Alsace, where you get notes of gardenia, jasmine, cinnamon and clove on the nose, but on the palate is bright and clean with a dry finish.

As for reds, agiorgitiko (originally from the south) is the most widely planted Greek red grape, frequently blended with Bordeaux varietals; its light to dark cherry notes draw comparisons to Chianti classico or Rioja reserva.

“It’s a great red wine to give to someone if they’ve never had Greek reds because it’ll feel the most familiar,” explains Turner.

Limniona, from just south of Mount Olympus, is reminiscent of an earthy pinot noir from Oregon. Lastly, xinomavro frequently gets compared to nebbiolo for its high acidity and tannins that Turner says “pairs gloriously with long-cooked meat dishes you so frequently see in Greece.”

In fact, Turner advises that all Greek varieties allow for exceptional pairings due to the meze style of cuisine the country is renowned for. “Greek wine has the greatest affability to food of any country,” says Turner. “Greek cuisine in general was never a one-plate, one-course meal, we pile stuff in the middle; so you’d want to make wines for that!”

As Greek wines continue to garner popularity in the United States, back in Greece, Turner hopes to see more oenotourism throughout the country. The Peloponnese currently draws the most attention for wine aficionados, but Santorini, Nemera and Crete are also authoritative starting points to a self-guided tour.

Turner predicts the eruption of wineries from lesser-known regions of Greece to continue to revolutionize the category.

He concludes, “Using rare indigenous grapes, from various far-flung areas across both the islands and the mainland, these wineries are at the vanguard of new Greek winemaking. They are the future.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Things had started to feel somewhat normal for Joshua Stokes and his family this summer with a family trip to a resort near San Diego and in-person visits with vaccinated friends.

But now, with the delta variant throwing a curveball in the world’s pandemic recovery plans, Stokes said he and his family are being more cautious.

Stokes, who is fully vaccinated, canceled two of his own trips this month and is pushing off plans to visit family members with his four kids, all of whom are too young to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Children 12 and older in the U.S. can receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but clinical trials on vaccinations among younger children are still ongoing.

“All of our elective travel plans right now are off the table until either the kids can get vaccinated or until cases die down again,” he told USA TODAY, noting he's concerned about breakthrough infections. Until then, “we’re not particularly interested in putting them on planes, in airports, through hotels, things like that.”

►Are crowds safe as delta variant spreads? Experts explain COVID risks at common gatherings

Health experts say travel can be risky given the rise of the delta variant, but each family will have to weigh the risks themselves and determine whether to follow through on vacation plans at the tail end of summer.The number of people in the U.S. hospitalized with COVID-19 has more than tripled over the past month to nearly 45,000 but still hovers far below the nearly 124,000 hospitalizations in January during the winter surge, according to CDC data.

“A lot of people and families went into the summer really feeling and hoping COVID was winding down, ... (but) the pandemic isn't done,” said Angela Bengtson, an assistant professor at Brown University’s department of epidemiology. “Every family has to look at what their own unique features are, where they’re going, what their tolerance for risk is and assess that.”

Should unvaccinated kids travel amid delta variant surge?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests people avoid both domestic and international travel until fully vaccinated, but does that mean parents with unvaccinated children should cancel their family vacations?

Short answer: it depends, according to health experts.

Staying home offers a much lower risk of transmission, but experts say travel can be important for children, socially and developmentally.

“The safest thing for anybody is not traveling. That’s going to limit your exposure the most,” said Bengtson, who has a 4-month-old daughter. “That said, a lot of families and people, after going through a year and a half in a pandemic, have put off seeing family or friends … so they are weighing these choices.”

Karl Minges, interim dean at the University of New Haven’s School of Health Sciences, said families shouldn’t necessarily rush to cancel a vacation now that COVID-19 cases are spiking but suggested they be mindful of how they travel.

Minges took a trip to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, with his husband and three children last month and spent time focusing on lower-risk activities like going to the beach and riding bikes. The family avoided the downtown area unless it was windy and less crowded.

“We just had to adapt," Minges said. "I would just say to adopt a plan to really embrace the great outdoors as much as possible.”

He added that a trip to a theme park or similar venue that would entail spending a lot of time crammed inside with strangers "might be worth reconsidering."

Susan Michaels-Strasser, an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center’s epidemiology department, encouraged families with children to carry on with their vacation plans as long as they take the right precautions.

“You weigh your benefits and your costs. Children over this past year have really lost a lot,” she said. “Life is not all or nothing. Do it wisely, use common sense.”

►Disney mask mandate:Disney World, Disneyland mandate vaccinations for employees, announce indoor mask requirement

►Are crowds safe as delta variant spreads:Experts explain COVID risks at common gatherings

Where can I travel with unvaccinated kids?

Michaels-Strasser said risk levels will vary based on where families travel and what they do.

Families should look at the transmission rates at their destination before committing to travel, she said. She suggested shifting toward open-air settings like beaches or exploring socially distanced venues that enforce mask-wearing, like museums.

“Any movement where people are coming in contact with others, the risk is there,” Michaels-Strasser said. “But it’s within a parent’s ability to reduce that risk as much as possible.”

The CDC has published a map highlighting countries with high COVID-19 transmission rates and offers guidance for international travelers based on foreign countries' COVID-19 data.

►Travel warning:CDC says travelers should avoid Greece, Ireland and other destinations, regardless of vaccination status

Should vaccinated adults travel if they have unvaccinated children?

The CDC says it’s safer to travel if vaccinated, but should parents with children go on solo trips?

Bengtson said it’s hard to make a blanket statement that applies to every situation. Risk will depend on how much the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in the destination and the vaccination status of the people in the area.

Health experts say it is possible for fully vaccinated parents to bring home the virus to their unvaccinated children. They recommend parents wear a mask in public, but they can take the mask off around their children when they get home.

“We are seeing increasing rates of children with the delta variant and children who are sick, partly because of the fact that this particular variant is so much more contagious,” said Jodie Guest, professor and vice chair of the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. “On the off chance that I have the delta variant, I don’t want to collect it and then bring it home.”

William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, added that COVID-19 infections in young children generally are less severe, but they can play a role in transmission.

What can parents do on vacation to protect their kids?

Health experts suggest families mask up indoors, reduce time inside or at crowded settings and follow social distancing protocols.

“As a parent, knowing that I have a kid that’s unvaccinated, we’re wearing masks indoors in all settings whether they’re required or not,” Bengtson said.

Choosing a vacation spot that enforces a mask mandate or opting to drive instead of fly can also help reduce the risk of transmission, according to Michaels-Strasser.

“It comes back to what we’ve known since the beginning is the most important thing, which is social distancing and wearing masks and reducing the number of people in a crowded space," she said. "There's no magic here."

Testing can also be a handy tool; the CDC suggests unvaccinated travelers test for the coronavirus both before and after trips.

►Delta's threat:CDC reveals data on why masks are important for the vaccinated and unvaccinated

Is the delta variant worse for kids?

The delta variant, which is thought to be as contagious as the chicken pox, is “a large concern,” according to Albert Ko, an epidemiology professor at Yale, but it’s not yet clear if the delta strain poses a greater risk to children than other versions of the virus.

Studies have shown that children are at a lower risk for infection and severe illness from COVID-19 than adults, but their share of new infections seems to be on the rise. Children accounted for only about 2% of new infections in March 2020 but more than 24% of new weekly infections by the end of May, despite accounting for only 16% of the population, according to data by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

More than 4 million children in the U.S. have tested positive for the coronavirus since the onset of the pandemic, and at least 358 have died from the disease, according to the pediatrics academy.

As of June 28, more than 4,100 children have been diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome children, or MIS-C, a rare but dangerous condition the CDC says is associated with COVID-19. Thirty-seven of those patients died.

“In areas of high transmissibility, spreading the virus is certainly a concern (for traveling families),” Ko said.

Experts say parents and other adults can help protect children from getting COVID-19 by getting vaccinated themselves.

►COVID data:At the start of the pandemic, kids made up 2% of new COVID infections. Now, they make up 24%.

When will kids be able to get vaccinated?

Pediatric hospitals and vaccine developers like Pfizer and Moderna are working together to wrap up clinical trials and plan to submit data by early fall.

“Based on that, an emergency use authorization review will be done by the FDA (to see) if the vaccines are safe and effective (for younger children), and, hopefully, they’ll be available sometime in the fall,” Ko said.

In the meantime, Ko said getting those 12 and above vaccinated is “key.” About 58% of eligible people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated as of Thursday, according to the CDC.

Hawaiian Airlines is the latest carrier to require employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, joining a growing number of big corporations that are responding to a surge in coronavirus cases.

The Honolulu-based company will require all U.S.-based staff to be vaccinated by Nov. 1, according to a memo sent by President and CEO Peter Ingram to employees on Monday.

"There is no greater demonstration of our values than ensuring the safety of others," Ingram's memo reads. "Safety is the foundation of air travel, and it is ingrained throughout our operation and service. This is no different. By getting vaccinated, we protect ourselves and those around us.”

The company plans to develop a program for its international staff that aligns with the vaccine accessibility in their countries. Employees can apply for medical and religious exemptions if eligible but will be tested for COVID-19 regularly.

Hawaiian Airlines spokeswoman Alex Da Silva said the company will be collaborating with unions and other stakeholders to figure out how to address employees who decline to get vaccinated and do not have medical and religious exemptions.

►Fact check:6 of the most persistent misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccines

Story continues below

United Airlines

Two other carriers, United Airlines and Frontier Airlines, updated their employee vaccine policies last week.

United Airlines will require employees in the U.S. to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by late October, perhaps sooner, and Frontier is asking all direct employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 1 or provide proof of a negative test on a "regular basis."

Company leaders at United called it a matter of safety and cited “incredibly compelling” evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines.

“We know some of you will disagree with this decision to require the vaccine for all United employees,” CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart told employees Friday. But, the executives added that “the facts are crystal clear: everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated.”

United, which has 67,000 employees in the United States, is the first major U.S. airline to announce it will require vaccination for workers. The airline has been requiring vaccination of new hires since mid-June. Unvaccinated workers are required to wear face masks at company offices.

The Chicago-based airline estimates that up to 90% of its pilots and close to 80% of its flight attendants are already vaccinated. They get incentives to do so.

The airline told U.S. employees Friday that they will need to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 25 or five weeks after the Food and Drug Administration grants full approval to any COVID vaccine — whichever date comes first. So far, the FDA has only granted emergency-use approval of the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Full approval is expected soon.

Each employee will have to send an image of their vaccine card to the company. Those who don't will be terminated, with exemptions granted only for religious or health reasons, officials said.

Employees who are already vaccinated or do so by Sept. 20 will get an extra day of pay, according to the memo from Kirby and Hart.

Frontier Airlines

Frontier required masks among employees in April 2020 and extended the policy to all passengers less than a month later. The company is also encouraging customers to get vaccinated through its Friends with Vaccines Fly Free program, in which vaccinated members of the Discount Den program can buy one discount fare and get one free fare for another passenger on the same itinerary. The deal is valid for purchases made by Thursday for travel between Aug. 21 and Oct. 30.

“As we continue to watch the rapid increase of new COVID-19 cases across the United States caused by the delta variant, I am concerned for the well-being of our team members, their families and friends,” Barry Biffle, Frontier president and CEO, said in a Friday news release. “The time has come to do what we can to help put an end to COVID-19.”

Biffle added that "the vast majority" of Frontier's employees have been vaccinated.

Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines

Like United, Delta Air Lines has operated vaccination centers for employees and recently began requiring the shots for new hires. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said last week that 73% of the airline's workforce is vaccinated.

Executives at other airlines have similarly encouraged their workers to get vaccinated, even offering bonuses and paid time off to get the shots, but haven't made them mandatory.

"We still are strongly encouraging our employees to vaccinate themselves and to share with us their vaccination status," Southwest Airlines told USA TODAY.

American Airlines echoed the urging: "We are strongly encouraging our team members to get vaccinated, and we are offering an incentive for those who do. American Airlines team members who get vaccinated are provided an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through our employee recognition platform.”

Airlines and other companies in the travel business have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, which led to sharp travel restrictions. The United States requires people entering the country, including U.S. citizens, to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, and the Biden administration plans to require non-U.S. citizens to be vaccinated before entering the country.

Also, tech giants Microsoft, Google and Facebook have said they will require proof of vaccination for employees and visitors to their U.S. offices starting this fall.

Last week, Tyson Foods announced it will require all U.S. employees to get vaccinated by November — notable because, unlike the tech companies, Tyson relies on many lower-paid workers who cannot do their jobs remotely. The president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union criticized Tyson for imposing the requirement while the vaccines still have only emergency FDA approval.

A few governments are getting involved. California and New York City will require employees to be vaccinated or face weekly testing, and the California mandate extends to workers in public and private hospitals and nursing homes.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Norwegian Cruise Line asked a federal judge Friday to block a Florida law prohibiting cruise companies from demanding that passengers show written proof of coronavirus vaccination before they board a ship.

Norwegian contends the “vaccine passport” ban, signed into law in May by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, jeopardizes the health and safety of passengers and crew and is an unconstitutional infringement on the First Amendment's free speech guarantee, among other things.

Norwegian attorney Derek Shaffer told U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams during a remote hearing the vaccination requirement for its passengers is especially needed as Florida has recently experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

“It's scary what is happening in Florida. Florida is a hot spot,” Shaffer said. “All we're doing is trying to protect our staff and passengers.”

►Cruise uncertainty:Florida's 'vaccine passport' ban creates ocean of confusion

►'100% vaccinated':Norwegian announces vaccine requirement for all passengers, crew on cruises

The lawsuit names state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees, who leads the Florida Department of Health. The state's attorney, Pete Patterson, said the law's aim is to prevent discrimination against passengers who don't get vaccinated.

“You can't discriminate against customers on the basis of their refusal to give you information,” Patterson said. “If it weren't for this law, there would be a vaccine passport required to get on a cruise ship.”

Williams did not immediately rule Friday on Norwegian's request for a temporary injunction halting the law's enforcement. Violations of the law could trigger a penalty of $5,000 per passenger, which Shaffer said would cause the company “irreparable harm.”

“This law should be fatal on arrival," Shaffer said, adding that the legislature and governor sought mainly to “score political points” in the heated national debate over getting the coronavirus vaccine.

The hearing comes as the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the validity of cruise line rules adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The appeals court recently upheld a Tampa judge's decision, hailed by DeSantis, making those CDC rules on how to resume cruise sailing into guidelines rather than requirements.

Miami-based Norwegian operates 28 cruise ships around the world, but only those boarding in Florida ports are affected by the state vaccine passport law. Once the ships leave Florida waters, the law no longer applies. Many cruise destinations, however, have their own vaccination requirements for passengers to go ashore.

Norwegian is planning an Aug. 15 cruise from Florida under its vaccination proof policy. If the law banning that policy remains in effect, the company said that ship won't sail – and Norwegian has also threatened to abandon Florida entirely over this issue.

“Simply stated, (Norwegian) cannot sail as planned unless and until Florida’s ban gives way,” the company said in court documents. “There is no adequate substitute for documentary proof when it comes to maximizing onboard safety.”

Other cruise lines, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, have already begun voyages from Florida with a variety of policies regarding COVID-19 vaccination.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A sightseeing plane crashed Thursday in southeast Alaska, killing all six people on board, including the plane's pilot, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The five passengers were Holland America Line cruise passengers, the cruise line said on Twitter.

"An MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Sitka located the wreckage at 2:37 p.m. and lowered two rescue swimmers who reported no survivors," the Coast Guard said in a statement.

The Coast Guard along with Alaska Wildlife Troopers, Alaska State Troopers, U.S. Forest Service and the Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad responded to the area of the crash, according to a statement from the Alaska Department of Public Safety, provided by public information officer Austin McDaniel. The Coast Guard discovered the crash site in "a steep mountainous area," the statement continued.

The identities of those killed in the crash were not immediately released.

The floatplane, an aircraft that can be supported by floats on water, left from Misty Fjords National Monument and "crashed near Ketchikan, Alaska, around 11:19 a.m. local time today," Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson Donnell Evans told USA TODAY in a statement.

The plane left from Misty Fjords and was on its way to Ketchikan.

The five passengers on the flight were from the Holland America Line cruise ship Nieuw Amsterdam, the company said in a statement. Holland America expressed its condolences on Twitter late Thursday.

"We can confirm that a float plane carrying five guests from Nieuw Amsterdam was involved in an accident in Ketchikan, and there are no survivors," Holland America said. "It was an independent tour not sold by Holland America Line. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the victims."

The ship stopped in Ketchikan on Thursday and delayed its afternoon departure after the plane crash. The company said it was making counseling services available to guests and crew.

The Nieuw Amsterdam was wrapping up a seven-day cruise in Alaska which departed from Seattle on Saturday. Ketchikan is a popular cruise ship destination, and passengers can take various sightseeing excursions while in port. Popular among them are trips to Misty Fjords National Monument, where visitors can see glacier valleys, snowcapped peaks and numerous lakes in the wilderness area.

.

The Coast Guard was first on the scene, responding Thursday morning to an emergency alert from a sightseeing plane in the area, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Kip Wadlow told the Associated Press.

This isn't the first aviation incident that has occurred in the area.

In 2019, two planes collided midair, killing six of the 16 people on board the two planes. Those planes were also carrying cruise ship passengers.

The plane involved Thursday, a de Havilland Beaver, was owned by Southeast Aviation LLC, Wadlow said.

"Our hearts are shattered at the loss of six people today," Southeast Aviation LLC said in a statement shared by spokesperson Bri Kelly. "We are thinking of and grieving with the families of the five passengers and our dear friend and pilot aboard the aircraft. We are cooperating with the first responders and agencies involved, including the U.S. Coast Guard, National Transportation Safety Board and Alaska State Troopers. All of us share in the anguish of this tragic incident, and our prayers go out to all affected."

The company on its website says it provides sightseeing tours to Misty Fjords National Monument and bear-viewing sites, along with air charters to other communities in southeast Alaska.

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate.

PARIS – France took a big step Monday into a post-pandemic future by requiring people to show a QR code proving they have a special virus pass before they can enjoy restaurants and cafes or travel across the country.

The measure is part of a government plan to encourage more people to get a COVID-19 vaccine shot and slow down a surge in infections, as the highly contagious delta variant now accounts for most cases in France. Over 36 million people in France, or more than 54% of the population, are fully vaccinated.

The special pass is issued to people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 or have proof of a recent recovery from the virus, or who have a recent negative test. The measure also applies to tourists visiting the country.

In the southern city of Marseille, several restaurant owners had decided not to check clients for the pass, an Associated Press reporter saw on Monday. Many consider it is not their job to enforce the measure.

►Italy 'Green Pass' rolls out:Proof of COVID vaccine, test or recovery needed for museums, indoor dining

►Europe travel:EU recommends lifting Europe travel restrictions for all US tourists, vaccinated or not

People without a pass where it is required risk a fine of 135 euros (about $160). The government said that for the first week of implementation, police controls will not lead to sanctions for noncompliance but instead will be an occasion to explain the law.

In hospitals, visitors and patients who have appointments are required to have the pass. Exceptions are made for people needing urgent care at the emergency ward.

The pass is now required on high-speed, intercity and night trains, which carry over 400,000 passengers per day in France, Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said Monday. It is also required on long-distance travel by plane or bus.

“We’re going to enforce massive controls,” Djebbari said.

Paper or digital documents are accepted.

Meanwhile, the Paris Saint-Germain soccer club will be allowed a capacity crowd for its first home game of the season against Strasbourg in the French league on Saturday. PSG said the Paris prefecture has approved 49,700 fans at Parc des Princes stadium, with spectators expected to show their virus passes.

Polls show that most French support the health pass.

Immediately after President Emmanuel Macron announced the measure on July 12, more than 1 million people in France made vaccine appointments in less than a day. Since then, at least 7 million people have received their first shot.

Yet the measure has prompted strong opposition from some people who say it compromises their freedoms by limiting movements and daily activities outside the home.

On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators marched in Paris and other French cities for a fourth consecutive week of protests against the measure.

The coronavirus pass has already been in place for the last month for cultural and recreational venues including cinemas, concert halls, sports arenas and theme parks.

The law also requires French health care workers to be vaccinated against the virus by Sept. 15.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hawaii is tightening COVID-19 restrictions amid an alarming spike in cases, but the state is not changing tourist entry requirements, at least yet.

Gov. David Ige said late Tuesday that restaurant and bar capacity will be reduced to 50% effective immediately. Capacity was raised to 75% in early July as vaccination rates climbed, welcome news to restaurant operators and visitors who have been scrambling to find reservations. But the dangerous delta variant dictates a cut in capacity, Ige said.

Hawaii is seeing a seven-day average of more than 500 cases a day and a test positivity rate of 7.25%, Ige said. Those figures a month ago: 60 cases a day and a test positivity rate of 2.25%.

"We need to take action, and we need to take action now,” he said.

He called restaurants and bars high-risk activities and said social distancing will be required. "There will be no mingling, and masks must be worn at all times except when actively eating or drinking,'' he said.

Ige said Hawaii is evaluating its Safe Travels program, which includes the most strict travel restrictions in the United States. Visitors must present a negative coronavirus test or be vaccinated to bypass the state's mandatory 10-day quarantine.

Visitors with upcoming trips have peppering travel agents and Hawaii travel message groups with questions about possible changes, including a return to pre-departure travel testing requirements for all visitors regardless of vaccination status. That was the case before July 8, when a vaccine exemption took effect.

"At this point and time we won’t be … making any specific changes to the Safe Travels program,'' Ige said.

The governor noted that the number of COVID-19 cases among visitors is "relatively low,'' at 1 or 2%. The bulk of travel-related cases are from residents returning to the island with infections.

►The good, the bad and the ugly:7 hours at Spirit's biggest hub on 7th day of meltdown

►Frontier passenger taped to seat:Allegedly groped, punched airline's crew

How can I save money on Allegiant?

Allegiant is offering introductory fares starting at $39 one way on these new routes. The rates are not available on all flights, and the airline says seats and dates are limited.

Keep in mind Allegiant operates an unbundled business model, meaning it offers low base fares and charges for carry-on and checked baggage as well as seat assignments. Make sure to factor those in.

Easily avoidable charges include booking and boarding pass fees. Allegiant charges $14.99 per segment per passenger for flights purchased through the Allegiant Air Call Center. The airline also charges $5 per boarding pass printed at "select domestic airport locations." Skip those by booking online and printing boarding passes at home.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"We're sorry."

The subject line on the email from Spirit Airlines at 5:20 a.m. Friday scared me. I was due to fly from Las Vegas to Dallas in two hours and figured the flight was canceled, a victim of the budget airline's multiday meltdown.

It wasn't. The letter from Spirit was an apology, complete with a $50 voucher, for what happened on my "recent rip," though I had zero issues on two Spirit flights the day before.

The pilot on the Las Vegas to Dallas flight also apologized, even though the flight departed early.

"If you've been affected by delays and cancellations over the last week, we do apologize," he said before takeoff. "We understand your frustration. Thanks for hanging in there with us."

Spirit CEO Ted Christie has been on an apology tour, too, telling USA TODAY Saturday he will continue to say sorry after more than 2,000 flight cancellations in a week. The airline scrubbed as many as 60% of its flights on the worst days as it struggled to get flight crews where they needed to be.

"Did we fail our guests over that period of time? We absolutely did," he said. "And we gotta fix that, and we gotta earn that back. It starts with an apology, but what it really is: We're going to earn the trust."

It might be too late for some passengers. Spirit's operational meltdown inconvenienced and frustrated tens of thousands of travelers, but it upended the lives of some, who were stranded for days by multiple cancellations at their own expense, and forced others to miss important events.

'I felt like I was held hostage by Spirit'

LeAnn Hilton was ordering a car service from Manhattan to Newark, New Jersey, last Tuesday when she decided to double-check her seat assignments on Spirit. The 35-year-old consultant had been in New York for a week with her three kids for medical appointments for the youngest, a 7-month-old daughter with a heart condition, and their first vacation since the pandemic.

The reservation said her flight to Austin, Texas, via Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was canceled. An email from Spirit soon confirmed it but didn’t mention anything about booking her on another flight.

Hilton kept calling Spirit until someone answered. The agent delivered bad news.

“Well, I can get you out in two days," Hilton said the agent told her. “I said, ‘Well, I need to go home tomorrow.’”

She saw a flight to Austin for sale on Spirit’s website, but the agent said it wasn’t available. She said she asked to be put on another airline but got a no. Ditto for meal vouchers or hotel vouchers for two nights.

“She said, ‘No, we’re not authorized.’”

The only option Hilton was given: a nonstop flight to Austin for four on Thursday morning. She thought about driving home but couldn’t find a rental car in New York or New Jersey.

Hilton said she found another New York hotel for two nights at $300 a night and made the best of it with the kids, planning outdoor activities around the city to be cautious of COVID-19. The girls ran out of underwear, so she picked up some at H&M.

“For two days, I was like, that’s not bad, we can do that,’’ she said.

Her attitude changed just after midnight on Thursday when another email from Spirit arrived. The nonstop flight to Austin was canceled.

She called Spirit again in the middle of the night and was on hold for 3½ hours before being disconnected. She tried again. (She also tried the airline's online chat, reached out on social media and, given some work as a paralegal, even appealed to Spirit's legal department during her ordeal.)

Hilton's 10-year-old daughter grew so tired of the automated hold message telling passengers they are required to wear masks she cracked, "We require you to take us home."

Spirit was in crisis mode by then, and when Hilton finally reached someone Thursday, the representative said the earliest Spirit could get her out was a flight on Sunday, five days after she was supposed to depart.

"It's just like 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York': I can only make it home after I level up with Marv in Central Park and fight with the pigeons," she said. "I felt like I was held hostage by Spirit.''

The family finally made it home Sunday afternoon, but not without flight delays and Spirit's insistence that she still needed to pay for seat assignments.

Hilton estimated she spent about $1,600 on New York hotels because of the flight cancellations, not to mention money spent on food, baby necessities and extra days of airport parking, pet sitting and house sitting. She also missed work.

Late Sunday, Hilton fired off a lengthyemail to Christie and other Spirit executives, detailing what she called a nightmare and seeking reimbursement for her expenses and a refund for their tickets.

An excerpt: "Though this does not capture the entirety of the nightmare, I share all of this because you can’t actually imagine, and I can’t fully put into words, what it’s like to be stranded in a foreign city, a vacation attempt ruined after a bad 18 months (during the pandemic), bleeding money you didn’t choose to spend, missing work, consoling small children in small hotel rooms, worried about an infant, not sleeping, stressed and spending countless hours calling an airline that doesn’t answer and sends one sentence emails 'Your flight has been cancelled.'"

She's not hopeful she'll get anything, given the airline's poor customer service when she was stuck in New York and is insulted by the $50 goodwill vouchers the airline sent to all passengers affected by the flight woes.

The last time Hilton had a flight issue on the way for treatment for her daughter, in July, Delta Air Lines automatically rebooked her on the next flight, gave her two meal vouchers, a hotel stay, a ride to the hotel, a refund of her seat upgrades and a $175 voucher.

"Spirit doesn’t care at all, and (that) is a good reason to never travel a budget airline," she said. "When things go wrong, they can’t or won’t fix it."

A quick airport wardrobe change and $150 Uber ride for a funeral after an all-nighter at San Juan airport

Ekow Yankah got word of funeral plans for a family friend when he was on vacation in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with his family in late July.

The law professor scratched his plans to return to New York from San Juan and bought a ticket on Spirit, so he could make it to Michigan for the service on Sunday, Aug. 1.

He was booked to fly from San Juan to Fort Lauderdale, Spirit's biggest hub, late on Saturday, July 31, and from Fort Lauderdale to Detroit early the morning of Aug. 1.

His longtime friend whose dad had died unexpectedly was going to pick him up at the airport for the drive to East Lansing for the funeral.

Yankah sensed he was in for a rough day at San Juan International Airport when he arrived before lunch to drop his wife and children off for their Spirit flight. They don't usually fly the budget airline, but the flight times lined up with other family members' flights. The check-in line was 2½ hours long, and they barely made their flight to Boston, he said.

Yankah spent the afternoon working at an airport business center before check-in for his 10:30 p.m. flight to Fort Lauderdale. He emerged around dinnertime to find out his fight was canceled, sending him scrambling to find a way to get to Detroit in time for the funeral. Yankah said he waited in an interminable line to get a new flight and, hopefully, a hotel and meal voucher.

He lucked out and got a flight to Orlando for 4:30 a.m. Sunday. He pressed the agent for vouchers, and a supervisor told him he'd receive the vouchers via email.

The hotel voucher showed up in his inbox 20 minutes later, but it was for a hotel in Orlando, the city he was rerouted to, not San Juan. The meal vouchers wouldn't work, he said.

"It was just a comedy of errors," Yankah said. "It was so bad, it's just hard to describe."

He stood in line for hours to try to get another voucher, but the San Juan hotels were sold out, so he was stuck at the airport overnight.

He was starving and saw fellow passengers ordering UberEats, so he ordered from Burger King.

"It was like $25 for a Whopper meal," he said.

When Yankah landed in Orlando the next morning for the flight to Detroit, he grew worried when he saw pilots at the gate but no gate agents.

The flight boarded, but passengers were soon deplaned because of a fuel leak on a plane next to his flight. His scheduled arrival into Detroit was getting later and later. He told his friend he would take an Uber when he finally landed.

Yankah started live-tweeting about Spirit because the experience had become so "comical" and frustrating,

"I am not someone who tweets about these things," he said. "I’m not a 20-year-old cool kid that live-tweets everything."

The flight landed in Detroit at 2:40 p.m., 20 minutes before the funeral started. Yankah did a quick wardrobe change in the Detroit airport and hopped in an Uber for the 90-minute ride. The cost: $150.

"It was the worst trip I’ve ever taken," he said. "It was just a parade of incompetency. And it made me miss (most of) a funeral that meant a lot to me."

He called Spirit's $50 flight vouchers "laughable."

"I should at least be made whole," he said.

'I was going to Costco and getting $2 pizza'

Nick Havener nabbed a cheap Spirit ticket to visit his Boston University college basketball teammate in Phoenix for a long weekend in late July.

The 25-year-old digital marketing professional was due to fly back to Santa Ana, California, on Monday, Aug. 2. He arrived at Sky Harbor International Airport around 1 p.m. for the 3 p.m. departure for the short flight.

About 30 minutes before takeoff, Spirit's bright yellow plane was at the gate, but boarding hadn't started, he said.

"The flight attendants seemed confused because they didn't see their new flight crew," he said. “They kept announcing on the intercom, ‘We're still trying to get your flight ready.’”

The announcements came about every 15 minutes for 2½ hours, he said. Then something strange: Havener and other passengers were notified via email that the flight was canceled.

He got another email that he was booked on a flight at the same time on Tuesday. He scrambled and found a place to stay at a friend of a friend's house. On a cot.

Tuesday, another email from Spirit: His flight was canceled. He tried to reach someone to get on another airline so he could get home but had no luck.

"My mom was a flight attendant for 20 years. I know that they can do that," he said.

He called American to try to get on a flight, but the hold time was four hours. He didn't book a flight on his own because the tab was $160.

"Unfortunately, I don't have the funds, and I didn't have the ability to get my money back from Spirit right away," he said.

He was rebooked on the same Spirit flight on Wednesday and that, too, was canceled. Three canceled flights in three days.

All he got from Spirit: a $7 meal voucher on the first day. He used it for macaroni and cheese at Panera Bread.

"I had to scramble in terms of eating every day," he said. "I was going to Costco and getting $2 pizza."

Havener heard about the $50 vouchers Spirit sent customers but has not received one.

BERLIN — Travelers in Germany have been warned to expect disruptions this week as train drivers go on a nationwide strike.

The head of the GDL union, Claus Weselsky, said the strike would start with all cargo trains at 7 p.m. Tuesday and expand to include passenger trains from 2 a.m. Wednesday until 2 a.m. Friday.

German train operator Deutsche Bahn said only about a quarter of its long-distance trains will run on Wednesday and Thursday, with priority given to connections between Berlin and cities in the west, as well as between Hamburg and Frankfurt. The company urged passengers to refrain from unnecessary travel and said it would lift coronavirus-related restrictions to allow every seat to be booked.

►Traveling to Germany?:Unvaccinated travelers will have to show a negative COVID-19 test to enter

►Germany cancels Oktoberfest again:Bavarian officials say there are too many risks in hosting the celebrations

Train travel is popular among Germans and tourists alike. Germany reopened to U.S. travelers in late June, and many German states are currently on summer vacation with travelers relying heavily on trains to get around.

Customers who have already bought tickets for the coming days can request refunds.

Deutsche Bahn is rejecting union demands for a 3.2% salary increase and a one-time “coronavirus bonus” of 600 euros ($703). The company has lost billions since the start of the pandemic and from recent floods that destroyed or damaged numerous railroad tracks.

The GDL union went on nationwide strikes eight times in 2014 and 2015 to push through its demands.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico is now requiring COVID vaccination for all guests of hotels and short-term rentals like Airbnbs.

It's part of a wider move to control a spike in COVID-19 cases blamed largely on the delta variant.

As of Monday Aug. 16, vaccinations are also required for all hotel employees, government contractors, and workers at health facilities, including laboratories and senior care centers.

“We cannot lower our guard,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. “There are vaccines for everyone. Vaccinations are the solution.”

People who refuse to get inoculated will be required to submit a weekly negative COVID-19 test.

Violators will face up to a $5,000 fine or six months in jail, with few exceptions.

►Pandemic first:Puerto Rico cautiously welcomes first cruise since COVID-19, Carnival's biggest ship yet

►The delta variant is spreading:What travelers should know

Pierluisi previously announced that all government employees who work in-person would need to be fully vaccinated, also effective Aug. 16.

The additional requirements come as Puerto Rico reports an 11% transmission rate this month, compared with a 1.4% rate reported in late June.

Carlos Mellado, Puerto Rico’s health secretary, said the majority of cases are being driven by the delta variant. He noted that 20% of current hospitalizations are people who have already received two vaccine doses and added that the government will not issue health certificates unless proof of vaccination is submitted.

The U.S. territory of 3.3 million people has reported more than 128,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,500 deaths. Some 76% of people have received at least one dose.

Broadry Newsroom

Are you starting to hit that proverbial mid-summer slump? It’s natural. The days are long and hot, you’ve grown tired of your daily slathering of sunscreen and the kids are starting to mumble those two dreaded words: I’m bored. Summer burnout is real. Jam-packed social calendars making up for lost time, shuttling children from one camp to the next, even travel to-and-from vacation can be exhausting.

Here are more than a half dozen trending activities, according to Broadry’s analysis of the latest Google trends, that may just reignite your summertime swagger.

Parasailing

Looking for a quick adrenalin rush? The most heart pumping part of parasailing, after securing your harness to the line attached to a giant parachute (known as a parasail wing), is standing on the stern of the boat and eagerly awaiting for it to gain enough speed to whisk you into the sky. After that initial belly-flipping blitz, the gentle lift off gives way to a peaceful, gradual ascent until you reach about 300 feet above the water, where an overwhelmingly peaceful experience is in store.

Most parasailing adventures can accommodate solo riders, a duo or even a trio, so bring along our BFF(s). Those seeking a more adventurous ride can talk to the captain about adding a few dips throughout the ride.

Biking

The beauty of taking in the world on two wheels is that a good amount of people know how to do it from a young age, it can be as intense or as mellow as you like, and it’s the rare gem of being a multigenerational activity. Pedal power might be just what you need to simultaneously unplug and recharge, and meets the mark when it comes to boosting your physical and mental health. A low-impact exercise that can still get the heart pumping (without a gym membership!), biking can be enjoyed nearly everywhere, from urban to bucolic settings.

For an insanely fun and unique ride, take a spin on a tandem bike. Both riders control the speed and pace of the ride, but the person in the lead, the “captain,” bears the most control, so a bicycle built for two can be ideal when the second rider (called the “stoker”) may not have the ability to ride a bike completely on their own.

► In the market for a bike? What to look for, how much you can expect to spend

Splash pads

No pool? No problem. Splash pads, often found in public parks, amusement parks and gathering spaces, are usually free. They're total kid magnets and are the ideal antidote to the sweltering summer sun.Watch little ones frolic and squeal with glee as powerful streams of water shoot through the air with powerful force, cooling down everyone in its path. Often choreographed, the airborne water chutes are captivating to watch and lure in people of all ages.

Trade overcrowded pools for these awesomely refreshing refuges – if you can locate one. None in your area? Backyard splash pads are on the rise, too. Easily inflatable – albeit less intense – versions of public splash pads that can be found at major retailers and online for under $50.

Blueberry picking

The spoils of summer are many, and one of the best ways to experience it all is with our palette. Roadside farm stands, in all their Rockwellian charm, are some of the season’s most resplendent seasonal staples, but rolling up your sleeves and plucking blueberries right from the bush is like capturing a little piece of summer magic right in your hand.

The sweet, juicy, lip-staining berry is arguably the season’s greatest culinary pleasure, whether enjoying the ripened antioxidant-rich fruit from the moment you give it a gentle tug off the plant, woven under the flaky lattice of a blueberry pie, amid the crumbly bits of fresh scone, speckled throughout fluffy pancakes, or extending their longevity by making preserves or a luscious jam.

Exploring caves

Exploring cazes, more formally called “caving” or “spelunking,” is nothing new, considering the lure to do so dates back millennia. While it is one of the oldest recreational pastimes, it’s also one of the more dangerous. Cave exploring should be well-planned in advance as some caves have hazards not immediately seen to the curious eye.

According to the U.S. Forest Service, cave explorers should wear proper attire, sturdy footwear, gloves, a hard hat with headlamp and maybe even knee and elbow pads if you expect to do some crawling. First-timers might consider a guided cave tour, whether through private companies that specialize in cave or cavern tours or through state park systems or the National Park Service.

Hiking

One of the many outdoor activities many people turned to while social distancing, hiking not only burns a ton of calories but cleanses the mind and feeds the soul. As such, the American Hiking Society calls hiking “nature’s therapy” and says trail usage saw a 200% increase in urban areas during the quarantine-heavy early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Terms related to hiking were mentioned more in June than in any other month in the past year. Additionally, hiking-related terms were mentioned 27% more in June of 2021 than in June of 2020, according to media monitoring service Critical Mention.

The U.S. boasts an extra ordinary trail system; one that’s diverse in terms of terrain and distance, so don’t let your skill level, or lack thereof, hold you back. Whether journeying solo or hiking with a buddy, always take precautions out there, including having adequate hydration, familiarity with the trail or a map of your trek, and ideally, letting someone know where you’re headed (remember, your cell phone may be useless, depending on location).

Whitewater rafting

Got action? Adventure seekers take note: if white water rafting isn’t on your bucket list, consider this a sign. You really don’t know the meaning of teamwork until you’re perched upright in a rubber inflatable raft (that looks completely penetrable) with a bunch of helmeted strangers paddling relentlessly to try and have some control over Mother Nature’s fury as rushing, turbulent waters careen over centuries-old rock formations creating rapids that don’t exactly look “human friendly.” Okay, that might be an exaggeration...depending on the class of rapids you’ll be navigating.

Let’s back up. There are six levels of classification for whitewater rapids; the lowest being the easiest (little to no waves, minimal steering of the raft required) and the highest being wildly difficult. Whitewater canoe/kayak slalom have been Olympic sports since the 1972 Munich Games. (However, they didn't become permanent additions until Barcelona in 1992.)

Nearly all white water rafting companies have a guide aboard every trip who knows the waterway well and can “read” a river as they call out directives from the back of the boat.

Consider a multi-day rafting trip to get a diverse range of rapid experience while camping along the river. And, before you head out, grab a pair of water sports shoes (with traction, if available) on Amazon. Based on sales, slip-ons are the most popular variety, in the outdoor recreation category.

Boating and jet skiing

The National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) made headlines earlier this year when they reported that boat sales skyrocketed in 2020, with the industry garnering $47 billion (includes marine products and services). That’s an increase of 9% from 2019 and a 13-year high. An estimated 10% of those were first-time buyers. Since then, boat sales haven’t slowed down. But not every consumer is looking for the considerable demand and responsibility (and cost!) that comes with a boat.

While the Broadry team recently highlighted the demand for inflatable paddle boards from brands like Bote and Aquaglide, sales of personal watercraft, including Kawasaki's Jet Ski, Yamaha's Waverunner and Sea Doo, were also estimated to be up 8% in 2020, with the NMMA citing accessible entry-level price points attracting buyers – many of those first time buyers. With so much of the workforce able to work remotely more than ever before, people can spend more time with family and friends enjoying recreational activities while chasing that elusive work/life balance.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Southwest Airlines flight attendant based in Las Vegas died Tuesday from COVID-19, according to his family and co-workers.

Maurice "Reggie" Shepperson, a native New Yorker whose brightly colored pants earned him the nickname Skittles during training in 2014, tested positive for the coronavirus in early July and had been fighting it in a hospital for a month, according to Marcia Hildreth, a Southwest flight attendant who called him her best friend.

He was on a ventilator and died early Tuesday, his mother, Dawn Shepperson, told USA TODAY. A nurse told her it was from COVID-19.

Shepperson, 36, was fully vaccinated, his mother and Hildreth said. He loved to fly and took every precaution, wearing a mask, constantly washing his hands, sanitizing surfaces and wiping everything down in hotel rooms, Hildreth said.

"It hurt me so bad because it was just so quick," Dawn Shepperson said. "I didn't have time to really even acknowledge what is going on. This is mind-blowing. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real."

Hildreth said she's in disbelief, too.

"I'm going to miss my friend," she said.

Southwest spokesman Brandy King confirmed a Las Vegas-based employee died Tuesday but declined to provide details. Shepperson's mother said the airline reached out to her, and Hildreth said Southwest contacted her after Shepperson's death and pulled her from a work trip, so she could fly home to Las Vegas Wednesday.

"We are heartbroken over the loss of our Southwest employee," King said in a statement. "Out of respect for the family, we do not have additional information to share."

COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but they’re not 100% effective in preventing infection. A small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they're exposed to the virus that causes it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, vaccinated people who have breakthrough infections are much less likely to get severely sick or die.

Southwest and other airlines have not released statistics on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among flight crews. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents flight attendants at United, Frontier, Spirit and Hawaiian airlines, among others, estimated that 4,000 flight attendants across all airlines in the USA have contracted the virus and 20 have died.

Shepperson worked throughout the pandemic and was pulled from work several times because of COVID-19 exposure, Hildreth said. He never tested positive until July, she said.

Co-workers called Shepperson a high flyer: He picked up more work trips than most, partly to make money, partly to travel wherever he could.

Kiki Lee was in Shepperson's flight attendant training class in 2014 in Dallas, where Southwest is based.

After five weeks of training, she and other newly minted flight attendants just wanted to go home. Shepperson started using his employee flight perks. One of the first trips, Lee recalls, was to China.

"He was hitting the skies right way, using his benefits," Lee said. "He loved working, and he loved the perks."

Shepperson's Facebook page shows his travel adventures, including several work trips to Hawaii. In June, he took his mother along for the ride. His mother said that was one of his last work trips for Southwest before he tested positive.

"He loved travel, and anybody who knew him knew he loved his mother," Lee said.

Travis Pittman, another Las Vegas-based flight attendant for Southwest, met Shepperson when he relocated to Nevada from Tampa in 2016.

"That New York exterior can come off hard and all that," he said. "But he was just like a teddy bear, so sweet on the inside and very, very loving. Just very fun to be around."

Dawn Shepperson said Reggie, whom she raised on her own after his father died when he was 14 months old, made her proud every time she walked through a Southwest terminal at an airport.

“People that I don't even know, once they find out I'm Reggie's mother said, ‘Ma’am, you did a beautiful job. This is a fine young man,’” she said. "As a mother, I feel so blessed and proud because that's all I wanted in life was to raise my son right."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. State Department have each downgraded their travel advisories for Canada, which recently began allowing vaccinated American tourists to cross its borders.

The State Department moved the country from level 3, "reconsider travel,” to level 2, "exercise increased caution,” on Tuesday. The CDC also moved the country from level 3,indicating a high level of COVID-19, to level 2, a moderate level, this week.

The State Department says travelers heading to level 2 countries should “be aware of heightened risks to safety and security.” The CDC advises travelers to make sure they are fully vaccinated and warns that unvaccinated travelers at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid nonessential travel to level 2 destinations.

►'Let’s get this thing going':Canada opens border to fully vaccinated Americans for travel

Canada began to welcome back fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents on Monday.

Nearly 63% of Canada's population has been fully vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins, and the country reported 9,765 new cases in the past week. Meanwhile, the U.S. reported 817,052 cases in the past week with nearly 51% of its population fully vaccinated.

Despite Canada's move to reopen its borders to vaccinated American travelers, the U.S. extended its border restrictions for nonessential travel last month. The restrictions, which affect land and ferry travel at its borders with Canada and Mexico, are set to remain in place until at least Aug. 21.

The CDC also moved several destinations to its highest travel advisory tier earlier this week. As of Monday, the agency warns that Americans should avoid travel to France, Israel, Iceland, Aruba, Eswatini, French Polynesia and Thailand, regardless of vaccination status.

Greece, Ireland, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other destinations were added to the CDC's Level 4 advisory list earlier this month as countries around the globe grapple with the highly contagious delta variant.

In an interview with the USA TODAY Editorial Board last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said CDC guidance urging people to limit themselves to travel only when necessary still holds.

The CDC recommends all travelers, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks, self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and get tested three to five days after they travel. On top of those travel precautions, the agency also recommends that unvaccinated travelers get tested one to three days before leaving the U.S. and that they self-quarantine after travel for up to 10 days.

All passengers ages 2 and older flying into the United States must present a negative coronavirus test taken no more than three days before their flight or proof they recovered from the virus within the past three months.

HELENA, Mont. — A grizzly bear that fatally mauled a Montana man near Yellowstone National Park this spring was likely defending a moose carcass and may have continued to aggressively guard the cache — charging at rescuers and investigators — because of a recent fight with another grizzly, investigators theorized.

Charles “Carl” Mock, 40, of West Yellowstone, was attacked by the bear near the Baker's Hole Campground, about 2.5 miles north of West Yellowstone on April 15. He called 911 just before 3:45 p.m.

Mock was able to deploy bear spray, but the 411-pound male bear stayed in the area, bluff charging and stalking rescuers, according to the investigation of Mock's death that included information from federal, state and local agencies. The 20-year-old bear was shot and killed after it charged a team of wildlife investigators who returned to the scene the next day.

A study of its gastrointestinal contents discovered moose hair, cartilage and muscle tissue, along with other tissue that was later determined to be from another grizzly bear, investigators said.

The grizzly bear tissue and its location in the bear's lower stomach suggested the bear “had possibly been in a very recent fight with another grizzly bear defending the moose carcass or fought taking the moose carcass from another grizzly bear,” the report stated. “If this were the case, those interactions could have contributed to (the bear's) overall aggressive defense of the moose carcass” toward Mock, initial search and rescue personnel and the investigation team.

Mock, a backcountry guide, was on the phone with dispatchers for 49 minutes while he tried to direct searchers to his position. He told a dispatcher he had been taking pictures.

Mock's camera, which was found at the scene of the attack, was placed in his vehicle, and friends removed his vehicle from the area. Investigators did not have the opportunity to examine the camera at the time and when they looked at the memory card on April 17 there were no pictures from the Baker's Hole area or any from the day of the attack, the report said.

“Whether any pictures were removed before my observation is unknown, as control was lost over the camera,” Montana game warden Robert Pohle wrote in his report.

Mock suffered a severe head injury and was taken by ambulance to the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho, where he underwent extensive surgery. He died two days after the attack, having not spoken to investigators.

►America's deadliest national parks:'Understand your limits, take care'

On April 16, seven investigators and a dog hiked into the area aware that the bear may still be around and that if it did charge them it may have to be killed, the report stated.

The team stopped and fired cracker rounds and hollered several times as they hiked into the area. As they got close to a boggy, wet area, they could see brush and a small tree move.

“All members stopped and readied in case it was the bear and it charged,” the report said. “Within seconds the bear silently charged out of the brush, head down, ears back and running full out."

The bear was briefly slowed by deep snow before digging its way clear and beginning to charge again.

Pohle's report said he and two others called out that they were going to fire shots at the bear. A forest service officer fired some final shots to prevent unnecessary pain and suffering on the part of the bear as well as to protect the public.

It was not known if Mock knew the carcass was in the area or why he was in the location, Pohle wrote.

And although you don't need a negative COVID test to enter Mexico, you'll need one to re-enter the U.S. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires that all air passengers returning to the United States from abroad show either a negative COVID-19 test result no more than three days old or documentation of recovery from COVID-19.

Many resorts in Mexico offer free testing for departing guests so inquire about that when booking. If yours does not, you can also find a list of testing sites on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Disney lovers who've missed Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party will have to pay a lot more for the closest thing to it during Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary.

Starting prices for this year's Disney Very Merriest After Hours are nearly twice as expensive as Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party in 2019. The popular holiday event was canceled last year amid the pandemic.

The two holiday celebrations actually sound strikingly similar.

Like its predecessor, Disney Very Merriest After Hours will be held after hours at the Magic Kingdom on select nights leading up to Christmas, Nov. 8 through Dec. 21. It requires a special ticket, not included with regular park admission. Capacity is limited, so guests can expect shorter lines on select rides. There will still be snow falling on Main Street, U.S.A., a holiday-themed parade and Minnie’s Wonderful Christmastime fireworks.

►Not so scary after all:After-hours Halloween events return to Disney World, Disneyland this year

►New Disney Star War hotel:A Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser stay will cost more than a mortgage

There are a few notable differences between the two holiday celebrations.

How is Disney Very Merriest After Hours different from Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party?

Disney Very Merriest After Hours is later and shorter than Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party. The festivities run from 9 p.m. until 1 a.m., but ticket-holders can enter the Magic Kingdom as early as 7 p.m. for a total of six hours in the park. In 2019, Mickey's Very Merry Christmas ran from 7 p.m. until midnight, but guests could enter the park at 4 p.m. for a total of eight hours in the park.

Guests will not be able to get up close to their favorite characters, who in the past donned their holiday finest for the festivities. Throughout the pandemic, up-close character meet-and-greets have been suspended to allow for social distancing.

►Disney World, Disneyland:Masks required for all indoor attractions, transportation

Snacks will be different, too. While endless cookies, hot cider and hot cocoa were included with admission to Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party, Disney Very Merriest After Hours guests will get ice cream, popcorn, bottled drinks and unspecified holiday treats. Of course, additional food will available for purchase.

Pricing is also different this year.

How much are Disney Very Merriest After Hours tickets?

Tickets range from $169 to $229 for select nights in November and December and start at $249 for Dec. 19 and 21 on Disney World's website. Annual passholders and Disney Vacation Club members can get $10 off on select dates in November.

Tickets for the 2019 holiday event started at $94.

This year's tickets go on sale on Aug. 20 for the general public. Disney resort guests will be able to buy tickets starting Aug. 17 for event nights during their stay.

Only Disney Very Merriest After Hours tickets are accepted for entry to the event. Not only will standard theme park tickets be rejected, but regular Magic Kingdom guests will have to leave the park before the event starts.

TORONTO — The Canadian government will soon require all air travelers and passengers on interprovincial trains to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said Friday that includes all commercial air travelers, passengers on trains between provinces and cruise ship passengers. The announcement comes less than a week after Canada opened its borders to fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents.

The government is also requiring vaccinations for all federal public servants in the country.

“As soon as possible in the fall and no later than the end of October, the Government of Canada will require employees in the federally regulated air, rail, and marine transportation sectors to be vaccinated. The vaccination requirement will also extend to certain travelers. This includes all commercial air travelers,” Alghabra's office said in a statement.

►Canada travel:Here are 11 things to know before a trip.

Currently, air travelers entering Canada are required to show proof of negative COVID-19 PCR test results taken within 72 hours of their scheduled departure. Unvaccinated air travelers must take another COVID-19 test upon arrival to Canada and toward the end of a mandated 14-day quarantine upon arrival.

Alghabra said additional measures are needed to encourage more people to get vaccinated and to protect the hard-won gains the country has made to flatten the epidemic curve.

Canada has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with about 63.37% of its population fully vaccinated according to data from Johns Hopkins University and Medicine. Even so, cases are starting to creep up again in what Canada's top health official dubbed a fourth wave this week.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. State Department each downgraded their travel advisories for Canada earlier this week, but the U.S. border is set to remain closed to Canadian tourists through at least Aug. 21.

The Canadian government is working on a vaccine passport that can be also used in Canada.

Air Canada, Canada's largest domestic and international carrier, released a statement in support of the new measures, adding that it will work with the government and its unions to implement the new policy.

"Although Air Canada awaits further details about today's announcement on mandatory vaccinations, it is a welcome step forward in the evolving measures to protect the health and safety of airline employees, customers and all Canadians," the statement reads.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Germany added the United States to its "high-risk" area list and will soon tighten entry restrictions for unvaccinated travelers who had recently been in the U.S.

Starting Sunday, travelers who have recently spent time in the U.S. will need to be fully vaccinated or demonstrate an “important reason” for entering. Those who are unvaccinated or unable to show proof of recovery will need to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival. The quarantine period can end on the fifth day with proof of a negative coronavirus test.

Previously, unvaccinated travelers had to show a negative coronavirus test to enter Germany.

The change comes as the U.S. faces its fourth wave of COVID-19, driven by the highly contagious delta variant. The country reported more than 900,000 new COVID cases in the past week with nearly 52% of its population vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins University and Medicine.

►COVID-19 and travel:Growing number of travelers cancel trips as COVID cases surge

►Is it safe to travel?:Some may be better off canceling plans during COVID-19 surge, experts say

Israel, Turkey and Vietnam and other countries were also added to Germany’s high-risk list, joining destinations like the United Kingdom, Spain, India and Mexico.

Germany has been open to tourists from the U.S. since June 20, shortly after the European Union added the United States to a list of countries it believed could see the gradual lifting of travel restrictions. The recommendation is not binding, and each country in the bloc can enforce its own travel restrictions.

The EU has yet to remove the U.S. from its safe travel list, despite the U.S. maintaining a travel ban on most European countries. Restrictions against the European Schengen area were first implemented in March 2020 and prevent travel to the U.S. for most people from:

Austria

Belgium

Czech Republic

Denmark

Estonia

Finland

France

Germany

Greece

Hungary

Iceland

Italy

Latvia

Liechtenstein

Lithuania

Luxembourg

Malta

Netherlands

Norway

Poland

Portugal

Slovakia

Slovenia

Spain

Sweden

Switzerland

Monaco

San Marino

Vatican City

German Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed President Joe Biden on the travel ban during a meeting last month. Biden said at the time that his team was reviewing the travel restrictions, but no changes have been made.

“The administration certainly understands the importance of international travel,” Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response team coordinator, said in a press briefing last week. “(But given) the prevalence of the delta variant, the United States will maintain the existing travel restrictions at this point.”

MADRID – Spain endured its hottest day of the year Saturday, when temperatures topped 115 degrees Fahrenheit, while authorities in Italy expanded the number of cities on red alert for health risks to 16 as a heat wave engulfed Southern Europe.

Provisional data showed that Spain matched its all-time high temperature of 116.42 degrees F in Montoro, Cordobia, in the southern region of Andalusia. If confirmed, that matches the country’s heat record, set in the same city in July 2017.

Europe’s overall heat record came in 1977 when Athens hit 118.4 F.

In the southern Spanish province of Granada, where the mercury rose to 113.7 F, few people ventured outside. Those who did sought shade and stopped to take photos of public thermometers displaying the rocketing temperatures. Ice cream parlors did a brisk trade, and some restaurants installed sprinklers to spray mists of water over sweating guests.

European heat wave:Temperatures soar across Europe during summer heat wave

Dominic Royé, a climate scientist at the University of Santiago de Compostela, said the hot air from the Sahara Desert that has brought days of heat and fueled hundreds of wildfires across Mediterranean nations shows no signs of ending soon.

“The heat wave we are experiencing now is very extreme, and a lot of people are saying that it’s normal, as we are in summer. But it’s not, not this hot,” Roye said.

The World Meteorological Organization said temperatures recorded in the Mediterranean region go well beyond the typical hot, dry August weather and “are extreme and what we might expect from climate change.”

Spain’s State Meteorological Agency noted that 24 heat waves have been recorded over the past decade, twice the number in each of the previous three decades.

“It is important to stay in cool places and to stay hydrated and to pay special attention to babies and elderly, vulnerable or otherwise dependent people. Extreme precautions should be taken to avoid starting forest fires,″ said Rubén del Campo, spokesman for the Spanish meteorological service.

Elsewhere on the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal’s government placed 14 of the country’s 18 districts on a state of alert through Monday night because of the “significantly increased risk” of wildfires, as temperatures were forecast to surpass 104 F. That would still fall short of Portugal’s highest recorded temperature of 117.1 F in the inland Alentejo region in 2003.

Italians sought respite at the sea and in the mountains from the aptly named Lucifer anti-cyclone that was bringing hot air from Africa during Italy’s peak summer holiday weekend. Authorities raised concerns about older adults and other people at risk as they expanded heat warnings to 16 cities.

Heat wave:At 119 degrees, Sicily may have recorded Europe's highest temperature in modern history

Temperatures in Italy rose as high as 98.6 F in Rome, Florence and Bologna, all places that the Health Ministry put on red alert.

High temperatures were forecast to continue through Sunday, the traditional Ferragosto holiday on the religious feast of the Assumption of Mary, which marks the annual summer holiday exodus from Italian cities.

In Rome, drinking fountains provided relief, while authorities kept tourists away from ornamental fountains such as the famed Trevi Fountain, fearing imitators of Anita Ekberg soaking themselves like she did in “La Dolce Vita.”

“I put my head under the water at each fountain, drinking a lot, staying in the shade as much as I can,″ said Alessia Pagani, who was visiting from the northern city of Brescia.

Storms in the north were forecast to bring the first signs of relief Monday.

“More than anything else, fresh air from the Atlantic will bring a coolness and greater ventilation that will sweep away the humidity and make the air much more breathable,” Lt. Col. Filippo Petrucci of the Italian air force’s weather service told RAI state TV.

The heat wave aggravated wildfires that consumed forests in southern Italy, Greece, Turkey and North Africa.

Across the Mediterranean Sea, North Africa has been sizzling for days. Algeria’s National Office of Meteorology issued a special bulletin Saturday saying temperatures in regions across the north were above 115 F, spiking up to 116.6 F, the online TSA news agency reported.

Scientists have said climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas drives extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The travel landscape has changed dramatically in just a few short weeks.

The United States is on its fourth COVID-19 surge thanks to the highly contagious delta variant, with cases bouncing back to levels not seen since February 2020. Other countries are also reporting more COVID-19 cases.

That leaves travelers, many of whom booked trips months ago when case counts were low, wondering whether or not to follow through with their plans.

"The delta variant is a different beast," Richard Webby, who helps lead St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s Infectious Diseases Department, told USA TODAY. "This virus is everywhere. ... As far as (whether or not it's safe to) travel, it depends on what you're trying to do."

►COVID-19 and travel:Growing number of travelers cancel trips as COVID cases surge

►Canceling or postponing a flight due to delta? What to know about airline ticket policies

How does the COVID-19 delta variant affect travel?

Health experts say travel risks vary from person to person, but it may be time for certain travelers – especially those who are unvaccinated or susceptible to severe illness from the virus – to postpone their trips.

“If you’re vaccinated and fully immunized against this virus, then it poses a slight increased risk to you,” Webby said. But among the unvaccinated population, “this virus is going to cause more cases; it’s going to spread more easily and more rapidly. … If you’re not vaccinated, now is not a good time to travel.”

The U.S. reported 131,917 new cases on Wednesday, surpassing levels not seen since February, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Over 90% of counties in the U.S. are experiencing high or substantial transmission, and the CDC suggests both vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers avoid travel to more than 70 countries due to high COVID-19 case counts.

“The delta variant is around twice as transmissible as the variant that caused such a horrific period in our history in December and January,” said John Swartzberg, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public Health. “It’s going to be a lot easier for you to get infected this time than it was (during the last surge of cases).”

Dr. Purvi Parikh, an immunologist who has worked as an investigator for some of the COVID-19 vaccine trials,advises vaccines for travelers since the majority of the recent COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are among nonvaccinated people. She also suggests checking local guidance and infection rates before booking a flight.

“You may want to defer travel if an area is having a spike or surge,” she said. “Be adaptable (because) much of this is dynamic and changing.”

►CDC travel alerts:CDC says travelers should avoid France, Israel and other destinations

Is it safe to travel during the COVID-19 delta surge?

Rachael Piltch-Loeb, a researcher at Harvard’s School of Public Health, says there’s no “one-size-fits-all” piece of advice for travelers debating whether or not to postpone their trips. The level of risk depends on travelers’ vaccination status, whether they have an increased risk for severe illness and what the infection rate is like at their destination.

She added that breakthrough cases remain rare, but should be taken into consideration by vaccination travelers.

A small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if exposed to the virus that causes it but is much less likely to get severely sick or die, according to the CDC.

“I would think about my own risk tolerance, meaning am I OK if I get a little bit sick?” Piltch-Loeb said. “If you are uncomfortable with the potential that you may be infected ... then your decision-making may be a little bit different.”

The capacity of the destination’s health care system should also be considered, now that certain hospitals are running out of available ICU beds.

“That would be a concern if I was planning to travel (to those areas),” Piltch-Loeb said. “I would want to feel comfortable that in the event anything happened to me, COVID or otherwise, I could be treated by the medical system there.”

Piltch-Loeb recommends getting tested ahead of travel, regardless of destination or vaccination status, and opting for safer forms of travel such as driving. She also suggests people go back to “key virus mitigation strategies,” such as mask-wearing, social distancing and avoiding time indoors with people whose vaccination status is unclear.

“If I'm driving to a cabin in the woods and planning to spend most of my time outdoors, that's a little bit different than flying somewhere and planning to be sightseeing in another country,” Piltch-Loeb said.

►Fact check:Hospitals staff near max capacity, but COVID-19 isn't business as usual

►Breakthrough cases:COVID-19 transmission among the fully vaccinated is rare, but possible, experts say

What sort of travel restrictions are in place today?

Travel restrictions vary across countries.

Some are continuing to ease roadblocks to entry – both Canada and the United Kingdom lifted travel restrictions against American travelers in recent weeks– while others are starting to introduce new safety protocols or reimpose restrictions that had been pushed aside ahead of the busy summer travel season.

Puerto Rico will require all hotel and short-term rental guests to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or submit a weekly negative COVID-19 test starting Monday, and both France and Italy require proof of vaccination to enter restaurants and other venues.

“If I was a country that didn’t have a lot of this (delta variant) activity going on, it’s a virus that I would want to keep out of my community,” Webby said. “I would certainly be imposing travel restrictions from places where this virus is rampant. Unfortunately, at the moment, that’s a lot of places around the globe.”

Parikh believes the variant “will definitely impact international travel.”

“Various parts of the world may go back on lockdown depending on spread and vaccines and testing will be required,” she said via email. "(Some countries) may have to reinforce lockdown, travel bans, masking and quarantines, depending how bad it is.”

She added that the easing of restrictions will depend on countries’ vaccination efforts, and “many are behind.”

Popular tourist destinations in the U.S. are starting to reimpose COVID-19 restrictions, as well.

Mask mandates are resurfacing in destinations across the U.S. like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and Hawaii has cut its restaurant and bar capacity down to 50%. Other cities, like San Francisco and New Orleans, now require proof of vaccination for indoor events.

The CDC cautions Americans to make sure they are fully vaccinated before traveling and recommends all travelers, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks and self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms. If traveling internationally, fully vaccinated travelers should also get tested three to five days after travel. Unvaccinated people traveling both domestically and internationally are advised to get tested one to three days before and three to five days after travel and self-quarantine seven days after returning.

Special to USA TODAY 10Best

Greece has reopened to tourism, but this year will see safety-minded travelers being more discerning about just where they want to lay their head, and seclusion and distancing may be keywords for the next year. With this in mind, Mystique, a hideaway resort voted one of the top 20 hotels in Greece and Turkey, is the perfect destination.

Mystique is managed by Kanava Hotels & Resorts, a Greek company that specializes in private villas with properties on Santorini and Paros, as well as a boutique hotel in Mani in the Peloponnese.

Carved into the volcanic cliffs below the village of Oia, northern Santorini's most charming whitewashed hamlet, Mystique is an exclusive hideaway that features private villas and suites, two pools and a vantage point that looks out on the calderas, volcano and captivating Aegean Sea.

The scenery makes it the perfect spot for romantic escapes, honeymoons or just those in need of a bit of pampering surrounded by exquisite natural beauty. The resort is designed to show off Cycladic architecture, mixing gentle curves and sculpted arches into light-enhancing spaces, with cobbled paths connecting all of the resort's enticing features.

Guests here can opt for luxury suites and private villas, some of which even have their own private fitness room and feature unique designs, personal plunge pools and jacuzzis, in addition to plenty of other enticements. Balconies offer dreamy views of the Aegean, as well as of the caldera surroundings in this one-of-a-kind destination.

There are 41 suites and villas to choose from, led by the large freestanding Mystery Villa, which comes not only with an expansive outdoor terrace and private pool, but also an NOHrD bike, swing bells and wall bars in its personal fitness room.

You've got a choice of restaurants for dining, ranging from the gourmand Lure, headed by renowned French chef Olivier Campanha, where traditional Greek and Mediterranean dishes are given contemporary twists, to the open-air Charisma, serving Mediterranean fare above the sea.

Chef Campanha will also create a degustation menu with dishes available for pescatarians and vegans, as well as meat eaters, served out on your own private terrace away from the crowds and looking out at the Cycladic island archipelago below.

Mystique also boasts the Secret Wine Cave, paying homage to Santorini's prowess as a grape growing paradise. Guests can book private dinners here and eat alongside the 150-year-old wine cellar that holds a large collection of excellent local Santorini wines.

If the sun, sea and gastronomy get to be too much, you can also avail yourself of the resort's Elios Spa, a sanctuary for renewal and renovation. Wellness treatments promise to be high on the wish list, and you can treat yourself here to signature treatments using natural ingredients.

You can even opt for a range of body therapies, from wraps and scrubs to massages and facials. The resort also offers sunrise yoga sessions, the perfect way to welcome an Aegean morning.

Venturing out from the resort, it's not far to the picturesque narrow alleys of old Oia town, which is also the best place on the island to watch the magnificent sunsets from up on the clifftops, or from the old castle ruins. The more actively-inclined may want to hike down (and up!) the 350 stairs from the village leading to the fishing port at Amoudi Bay.

Other island escapes include the unique black sand beach of Kamari, the ruins of the ancient trading site of Akrotiri, and a trip up through the traditional village of Pyrgos, which features the island's most stunning panoramas seen from its hilltop Kalisti Castle, which is the highest point on the island.

The combo of privacy and the deep blue Aegean waters of the Mediterranean just below are unbeatable, and Mystique is about as romantic, secluded and pampering as it gets. For top island escapes, you'll be hard-pressed to beat the barefoot luxury options here, not to mention being able to isolate and have plenty of time and space away from the crowds.

If you're looking to "self quarantine" in elegance, have a knockout "staycation," or just a plain old sublime holiday in a wonderful spot, a visit to Santorini and Mystique makes for an excellent summer travel choice.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Three months ago, Jackie Henderson of Oregon finally felt comfortable enough with the country’s COVID-19 case counts to book a trip with her husband and three kids to a family reunion in Pennsylvania.

Their trip, scheduled for later this month, has since been canceled. Henderson said her family didn't feel safe traveling with their kids, all of whom are too young to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

“I just thought flying six hours on a plane is like being in a petri dish, and then we're going to walk into this family reunion with about 80 people, and the majority of them are over age 65," Henderson said. "I just really didn't feel like it was responsible for us to do that.”

Henderson joins a growing number of travelers who have been second-guessing plans amid a surge in COVID cases. About one-third of American travelers surveyed by marketing firms Longwoods International and Miles Partnership have postponed travel because of the delta variant, compared to a quarter of travelers two weeks prior, according to the Aug. 4 survey of 1,000 adults.

“Even a little bit of a dip here is concerning for businesses that have already been in a difficult position,” said Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy for the U.S. Travel Association trade group. “I think we're still very optimistic, and there is still a strong desire for folks to be out there … but we need to get back to a more-consistent state.”

►Is it safe to travel?:Some may be better off canceling plans during COVID-19 surge, experts say

Hotels, airlines noticing more cancellations

Optimism around travel has plummeted since early June, hitting a year-to-date low of 20.4% as of Aug. 6, according to surveys of more than 1,200 American travelers from research firm Destination Analysts.

The firm’s most-recent report found over half of American respondents expect travel to get worse in the U.S. over the next month, and 23% canceled travel plans because of the delta variant.

That attitude shift comes as COVID-19 cases spike across the country, with the highly contagious delta variant making up more than 80% of all cases as of the end of July, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Airlines and hotels are starting to feel the effects.

On Thursday, hotel research firm STR eased its growth projections for 2022, citing a lack of business travel to supersede leisure travel as the summer winds down.

"With more concern around the delta variant as well as delays in companies returning their employees to offices, it’s possible that businesses wait until early 2022 to put their people back on the road,” STR president Amanda Hite said in a news release.

Marriott International spokeswoman Julie Rollend told USA TODAY that the company has seen some cancellations for group bookings later this year that could be related to the spread of the delta variant, but added that cancellations have “slowed significantly” compared to earlier in the pandemic.

Southwest Airlines' outlook for third-quarter revenues dipped after the company noticed an increase in trip cancellations in August, according to a Wednesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company pinned it on the rise of COVID-19 cases.

Glenn Fogel, president and CEO of Booking Holdings Inc., told USA TODAY that the company saw a “modest pullback” in July’s booking trends compared to June, but noted that bookings were still up from the second quarter.

“When infections were going up because of delta, you would see cancellations in those particular areas (with more COVID-19 cases),” Fogel said. “But it doesn't change the long term at all. The long term is, pandemics all end. They do. This will end, too.”

Southwest and AAA have both recently noted that Labor Day travel remains strong despite the uptick in COVID-19 cases, and other travel executives have echoed Fogel’s long-term optimism, including United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.

“Certainly, over the medium to the long term there'll be some ups and downs, but I think that air travel is going to continue to recover,” Kirby told NBC Nightly News earlier this week. “The silver lining of what has happened with the delta variant is it's driving much higher vaccination rates across the country, and at the end of the day, that's the only thing that's going to really get us out of this crisis.”

A little over half of all people in the U.S. are fully vaccinated.

►Tracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution:How many people have been vaccinated in the US?

Travelers' response to COVID delta variant

While many Americans will follow through with plans, the way they travel has changed.

Kyle Baker, 26 of Kansas City, Kansas, has been to Las Vegas four times and Florida once since being fully vaccinated but draws the line at cruises, especially now that COVID-19 cases are up. While he had been considering a cruise trip in December 2019, Baker said watching the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship unfold in February 2020 was “terrifying.”

“That makes my anxiety go crazy,” he said. “Even at the very beginning of COVID, I was of the mindset of, I’m not going to do a cruise, I wasn’t going to go out of the country. … I’m just scared I won’t be able to get back easily.”

►COVID-19 on a cruise ship:Six cases emerged on my Royal Caribbean cruise. Here's why I didn't panic

Others, like 74-year-old Doris Wright, feel perfectly safe on cruises thanks to their heightened safety protocols. Wright plans to take a 21-day cruise in October.

“I am confident in the new protocols the cruise lines have set up to combat this variant,” she wrote to USA TODAY. “I'm a world traveler and I have been going (nuts) without travel."

Nicholas Sanford of Charlotte, North Carolina, plans to go to Greece with his partner later this month, despite the hassle of having to complete additional COVID-related forms to enter and test for COVID before returning.

He added that the two are vaccinated and “regular mask wearers,” which makes him feel more at ease despite reported COVID-19 breakthrough cases.

COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but a small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if exposed to the virus that causes it, according to the CDC. Vaccinated people who have breakthrough infections are much less likely to get severely sick or die.

“When we purchased the tickets, we were both vaccinated, so we felt really confident that this would be fine. ... Now with the delta variant, there’s just more anxiety around the trip,” Sanford said. “Our tickets are nonrefundable, so at this point we’re going to go and we’re just crossing our fingers.”

►Cruise safety:Six COVID-19 cases emerged on my Royal Caribbean cruise. Here's why I didn't panic

Is it safe to travel during the delta surge?

Amber Schmidtke of Kansas City, who is an associate professor of biology at the University of Saint Mary and former CDC employee, postponed a family vacation to Hawaii two weeks ago.

The vacation was booked in March, and Schmidtke expected a pediatric vaccination to be approved by this point. Without it, she said she doesn't feel comfortable traveling with her unvaccinated child.

Children 12 and older in the U.S. can receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but clinical trials on vaccinations among younger children are still ongoing.

“The risks (to travel with an unvaccinated child) just felt much worse than they did a year ago,” Schmidtke said. “The thought of being in a high-risk environment, potentially an airport terminal ... it seemed like a bridge too far.”

►Travel alert:CDC, State Department downgrade travel alerts for Canada

Health experts say travel risks can vary based on many factors, such as vaccination status and the destination's transmission rates.

In an interview with the USA TODAY Editorial Board last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said travelers should follow CDC guidance and restrict themselves to only necessary travel.

The CDC recommends all travelers, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks and self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms. If they’re traveling internationally, fully vaccinated travelers should also get tested three to five days after travel. Unvaccinated people traveling both domestically and internationally are advised to get tested one to three days before and three to five days after travel and self-quarantine 7 days after returning.
