@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Scores of wildfires racing across much of the Northwest could be energized this week by a resurgence of high winds and heat, forecasters warned Monday.

The historic Dixie Fire has destroyed at least 873 buildings and threatens thousands of others across four Northern California counties. More than 100 major blazes are raging through 15 Western states, authorities say.

"An extremely challenging stretch is in store for area firefighters over the upcoming days as episodes of gusty winds will precede the building heat," AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said.

The forecasting service said cities such as Seattle and Portland got a sprinkling of rain late last week after long dry spells, but hot, gusty and smoky conditions are on the way.

Thick smoke that held down winds and temperatures in many areas also brought havoc to air quality. Denver on Saturday had the worst air quality in the world, according to IQair.com. On Monday the city had yielded the top spot – to Krasnoyarsk, Russia – but still ranked seventh in the world, just behind Salt Lake City.

Twenty-five major fires were burning in Montana, the most of any state. Idaho had 20, Oregon 16, Washington 13 and California 11. Temperatures could climb 25 degrees above average in some areas this week, worsening the already intense drought across the region, AccuWeather said.

The return of the winds and intense heat does not bode well for more than 20,000 firefighters battling the blazes. Mark Brunton, operations section chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the live trees in many areas have a lower fuel moisture than kiln-dried lumber at a lumber yard.

“It’s that dry, so it doesn’t take much for any sort of embers, sparks or small flaming front to get (a fire) going," he said.

The Department of Energy is investing $2.2 million into wildfire prevention technologies to help fight future fires.

“Climate change is driving extreme heat and drought, leading to more frequent and severe wildfires,” said Deputy Secretary for the U.S. Department of Energy, David Turk. “By partnering with industry and leveraging the advanced capabilities at DOE’s National Labs, these projects will expand real-world solutions at scale to help secure the electric grid that powers our communities and our daily lives.”

A red sky and a road on fire: How this man 'barely survived' California's Dixie Fire

California’s fire season is on pace to surpass last year's, which was the worst in recent recorded state history. Since the start of 2021, more than 6,000 blazes have destroyed more than 1,260 square miles of land – a larger area than the state of Rhode Island and more than triple the losses for the same period in 2020, according to Cal Fire figures.

Firefighters have been able to tamp down growth of the River Fire, a blaze south of the Dixie Fire that broke out Wednesday and destroyed 68 homes.

The Dixie Fire was more than 750 square miles Monday night and remained just 22% contained, according to Cal Fire. It had scorched an area larger than the city of Los Angeles.

The blaze, named for the road where it started July 14, surpassed last year’s Creek Fire as the largest single fire in California history but is still about half the size of the August Complex. That was a series of infernos caused by lightning in 2020 and is considered the state's largest wildfire overall.

The cause of the blaze is under investigation, but Pacific Gas & Electric said in two separate reports to the California Public Utilities Commission that it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines. A federal judge ordered PG&E on Friday to give details by Aug. 16 about the equipment and vegetation where the fire started.

The smoke clearing out on eastern portions of the Dixie Fire meant crews that had been directly attacking the front lines would be forced to retreat and build containment lines farther back, said Dan McKeague, a fire information officer for the U.S. Forest Service. On the plus side, better visibility should allow planes and helicopters to return to the fight.

“As soon as that air clears, we can fly again,” McKeague said.

Northwest of the Dixie Fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, hundreds of homes remained threatened by two fires that continued to grow. About a quarter of the McFarland Fire was contained. New evacuation orders were issued Monday for residents near the Monument Fire, which was only about 3% contained.

WASHINGTON – Members of the U.S. military would be required to have a dose of COVID-19 vaccine beginning Sept. 15 under a plan announced Monday by the Pentagon and endorsed by President Joe Biden.

That deadline could be pushed up if a vaccine receives final FDA approval or infection rates continue to rise.

“I will seek the president’s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon" licensure by the Food and Drug Administration, "whichever comes first,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a memo to troops, warning them to prepare for the requirement.

He said that if infection rates rise and threaten military readiness, “I will not hesitate to act sooner or recommend a different course to the President if l feel the need to do so. To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force.”

More:What we know about federal vaccine rules, paid leave, potential $100 payments

Austin's plan provides time for the FDA to give final approval to the Pfizer vaccine, which is likely early next month. Without that formal approval, Austin would need a waiver from Biden to make the shots mandatory. Biden has made it clear he supports that.

In a statement Monday, Biden said he strongly support's “Austin’s message to the Force today on the Department of Defense’s plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for our service members not later than mid-September.”

Biden said the country is on a wartime footing and “being vaccinated will enable our service members to stay healthy, to better protect their families, and to ensure that our force is ready to operate anywhere in the world.”

Austin's memo to the military went out Monday.

Austin said the military services will have the next few weeks to prepare, determine how many vaccines they need and how this mandate will be implemented. The time is a nod to the bitter political divisiveness over vaccines and the likelihood of opposition from state and federal governments, members of Congress and the American population.

Troops often live and work closely together in barracks and on ships, increasing the risk of sickness rapidly spreading. Any large outbreak of the virus in the military could affect America's ability to defend itself in a national security crisis.

The decision will add COVID-19 vaccine to a list of other inoculations that service members are required to get. Depending on their location, service members can get as many as 17 different vaccines.

Austin's memo said the Pentagon will comply with Biden's order for restrictions on federal personnel who have not been vaccinated. Those restrictions include masks, social distancing and travel limits.

According to the Pentagon, more than 1 million troops are fully vaccinated and 237,000 have received one shot. The military services vary widely in their vaccination rates.

The Navy said more than 74% of all active-duty and Reserve sailors have been vaccinated with at least one shot. The Air Force said more than 65% of its active-duty and 60% Reserve forces are at least partially vaccinated.

Military officials have said the pace of vaccines has been growing, and some units – such as sailors on a warship – have seen nearly 100% of their members get shots. The totals drop off among the National Guard and Reserve, which are much more difficult to track.

Some unvaccinated service members have suggested they'd get the shots once a vaccine is required, but others are flatly opposed. Once vaccines are mandated, a refusal could constitute failure to obey an order and may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Army guidance includes counseling soldiers to ensure they understand the purpose of vaccines and the threat the disease poses. The Army noted that if a soldier "fails to comply with a lawful order to receive a mandatory vaccine, and does not have an approved exemption, a commander may take appropriate disciplinary action."

Military service officials don't collect data on the number of troops who have refused other mandated vaccines, such as anthrax, hepatitis, chickenpox or flu shots over the past decade. And they didn't provide details on the punishments any service members received as a result of refusal.

Officials said they believe the number of troops refusing other mandated vaccines is small. And the discipline could vary.

Service members can seek an exemption from any vaccine – either temporary or permanent – for reasons including health issues or religious beliefs. Regulations involving mandatory vaccines say anyone who had a severe adverse reaction can be exempt, and those who are pregnant or have other conditions can postpone a shot.

Military commanders have struggled to separate vaccinated recruits from unvaccinated recruits during early portions of basic training across the services to prevent infections. For some, a mandate could make training and housing less complicated.

Navy officials said this week that there has been only one case of COVID-19 hospitalization among sailors and Marines who are fully vaccinated. In comparison, the Navy said, there have been more than 123 hospitalizations "in a similarly sized group of unvaccinated sailors and Marines." It said fewer than 3% of its immunized troops have tested positive for the coronavirus.

The other military services did not provide similar data.

USA TODAY NETWORK – FLORIDA

The state "could" defund the salaries of district superintendents and county school board members who mandate mask wearing in schools, according to a statement from Gov. Ron DeSantis' office.

The statement comes as the latest salvo in an ongoing battle over mandating masks in schools, a fight that has flared in school districts across the country as the pandemic resurgesas the school year is set to start.

The governor's spokeswoman, Christina Pushaw, released the following language Monday afternoon:

"With respect to enforcing any financial consequences for noncompliance of state law regarding these rules and ultimately the rights of parents to make decisions about their children's education and health care decisions, it would be the goal of the State Board of Education to narrowly tailor any financial consequences to the offense committed.

Dems ask for local control:Florida Democrats denounce DeSantis' mask mandate ban, urge local school districts to mask

"For example, the State Board of Education could move to withhold the salary of the district superintendent or school board members, as a narrowly tailored means to address the decision-makers who led to the violation of law."

At least one superintendent offered an immediate defiant response. Leon County Superintendent Hanna told school officials at a meeting Monday afternoon "you can't put a price tag on someone's life, including my salary."

“We want to make sure that children also have access to a high-quality education but they can’t if they’re sick and in the hospital,” he added. Hours earlier, Hanna announced that students in elementary and middle schools will be required to wear masks as the upcoming school year begins in Tallahassee.

Leon joins several other Florida counties — including Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Orange and Palm Beach — that have already announced mask mandates in public schools.

Angry parents have flooded school board meetings in Florida and across the country both supporting and opposing face covering requirements on schoolchildren.

At one meeting of the Buncombe County Board of Education in North Carolina, for example, a group of parents opposing the district’s mask mandate tried to "overthrow" the current board and instate themselves into the positions over the question of mask mandates.

Related:Protesters object to Buncombe County Schools' mask mandate, attempt to 'overthrow' board

Late last month, DeSantis issued an executive order that prohibits county school boards from imposing masking requirements on students. And last week, the Department of Health and Department of Education OK'd emergency rules to allow parents to make the decision for their children to wear masks.

In an email, Andrew Spar — president of the Florida Education Association, the statewide teachers union — said DeSantis "needs to set aside his political goals and focus on the safety of our students.

"He must listen to the people who are ultimately responsible for the overall health and well-being of all students and stop these heavy-handed tactics," he added. "He can do the right thing by not playing politics during this public health emergency.”

Requests for comment on DeSantis' announcement are pending with the Florida School Boards Association and the Florida Association of District School Superintendents.

As part of a longer statement to the USA TODAY Network-Florida, DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw said that, "as a father of 3 children, (the governor) cares about every child in our state and trusts families to make the right decisions for their own children.

"Anyone who feels safer wearing a face covering is free to wear one, and any parent who wants his or her child to wear a face covering has the right to make that choice."

But, she added, the governor remains opposed to requiring kids to wear masks in schools, saying he believes "there are potential downsides to masking children for 8 hours per day, from a developmental, emotional, academic, and medical perspective.

"These potential downsides are largely unexplored ... This is (his) philosophy: Protecting individual rights and every family’s freedom to choose what is best for their own kids."

The accident happened around 1:15 a.m. Saturday morning near Salt Lake City, according to the Utah Highway Patrol.

Authorities said Angelica Dhondup was "traveling home from her wedding" in her Toyota Corolla when a silver Toyota pickup driving on the wrong side of the highway hit Dhondup's car head-on. Dhondup suffered fatal injuries from the accident while a 20-year-old female passenger had non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to a hospital.

Family members told KSL-TV Dhondup was on her way home with her cousin to drop off wedding presents and was still in her wedding dress. After the crash, Dhondup's friend Tayler Craft said Dhondup called her sister to say she was hurt and couldn't breathe before she died.

"She can't even go to her honeymoon. She can't even come home to her kids," Craft told KSL. "She just got married five hours ago."

The driver of the pickup and a passenger were helped out of the vehicle by a passerby. Authorities said the driver stole the passerby's truck before he was apprehended by responding officers. The passenger fled on foot but returned to the scene.

The driver of the Toyota pickup, identified as Manaure Gonzalez-Rea, 36, was arrested and taken to Salt Lake County Jail. Gonzalez-Rea is charged with a DUI, automobile homicide criminal negligence DUI, reckless driving and failure to remain at an accident involving death and theft, according to court records. Cans of beer were found at the scene of the crash.

USA TODAY

Scientists, activists and environmental groups across the nation were quick to weigh in with their own observations and concerns Monday about the dire findings in the latest report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Across the country and the world, scientists zeroed in on the report's underscoring that climate change is here and now, that the time to avert catastrophe is winding down but that solutions are still possible.

The 3,000-page report was described by the IPCC as a "code red for humanity."

Here's a selection of quotes from the report's co-authors, leading climate scientists, officials and others:

Gina McCarthy, White House National Climate advisor, on Twitter

The IPCC report “confirms what we already know: climate change is an urgent threat that requires bold action. That’s why we’ve launched a whole-of-government response to the climate crisis. And we’re going to create good paying jobs along the way. There’s no time to waste.

Michael R. Bloomberg, United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions, founder of Bloomberg LP

“To respond to the climate crisis with the urgency that is required, it’s clear what we need to do: Drive down carbon emissions and transition to a clean energy economy – and quickly. We’ve made some great progress recently, but this report is sounding an alarm about how much more we need to do, and how tight time is getting. If more governments and businesses take bold action, we can still avoid the worst impacts of climate change and build a better future for our children and grandchildren.”

Heather Zichal, CEO of the American Clean Power Association

“Climate change is a global threat that requires international collaboration and the findings released today by the IPCC note there are policies and government action that can be enacted to drastically reduce carbon emissions.

As Congress debates infrastructure legislation and prepares for the budget reconciliation process, this report shows that our leaders need to realize the immediate national security threat climate change poses to our country and future generations. As wildfires and hurricanes occur more frequently, the human and economic devastation they cause will only intensify if we do not take immediate action now.

Al Gore, former vice president, on Twitter

"We need climate action NOW. We cannot rely on vague pledges with distant deadlines. We need concrete plans to phase out fossil fuels in the near term. As the scientists at the (IPCC) make clear: there is no time left to waste.

But importantly, the (IPCC) report shows that we still have a path forward to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C—though that path is narrowing by the day.

That's why this is our moment to heed the warnings of the world's scientists. We have the solutions we need to rapidly transition to a net-zero economy and I am optimistic that we will meet this moment."

Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Global Environment Facility CEO and chairperson

I feel both alarmed and emboldened by the latest IPCC report, which shows that climate change is occurring much more quickly and with more extreme effects than we previously anticipated. ... The tragedy of forest fires burning all over the world this year has shown us just how damaging rising temperatures can be for human life and nature. Changing this story for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren is the most important thing we can do."

Fred Krupp, Environmental Defense Fund president

“The report makes clear that if we don’t move aggressively to cut the pollution heating our atmosphere, we are guaranteeing a less stable, less habitable and less prosperous world now and in the future.

“This report also provides a road map for slowing the rate of warming and protecting our communities from even more instability. For the first time, the IPCC highlights the importance of short-lived, highly potent pollutants such as methane, which alone accounts for at least 25% of the warming we are currently experiencing. The report quashes any remaining debate about the urgent need to slash methane pollution, especially from sectors such as oil and gas, where the available reductions are fastest and cheapest. When it comes to our overheating planet, every fraction of a degree matters – and there is no faster, more achievable way to slow the rate of warming than by cutting human-caused methane emissions.

Lori Lodes, Climate Power, executive director

“Congress can’t kick the can down the road any longer, they must prepare for what’s in front of us, stop the worst of climate change and build a stronger, clean energy economy. If lawmakers put aside differences to act, it means jobs, sustainable neighborhoods, healthier communities, cheaper energy costs, and ultimately, if done right, a more just and equitable world. But Congress must act now. Not in two months, not next year or next decade. Now.”

Nafkote Dabi, Oxfam climate policy lead

“Amid a world in parts burning, in parts drowning and in parts starving, the IPCC today tables the most compelling wake-up call yet for global industry to switch from oil, gas and coal to renewables. Governments must use law to compel this urgent change. Citizens must use their own political power and behaviors to push big polluting corporations and governments in the right direction. There is no Plan B."

Miya Yoshitani, Asian Pacific Environmental Network executive director, Climate Justice Alliance board member

“The latest IPCC report confirms what communities on the frontlines of fighting big polluters already know. We need bold, community-led solutions that meet the scale of the climate crisis, not failed market-based schemes that allow big polluters to pump more poison into our communities and further destabilize our climate.”

Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, Climate Justice Alliance board member

Scientists in the latest IPCC physical science report provide undeniable proof of faster rates of global warming than earlier predictions indicated. The gravity of the climate emergency has been tirelessly called out by Indigenous and frontline communities for decades. We must pressure the IPCC before the mitigation report comes out early next year to listen to the voices of the traditional knowledge holders of Indigenous peoples and end carbon pricing, carbon capture and solar radiation management mitigation strategies that keep fossil fuels coming out of the ground.”

Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, Co-Chair, Climate Justice Alliance board member

“The frontlines are already way ahead of the politicians. We are leading with solutions - from community-owned solar energy systems that create safe, good paying jobs to just recovery efforts that ensure those communities most impacted by the crisis are built back in sustainable and safe ways based on community needs. To truly address the climate crisis, we need policymakers to enact bold and transformative policies like the THRIVE Act, which were crafted in deep consultation and partnership with Black, Brown, Indigenous, Asian and Pacific Islander, poor, and marginalized communities.”

Kayly Ober, Refugees International, climate displacement program manager

“The latest IPCC report shows us that we are already in the midst of a climate crisis—and that without swift action, climate-related hazards will only get worse. This trajectory will mean more disruptive and deadly events, such as extreme heatwaves and precipitation, which may force more people from their homes around the world.

This future reality means that we need—now more than ever—to extend more robust and humane protection for families and communities that will be forced to move in the face of these ever-increasing events."

Collin O’Mara, National Wildlife Federation, president and CEO

“We are living through exactly what the climate models predicted: more frequent and more intense extreme storms, floods, wildfires, drought, and heat waves that threaten lives, livelihoods, and communities. This report drives home the reality that there is absolutely no time to waste. We desperately need to invest in zero-emission 21st-century infrastructure, while bolstering the resilience of communities across the country.

“As Congress finalizes its infrastructure plans, we urge bold investments in clean energy, advanced transportation, natural climate solutions, restoration and resilience, and sustainable agriculture.”

Kristina Dahl, Union of Concerned Scientists, senior climate scientist

“Climate change is here, it’s dangerous, even deadly, and yet a giant gulf remains between what the science shows is needed to address this crisis and the actions taken by policymakers. The continued dithering is no longer about the lack of scientific evidence, but rather directly tied to a lack of political will and the overwhelming influence of the fossil fuel industry. The scientists keep showing up time and time again; now it’s time for policymakers to do the same.”

Rachel Cleetus, Union of Concerned Scientists, policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program

“In the United States, Congress has a unique and powerful moment to move forward legislation that could be a big down payment on climate action. When considering the enormity of the climate impacts the nation is already experiencing, as well as the tremendous health and economic benefits of a clean energy economy, the choice for policymakers should be obvious.

Kim Cobb, co-author, professor of earth and atmospheric sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology

“There’s really one key message that emerges from this report: We are out of time. And this report really provides compelling, scientific linkages between the headlines that we see today and what we know about the physics of the climate system and how it’s being impacted by rising greenhouse gases.”

Baylor Fox-Kemper, co-author, professor of earth, environmental, and planetary sciences, Brown University

“The biggest, most important aspects of climate change are not changing from report to report. And so things like the fact that the earth—were we to double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere—would warm by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit doesn’t change in this report. But the precision with which we can say that has improved, and in particular regional information, and information about extremes is provided in this report at a level of detail that exceeds any of the previous reports.”

...

“So we keep hearing more and more in the news about these extreme events, and the takeaway message from this new report is that these events are just going to occur more and more often as global temperatures rise. And they may get more and more intense. And so in the Western U.S., for example, we need to think hard about issues like water conservation and water storage in order to sort of weather through these increasingly extreme events.”

Jessica Tierney, co-author, associate professor of geosciences, University of Arizona

“Snowpack in the Western United States is almost certain to decline in the future. And that has implications for water availability, because a lot of the stream flow in the Western United States, for example the Colorado River, depends on snow. So we have increased confidence that we’re going to see less flow through our river systems in the Western U.S., which means that we’re going to be even more prone to drought. And in fact, if emissions continue, then there is a very good chance that we’re going to see a level of drought and aridity that we haven’t seen in at least a thousand years.”

Mathew Barlow, co-author, professor of climate science, University of Massachusetts Lowell

“For the future, we expect a continued increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme events, with larger increases for higher greenhouse gas emissions. The increases observed so far have occurred with around 1 degree C of warming. ...

“The changes that we have seen so far are associated with around 1 degree C of warming. Limiting warming to the 1.5 degree C target of the Paris Agreement would require immediate, rapid, and large-scale reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, regardless of any specific temperature target, every degree matters: Reducing emissions will reduce impacts.”

Kelly Kryc, Center for American Progress, senior fellow for Climate Science and Ocean Policy

"The warnings have been blinking red for a long time, and this IPCC report is the latest blaring alarm. Through the efforts of an incredible number of scientists around the world, the report details the utter devastation that the climate crisis is wreaking on every environment and community on Earth. Critically, this report shows that climate catastrophes that were projected in previous IPCC reports are now actually happening, which is both chilling and underscores the need to trust the science and further invest in solutions. This crisis demands immediate climate leadership at every level, coupled with investments in science and technology from our own U.S. Congress – to start – to stave off the worst impacts."

Wendy Bredhold, senior campaign representative for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign in Indiana

“This IPCC report is a call to action to all of us, and needs to be heard especially by those in the most powerful positions to respond: the decision-makers at Indiana’s monopoly electric utilities and in the government that regulates them. … “Some of Indiana’s investor-owned utilities are making progress away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but almost all of the benefit has been for the utilities. This moment requires Gov. Holcomb and the legislature to stop passing laws that further enrich and entrench monopoly utilities at the expense of everyday Hoosiers struggling through a pandemic to stay afloat. They must craft policies that support an equitable energy transition – one that benefits the Indiana communities that have been most harmed by fossil fuel plants and infrastructure. It’s time to get to work for the people.”

William Ripple, Oregon State University professor of ecology

“The scientific community has shared a very clear picture of a planet in crisis, but the world’s governments continue to drag their feet on the defining issue of our time. This report underscores the need for action. Look at the data. Listen to the story that the earth is telling us. Unless we fundamentally and immediately transform our society –banning fossil fuels, capping carbon emissions, and reconfiguring our relationship with nature – then the 21st Century will yield untold human suffering. We’re in the final act before the window is permanently closed.”

Jonty Whittleton, global campaign head for World Animal Protection

"The IPCC study is sending out a clear and urgent signal about what will happen if we don't act now to curb runaway greenhouse gas emissions. Our broken food system is fueling the climate crisis. Global meat production is five times higher than it was 50 years ago and food production has fundamentally changed to prioritize quantity over quality. ...

"Our future depends on us rethinking how we treat all animals. We must all work together now to transform the global food system and end cruel factory farming. This is an urgent action for animals, for people and for our planet."

Moira Mcdonald, director of the Walton Family Foundation’s Environment Program

“This report is a wake-up call – there are practical reasons to both take action and still be hopeful."

When the clock struck midnight on Monday, Canada reopened its borders to U.S. citizens after more than a year of only allowing essential travel.

Although some Americans were not going to wait a minute longer than necessary to get into Canada, Detroit’s ports to Canada didn’t get much attention early Monday. Wait times for the Ambassador Bridge hovered around 10 minutes, with the Detroit-Windsor tunnel following closely.

But the Ambassador saw some families reunite and couples return to empty properties across the river.

Asawari Kaur of Indiana, along with her family, huddled together at Detroit’s duty free shop minutes before midnight. Some of Kaur’s family hadn’t seen her brother, who got married in April, in almost two years.

“We were all so eagerly waiting for that day,” Kaur said. “As soon as it hits midnight, we’re gonna enter the border.”

Carolyn Ferroni and David Bruns of Columbus, Ohio, hadn’t seen their lake house across the border in almost two years. The minute Canada's border reopened, the couple was ready to go.

“It’s just part of a family culture and tradition — we go there every year,” Ferroni said.

If not for close kept friends on the other side, Ferroni said their well-loved family lake house of 50 years could’ve been in disarray.

Now, Ferroni and Bruns said they plan to resume their yearly visits to the St. Anthony property.

A stark warning on climate change

Hundreds of top scientists released a devastating report Monday on the danger that human-caused climate change poses to the world. Calling it "code red for humanity," the landmark report was released in Geneva by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Many of the changes seen in the world's climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of years, and some of the changes set in motion – such as a rise in sea levels – are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years, according to the report. Wild weather events, such as storms and heat waves, are expected to worsen and become more frequent. The 3,000-page report says the evidence is clear that carbon dioxide is the main driver of climate change, even though other greenhouse gases and air pollutants play a role.

Pediatric hospitals fill up as kids go back to school

Schools are filling up with kids going back to school – and pediatric hospitals are, too. Amid the latest surge in infections, this one driven by the highly contagious delta variant, children's hospitals in COVID-19 hot spots are seeing record numbers of pediatric patients. Schools are allowing students, with or without masks, back into the classroom. Some closed again shortly after they opened heir doors. The American Academy of Pediatrics sent a letter to acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock last week, urging the agency to work aggressively toward authorizing vaccines for children under 12.

Natural infection isn't enough to protect against COVID-19, experts say. You still need to get vaccinated.

High winds, heat could spark even more wildfires

The smoke from the Dixie Fire is clearing – but that might not be a good thing. Scores of wildfires racing across much of the Northwest could be energized this week by a resurgence of high winds and heat, forecasters warned Monday. The historic Dixie Fire has destroyed at least 627 buildings and threatens thousands of others across four Northern California counties. AccuWeather said Seattle and Portland, Oregon, got a sprinkling of rain late last week after long dry spells, but hot, gusty and smoky conditions are on the way. The Dixie Fire grew to more than 750 square miles late Sunday and remained just 21% contained after scorching an area larger than Los Angeles. More than 100 major blazes are raging through 15 Western states.

Cuomo accuser: 'He broke the law'

A former executive assistant who accused New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of groping her at the Governor's Mansion last year said she believes the incident "was a crime. He broke the law." Brittany Commisso, listed as “Executive Assistant #1” in the state attorney's general investigation into alleged sexual harassment by Cuomo in the workplace, came forward in an interview Monday, saying the governor needs to be held accountable. Commisso is one of 11 women, nine of them state workers, who were interviewed in the report claiming Cuomo inappropriately touched them or made inappropriate comments. The report has led to calls for Cuomo to resign, including from President Joe Biden. Sunday night, Cuomo took another hit: His top aide, Melissa DeRosa, quit. The state Assembly's judiciary committee plans to meet Monday to discuss how to wrap up an investigation into whether there are grounds to impeach Cuomo. The governor has denied touching anyone appropriately.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A former Fort Bragg command sergeant major who has since been demoted and allegedly forged documents to retire in the midst of an Army investigation is facing an Oct. 11 trial on five new charges –including impeding a sexual assault and revenge porn.

Master Sgt. Clinton M. Murray is also charged with desertion, failure to obey a regulation and extortion , according to an Army trial docket and charge sheet. Murray has pleaded not guilty.

Further details about Murray’s latest case are found in federal documents after he filed a lawsuit on July 17, 2020, seeking a temporary restraining order against being recalled to active-duty military status. The case was ultimately dismissed.

Murray was found guilty in January 2020 following court-martial proceedings at Fort Bragg of having an inappropriate relationship while deployed to Afghanistan with a private first class between July 1, 2017, and Dec 30, 2017. He was reprimanded and demoted one step in rank to master sergeant.

'The tragic death is a real mystery':Reward increased to $50K in slaying of Fort Bragg paratrooper

He was found not guilty of sexual assault of the junior enlisted soldier, and a charge of maltreatment of subordinates was dismissed. Also dismissed was an allegation that Murray fostered “the perception of undue familiarity” with a first lieutenant in Afghanistan between April 1, 2017, and Dec. 30, 2017, the record shows.

At the time he was charged, Murray was command sergeant major of the 3rd Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, according to his enlistment records included in the federal court filing.

The latest charges against Murray came during the course of the court martial, according to the federal lawsuit.

The pending charges allege:

Murray violated an Army regulation by having an intimate or sexual relationship with a commissioned officer between Sept. 1, 2017, to May 1, 2018, while in Fayetteville and while deployed near Kabul, Afghanistan.

Murray tried to extort a woman, whose name is redacted from the report, between May 19 and May 20, 2018, by obtaining intimate visual images and threatening to divulge the relationship to the woman’s husband and her employer – the Army.

Murray attempted to impede a sexual assault investigation between Dec. 11 and Dec. 14, 2017, by requesting an individual, whose name is redacted from the report, to destroy physical evidence of alleged sexual conduct.

Murray broadcast intimate images of an unnamed woman on June 18, 2018.

The sexual assault charge is tied to an allegation that Murray had sex with the woman on May 21, 2018, and again threatened to tell her husband and the Army about the relationship.

Additionally, Murray is accused of fraudulently separating from the Army between June 1 to June 30, 2020, “under the guise of a medical retirement while flagged for investigation,” the charge sheet states.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Officials are expecting an active Atlantic hurricane season in 2021, hitting swaths of the United States. At the same time, COVID-19 cases are spiking as the delta variant spreads across the country.

With hurricanes approaching during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, health experts are calling on individuals to protect themselves from the weather and from potential exposure to the virus if they have to evacuate, gather in a shelter and more.

Jane Kelly, an assistant state epidemiologist at the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, told USA TODAY that "part of hurricane preparedness is thinking ahead about what supplies you need so that you have them on hand."

"It’s the same thing, thinking about what you need to do to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19," Kelly said.

USA TODAY’s data reporters are pointing out that Floridians remember Hurricane Andrew, which killed 44 people in the state in 1992. But in the last week alone, Florida has reported over 600 fatalities from COVID-19 — amounting to the same number of deaths as Hurricane Andrew happening 14 times.

If you live in the path of a storm, here’s what you need to know to keep you and your family safe during the pandemic and hurricane season:

Hurricane season enters its peak:NOAA's updated forecast calls for even more storms: 21 named systems

Should I get vaccinated to prepare for a hurricane?

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week said that 15 to 21 named storms are expected to develop during the current hurricane season, including hurricanes and tropical storms.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that preparing for hurricanes looks different during the coronavirus pandemic. The CDC encourages eligible people to "get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can" to widely avoid getting or spreading the virus if evacuation to a shelter or the home of a loved one is needed.

Kelly told USA TODAY that South Carolina officials are concerned about unvaccinated people gathering in shelters during hurricanes, creating "a perfect storm for the rapid spread of the virus."

"The people who may not be vaccinated may be the ones who are least prepared for having an alternative shelter for hurricane season and, therefore, need to go to some congregate shelter," she said.

If "we have a hurricane, and people need to move to shelters, it's going to be difficult to keep people at a distance," she added.

Kelly noted that people should think ahead about getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before a potential storm.

"Don't wait until hurricanes are upon us and then think, ‘Uh oh, if I have to go to a shelter, I better go get vaccinated today,’" she said. "Because you won't be protected."

'The effects will linger':US kids’ long-term health in jeopardy after pandemic schooling

What can you do in addition to getting vaccinated?

The CDC also encourages people preparing before a hurricane or tropical storm to "give yourself more time than usual" to gather emergency food, water and prescriptions, or have the items delivered.

If individuals plan to evacuate and stay with friends or family, the CDC also says they should talk with their hosts "about how you can all best protect yourselves from COVID-19." That includes considering if anyone from either household is at risk of developing a severe case of the virus.

If individuals are also in crowded, indoor shelters during storms, they may want to keep a distance from others, wear a mask and wash their hands frequently, health officials recommend.

American Red Cross spokesperson Jenelle Eli told USA TODAY that, whether you're creating an emergency kit to stay at home or to leave quickly during a storm, individuals should pack additional masks and hand sanitizer along with items like flashlights and water.

"After back-to-back years of active hurricane seasons that have broken records, the American Red Cross is urging people in hurricane-prone areas to get ready now," Eli said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Evidence shows that carbon dioxide is the main driver of climate change, the report says.

Almost 200 countries have signed up to the Paris climate accord.

The report comes three months before a major climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.

Hundreds of top scientists released a devastating report Monday on the danger that human-caused climate change poses to the world.

Calling it "code red for humanity," the landmark report was released in Geneva by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Many of the changes seen in the world's climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of years, and some of the changes already set in motion – such as a rise in sea levels – are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years, according to the report.

Wild weather events, such as storms and heat waves, are expected to worsen and become more frequent.

“Climate change is already affecting every region on Earth, in multiple ways, (and) the changes we experience will increase with additional warming,” said Panmao Zhai of the IPCC.

The evidence is clear that carbon dioxide is the main driver of climate change, even as other greenhouse gases and air pollutants play a role, the report says.

The 3,000-page report "provides an unprecedented degree of clarity about the future of our planet, and the need to reduce – and ultimately eliminate – our emissions of greenhouse gases," said Zeke Hausfather of the Breakthrough Institute, a global environmental research center.

'Worst is yet to come': Disastrous future ahead for millions worldwide due to climate change, report warns

The report, which calls climate change clearly human-caused and “unequivocal,” makes more precise and warmer forecasts for the 21st century than it did last time it was issued, in 2013.

“If this IPCC report doesn’t shock you into action, it should," said Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute, a research nonprofit organization. "The report paints a very sobering picture of the unforgiving, unimaginable world we have in store if our addiction to burning fossil fuels and destroying forests continues. One of the most striking takeaways is that we may reach 1.5°C of warming a decade earlier than the IPCC had previously found."

What climate change looks like:Eye-opening images of what climate change has done and could do to our world

Almost 200 countries have signed up to the Paris climate accord, which aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times.

The report projects that in the coming decades, climate changes will increase in all regions. For 1.5 C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons; at 2 C of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report shows.

“Scientists have predicted the likelihood of accelerating climate change for more than a century now – yet too often their warnings have been disregarded," said Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy. "My hope is that the rigor, transparency and unprecedented urgency of this latest IPCC report will make it simply impossible to ignore."

Though many of the report’s predictions paint a grim picture of humans’ impact on the planet and the consequences that will have going forward, the IPCC also found that so-called tipping points, such as catastrophic ice sheet collapses, are “low likelihood,” though they cannot be ruled out.

The report comes three months before a major climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Committee chair: There is still weeks of work to do before an impeachment vote is possible.

Cuomo has not resigned, despite calls for him to step down from local lawmakers all the way to Biden.

This is the first time in more than 100 years that the Assembly has launched an impeachment probe.

ALBANY – The potential impeachment of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo could still be weeks away as a key Assembly committee plans to first hold public hearings in the coming weeks.

The Assembly Judiciary Committee met in private with its outside lawyers for more than four hours Monday as they conduct an ongoing investigation into Cuomo and his administration. That probe will ultimately determine whether lawmakers will begin impeachment proceedings.

The committee has faced increasing pressure to finish its work and impeach Cuomo, a Democrat, after state Attorney General Letitia James' office released a report last week that concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women in violation of state and federal law.

But there is still weeks of work to do before an impeachment vote is possible, Assembly Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Lavine, D-Nassau County, said Monday.

The committee will meet again with its outside counsel from the law firm of Davis Polk on Aug. 16 and Aug. 23, he said. After that, Lavine said the Assembly plans to hold public hearings with independent experts on sexual harassment and the state impeachment process.

Only after that occurs will the Judiciary Committee decide whether to recommend impeachment against Cuomo.

"I understand and I appreciate and sympathize with the desire to do this and do this as fast as possible, but we still have to comport with constitutional mandates and requirements," Lavine told reporters Monday. "And 100 years from now, 200 years from now, people will look back at this and people will say, 'Did they do the right thing?'"

He continued: "Our intention — the intention of everyone, and this is a bipartisan statement on behalf of the committee — is to do what is right."

More:'He groped me': Cuomo's former executive assistant speaks out in TV interview

What is alleged against Cuomo

James' report, released Aug. 3, found credible evidence that Cuomo touched women inappropriately, made comments about their romantic and personal lives, delivered unwanted hugs and kisses, and groped an executive assistant underneath her shirt.

The Democratic governor has denied touching anyone inappropriately and has suggested some of his comments were misconstrued by his accusers.

He has refused to resign despite calls to do so from scores of state lawmakers, Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand; state Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and even President Joe Biden.

Within hours of the release of the report, the Assembly's Democratic majority huddled on a Zoom call, which resulted in Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, making clear his conference had lost confidence in Cuomo's ability to hold office.

That's led to the increasing belief that Cuomo's impeachment is inevitable. But critics of the governor and advocates for harassment victims have criticized the timeframe of the Assembly's process, urging them to put impeachment to an up-or-down vote as soon as possible.

Unlike the federal impeachment process, a New York governor must cede power to the lieutenant governor upon a successful impeachment vote. The lieutenant governor, in this case Kathy Hochul, would then act as governor during an impeachment trial.

"It is time for the Assembly to act," Debra Katz, attorney for former Cuomo aide Charlotte Bennett, said in a statement Friday. "Further delay is an affront to the women who came forward and to survivors everywhere.”

What's next in impeachment probe

Heastie and Lavine said the Assembly needs to act quickly but cautiously to ensure the potential impeachment process can stand up to scrutiny.

Unlike James' investigation, which was focused exclusively on the issue of sexual harassment and workplace culture, the Assembly's probe is broad and wide-reaching.

Along with harassment, the Assembly investigation is looking into the Cuomo administration's handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes; whether Cuomo's family and friends got preferential virus testing; and whether the governor improperly used state resources on his most recent book deal, which promises to pay him $5 million.

The Assembly probe is also examining potential safety issues related to bolts at the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge in the Hudson Valley and whether the state did anything to cover up a whistleblower's complaints.

Heastie noted this is the first time in more than 100 years that the Assembly has launched an impeachment investigation.

The last time came in 1913, when then-Gov. William Sulzer was impeached and ultimately removed from office.

"You want to make sure things are right, but also done in an expeditious manner," Heastie said Monday.

"I believe that this is going to be dealt with in weeks and not months, I just want people to understand. You want to make sure that this is a process that no one can say they are being treated unfairly."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Like any other busy Sunday, real estate agent Eric Brown arrived at a Michigan home to give a tour on Aug. 1.

His longtime friend, Roy Thorne, was looking to buy his first house, and Brown was showing him the second floor of a Wyoming, Michigan, property when he noticed at least two officers with their guns drawn outside. Thorne's 15-year old son, Samuel, quickly emerged from the basement and announced he'd seen officers surrounding the house.

Brown first worried police were trying to arrest a suspect and might drive them inside the house. When he realized the officers were there for him and his clients, he remembers feeling "sheer terror."

"I thought, 'We’re going to get shot. This is going to go really bad, really fast,'" Brown told USA TODAY.

Thorne, an Army veteran, said he had the same thought as he walked down the stairs.

"I prepared myself to get shot or killed," he said. "I can’t get it out of my head. I keep replaying that walk down the stairs."

Officers ordered the three of them – all Black males – to come outside with their hands up, handcuffed them and put them in separate police cars.

"Looking at my son, watching him get cuffed," Thorne said. "I felt defeated ... he's just a kid."

Police were responding to a call from a neighbor who said a person who had been arrested last month for unlawful entry into the house had returned in the same vehicle, a black Mercedes, according to a statement from Wyoming Department of Public Safety. Five officers responded to the home and found two vehicles, a black Hyundai Genesis sedan and a black Chevrolet Malibu.

Two officers unholstered their guns during the incident, according to police, which is standard protocol for responding to a reported home invasion.

Officers can be heard in body camera footage of the incident explaining why they had been called to the scene and acknowledging that this was likely a misunderstanding. While still handcuffed, Brown showed police his realtor's license and the system he used to get the key from the lockbox.

After confirming Brown was a real estate agent giving a tour to the Thornes, officers removed their handcuffs within 10 minutes of arriving to the home and apologized.

Police reviewed footage of the incident and found no policy violations.

"We have concluded race played no role in our officers’ treatment of the individuals who were briefly detained," the statement said. "While it is unfortunate that innocent individuals were placed in handcuffs, our officers responded reasonably and according to department policy based on the information available to them at the time."

But Brown believes he and his clients were racially profiled. If they had been white, he alleged, the neighbor would not have called police and officers would not have responded in the same manner.

"If that's the protocol, procedure and policy then those are the protocols, procedures and policies that need to change," Brown said, adding he and Thorne are consulting with attorneys on potential legal action to encourage policy change.

Thorne said the experience has prompted him to have tough conversations with his sons about how to navigate interactions with the police, a discussion they first started having after the death of Philando Castile in 2016.

He hopes sharing their story can prevent situations like this.

The neighbor "changed our lives forever with that call," he said. "If you see a crime, report a crime. Don’t report people doing every day normal things."

Police Chief Kimberly Koster reached out to Brown and offered to meet with him and the Thornes to talk about the incident, Wyoming police said. Citing his own emotional trauma, Brown initially declined but said he plans to talk with Koster after hiring an attorney.

Still, Brown said he feels fear and anxiety when recounting the incident.

"I’m sweating right now, it's difficult to continue to tell this story. I’m not doing as well today as I was doing prior to the incident," he said. "This is going to be an ongoing thing probably for life – you just keep pushing for change."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As concerned friends and family members try to convince loved ones to get vaccinated, many are met with the argument: "I already got COVID, so I can't get it again."

Health experts say that just isn't true.

Although antibodies from natural infection may provide some protection against the virus, evidence shows nothing protects against COVID-19 better than vaccines.

People who have recovered from COVID-19 should get vaccinated to reduce their risk of reinfection, which will prevent transmission and suppress the opportunity for more variants – like the highly contagious delta – to emerge.

“Natural infection will cause your immune system to make many types of antibodies and immune response to all parts of the virus, but only a small fraction of that response is actually protective,” said Nicole Iovine, chief hospital epidemiologist at University of Florida Health in Gainesville. “When you get the vaccine, the entire response is targeted to the virus's spike protein.”

A study published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found unvaccinated people who have had COVID-19 are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with the virus compared with people who were fully vaccinated after contracting the virus.

The study included hundreds of Kentucky residents with previous COVID-19 infections from May through June. It showed those who were unvaccinated were 2.34 times more likely to be reinfected compared with those who were fully vaccinated.

“If you have had COVID-19 before, please still get vaccinated,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement. “This study shows you are twice as likely to get infected again if you are unvaccinated. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you, especially as the more contagious delta variant spreads around the country.”

Anyone can be at risk for reinfection, health experts said, regardless of age or health status.

'A surge of straight stupidity':The vaccinated are angry. That's understandable but unproductive, health experts say

Will COVID-19 vaccine booster shots be needed? It's likely, experts say, but the immunocompromised should be prioritized.

A study in April published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine found multiple COVID-19 reinfections in the U.S. Marines Corps, a population considered to be the picture of health. Among the 189 Marines who were infected from May to November 2020, 10% tested positive again.

People reinfected with the virus are more likely to be asymptomatic, which increases the chances of spread, said Michael Grosso, chief medical officer and chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health’s Huntington Hospital in Long Island, New York.

“Individuals who have partial immunity, and therefore susceptible to asymptomatic infection, absolutely place people around them at risk because they don’t know they’re ill, and we know now that they can transmit COVID under those conditions,” he said.

Those with asymptomatic infection can unknowingly expose friends or loved ones who may be older or have weakened immune systems, health experts said, putting them at risk of infection if they’re vaccinated, or worse, at risk of severe disease and death if they’re unvaccinated.

Although most people present milder symptoms during their second bout of COVID-19, Iovine said she's seen a fair share of hospitalizations.

A 25-year-old man in Nevada was the first reported case of COVID-19 reinfection in October 2020, according to a case study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Researchers said his second go-around was “symptomatically more severe than the first.”

Spreading the disease gives the virus more opportunity to mutate, heath experts said, allowing more variants to emerge. According to the CDC, the delta variant accounts for more than 90% of sequenced cases in the USA.

“With this delta variant, you want to have the odds in your favor,” Iovine said. “You don’t want to leave yourself with excess risk, and that’s where vaccination is going to give you that extra layer of protection that natural infection cannot.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A grim global report on climate change released Monday paints a dire picture for the future of Earth.

Climate change has led to irreversible shifts for the next hundreds to thousands of years, according to the report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The effects of more extreme weather are felt across the globe, the report said, and average global temperature increases that could have devastating effects may come sooner than expected.

Dubbed a "code red for humanity" by the United Nations, the report says unequivocally humans have caused climate change, driven up greenhouse gas emissions and led to warmer weather.

'Code red for humanity':UN report gives stark warning on climate change, says wild weather events will worsen

Here are five of the most alarming findings in the climate report:

We may reach 1.5°C of warming much sooner than previously expected

"One of the most striking takeaways is that we may reach 1.5°C of warming a decade earlier than the IPCC had previously found," said Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute.

Warming of 1.5 degrees Centigrade would increase heat waves, lengthen warm seasons and shorten cold seasons. If temperatures were 2 degrees warmer, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report says.

In five scenarios of expected levels of greenhouse gas emissions laid out in the report, global warming of at least 1.5 degrees is the best estimate for the increase in temperature in the near term, from 2021 to 2040. Even under the lowest emissions scenarios, the report says a 1.5-degree warming in the next 20 years is "more likely than not" before bouncing back. Previous predictions did not expect this level of warming this soon.

The five scenarios varied more in how much global temperatures will increase in the coming century, but even under a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario, the range of temperature increase by 2100 is very likely to be 1 to 1.8 degrees Centigrade.

Human-caused climate change is already affecting 'every region across the globe'

No region of the globe has been spared from the impacts of climate change, the report says. Climate change is "affecting many weather and climate extremes," such as heat, heavy precipitation and drought.

Since the IPCC's last assessment, the evidence of humans' influence on specific weather events has strengthened.

The report says extreme heat has become more frequent and more intense across most parts of the world since 1950. The IPCC asserts with "high confidence" that human-caused climate change is the main driver and that without human influence, some of the extreme highs would be "extremely unlikely."

Heavy precipitation has increased in frequency and intensity across most regions, the report said.

The report found the share of hurricanes that reach the devastating levels of Category 3 to 5 storms has probably increased over the past 40 years. Humans have increased the chances of extreme compound weather events, such as the frequency of concurrent droughts, fire weather and flooding.

Extreme weather will get worse

The report found a direct relation between increasing temperatures and extreme weather events. For every half a degree Centigrade warmer the average global temperature is, expect "clearly discernible increases" in extreme heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts.

For example, hot temperature extremes that typically occurred only once every 10 years without human-caused climate change are likely to occur 4.1 times if temperatures increase by 1.5 degrees Centigrade. If temperatures increase by 2 degrees, a once-in-every-10-years extreme is likely to occur 5.6 times. Under a 4-degree warming scenario, the extreme heat occurs 9.4 times.

Each incremental increase in global temperature would lead to lower levels of Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost.

Under all five emission scenarios the report lays out, the Arctic is likely to see at least one September month that is practically free of sea ice before 2050.

Many changes to Earth are irreversible for centuries and millennia

In a number of areas, greenhouse gas emissions have caused irreversible damage, and the effects will be felt on the time scale of centuries to millennia, according to the report.

The report says ocean temperature changes and ocean acidification, mountain and polar glacier melt and sea level rise are all expected to continue over the next hundreds of years regardless of human intervention.

Over the next 2,000 years, even if global temperatures are kept to a 1.5-degree increase, the average global sea level is expected to rise 2 to 3 meters.

The report says ice loss in Greenland over the 21st century is virtually certain and there is high confidence that ice loss will increase cumulative emissions.

As emissions and temperatures increase, Earth's water cycle becomes more intense

Earth's natural cycles are expected to be acutely effected by rising global temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions, the report says.

As the climate warms, Earth's water cycle will increasingly tend to more extremes. In some areas, that means wetter wet seasons and in others drier dry seasons, the report says.

Increased variability in rainfall tied to El Niño is very likely under three of the global emission scenarios.

The way Earth naturally combats increased carbon emissions is likely to be affected in the coming decades, the report says.

Earth's carbon sinks – generally its forests and oceans – will store an increasing amount of carbon under scenarios with higher emissions, but they will be less effective in the higher emission scenarios, the report says. As a result, higher levels of emissions will remain in the atmosphere.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fred would be the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.

The chance the disturbance forms into a tropical storm is high at 90% through 48 hours.

Most of Florida remains in the system's five-day forecast cone.

SARASOTA, Fla. — Tropical Storm Fred developed just south of Puerto Rico late Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center confirmed, heading for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, with forecasters warning that its heavy rains could cause dangerous flooding and mudslides.

After a quiet month of no named storms in the region, Fred became the sixth of the Atlantic hurricane season as expected late Tuesday and tropical storm warnings were already in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

“The most important thing today is preparation,” said Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. “I am not going to minimize the potential impact of this event … we expect a lot of rain.”

Florida could be in the storm's path, but forecasters said it was too early to determine the exact track.

Data from the aircraft and surface observations indicate the disturbance gained some strength Tuesday night, with maximum sustained winds near 40 mph with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is forecast overnight before Fred reaches eastern Dominican Republic on Wednesday morning.

Fred was the first named storm since Hurricane Elsa dissipated one month ago on July 9.

Gradual strengthening was forecast, and the disturbance was expected to become a tropical storm Tuesday night, the center said.

The disturbance is expected to pass near or over the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico late Tuesday and early Wednesday, be near or over Hispaniola on Wednesday and be near the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands on Thursday. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic.

Heavy rain is likely over the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, which could lead to flash, urban and small stream flooding and potential mudslides. The greatest threat for flooding will be across the eastern and southeastern portions of Puerto Rico.

Tropical storm conditions are possible elsewhere along the northern coasts of the Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, the Turks and Caicos, and the southeastern Bahamas beginning late Wednesday.

The system could intensify once it reaches the waters south of Florida or the eastern Gulf of Mexico by this weekend, forecasters said. But that path is subject to change depending on wind shear and whether the storm tracks over water or land.

"The system is being guided along to the west-northwest by the circulation around a large area of high pressure over the central Atlantic," AccuWeather hurricane expert Dan Kottlowski said.

Florida and the Keys could be in the system's path. This scenario could unfold if the high-pressure area weakens and allows the system to turn more to the north, Kottlowski said.

The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be active, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in an updated forecast last week: 15 to 21 named storms could develop; seven to 10 could be hurricanes.

An average season spawns seven hurricanes and peaks in August, September and October. If predictions hold true, this year will be a record sixth consecutive year of above-normal activity.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LOS ANGELES – A massive wildfire in California continued its destructive trek through the northern reaches of the state Tuesday, fueled by bone-dry conditions and fierce winds that have allowed the blaze to raze almost 900 structures and take out much of a historic Gold Rush town.

Firefighters made progress on the more than 482,000 acre blaze Monday and have it about 25% contained, but high pressure building over the western United States is posing a new risk this week. Forecasters say sweltering temperatures — possibly hitting triple-digit highs — will further dry out the area. Forecasts also show more strong afternoon winds, another key ingredient that could intensify the blaze.

So far, the fire has scorched an area more than twice the size of New York City. Only the million-acre August Complex from a year ago has burned through more land in California. That fire was a compilation of more than 30 fires ignited by lightning strikes.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in the northern counties of Shasta, Tehama and Trinity due to the McFarland, Monument and Dixie fires.

Those fires combined with three others raging in the region, Antelope, Nelson and McCash, have burned through more than a half a million acres and forced thousands from their homes. More than 650,000 acres continues to burn.

The governor's declaration unlocks state funding to provide resources to communities in need. The move came days after Newsom surveyed damage from the Dixie Fire and met with elected officials in Greenville, a Gold Rush-era town that was mostly destroyed by the fire.

“These are climate-induced wildfires and we have to acknowledge that we have the capacity in not just the state but in this country to solve this,” Newsom said on CNN.

On Sunday, the Dixie Fire surpassed the Mendocino Complex, which in 2018 burned 459,123 acres in Colusa, Lake, Mendocino and Glenn counties, to become the state's second largest fire in recorded history.

The blaze has been burning since July 13 and a cause is being investigated. Pacific Gas & Electric has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines. A federal judge ordered PG&E on Friday to give details by Aug. 16 about the equipment and vegetation where the fire started.

So far, the Dixie Fire has destroyed at least 893 structures and more than 16,000 structures are still in danger of being destroyed, fire officials said.

Four firefighters were taken to the hospital Friday after being struck by a fallen branch. More than 30 people were initially reported missing, but by Monday the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office had accounted for all of them.

California’s raging wildfires are among some 100 large blazes burning across 15 states, mostly in the West, where historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition.

Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists have said climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. The fires across the West come as parts of Europe are also fighting large blazes spurred by bone-dry conditions.

California's fire season is on track to surpass last year's season, which was the worst fire season in recent recorded state history.

"Compared to this same time last year, we have seen an astounding 151% increase in acres burned across California and it is only August," Cal Fire said last Thursday.

An ashy haze has continued to hang over large stretches of the region as many evacuees wonder where they will go from here.

Angela Rutledge has lived for two years in Janesville, a small community on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. She didn't leave last year when asked to evacuate for the Sheep Fire. This year, she is.

She and her husband have already packed suitcases of clothes and important documents. Without a trailer, she will have to leave her goat, three pigs and 15 chickens behind.

“I’m very nervous,” she said.

The fire and groups of evacuees have transformed the center of Susanville, another sleepy Sierra Nevada town of about 15,000 people. Fire engines from cities as far away as Huntington Beach and Los Angeles crowd the highway. RV’s camped at Walmart, Subway and any parking lot with an open space.

As of Sunday night, 275 people were sheltered at Susanville’s two emergency shelters, according to Lassen County Administrator Richard Egan.

“We’re doing whatever we can to provide areas for people to go to in this time,” he said.

About a dozen people are waiting for a spot at an RV park in the area. Scott Enos and his mom, Susan, are among them.

The pair, who live in nearby Chester, Calif., are camped at the Walmart parking lot in the city with their three cats and two dogs. Her family home in Greenville burned last week, and “that was a big hit,” she said.

She hopes a site opens up at the RV park so she, her son and pets, some of whom are blind and diabetic, can be more comfortable.

Until a spot opens, she is grateful for services from the Red Cross and Salvation Army. She and her son have been camped at Walmart for about a week, and they’ve had deliveries of pet food, watermelon, enchiladas and pizza.

“They’ve really stepped up,” she said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WASHINGTON – Minutes after approving a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill to update America's roads and bridges, the Senate on Tuesday took its first step on another priority of President Joe Biden's: a multi-trillion-dollar plan that devotes billions to expand caregiving, subsidize child care and provide free community college.

The Senate immediately voted to start formal debate on the $3.5 trillion budget plan that includes what the Biden administration has called "human infrastructure" – massive investments in areas like the environment, housing, education and health care.

Later this week, the Senate is expected to take a final vote on a resolution that would direct committees to finalize the legislation, but a final vote on the overall package may be months away.

Infrastructure bill pa Senate:Infrastructure bill passes Senate, sending Biden's plan for roads, bridges and broadband to the House

Tuesday's action is the start of what are likely to be weeks of contentious negotiations among Democrats in the House and Senate on the size of the proposal. Some moderates have expressed reservations about the $3.5 trillion price tag while progressives have stated they won't vote for anything smaller and are willing to squash the $1.2 trillion deal if the plan isn't to their liking.

That means keeping the Democratic caucus unified in both the House and Senate could be challenging as Biden and Democrats seek to make both pieces of legislation law.

Senate Democrats, who hold a slight majority in the 100-member chamber, plan to use a legislative maneuver called reconciliation to pass the plan without the support of Republicans, who generally oppose the measure. Vice President Kamala Harris would be used to break a 50-50 tie.

Like the Senate, Democrats also hold a slight lead in the House, meaning just a handful of Democratic objections could sink both the bipartisan infrastructure package and the larger bill.

House progressives are insistent they will not vote on the infrastucture deal without the $3.5 trillion bill, which could take weeks to craft.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has stressed the need for both bills to make it to the chamber.

“There won't be an infrastructure bill unless we have a reconciliation bill. Plain and simple,” Pelosi said in June.

Other House progressives agree. A survey sent by the Congressional Progressive Caucus showed "a majority of respondents affirmed that they would withhold their votes in support of the bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives until the Senate adopted a robust reconciliation package,” a letter from the caucus' chairs reads.

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told USA TODAY on Thursday he wouldn't vote for the bipartisan infrastructure deal the Senate cleared unless the full $3.5 trillion bill – or something very close to it – is approved by the Senate as well.

“The reality is for the bipartisan bill to pass the House and to get the progressives on board — at least 30, 40 of them – you're going to have to have the reconciliation bill, which is already a compromise at $3.5 trillion, pass the Senate with the strong climate provisions," he said.

Khanna said he and other progressives could live with “cosmetic changes" to the bill but cautioned against bigger tweaks.

"If you start to go after the heart of the bill, you're undermining the bipartisan effort," he said.

Moderate Democrats on the other hand aren't sold on the price tag.

More:Sinema doesn't support Democrats' $3.5T bill, clinches bipartisan infrastructure deal

In late July, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., told The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, that she does not support the Democrats' $3.5 trillion plan because of the price.

When news of Sinema's hesitation broke, those compiling the budget resolution seemed surprised.

"We have had multiple meetings about the importance of both parts of the infrastructure going forward and everyone has had an opportunity to participate in those meetings," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Finance Committee, told USA TODAY.

Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana told reporters over the last few weeks they have concerns over the price as well.

Manchin also stressed he believes the House should pass the bipartisan infrastructure deal without the final budget bill being completed, telling CBS' Face the Nation the infrastructure bill "should go and fall or rise on its own."

Despite some hesitancy within their ranks, Democrats are confident the full caucus will pass the budget resolution to begin crafting the actual legislation.

The $3.5 trillion budget plan includes Democratic priorities the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill did not. The budget text calls for creating free pre-kindergarten for three and four-year-olds, two years of free community college, and establishing paid family and sick leave. It also would expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision benefits.

"By making education, health care, child care, and housing more affordable, we can give tens of millions of families a leg up. By making further investments in infrastructure, we can create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. And by finally tackling climate change, we can spare our country and our planet the most devastating effects of global warming," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a letter to his colleagues.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cuomo's resignation will take place in 14 days.

Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul of Buffalo will make history as the first woman New York governor.

Cuomo announced his decision following a presentation by his outside attorney, Rita Glavin..

ALBANY, N.Y. – New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation Tuesday under the weight of a sexual harassment scandal that engulfed his administration and derailed his political future, capping a remarkable and rapid fall for a governor whose national profile had risen to extraordinary heights during the coronavirus pandemic.

Cuomo, a Democrat, said his resignation would take effect in 14 days, ending a decadelong run in the office he dedicated most of his adult life to keeping within his family – first as an adviser to his father, the late Gov. Mario Cuomo, before winning three terms himself.

"The best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing. And therefore, that's what I'll do," he said in his address.

With Cuomo stepping down, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul of Buffalo will make history as the first woman to serve as New York governor. Hochul, a Democrat, will be sworn in after Cuomo's resignation takes effect and is set to fill out the remainder of his term, which runs through 2022.

Cuomo, 63, had defiantly resisted calls for his resignation over the the past five months, a period in which multiple women, including current and former state employees, publicly accused him of inappropriate or harassing behavior in some form.

His administration has also faced criticism for withholding the true COVID-19 death toll of nursing home residents for months, a decision that has attracted scrutiny from federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.

More:Who is Kathy Hochul? What to know about Cuomo's lieutenant governor

The most damaging – and ultimately fatal – blow came Aug. 3, when state Attorney General Letitia James' office released a report that found Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women, including nine state employees, violating various state and federal laws along the way.

Among them was an executive assistant who accused Cuomo of reaching under her blouse and groping her breast during a November 2020 encounter at the Executive Mansion, which Cuomo denies despite the attorney general's report finding the woman's claims "credible."

On Tuesday, Cuomo announced his decision in an on-camera address after a lengthy presentation by his outside attorney, Rita Glavin, who sought to cast doubt on many of his accusers' claims and denied Cuomo had ever touched them inappropriately.

In his address, Cuomo denied the most serious of allegations but acknowledged offending a trail of women with jokes and unwelcomed embraces that he suggested may have crossed a shifting cultural line. He said he was choosing to step down for the good of state government, which has been paralyzed for the past week as Cuomo fought for his political life.

More:Melissa DeRosa, top aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, resigns amid scandal

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said shortly after Cuomo's announcement that President Joe Biden "made clear his views last week." Biden last week called on Cuomo to resign.

"Our view is that this is a story about these courageous women who came forward, told their stories, shared their stories," Psaki said. She added that Biden has not spoken with Cuomo nor was the White House given a heads up on the New York Democrat's decision to resign.

In recent months, Cuomo had vehemently vowed to not resign, saying it was the people, not politicians, who elected him to his third term in 2018.

But Cuomo ultimately faced an untenable choice: Either step down or face impeachment, which looked increasingly like a fait accompli as more state lawmakers called for his ouster.

"(It) is abundantly clear to me that the Governor has lost the confidence of the Assembly Democratic majority and that he can no longer remain in office," Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, said in a statement Aug. 3 after refraining for months to call for Cuomo's ouster.

Cuomo to resign:A timeline of the New York governor's life and political career

Andrew Cuomo's long rise, stunning fall

Andrew Mark Cuomo was first elected governor Nov. 2, 2010, marking a triumphant return to the state Capitol for the Cuomo family after his father served as governor from 1983 through 1994. He failed in his first bid for governor in 2002.

Since taking office in 2011, Cuomo used his unyielding aggression and distaste for bureaucracy to mold himself into the most consequential and powerful figure in New York government, flexing his muscle to push through major projects like the $4 billion Tappan Zee Bridge replacement and policy like the legalization of same-sex marriage.

He teetered between staying true to his moderate Democratic roots and moving more to the left as the party became more progressive, shepherding through a $15 minimum wage law in 2015 and paid family leave a year later.

Most of his tenure was with Republicans in control of the Senate, though he was able to cajole enough of them to support portions of his agenda, including stronger gun rights laws in 2013 and the same-sex marriage law two years earlier, which at the time made New York the largest state to do so.

In 2020, he rose to his highest level of national fame when his daily PowerPoint-driven briefings gained an international audience amid the coronavirus pandemic, with many supporters coming to view Cuomo's hands-on approach as counterprogramming to a timid federal response led by then-President Donald Trump.

The televised briefings even won him an International Emmy award, and his popularity soared to a record 70% in polls. In October, he released a book, "American Crisis," that recounted his response in the early days of the pandemic and landed on The New York Times Best Sellers List.

The book deal netted him an astounding $5 million from The Crown Publishing Group. But it has since become the subject of an investigation by James, who is examining whether he illegally used state resources to complete the project.

Cuomo's hard-charging style and penchant for threats helped contribute to his demise, alienating state lawmakers who may otherwise have been more willing to stave off potential impeachment proceedings had they viewed the governor as an ally instead of an enemy.

More:Kathy Hochul: 5 things to know about NY's next governor after Cuomo resigns

In the end, his downfall was as swift as his rise was long: Cuomo resigned just five months after former aide Lindsey Boylan published an essay detailing his alleged harassing behavior, including a 2018 meeting in which he kissed her on the lips without consent as she left.

Boylan was followed by a number of other women who publicly shared similar stories of a governor who made inappropriate remarks and unwanted advances.

Among them was Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former aide who said Cuomo asked repeated, invasive questions about her romantic life during one-on-one meetings last May and June, as the state was responding to COVID.

In interviews with the attorney general's investigators, Bennett said the governor asked whether she practiced monogamy and if she had ever been with an older man. Cuomo remarked that he would be comfortable being with a woman in her 20s, she said.

Taken together, Bennett believed Cuomo was propositioning her for sex.

"Without explicitly saying it, he implied to me that I was old enough for him and he was lonely," Bennett, a Westchester County native and Hamilton College graduate, said in an interview with "CBS Evening News."

The attorney general's report corroborated the victims' accounts with contemporaneous text messages, notes and interviews with those familiar with the encounters.

More:Andrew Cuomo mandated sexual harassment training. Did he take it himself?

Cuomo denied any misbehavior, saying he never touched anyone inappropriately while acknowledging he makes jokes and sometimes asks his staff about their personal lives.

After the attorney general's report, Cuomo rejected the most serious of claims, saying he did not grope the executive assistant and suggesting some of his aides misinterpreted his remarks as flirtations.

During a direct-to-the-camera address on Aug. 3, he went so far as to play a slideshow of photos of him and other famous politicians kissing and hugging various people, suggesting his behavior was normal.

"I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances," Cuomo said. "I am 63 years old. I have lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am and that's not who I have ever been."

Kathy Hochul to become NY's 57th governor

Cuomo, who was the state's attorney general from 2007 though 2010, becomes the second New York governor to resign amid scandal since the turn of the century. Eliot Spitzer stepped down in 2008 after his habit of soliciting prostitutes became public.

Hochul, 62, will become New York's 57th governor, breaking a 244-year streak of males holding the state's highest office.

She will also become the first governor to hail from outside New York City and the Hudson Valley since 1922, the final year in office for Gov. Nathan Miller of Cortland County.

She was first elected lieutenant governor when Cuomo won a second term in 2014. She replaced Robert Duffy, the former Rochester mayor who was Cuomo's first lieutenant governor and declined to seek reelection.

A former Erie County clerk, Hochul served in Congress in 2011 and 2012 after scoring an upset win in a special election following the resignation of Rep. Chris Lee.

She lost her bid for reelection to Chris Collins, who later stepped down after he pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and was later pardoned by Trump.

Hochul is well liked in Albany, and she has dutifully crisscrossed the state to tout the Cuomo administration's policies.

Now she will inherit immediate challenges: The state is seeing an increase in COVID-19 cases as the delta variant spreads, leading to questions over whether the state will seek to reinstitute a mask mandate or other similar pandemic-era restrictions.

Cuomo remains under investigation

Cuomo and his administration remain the subject of several investigations or inquiries that could spell trouble for him even after his resignation.

Albany County District Attorney David Soares has opened a criminal investigation into Cuomo, and district attorneys in Manhattan, Westchester County and Nassau County have pledged to examine James' report for possible criminality.

The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn have been investigating Cuomo's administration for its counting of nursing home residents who died of COVID-19.

For months, Cuomo and the state Department of Health refused to release the number of nursing home residents who died in hospitals, instead revealing only those who died in the homes themselves. As a result, the true death toll was underrepresented by more than 40% for months.

Cuomo's office retained high-profile defense attorney Elkan Abramowitz to represent the governor and his team during the federal inquiry.

James's office, meanwhile, is still investigating Cuomo's $5 million book deal, which he struck in the midst of the pandemic. At issue is whether Cuomo used state resources on the book, which is prohibited by law.

"The investigation with respect to the book and whether or not public resources were utilized is ongoing and it's separate and apart from this (sexual harassment) investigation," James said Aug. 3.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A baby born in Singapore last year, who is believed to be the world's smallest baby to have survived a premature birth, went home last month after more than a year in the hospital.

Kwek Yu Xuan was delivered via an emergency C-section in June 2020 at Singapore's National University Hospital, the facility shared on Facebook. She weighed just under 7.5 ounces, approximately as much as a large apple.

The baby spent 13 months in the hospital’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit before being discharged.

“We are happy for the little fighter and her family, and proud of the care provided by our team,” the hospital wrote on Facebook. “Our best wishes to Little Yu Xuan as she continues to grow, thrive and beat the odds every day.”

A registry of “the tiniest babies” managed by the University of Iowa lists a baby born in Germany in 2016 at 8.1 ounces.

Full-term babies are typically delivered at approximately 40 weeks of gestation. Yu Xuan was delivered before 25 weeks.

"Against the odds, with health complications present at birth, she has inspired people around her with her perseverance and growth," the hospital said in a statement to USA TODAY.

The hospital in its statement also described the infant as “a ray of hope amid turmoil” because of her survival during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. She relied on “multiple treatments and machines” during her hospitalization, but the facility said she was “active, cheerful and responsive.”

Her parents, Kwek Wee Liang and Wong Mei Lin, thanked the hospital’s staff in its statement. They said that Yu Xuan’s mother was admitted to the hospital after suffering from preeclampsia, a blood pressure disorder during pregnancy that is dangerous for both a mother and an infant.

The baby is still struggling with chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. However, her doctors expect her to improve as she gets older.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AUSTIN, Texas – House Speaker Dade Phelan late Tuesday signed 52 arrest warrants for Democrats who left the state for Washington, D.C., in July and have yet to return to the House chamber for the second special legislative session of the year.

The warrants came after Texas House Republicans voted to direct state law enforcement to track down and compel the attendance of absent Democrats by a vote of 80-12, the second time such a vote has been taken amid the Democratic lawmakers efforts' to prevent passage of a bill overhauling state election laws.

The warrants, first reported by the Dallas Morning News, were expected to be delivered to the House sergeant-at-arms Wednesday morning, according to Phelan spokesperson Enrique Marquez.

The Texas Constitution requires at least two-thirds of the House and Senate to be present before business can be conducted.

Democrats were able to avoid the reach of state lawmakers during the first special session of the year by crossing state lines. But since the start of the second special session, some Democrats have begun returning to Texas, even as they avoid entering the House chamber.

Four of the 57 quorum-busting Democrats returned to the House chamber on Monday. While some members have returned home or traveled to other locations outside Texas, almost half said they planned to stay in Washington and push for federal voting rights legislation.

Texas Democratic lawmaker:We fled Texas, risked our lives to restore voting rights

Texas Democrats vs. Gov. Greg Abbott:Who will blink first? Abbott may have the upper hand

State Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, said he was still in Washington and did not plan on returning to the House “anytime real soon.”

“We’re united in staying away from the House as long as possible,” Rodriguez said, adding that he and many of his colleagues do not believe Phelan has the authority to issue arrest warrants for absent members. “The court will have to make some kind of decision on whether that’s something that can be done or not.”

A group of the Democrats have filed two lawsuits in response to Republican efforts to bring them back to the House floor to establish a quorum, including one in federal court that argues that the efforts infringe on their constitutional rights.

They also filed suit in a Travis County state district court, where a judge issued an order prohibiting the arrest of absent members. But the Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily blocked the order in response to an emergency petition from Phelan and Gov. Greg Abbott.

State Rep. Lyle Larson was the lone Republican to vote against authorizing the arrest warrants. “Civil discourse took a nasty turn today,” he said on Twitter.

Phelan signed just one arrest warrant during the first special session, for Rep. Philip Cortez of San Antonio. Cortez was one of the 57 Democrats to break quorum and head to Washington, but he returned to Austin and said he hoped to negotiate over the language of the GOP elections bill.

One day later, he returned to Washington and Phelan signed the warrant for his arrest.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Eagerly anticipated new research pinpoints antibodies scientists can test for to see if a COVID-19 vaccine is effective. These "correlates of protection" could speed the development of new vaccines or boosters without requiring the enormous clinical trials used to create the first COVID-19 vaccines.

Instead, researchers could vaccinate people with a new vaccine or booster, measure their antibodies over the course of several months, and know if it worked.

This is "the Holy Grail" in terms of vaccines, and one that hasn't yet been set for the virus that causes COVID-19, said Peter Gilbert, co-author of the study posted Tuesday to medRxiv, a preprint site where scientific articles can be published prior to being accepted by peer-reviewed journals.

"The hope is that the Food and Drug Administration will see these data and use them as a provisional approval mechanism," he said.

Gilbert is a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who also leads the statistical center for the federal government’s COVID-19 Prevention Network.

While the study has not been subject to the strict peer-review required by standard scientific journals, such preprints have become common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gilbert and his co-authors are highly regarded researchers, who have previously published on the topic of correlates of protection and have submitted the paper to a standard journal.

"This is a well done and important piece of collaborative work," said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University, who was not affiliated with the research.

Such correlates have long been used to help create vaccines for other diseases, such as influenza.

"Such measurements should help speed evaluation, including by regulators, of vaccines being used in new populations and/or being made with variants."

Coronavirus pandemic:Researchers are concerned about the possibility that COVID-19 might lead to dementia

Measuring 'soldiers on the field'

The researchers with the Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) study measured levels of two markers of antibodies in the blood of study participants to see if they correlated with COVID-19 risk.

The study took place from July to October 2020 and included 30,415 participants. Half received two doses of the Moderna vaccine, half received a placebo. Of those, 1,051 recipients of the vaccine had their antibodies measured.

Two types of markers were measured: neutralizing antibodies and binding antibodies. Both types have been used as correlates for protection for vaccines against other viral diseases.

The markers for neutralization measure how strongly antibodies block the virus from infecting cells. The markers for binding antibodies measure how many antibodies latch on to the spike protein.

“You could say it measures how many soldiers see the virus and get onto the battlefield,” Gilbert said.

Participants' blood was tested for levels of the markers twice, once after their second shot of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine and again four weeks later.

The higher the amount of antibodies participants had the lower their chance of getting COVID-19. That was true for all antibody markers at both time points.

The effect lasted through four months after the second dose of the vaccine. It may last longer but the study is still ongoing. Future research will look at whether lower antibody levels correspond to more severe cases of COVID-19 and if there's any correlation between age or health issues.

It's important to remember that the antibody levels measured may not represent all that's protecting people against the virus, Goodman said.

"Antibody levels may wane but other aspects of the immune system, not reported on in this study, such as T cells and memory B cells, may potentially still help provide substantial protection against disease, and particularly against severe outcomes," he said.

Because of that, it's still not possible to say waning antibodies are truly predictive of risk. Studies evaluating actual clinical protection and how well it correlates with the antibody levels are still needed, he said.

US COVID-19 map:Tracking cases and deaths

Strong connection between antibodies, protection

Similar data has recently been published by Oxford University in England about the AstraZeneca vaccine and in Israel about the Pfizer vaccine. In both studies, higher antibody levels corresponded with lower rates of disease.

While they used different tests to measure the levels, they are evidence of a strong connection between antibodies and protection.

The antibody levels the researchers looked at don't mean individuals can go out and get their blood drawn to see if they've mounted an effective antibody response to the virus, Gilbert said.

"I don’t think anybody is talking about individuals going into a clinic, finding out their antibodies are low and getting revaccinated. That’s not really the goal of this research," he said. "It’s to provide a way to approve new vaccines quickly."

One of the tests used by the researchers is not readily available at the average medical laboratory, said Alan Wu, a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and chief of the clinical chemistry and toxicology laboratories at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.

The test also doesn't measure all that’s going on in someone's immune system.

“How do you interpret results, as neutralizing antibodies are only half the picture? We also have T-cell immunity,” said Wu.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Local officials are pushing back against Republican governors who banned school mask mandates in two of the country's most populous states, the latest sign of how polarized the issue has become just as classes begin.

The superintendent of the school district in Florida's capital, Tallahassee, said he will mandate use of masks, even as Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an order suggesting punishments for school districts that require masks in classrooms.

Superintendent Rocky Hanna of Leon County – where Tallahassee is located – told school officials at a meeting Monday, "You can't put a price tag on someone's life, including my salary."

Several other Florida counties – including Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Orange and Palm Beach – are also defying DeSantis' order.

In Texas, two of the state's largest school districts, Dallas and Austin, have announced mask requirements in defiance of Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order banning such mandates.

“We’re in a situation that has gotten significantly more urgent,” Dallas Independent School District Superintendent Michael Hinojosa said in announcing the district would be the first in the state to require masks for students and teachers.

Austin Superintendent Stephanie S. Elizalde said the district will require face masks amid a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations from the highly contagious delta variant. And Houston ISD Superintendent Millard House II is expected to seek approval for a mask mandate from the school board of the largest school district in the state this week.

Some college professors 'freaking out' with concerns about virus exposure

While close to 700 colleges require students or staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19, many don't have such a mandate, and some may not enforce use of masks either, even as infections surge nationally.

That leaves some faculty members worried that, as in-person teaching resumes in the coming weeks, they'll be exposed to the coronavirus and its highly transmissible delta variant.

“We’re all freaking out,” says Kelly Benjamin, spokesperson for the American Association of University Professors.

Florida, Texas COVID-19 cases strain emergency services

New COVID-19 cases filling up Florida hospital beds are straining the state's emergency services, including ambulances and fire departments. In St. Petersburg, patients may wait in ambulances for up to an hour before they're admitted into a hospital, Pinellas County Administrator Barry Burton said.

Burton said the most serious cases still get prompt attention, and the county is working with fire rescue officials to find more ambulances and extra staff. But “that really taxes an already overstressed fire and rescue staff,” he said.

COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida have surpassed the worst previous surge in July 2020 and set a record with 13,600 Monday.

In Texas, Houston is experiencing a similar strain as some hospitals operate under "internal disaster" codes, meaning ambulances are being diverted because its emergency department has too many acutely ill patients, ABC 13 reported.

Georgia school goes to distance learning after 23 test positive

It took only two days after Glascock County Consolidated School in Georgia started the fall term for the first signs of COVID-19 to show.

Principal Michael Costello said all the health data in the weeks leading up to the beginning of the school year looked encouraging, but shortly after classes started Aug. 2, a few students started reporting COVID symptoms. Now two high schoolers and 14 elementary and middle school kids have the virus.

“It just took off,” Costello said.

School boards face ongoing battle over mask requirements

In districts across the country, school board meetings have become the battlegrounds of unruly debates over mask mandates in schools. Fueled by misinformation campaigns against masks, tensions have heightened in schools, turning once sparsely attended school board meetings into shouting matches.

Most recently, anger over mask requirements boiled over in North Carolina when a group of unruly parents opposing Buncombe County's mask requirements "overthrew" the current board and instated themselves into the positions. Roughly 30 people signed a loose-leaf paper claiming themselves "witnesses" of the new school board.

"They acted as a dictatorship, and so therefore, the people then take it into our own hands to abolish that governance and reelect new members right then and there," said the group's leader, Stephanie Parsons.

Buncombe County Schools attorney Dean Shatley said the group’s actions “unequivocally” do not mean the current school board is out of office.

Other school board meetings across the country have been rescheduled because of rowdy anti-masking protests, one of which led to charges filed in July against 11 people who interrupted a Utah school board meeting.

11 states report 1 million COVID cases

Half of the states have reported at least 500,000 COVID-19 cases, a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows, and 11 have reached the 1 million mark as the pandemic reasserts its grip on the U.S.

The states that have crossed the seven-figure threshold include California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina, New Jersey and Michigan. Oklahoma and Kentucky recorded their 500,000th infections Monday.

Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana have more people hospitalized with COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic, causing a shortage of nurses and other healthcare personnel.

Kentucky had a few hundred COVID hospitalizations in early July, but the total skyrocketed to 1,139 by Monday. Numbers of patients in intensive care and on ventilators also have risen steadily.

In Oklahoma, the seven-day average of new daily cases now tops 2,000. The last time the state's rate of daily cases was higher was in early February.

Vaccine trial volunteers left waiting for FDA authorization

Months after Troy Petenbrink received the Novavax vaccine as part of a clinical trial, he's still waiting for the biotech company to apply for authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. And while other fully vaccinated people are going to gyms, movie theaters and bars, Petenbrink is struggling to convince strangers that he's protected.

A freelance travel writer, Petenbrink had to turn down an assignment because the cruise line only accepts the three authorized vaccines, from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. He recently tried to go to a bar with his partner but was turned away because he hadn't received one of the three FDA-authorized vaccines.

"No one along the way explained any of this as a possibility," he said of the clinical trial.

About 50,000 Americans are in the same situation, having volunteered for either the Novavax or AstraZeneca vaccine trials.

Both vaccines have shown strong effectiveness and safety data. AstraZeneca's vaccine has been distributed across the U.K., Europe and other parts of the world. But both companies have yet to submit their vaccines for authorization in the U.S.

Florida children returning to school amid spike in infections

Most Florida children are returning to school in areas where COVID-19 outbreaks are far more intense than they were when school started last year.

In most counties, cases are at least four times higher than a year ago, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Five counties report a more than tenfold increase.

Cases among children are also surging, raising questions about the health consequences of students returning to campuses and a state ban on school mask mandates while vaccines are available for only some of the schoolchildren.

Public health experts and pediatricians said last fall that the most important factor to consider when deciding whether to start classes in-person was the amount of viral spread in the community at large. With cases so much higher than last year, districts are going against those recommendations by welcoming students to campus and limiting online learning options.

Under pressure, Gov. Cuomo resigns

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation Tuesday under the weight of a sexual harassment scandal that engulfed his administration and derailed his political future, capping a remarkable and rapid fall for a governor whose national profile had risen to extraordinary heights during the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo, a Democrat, said his resignation would take effect in 14 days, ending a decade-long run in the office. Once Cuomo steps down, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul of Buffalo will make history as the first woman to serve as New York governor. Cuomo, 63, resisted calls for his resignation over the past five months, a period in which multiple women, including current and former state employees, publicly accused him of inappropriate or harassing behavior. He denies any wrongdoing. Cuomo and his administration remain the subject of several investigations or inquiries that could spell trouble for him even after his resignation.

Infrastructure bill keeps on truckin'

Clearing a major roadblock for a core Biden administration priority, the Senate approved a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill Tuesday – but the legislation must overcome more obstacles before it becomes law. Senators voted 69-30 to approve the package, which would direct billions to modernize roads, bridges and transit systems while expanding high-speed internet systems and the nation's network of electric vehicle charging stations. The bill goes to the House. The legislation calls for $550 billion in spending. Among the major investments in the bipartisan package are $110 billion for roads and bridges, $39 billion for public transit and $66 billion for railways. It contains $55 billion for water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as billions for airports, seaports, broadband internet and electric vehicle charging stations.

All eyes on this tropical disturbance

A disturbance swirling in the Caribbean was expected to become Tropical Storm Fred, the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday. Florida could be in the storm's path, but forecasters said it was too early to determine the exact track. The system, known as Potential Tropical Cyclone Six, moved through the southern Leeward Islands overnight Monday and was about 220 miles southeast of Ponce, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday afternoon, according to the center. It had 35 mph maximum sustained winds and moved west-northwest at 18 mph. A tropical storm has maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph.

Siti Sarah Raisuddin, 36, was eight months pregnant when she was put into an induced coma after contracting COVID-19 and experiencing low oxygen levels, according to a local report.

The baby, born on Friday, survived, but Raisuddin succumbed to the virus 48 hours later, leaving behind three other children and her husband, Shuib Sepahtu.

"With the help of the nurses and doctor, I was able to make the video call and that was the last time my kids and I would lay our eyes on her while she was still alive," Sepahtu told local reporters.

During the call, he said there were "tears streaming down her cheeks" like she understood what was being said to her.

LOS ANGELES — California's attorney general has filed manslaughter charges against a former Los Angeles police officer who was off duty when he fatally shot a man who was shopping with his parents in 2019.

Officer Salvador Sanchez, who was a seven-year veteran of the LAPD at the time of the shooting, was arrested Monday in Riverside County. He faces one count of voluntary manslaughter and two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. The LAPD says he was terminated from the agency in July 2020, but it declined further comment on Sanchez's arrest.

Sanchez was with his young son in a Costco in Corona when he was attacked from behind by 32-year-old Kenneth French, who was described by his family as non-verbal and intellectually disabled. Sanchez was knocked to the ground and quickly opened fire, fatally wounding French and critically injuring French's parents, Russell and Paola French.

Sanchez had told investigators he believed French had a gun and that his life and his son's life were in immediate danger. Authorities said French was not armed and was moving away from Sanchez when the officer opened fire.

Kenneth French was nonverbal and had recently been taken off his medication for mental illness due to other health issues, the family's lawyer previously said, adding that the change may have affected his behavior that night. French's parents have filed a federal lawsuit against Sanchez and the city.

The charges filed by California Attorney General Rob Bonta came after the Riverside County district attorney declined to charge Sanchez criminally when a grand jury did not bring an indictment in September 2019.

Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin previously said Sanchez believed he had been shot in the head and that a gunman was on the loose in the store after he and his 1½-year-old son were knocked to the ground in French's unprovoked assault.

David Winslow, Sanchez's attorney, called his client's arrest a "political stunt that does absolutely nothing to protect the public."

"The arrest of Sal Sanchez is a product of the politically motivated program by the California Attorney General to prosecute police officers," Winslow said in a statement Monday. "Sal was not acting as a police officer when he was attacked. He was off duty acting as a father in self-defense and protecting his child."

Bonta's office in July announced that state investigators would respond to police fatal shootings of unarmed civilians after lawmakers passed legislation last year amid civil unrest over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer.

"Where there's reason to believe a crime has been committed, we will seek justice," Bonta said Monday in a news release. "That's exactly what these charges are about: pursuing justice after an independent and thorough review of the evidence and the law.

Ultimately, any loss of life is a tragedy, and being licensed to carry a gun doesn't mean you're not accountable for how you use it. No matter who you are, nobody is above the law."

The Riverside district attorney's office said Monday it would assist Bonta's office in the prosecution, but noted that its own investigation ended when the grand jury did not find enough probable cause to move forward with the case.

The Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners ruled last year that Sanchez had violated departmental policy in the shooting.

The French family's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A group of 19 Senate Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined the entire Democratic caucus in passing a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package on Tuesday.

The bill passed with a vote of 69-30, more than two weeks after President Joe Biden declared “we have a deal” with a bipartisan group of negotiators.

But the final bill included some noteworthy dissent.

Republican Sens. Jerry Moran of Kansas and Todd Young of Indiana were part of the bipartisan coalition backing the deal in July, but both voted against the bill on Tuesday, citing concerns about the national debt and Democrats’ plan to take up a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package after the infrastructure vote.

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., was not present for the vote but said he would not support the bill even though he also was part of the initial bipartisan group.

What's in the infrastructure bill? Roads, broadband and bridges: Here's what's in the infrastructure agreement

In the split Senate, the bill still drew support from enough Republicans to pass the chamber, even as they faced pressure from former President Donald Trump to not give Biden a legislative win.

Biden said after the vote on Tuesday that he called most of the 19 Republican senators who voted for the infrastructure bill to praise them.

"You have, and no doubt you will, disagree with me on many issues. But where we can agree, we should," he said. "And here on this bill, we proved that we can still come together to do big things, important things, for the American people."

Here is how the Senate's 50 Republicans voted:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A 1,000-year-old grave in Finland may debunk assumed gender roles in ancient society as researchers believe the resting place may have belonged to a highly respected and known nonbinary person.

In a peer-reviewed study in the European Journal of Archaeology, researchers analyzed DNA of the remains found in an iron grave at Suontaka Vesitorninmäki in Hattula, Finland.

“The overall context of the grave indicates that it was a respected person whose gender identity may well have been nonbinary,” according to the study. Someone who is nonbinary doesn't identify exclusively as female or male.

Researchers originally believed the grave belonged to a woman after they found jewelry such as oval brooches and clothing in 1968. The items led researchers to believe the person was buried in common feminine attire for the century, according to the study.

They also had found hiltless sword placed on the person’s left side, which is typically a more masculine custom. Due to the feminine and masculine contents in the grave, researchers had two theories – two bodies, a man and a woman, were in the grave or the remains were evidence of two female leaders or warriors.

More recent DNA testing confirmed the grave only held one person who had Klinefelter syndrome. Genetically, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Klinefelter syndrome results when a male is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome. The syndrome sometimes results in males developing enlarged breasts, infertility and other symptoms.

“The buried individual seems to have been a highly respected member of their community,” the study’s lead author, Ulla Moilanen told The Guardian. “They were laid in the grave on a soft feather blanket with valuable furs and objects.”

The discovery goes against the "ultramasculine environment" in the medieval Scandinavia era where men seen mixing with feminine social roles would be outcasts. Researchers theorize the person was accepted as nonbinary due to their high and secure status in society or because they were a respected shaman.

Paleo geneticists and researchers globally said the study is "convincing" and agree the person buried in Suontaka was likely nonbinary, according to the Livescience website.

Leszek Gardeła of the National Museum of Denmark told the Guardian that the study proved early medieval societies “had very nuanced approaches to and understandings of gender identities”.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark – About 96,000 farmed salmon are believed to have died when a leak in a nearby tank sent about 4,000 gallons of chlorine into a fjord in Arctic Norway.

Roger Pedersen, a spokesman for the salmon farming company Grieg Seafood, said the leak happened at one of its fish slaughterhouses in the town of Alta, and the fish were in a waiting cage at the time.

“We are connecting this to a chlorine leak,” Pedersen told Norwegian broadcaster NRK, adding the company was handling the dead fish “in a responsible way and was investigating why the leak occurred.”

The chlorine is used to disinfect the water after slaughtering.

On Twitter, police in northern Norway said that “significant quantities of salmon are dead” and that the leaked liquid had flowed into the Atlantic Ocean.

Police spokesman Stein Hugo Joergensen told NRK there was no danger of any toxic chlorine gas on land. As for the cause for the leak, it was still being investigated.

Alta sits 109 miles northeast of Tromsoe, the largest city in Arctic Norway.

Grieg Seafood describes itself as one of the world’s leading salmon farming companies. It has farms in Norway, Canada and off Britain's Shetland Islands. Its headquarters are in Bergen, Norway.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Before the South Dakota Department of Education released a draft of new social studies standards last week, department officials took out more than a dozen references to education on the Oceti Sakowin.

“Oceti Sakowin” refers collectively to the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people who are indigenous to South Dakota and surrounding states.

This is according to a draft of the standards dated July 26 obtained by the Argus Leader. The draft was created by a work group of more than 50 educators tasked with retooling the standards.

More:South Dakota education department to change social studies standards after review

Mary Stadick Smith, deputy secretary for the DOE, said in an email Tuesday morning that the department made "certain adjustments" before the release of the Aug. 6 draft to provide "greater clarity and focus" for educators and the public.

See what was released by the state education department here.

The draft of standards dated July 26 approved by the work group, though, shows multiple grade-level standards referring to the Oceti Sakowin Oyate, compared to three mentions of Oceti Sakowin in the draft released publicly 10 days later.

Friday’s release of the new standards follows July news that a pair of conservatives quit the work group, but they did not publicly say why they resigned.

More:Conservatives resign from group retooling South Dakota social studies standards

Major removals of Indigenous topics

Several of the standards on Oceti Sakowin were removed completely, including:

In kindergarten civics, discussing the meaning of kinship to the Oceti Sakowin Oyate.

In kindergarten geography, discussing the tribal nations of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate.

In first grade civics, identifying symbols of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate, including but not limited to star quilt, buffalo and medicine wheels.

In first grade geography, recognizing the nine contemporary reservations of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate on a South Dakota map.

In second grade civics, exploring the concepts of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate, including but not limited to tribal flags, celebrations (powwows), beadwork, dreamcatchers, music and artwork.

In second grade geography, identifying names and locations of Oceti Sakowin Oyate tribes within our communities and state.

In third grade civics, learning how to describe tribal organizational structures (council, chairman, etc.)

In third grade geography, researching the nine tribes in South Dakota

In fifth grade, standards for learning about tribal sovereignty in civics class and how natural resources and migration affected the lives and culture of the Oceti Sakowin were both removed completely.

In eighth grade history, examining major cultural traits and resiliency of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate throughout history

In eighth grade history, critiquing significant primary sources, including Oceti Sakowin Oyate treaties, and their impact on events of this time period.

In eighth grade civics, two grade-level standards on Indigenous topics were removed completely, including evaluating changing federal policy toward Indigenous Native Americans, and comparing and contrasting the structure of the U.S. government and sovereign tribal governments.

What were the major revisions?

Several other grade-level standards that referred to the Oceti Sakowin were revised, including:

In kindergarten history, students will read or listen to Oceti Sakowin Oyate stories, such as Iktomi stories and historical lore stories. This standard was revised to state that students will understand there are different people and cultural groups that make up South Dakota’s communities.

In first grade history, discussing the Oceti Sakowin Oyate creation story, including the correct chronological order of the story, was revised to identify celebrations and traditions various cultural groups bring to South Dakota communities.

In second grade history, discussing the culture of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate before European interactions was changed to “using multiple sources, investigate the impact South Dakotans, including Indigenous Native Americans, had on United States and South Dakota history.”

In third grade history, learning about “early settlement and development” was changed to learning about “creation of communities.”

Standards for fourth grade history changed entirely in one section, from explaining how the Oceti Sakowin was affected by “westward expansion, the creation of the reservation system, and the U.S. assimilation policies and programs,” to describing the “influences of various cultures on South Dakota communities.”

Next steps for the standards

Proposed standards will go to four public hearings between now and 2022 until the Board of Education Standards (BOES) takes them up for approval by spring 2022.

The work is part of a cyclical review by the DOE of standards on a regular basis, and separate from Gov. Kristi Noem's $900,000 push to create a new, state-specific civics and history curriculum resource.

The state's fine arts and career and technical education standards are going through a similar cyclical review process at this time.

The BOES will hold the first public hearing on these proposed standards at its Sept. 20 meeting at Holgate Middle School in Aberdeen. The hearing will begin at 9 a.m.

The other three hearings will be held throughout the 2021-22 school year at board meetings in Sioux Falls, Pierre, and Rapid City. The board will take final action on the proposed standards at the last of these meetings.

The resignation is effective immediately, Fann said.

The resignation ends a five-year legislative career for the Phoenix Democrat, who has represented a district that stretches from west-central Phoenix to Glendale.

It follows days of a torrent of calls for him to step down from the seat he was re-elected to last fall.

In a written statement to Fann, with Senate Minority Leader Rebecca Rios copied, Navarrete wrote simply, "Effective immediately, I am officially resigning my post as Arizona State Senator for District 30."

"I'm very glad he decided to do the right thing so he can figure out his next steps," said Fann, R-Prescott.

Fann said she and Rios, D-Phoenix, will issue a joint statement about the resignation. The two leaders issued a joint plea Monday calling for his immediate departure, especially after an ethics investigation was launched.

Navarrete's resignation triggers a replacement process that starts with the precinct committee chairmen in Legislative District 30. They will nominate three candidates, who by law must all be Democrats, as Navarrete is a Democrat.

The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors will choose a replacement from that list, who will be sworn in and will serve out the rest of Navarrete's term, which ends in January 2023.

A status conference on Navarrete's case is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Thursday.

USA TODAY

Grim warnings from the world’s leading climate scientists on Monday make clear the Earth faces irreversible changes from global warming and stress the need for immediate and wide-scale greenhouse gas reductions to avoid further damage.

Calling it a "code red for humanity," Monday's report says that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels “will be beyond reach” in the next two decades. That will mean more flooding, more wildfires, more wild swings in weather.

Those startling projections come despite a chorus of pledges to curb carbon emissions from coast to coast.

Over the past three decades, more than 600 local governments across the United States adopted their own climate action plans setting greenhouse gas reduction targets. These pledges were in addition to America’s commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement, an international treaty signed by nearly 200 nations to limit the impact of climate change.

But experts now say that many of those cities’ individual plans were aspirational at best. Now they must work harder if they’re going to curb the warming trend.

The USA TODAY Network reached out to half a dozen communities with climate plans. Reporters found some have made progress on reducing emissions, but others struggle to keep pace.

Austin, for example, successfully decreased its building emissions by 20% despite a booming population, but experienced an increase in transportation emissions between 2010 and 2018.

Phoenix reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 0.5% between 2012 and 2018. Over the same time period its population grew by 12%.

And in Palm Springs, California, the city met one of its climate goals by reducing its 2020 emissions to 16% below 2010 levels. But it fell short on its plan to cut emissions to 7% below 1990 levels.

Indianapolis was late to the party, having established its inaugural sustainability plan in 2019. Like others, the city aims to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050, but has a long way to go.

The USA TODAY Network’s findings are consistent with a study last year by the nonprofit Brookings Institution. It found just 45 of the 100 largest U.S. cities had adopted a serious climate pledge, and two-thirds of those with plans have fallen short of their targets. More than a dozen appeared to have no emissions tracking at all.

The good news is that those 45 communities have made a small difference, the Brookings Institution said. Together, they will eliminate some 6% of total annual U.S. emissions compared with 2017 levels – the equivalent of 365 million metric tons of carbon pollution or taking 79 million vehicles off the road.

A small window of opportunity remains for local governments to get serious about curbing climate change, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. But, to achieve any kind of major corrective action, emissions must be slashed by the end of the decade.

The pressure is on to limit emissions faster at every level, said Mark Muro, a senior fellow with the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.

Cities can play a key role in the nation’s ability to cut greenhouse gas, but more need to adopt action plans, Muro said, and those that have “need to deliver on their promises and tighten them.”

“Within this decade we have to make a sharp turn,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director and economist for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “If there’s going to be a shift, we need ambitious goals.”

Cities already feel the heat

Top U.S. cities must reduce their annual emissions by 64% by 2050, the Brookings Institution said.

If they do not succeed, heat, droughts and extreme rain events will increase with every additional increment of global warming, the IPCC panel wrote. Already mountain and polar glaciers are committed to continue melting for decades or centuries, and the panel reported it’s “virtually certain” global mean sea levels will continue rising over this century.

Drastic and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could lead to discernible differences within 20 years.

For the first time, the IPCC report included interactive tools to help communities set those goals by allowing the cities to visualize the local impacts of the changing climate and rising seas.

Some communities told USA TODAY that they plan to be carbon neutral within three decades. Their motivation is driven in part by the climate impacts they already experience today. Sweltering in record high temperatures baking the southern half of the United States, cities like Austin, Phoenix and Miami are racing to cut emissions by beefing up public transit, adding electrical charging stations and making it easier to get around on foot or bicycle.

Austin succeeded in lowering building emissions by 20%, but saw transportation emissions rise over the past decade. Last year, the city voted to allocate $7.1 billion to an ambitious transportation plan officials say could help them meet some emissions-reduction goals.

In a plan expected to come up for a vote this fall, Austin hopes to see 40% of its vehicle miles coming from electric cars by 2030 and hopes to have a 50% tree cover by 2050.

Palm Springs also has seen success in reducing emissions, but the city sweltered this summer during its hottest June and July on record and fears the rising heat will hurt its tourism-reliant economy.

It reduced last year’s emissions to 16% below levels a decade ago. That was due in large part to a collaboration with a community-choice program launched last year that allows local governments to purchase electricity for its residents. All residents were automatically enrolled in Desert Community Energy’s carbon free plan, which provides electricity from carbon-free sources such as hydropower, wind, and solar.

Without the program, city officials said it would have seen a nearly 5% increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

The city is reviewing 78 potential measures to see where it could reach the biggest gains, hoping to reduce emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below its 1990 levels by 2050.

Miami-Dade announced plans last year to reach 60% of its 2018 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and carbon neutrality by 2050. The city was one of the earlier local governments to adopt a climate action plan and already faces worsening effects from rising sea levels.

"I think we welcome the (IPCC) report because it spotlights and gives us better data on the things we have been planning for almost 30 years,” said Jim Murley, the county’s chief resilience officer.

The city is expanding its fleet of electric buses, but it has encountered difficulties in finding buses to buy, Murley said. The city is competing against a huge demand for the vehicles, he said.

Community officials also find that high-tide flooding sometimes demands more urgent focus and funding than its climate planning. For example, the city collaborated in a public-private partnership to build a billion-dollar tunnel that will improve traffic to and from the seaport, but includes flood gates to protect the city from a rising tide during storms.

Phoenix, in Maricopa County, Arizona, is another community that needs little reminder.

The number of days at 110 degrees or higher is projected to double by 2060, said Diana Bermudez, director of strategy for the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Even deadlier are the number of nights with a low temperature of 90 degrees. “In 2020, we had 28 days where the temperature never dipped below 90.”

Maricopa County already reported 47 confirmed heat-associated deaths as of July 31, compared to 15 over the same time span last year.

The city's updated climate action plan, now open for public comment, calls for transitioning the city’s electrical use to carbon neutral by 2030. Like Miami, Phoenix proposes to be carbon-neutral by 2050.

Late adopters make gains

Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis are later entries to climate action planning.

Columbus last year announced that emissions actually increased by 2.3% since 2013 as more people moved to the area, according to data released in November 2019. The goal was to reduce emissions by 20% in 2020. The city is now setting new emissions reductions goals.

Though planning has been underway for a few years in Columbus, some are calling for more specifics and accountability in the draft plan it released last year.

Cities can say they’re going to do a lot, said Aaron Wilson, an atmospheric scientist at Ohio State University’s Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center. “But if you're not monitoring what you're doing and those changes, and you’re held to a standard of accountability, then what's the point in having a climate plan?”

“You have to be able to monitor it, to show that goals are being met, or that goals are changing based on the progress or how things are proceeding,” he said.

The city took comments in March on a proposal to slash emissions by 25% by 2030, using 2018 as a baseline, and to become carbon neutral by 2050.

The public’s response was “we need to do more,” said Erin Beck, assistant director of Sustainable Columbus, a city environmental initiative. “And we need to do it faster, which is certainly supported, and underscored by the IPCC report.”

The city expects to have a plan approved by fall. But, as of Monday, the city still hadn’t decided where to set its reduction goal.

Indianapolis established its inaugural sustainability plan in 2019. Like others, the city aims to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050 but has a long way to go.

According to a 2008 Brookings study, Indianapolis had the second highest carbon footprint among the top 100 major metropolitan areas across the country.

The average Indianapolis resident emitted roughly 3.4 tons of carbon from a combination of both transportation and residential energy use. The average American, on the other hand, emitted only 2.6 tons of carbon – almost an entire ton less.

“This is a large puzzle, so we are still fitting all those pieces together,” said Morgan Mickelson, the city’s sustainability director. “But all the progress we’ve been making will help us set some more tangible targets.”

City Councilmember John Barth wants to do more.

The question becomes “does this plan go far enough and is it moving fast enough,” Barth said. “My vision is to spend time on that and think through if there is more we can be doing and for the plan we already have, is there a need to accelerate the work we’re doing.”

Climate experts would answer with a resounding yes.

So far, what’s happening in Indianapolis and the Midwest isn’t “nearly enough,” said Gabe Filippelli, executive director of the Environmental Resilience Institute at Indiana University. Cities need to make sure they’re not only carbon neutral by 2050 but carbon negative.

But there is hope for the cities to achieve the goals, according to experts like David Victor, co-author of the Brookings report and professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy.

“Cities make great laboratories for combating climate change because some of the hardest tasks in cutting emissions involve activities such as urban planning and rebuilding transportation infrastructures – areas where cities are on the front lines,” Victor said. If the nation’s cities take action one by one, it could add up to “a powerful approach to climate mitigation.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A tropical storm warning for the Florida Keys was discontinued Saturday as Tropical Depression Fred weakened to a tropical wave, the National Hurricane Center said. Florida could see two storm landfalls within days as Tropical Storm Grace picks up speed.

Fred is expected to reform Sunday as it passes over the Gulf of Mexico. It could arrive in Florida's panhandle and the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama on Monday.

The storm, which soaked parts of Cuba on Friday, was on track to redevelop to a tropical depression and ultimately strengthen to a tropical storm, it wasn't expected to reach hurricane strength, the Hurricane Center said.

Fred reached tropical storm strength late Tuesday and drenched the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before continuing its downpour on the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Hurricane season is upon us during a pandemic.Here's what you need to protect yourself.

The storm weakened, as expected, but forecasters say it could gain momentum en route to Florida. While there is still uncertainty about its track, Fred could make landfall in the state in multiple locations, forecasters said.

Fred is the sixth named storm of the 2021 hurricane season and first in August, breaking a monthlong lull after Hurricane Elsa.

Where are the remnants of Tropical Depression Fred?

The storm was about 125 miles southeast of Key West as of 11 a.m. EDT Saturday. It was moving west-northwest at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph.

What do the spaghetti models forecast for Fred?

After Fred moves past Cuba later Friday, it's expected to be west of the lower Florida Keys on Saturday afternoon.

The National Hurricane Center said its official track shows Fred over the eastern Gulf Saturday night through Monday, which could lead to more strengthening, before a final landfall is forecast along the Big Bend region or the panhandleearly next week.

When is Fred expected to make landfall?

Fred made landfall in the Dominican Republic on Wednesday. It was scraping the coast of Cuba on Friday. A Monday landfall in the Keys is likely, forecasters say.

Irreversible changes, warmer temperatures sooner:5 alarming findings from the UN climate change report

How strong is Fred?

Maximum sustained winds reached 40 mph Wednesday before Fred was downgraded to a tropical depression, then a tropical wave, with winds of 35 mph.

In the Dominican Republic, about 300,000 customers were without power, and forecasters warned there was a risk of dangerous flooding and mudslides after heavy rain. Puerto Rico had 13,000 customers without power after Fred roared through.

The National Weather Service said the Keys and southern Florida could also expect to see 3 to 5 inches of rain; some areas could get up to 10 inches through Monday. That raises the possibility of flash flooding, the Weather Service said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@DETROIT — Storms swept through Wednesday leaving more than 850,000 customer in the Midwest without power, according to data from Poweroutage.us, with the most residents in the dark in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Illinois.

On Wednesday evening in Michigan, more than 400,000 DTE customers and more than 200,000 Consumers Energy customers throughout the state were reportedly without power. By 8 p.m. Wednesday, each company had dispatched hundreds of power restoration crews.

Heavy rains and 60 mph winds damaged more than 2,000 power lines, DTE said in a news release. Teams will be working 16-hour shifts around-the-clock to restore power, as the company brings in 1,000 additional line workers from out of state to help with restoration efforts. DTE customers can expect a more accurate restoration estimate once a crew has been assigned to their outage, DTE said.

According to a statement on the Consumers Energy website, more than 200,000 customers were left without power after a powerful storm on Tuesday night. With Wednesday's storms and more turbulent weather forecast for Thursday, the company is also bringing in additional crews from out of state to assist in restoring power.

Consumers Energy customers without power can expect to have it restored by the end of the day Friday, although additional storms could delay restoration into the weekend, the company said.

Metro Detroit could see more severe weather overnight between 9 p.m. Wednesday and 4 a.m. Thursday, said Megan Varcie, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Detroit/Pontiac weather forecast office.

Since these storms will be coming late in the evening and overnight, it's important to have several ways to receive warnings, Varcie said.

Related:Study warns of 'irreversible transition' in ocean currents that could rapidly freeze parts of North America

There will be a marginal risk for severe weather on Thursday, with a risk of damaging winds and hail, but those storms will be more isolated than Wednesday's storms, Varcie said.

Milwaukee residents on Wednesday cleaned up from one major thunderstorm in the August heat while preparing for the next one. Thankfully, the worst of Wednesday's storms missed the Milwaukee area.

As of 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, about 85,000 customers were still without power.

The situation was made more urgent by the forecast. Meteorologists expected Wednesday evening's storms to pack a punch as well, but those storms largely missed the Milwaukee area.

Around 6 p.m., a line of severe storms in western Wisconsin was moving slowly eastward, bringing a risk of tornadoes, hail and damaging winds. Additional thunderstorms were developing ahead of the line in the southern portions of Milwaukee and Waukesha counties, and afternoon storms in northeast Wisconsin had already produced at least three tornadoes, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service.

Compounding the issue, roughly 100,000 customers in southeast Wisconsin spent the day without power — and without air conditioning. The weather service projected heat indices would top 100 degrees. Officials opened cooling centers and reminded the public how to stay safe in the heat.

Fact check:Flight cancellations due to weather, labor shortage, not vaccine mandates

More than 85,000 northern Ohioans remained without power Wednesday night as a series of severe thunderstorms pummeled the area, knocking down trees with 80 mph winds. Though Wednesday night was relatively quiet, another band of storms is currently forming and will move into the region Thursday, said the weather service in Cleveland.

"Damaging winds will be the primary weather hazard," they wrote. "Heavy rainfall with these thunderstorms may also lead to localized flooding."

And upwards of 35,000 Illinois residents were still without power around midnight Wednesday due to the storms speeding through the Chicago area overnight Tuesday at at least 70 mph.

Residents in Evanston, Illinois, and Plainfield, Illinois, reported extensive tree damage. In Evanston, there were reports of malfunctioning street lights, traffic signals and street flooding, National Weather Service meteorologist Ricky Castro told the Chicago Sun-Times.

The weather service said a survey crew had confirmed Tuesday that at least seven tornadoes touched down Monday in northern Illinois.

A heat advisory remains in effect across north-central Illinois, northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana until Wednesday night, when the weather service said more severe weather is possible in that region.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Students who use phony COVID-19 vaccine cards to skirt mandates at U.S. colleges and universities are risking disastrous consequences, according to school officials and other experts.

Hundreds of colleges and universities now require proof of COVID-19 inoculations. The process to confirm vaccination at many schools can be as simple as uploading a picture of the vaccine card to the student’s portal. However, an easy click of the mouse could spell a hard road for students’ academic futures – if that card is a fake.

“At a minimum, it’s likely to be a federal crime … because when you get the vaccine card it has the CDC stamp on it,” Erika K. Wilson, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told USA TODAY. “So, if people are buying those fake cards, it could certainly fall under that statute.”

Selling fake, blank cards has become a cottage industry in some corners of the internet. In at least one case, a person was arrested in California for selling fake cards.

Both faculty and students at dozens of schools interviewed by The Associated Press say they are concerned about how easy it is to get fake vaccine cards. Growing concern has even reached the federal level, with the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issuing a joint statement in March urging people not to buy, create or sell fabricated vaccine cards.

Vaccine passport:Honor system, paper cards won't cut it for COVID-19 vaccine verification, experts say

Without a federal vaccination database, the easy-to-forge paper cards have become the default proof of vaccination. But it can be possible to determine if a card is faked.

Wilson said it wouldn’t be difficult for colleges and universities to eventually verify the legitimacy of the card: “When you get your vaccination shot, most county health departments have some record of it, so there is a way to cross-reference it,” she said.

And getting caught with a fake COVID-19 vaccine card could derail a student’s academic career.

Elizabeth Heaton, vice president of Bright Horizons College Coach, said submitting a fake vaccine card is “the absolute worst thing that a student could do.”

“Because now you’re taking something where the college wants you to get a vaccine and you don’t want to get it, and it’s a disagreement, and you’re turning it into a situation where you are lying and falsifying documents,” Heaton told USA TODAY. “And that is super serious.”

It's not yet clear how schools would handle such an infraction, but Katie Burns, a college admissions counselor from IvyWise and a former senior assistant director of admissions at MIT, said it could be seen as a violation of "community standards" — like using a fake ID. It could also be seen as an issue of "academic dishonesty" — like plagiarism. The latter often quickly leads to a student being expelled.

“Almost all colleges and universities have some internal process for meting out student discipline, and I can’t see why a violation of a policy that makes use of a fake vaccination card wouldn’t go through that same internal procedure,” Wilson said.

Expulsion from school is on the table as a disciplinary option, multiple institutions told USA TODAY.

At Albertus Magnus College, a Catholic private liberal arts college based in Connecticut, submitting a fake vaccine card would be considered a form of “falsification,” which is a direct violation of the college’s student conduct code and community standards.

A student’s failure to comply with the student code of conduct “may result in administrative withdrawal from the college,” according to the college’s official website.

August 6:Supreme Court asked to block Indiana University's COVID-19 vaccine mandate

Albion College, a private liberal arts college in Michigan which requires students and employees to submit their vaccination records to the school’s COVID-19 Team, said submitting a fake vaccine card could trigger the school's student conduct process, which could lead to a hearing and possible suspension or expulsion.

“We take this process very seriously in order to protect our campus and the community and ensure a safe start to the school year,” said Leroy Wright, vice president for student development and dean of students, in a statement.

Michael Trivette, co-founder of College Transitions, said the seriousness of public health associated with lying about vaccination status would make expulsion a credible option for colleges and universities in their disciplinary process.

“Given that the student knowingly put others at risk, it's certainly plausible that the institution would view the action as grounds for dismissal,” Trivette wrote in an email to USA TODAY.

Trivette also said a public record of using a fake vaccine card can haunt a student for the rest of their college career.

“If a student has a record of forgery and subsequent disciplinary infractions on their academic record, it may negatively impact their admission prospects for transfer admissions and/or graduate school admissions,” Trivette said.

President Joe Biden plans to host a virtua "summit for democracy" in December as he aims to assemble government, civil society and private sector leaders in what he's cast as a global faceoff against rising autocratic forces. (Aug. 11)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Weakened and hospitalized with COVID-19, Kristen McMullen of West Melbourne, Florida, gave birth to her tiny daughter, Summer Reign, via emergency C-section on July 27.

She could only cradle her newborn for a few fleeting moments.

“She was able to hold Summer for basically just two pictures," said Melissa Syverson, McMullen's aunt.

"One she had the mask on, and one she took the mask off. They took the quick pictures, she put the mask back on – and then they moved Kristen to ICU immediately after that," she said.

"A 30-year-old bright, beautiful, vivacious girl with the world ahead of her," McMullen died of COVID-19 on Aug. 6 in the Florida city, Syverson said.

McMullen's death comes amid a record-breaking surge of COVID-19 cases across the state Monday afternoon, officials in Brevard County warned that all three local hospital systems are over capacity and "emergency rooms are inundated with patients with symptoms of COVID-19."

“We're seeing people of all age ranges being affected. This is not just people dying who are old and elderly anymore," said Dr. Adam Fier, president of the Brevard County Medical Society.

"We're seeing young people and old people alike being affected – including people dying,” said Fier.

COVID-19 and the wealth gap:How the pandemic has increased wealth disparities

McMullen grew up in Virginia and moved to Florida a few years ago, Syverson said. Shortly afterward, she met her future husband, Keith, and they married in April 2018.

Syverson said her niece developed COVID-19 symptoms about three weeks before her due date, and she was hospitalized July 21 with coronavirus-related pneumonia.

After Summer's birth, McMullen communicated with relatives via FaceTime from the ICU.

“She couldn't interact. But at least she could see Summer while she was being cared for, and just look at her. And then her breathing just progressively got worse," Syverson said.

By Aug. 3, doctors put McMullen on a CPAP machine, which uses a breathing mask to deliver oxygen.

“We would get random texts from Kristen saying that things weren't good, and she loved us. She had a few phone calls, but literally, she only had enough strength just to say, ‘I love you,’ to Keith and Summer," Syverson said.

Syverson said McMullen was placed on a ventilator on Aug. 6, and she died later that day.

“She was an amazing person, and very bubbly. Loved her family," said Syverson, who lives in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

"She was the person that would walk in the door with game boards in her hand and want everybody to sit down and play games for hours together, and just laugh and have a good time. And she loved animals," Syverson said.

Syverson set up a GoFundMe fundraiser to defray McMullen's family's financial burden.

Pregnant women are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19 than non-pregnant people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Syverson declined to discuss McMullen's vaccination status, but she said she had no preexisting medical conditions and was an active, hard worker.

“We're trying to make others aware that if you are pregnant or if you see a pregnant person, and whether you want to wear a mask or not wear a mask, be more aware that these people are really susceptible to COVID and COVID pneumonia," Syverson said.

“Summer’s doing great. She's a perfect little baby. She had a little bit of jaundice in the beginning, but she's perfectly fine now," she said.

"She's just amazing. And we're just really thankful to God to allow Kristen to pass Summer on to us and leave her with us," she said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pregnant people should get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they can, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday, warning of the possibility of "severe outcomes'' for those who don't and pointing out there's no evidence of increased chance of miscarriage for those who get immunized.

The recommendation comes as the U.S. is experiencing another spike in coronavirus infections and daily cases nationwide are surging past 100,000.

"Pregnant and recently pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people,'' the CDC says on its website. "Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can protect you from severe illness from COVID-19.''

The expectant run a higher risk of serious illness and pregnancy complications from the coronavirus, including miscarriages and stillbirths. But their vaccination rates are low: Only about 23% have received at least one dose, according to CDC data.

Breastfeeding mothers, those who are trying to get pregnant now and those who will try to get pregnant in the future should also get vaccinated against COVID, the CDC said.

Pregnant and not female:They gave birth and love their children. And they want to remind you 'not all pregnant people are women.'

‘’The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible delta variant and see severe outcomes from COVID-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,’’ CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.

The updated guidance comes after a CDC analysis of new safety data on 2,500 women showed no increased risks of miscarriage for those who received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The analysis found a miscarriage rate of around 13%, within the normal range.

Dr. Jane Martin, an obstetrician with Ochsner Baptist Medical Center in New Orleans, said the pace of pregnant patients with COVID has picked up in the last couple of weeks.

“We have had multiple critically ill pregnant patients admitted'' every day, she said, most requiring intensive care.

In Melbourne, Florida, a 30-year-old woman with COVID died days after giving birth to a daughter.

Also in the news:

►Hawaii is imposing limits on social gatherings — no more than 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors — and ordering bars, restaurants, gyms, churches and other establishments to reduce capacity to 50% amid a record number of COVID hospitalizations.

►A third dose of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine substantially improved protection for organ transplant recipients whose weak immune systems don’t always rev up enough with the standard two shots, Canadian researchers reported Wednesday.

►Americans are getting vaccinated at the highest rate in over two months, White House COVID-19 data director Cyrus Shahpar said on Twitter. The seven-day average for the newly vaccinated was 503,000, he said.

►As COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations surge, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said she is issuing two new pandemic mandates – a vaccination requirement for state employees and statewide indoor mask requirements.

►YouTube reportedly suspended Sen. Rand Paul's account for seven days Tuesday because of a video from the Kentucky Republican saying cloth masks are not effective in protecting against COVID-19.

📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has had more than 36 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 618,100 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: More than 204.3 million cases and 4.3 million deaths. More than 166.8 million Americans – 50.3% of the population – have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.

📘 What we're reading: While close to 700 colleges require students or staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19, many don't have such a mandate, and some may not enforce the use of masks either, even as infections surge nationally. That leaves some faculty members worried that, as in-person teaching resumes in the coming weeks, they'll be exposed to the coronavirus and its highly transmissible delta variant.

California governor mandates vaccination or testing for all teachers, school staff

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday a new requirement that all teachers and school employees — for public and private schools — need to be vaccinated or submit to regular COVID-19 testing, saying it was the "first state in the country" with such a mandate.

The order mandates not only faculty members but custodians, aides and bus drivers to show proof of their vaccination status to their school district. If an employee is not vaccinated, they must submit to weekly COVID-19 testing.

"We think this is the right thing to do and we think this is a sustainable way to keeping our schools open," Newsom said in announcing the order at a school in Oakland.

The San Francisco, San Jose and Long Beach school districts issued similar requirements in recent days. Los Angeles Unified, the state’s largest district, is requiring all students and employees to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing, regardless of vaccination status.

Last month, Newsom also required millions of health care workers and state employees to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or get tested weekly.

More local officials defying governors' ban on mask mandates, and courts agree

As students return to school, battles over mask mandates to curb spread of the coronavirus are being waged across the country.

In Texas, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins on Wednesday issued an executive order requiring masks in schools, county buildings and businesses. The previous day, a Dallas district judge had temporarily suspended Gov. Greg Abbott's ban on such mandates.

On Tuesday, a judge in San Antonio had also temporarily blocked Abbott's ban, and city and Bexar County officials promptly mandated masks at schools.

In Oklahoma, the superintendent of a public charter school in Oklahoma City said students and staff must begin wearing masks indoors, defying a state law signed by Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt that prohibits such mandates. Santa Fe South Schools, a 3,500-student, pre-K through 12 district, is the first in Oklahoma to require masks.

In Arizona, officials at Arizona State University said masks will be required in all classrooms, labs and other indoor settings, in apparent contradiction of state law.

In Arkansas, the University of Arkansas system will require masks on its campuses after a judge temporarily blocked the state’s law banning mask mandates.

A state judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the state law banning mask mandates by schools and other governmental entities, and at least three dozen school districts and public charter schools have approved the requirement.

Hospitals, ICUs overrun with COVID cases

Hospitals around the nation are once again overwhelmed by the amount of COVID-19 patients.

Texas hospitals tallied more than 10,000 coronavirus patients for the first time since early February. The state has only 329 staffed beds for intensive care among 8,283 hospital beds left for about 30 million people, according to state health data released Tuesday.

And hospital admissions have tripled in the last month among children 17 and younger, Dr. Desmar Walkes of the Austin-Travis County health authority told county commissioners. In June, 11 children were hospitalized with COVID-19, and by July that figure was at 34. A majority of cases, Walkes reported, are among children ages 10-18.

In Florida, all three hospital systems in one county are over capacity and are continuing to deal with a strong surge in patients, Brevard County Emergency Management Director John Scott said. During the week of July 30 to Aug. 5, Brevard had a total of 189.3 ICU beds at its seven general hospitals – 176.6 ICU beds were occupied on average.

Doctors in the state say they’re seeing more coronavirus infections among children as students return to classrooms. After seeing about 20 minors with COVID in the emergency room in June, Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood had more than 200 in July and already over 160 in August.

The surge in COVID-19 cases also prompted Brevard County Fire Rescue Chief Mark Schollmeyer to urge residents to stop calling 911 for non-emergency calls.

Unvaccinated Americans could pay more for health insurance

Tyson Foods, United Airlines, CNN, the U.S. military.

A wide variety of employers, including those four, are imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates on their workers, and experts said they’ll have a lot more company soon after the Food and Drug Administration gives the shots its full approval.

Some employers aren’t ready to impose mandates but may penalize workers for not getting vaccinated, possibly by requiring them to pay an insurance surcharge costing several hundred dollars a year.

Experts agree vaccine requirements are legal as long as workers are provided accommodations for legitimate medical or religious objections. Read more here.

US adds more cases in first days of August than in all of May or June

The U.S. reported more than 1 million cases by Aug. 10. That's more than double the number of cases reported in all of June, a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. The first nine days of August also added more cases than all of May.

While testing early in the pandemic was limited, the United States' first nine days of August included more cases than any of the spring 2020 months through June.

At the pace of the first nine days of August, the U.S. would be on track to report about 3.3 million cases in the month, far more than any months of the summer 2020 surge. If the surge continues at this pace, August 2021 would be the fourth-worst month for cases of the entire pandemic, behind only November, December and January of the fall-winter surge. But the pace of cases continues to rise.

Deaths are rising, too. At this month's pace so far, the U.S. could report about 14,100 deaths, far more than July's 8,671.

Study showing levels of antibodies that protect against COVID-19 could speed creation of new vaccines

Eagerly anticipated new research pinpoints antibodies scientists can test for to see whether a COVID-19 vaccine is effective. These "correlates of protection" could speed the development of new vaccines or boosters without requiring the enormous clinical trials used to create the first COVID-19 vaccines.

This is "the Holy Grail" in terms of vaccines, and one that hasn't yet been set for the virus that causes COVID-19, said Peter Gilbert, co-author of the study posted Tuesday to medRxiv, a preprint site where scientific articles can be published prior to being accepted by peer-reviewed journals.

"The hope is that the Food and Drug Administration will see these data and use them as a provisional approval mechanism," he said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ALBANY, N.Y. – New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is giving up the powerful job he's dedicated most of his life to keeping within his family, but his resignation won't end a bevy of pending investigations into him and his administration.

No fewer than five district attorneys have made preliminary inquiries into Cuomo's alleged sexual harassment detailed in the scathing, 165-page report last week from Attorney General Letitia James' office that ultimately led to the governor's announcement Tuesday that he will resign in two weeks.

That includes Albany County District Attorney David Soares, who is in the midst of a criminal investigation into claims by a Cuomo executive assistant who says the governor groped her breast at the Executive Mansion last year.

There's also a pending investigation by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn who are looking into the Cuomo administration's handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes and its withholding of certain death data at the height of the pandemic last year.

And that's not all. James is still looking into whether Cuomo illegally used state resources to pen his book on the COVID-19 crisis, for which he is due to be paid $5.1 million. And the Assembly's impeachment inquiry continues on, though its immediate future is no longer clear.

The investigations and litigation could enmesh Cuomo for months or years after his scheduled departure from public office in two weeks.

"The inquiry into criminal conduct in our jurisdiction remains open and pending," Soares spokesperson Cecilia Walsh said Tuesday, just after Cuomo announced his pending resignation.

Five county DAs looking at Cuomo's conduct

Following James' report, Soares announced he was in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation related to Cuomo. That investigation was bolstered Thursday by the filing of a criminal complaint by Brittany Commisso, the executive assistant who says Cuomo groped her.

The chief criminal prosecutors of New York, Nassau, Westchester, and Oswego counties also asked James’ staff for investigative evidence of possible Cuomo crimes committed within their respective jurisdictions.

“Our investigation continues,” Brendan Brosh, the communications director for Nassau County Acting District Attorney Joyce A. Smith, said Tuesday. Smith last week issued a statement confirming that her office would review “the deeply disturbing findings” in the report.

Cuomo’s resignation “does not have any impact” on a similar investigation by Westchester District Attorney Miriam E. Rocah’s office, public information officer Anna Young said in an email on Tuesday.

Danny Frost, communications director for Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr., declined to comment on whether Cuomo’s departure from the public stage later this month would impact Vance’s investigation. Last week, Vance’s office confirmed contact with James’ office “pertaining to incidents that occurred in Manhattan,” the locale for Cuomo’s downstate office.

Oswego County District Attorney Gregory Oakes could not immediately be reached on Tuesday about the status of his Cuomo investigation. Last week, Syracuse.com reported that Oakes would request material from James’ office about allegations by Virginia Limmiatis, a Syracuse-area woman and energy company employee who told state investigators Cuomo groped her in 2017.

Separately, federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York have subpoenaed material related to Cuomo’s recent memoir as part of an investigation of the state’s handling of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes on Cuomo’s watch, The Wall Street Journal reported in June. John Marzulli, a spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, declined to comment Tuesday.

Civil suits against Cuomo likely

Cuomo also is expected to face a civil lawsuit to be filed by Lindsey Boylan, the first woman who publicly alleged that he had sexually harassed her.

Boylan, a former aide to the governor, claims Cuomo made inappropriate comments toward her, including one remark about playing strip poker during a flight on an official state aircraft. She also says Cuomo once kissed her on the lips in 2018 as she left a meeting in his New York City office.

Her claim, via Twitter, prompted others to come forward. It also led to attacks on Boylan’s credibility by Cuomo staffers and lawyers.

James' report concluded Cuomo's administration illegally retaliated against Boylan by leaking documents to the press not long after her Twitter posts. Those documents showed Boylan was counseled for a workplace conflict shortly before her departure from the administration.

Cuomo's attorneys have denied the administration illegally retaliated against Boylan and have continued to attack her credibility, as well as the credibility of the report itself, which Cuomo claims is biased against him.

"I think that women should be believed and they should be treated fairly," Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin said Tuesday shortly before Cuomo announced his resignation.

She continued: "I also believe that men should be believed and treated fairly. All people should be given that, and everybody should have a chance to respond, and everybody should be scrutinized with what they say by facts, context, and evidence. That hasn’t happened here."

Jill Basinger, an attorney for Boylan, did not immediately respond to a voicemail seeking comment on Tuesday.

However, Basinger told ABC News last week that Boylan intends to sue Cuomo and others in the administration.

"Our plan is to sue the governor and his and his coconspirators," Basinger said.

Book investigation, impeachment inquiry ongoing

James, meanwhile, told reporters last week that her investigation into Cuomo's book deal remains underway.

"The investigation with respect to the book and whether or not public resources were utilized is ongoing and it’s separate and apart from this investigation," she said Aug. 3.

The Assembly Judiciary Committee, which has been investigating various Cuomo-related issues to determine whether to impeach the governor, is scheduled to meet Monday.

Lawmakers had been moving toward impeaching the governor, but Cuomo's resignation could change their plans.

The Assembly could still pursue an impeachment that could prevent Cuomo from running for state office again. Such an endeavor, however, would cost millions of dollars in taxpayer money, which Cuomo himself highlighted during his resignation speech.

"It will consume government," Cuomo said of his potential impeachment. "It will cost taxpayers millions of dollars. It will brutalize people."

Assemblymember Charles Lavine, a Long Island Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee, issued a statement Tuesday expressing faith in Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul's ability to lead the state. He did not make mention of the pending impeachment probe.

"As we begin to move forward, let us recognize the courage, strength and integrity of the women who dared to come forward," Lavine said. "Moreover, let us commit ourselves to continuing the battle for the inalienable rights of our sisters and daughters in New York and in every other state."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ALBANY - For the second time in 13 years, New York will have a governor resign in disgrace midterm, creating an unexpected transition to the state's second in command.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he would leave office in 14 days to allow a smooth transition for his successor Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who will make history as the first woman governor.

That's a longer period of time that Eliot Spitzer stayed in office when he announced his resignation on March 12, 2008, and officially left five days later.

Here's how the process will work.

When will Hochul take office?

Fourteen days from Tuesday would mean Hochul takes office on Tuesday, Aug. 24, meaning she would be sworn in on that date and likely give an address to the state.

When David Paterson was sworn in as Spitzer's successor, he gave a rousing speech in the packed Assembly chambers, but COVID-19 restrictions might prevent such an event.

Hochul was set to speak to reporters Wednesday afternoon to discuss the transition and her agenda.

Why is Cuomo waiting 14 days to leave?

It's a good question with no clear answer.

On its face, it would appear Cuomo simply wants time to leave office after taking the helm of the state in 2011. Critical issues remain, and none larger than the new surge in COVID-19 cases.

But critics questioned whether Cuomo might want to make a few last governmental moves before he leaves. There are also a series of investigations that will continue into his conduct.

“It may be overly cynical on my part – but I believe that Andrew Cuomo was a person of mischief," former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, a Cuomo foe who prosecuted his administration, said Tuesday on his podcast.

"I hope there's nothing nefarious about the 14 days, but it strikes me as too long a period. You don't have to give two weeks notice to resign as governor.”

Who fills Hochul's role as lieutenant governor?

Spitzer's resignation led to a lengthy court fight over whether Paterson could appoint his successor as lieutenant governor, one he ultimately won amid a Senate coup in 2009.

The Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled a governor could, in fact, appoint a lieutenant governor, a surprising decision after it was rejected in the lower courts.

Paterson tapped Richard Ravitch, a New York developer and long-time government appointee, as his second in command.

Now Hochul will eventually pick her own successor. In the meantime, state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, will take over some of the lieutenant governor's duties — which are mainly ceremonial.

KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban seized three more provincial capitals in Afghanistan and a local army headquarters completing their blitz across the country's northeast and pressing their offensive elsewhere, officials said Wednesday. The insurgents now control some two-thirds of the nation as the U.S. and NATO finalize their withdrawal after a decades-long war there.

The fall of the capitals of Badakhshan and Baghlan provinces to the northeast and Farah province to the west put increasing pressure on the country's central government to stem the tide of the advance, even as its lost a major base in Kunduz.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rushed to Balkh province, already surrounded by Taliban-held territory, to seek help in pushing back the insurgents from warlords linked to allegations of atrocities and corruption. He also replaced his army chief of staff.

While the capital of Kabul itself has not been directly threatened in the advance, the stunning speed of the offensive raises questions of how long the Afghan government can maintain control of its countryside. The multiple fronts of the battle have stretched the government's special operations forces — while regular troops have often fled the battlefield — and the violence has pushed thousands of civilians to seek safety in the capital.

The U.S. military, which plans to complete its withdrawal by the end of the month, has conducted some airstrikes but largely has avoided involving itself in the ground campaign. The Afghan government and military did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the losses.

The success of the Taliban offensive also calls into question whether they'd ever rejoin long-stalled peace talks in Qatar aimed at moving Afghanistan toward an inclusive interim administration as the West hoped.

Humayoon Shahidzada, a lawmaker from the western province of Farah, confirmed Wednesday to The Associated Press his province's capital of the same name fell. Neighboring Nimroz province was overrun in recent days after a weeklong campaign by the Taliban.

In Farah, Taliban fighters dragged the shoeless, bloody corpse of one Afghan security force member through the street, shouting: "God is great!" Taliban fighters carrying M-16 rifles and driving Humvees and Ford pickup trucks donated by the Americans rolled through the streets of the capital.

"The situation is under control in the city, our mujahedeen are patrolling in the city," one Taliban fighter who did not give his name said, referring to his fellow insurgents as "holy warriors."

The crackle of automatic weapon fire continued throughout the day in Farah.

Hujatullah Kheradmand, a lawmaker from Badakhshan, said the Taliban had seized his province's capital, Faizabad. An Afghan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak about an unacknowledged loss, said Baghlan's capital, Poli-Khumri, also fell.

The insurgents earlier captured six other provincial capitals in the country in less than a week.

On Wednesday, the headquarters of the Afghan National Army's 217th Corps at Kunduz airport fell to the Taliban, according to Ghulam Rabani Rabani, a provincial council member in Kunduz, and lawmaker Shah Khan Sherzad. The insurgents posted video online they said showed surrendering troops.

The corps is one of seven across the army and its loss represents a major setback. The province's capital, also called Kunduz, was already among those seized, and the capture of the base now puts the country's northeast firmly in Taliban hands.

It wasn't immediately clear what equipment was left behind for the insurgents, though a Taliban video showed them parading in Humvees and pickup trucks. Another video showed fighters on the airport's tarmac next to an attack helicopter without rotor blades.

In southern Helmand province, where the Taliban control nearly all the capital of Lashkar Gar, a suicide car bomber targeted the government-held police headquarters, provincial council head Attaullah Afghan said. The building has been under siege for two weeks.

Fears of a brutal regime

The rapid fall of wide swaths of the country to the Taliban raises fears that the brutal tactics they used to rule Afghanistan before will also return. Some civilians who have fled Taliban advances have said that the insurgents imposed repressive restrictions on women and burned down schools. There have also been reports of revenge killings in areas where the Taliban have gained control.

Speaking to journalists Tuesday, a senior EU official said the insurgents held some 230 districts of the over 400 in Afghanistan. The official described another 65 in government control while the rest were contested. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal figures.

In addition to the northeast, much of northern Afghanistan has also fallen to the Taliban, except for Balkh province. There, warlords Abdul Rashid Dostum, Atta Mohammad Noor and Mohammad Mohaqiq planned to mobilize forces in support of the Afghan government to push back the Taliban.

Dostum in particular has a troubled past, facing investigations after the 2001 U.S.-led invasion for killing hundreds of Taliban fighters last year by letting them suffocate in sealed shipping containers.

On Wednesday, Dostum said that the Taliban "won't be able to leave north and will face the same fate" as the suffocated troops.

Ghani meanwhile ordered Gen. Hibatullah Alizai to replace Gen. Wali Ahmadzai as the Afghan army chief of staff, according to an Afghan official who spoke to the AP and local media reports. The Defense Ministry official spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had yet to be made public.

Alizai was the commander of the Afghan army's Special Operations Corps — the elite troops that, along with the air force, have been forced to do most of the fighting as regular forces have collapsed.

After a 20-year Western military mission and billions of dollars spent training and shoring up Afghan forces, many are at odds to explain that collapse.

As the international community continues to hold out hope for a return to peace talks, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad brought a warning to the Taliban on Tuesday that any government that comes to power through force in Afghanistan won't be recognized.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The iconic dragons from Game of Thrones may not be real, but something very similar to them existed in Australia over 150 million years ago, according to new research.

A team from the University of Queensland analyzed a jaw fossil found in the northeastern part of Queensland over 10 years ago. What they found was a skull of a pterosaur, a flying dinosaur that was Australia's largest flying reptile.

“It’s the closest thing we have to a real-life dragon,” doctoral candidate Tim Richards said in a statement. "This thing would have been quite savage."

The findings were published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology on Monday.

That's not a dinosaur: Tiny fossil discovered in 2020 actually belongs to a lizard

In addition to a wingspan measuring as long as a school bus, the dinosaur had a 3-foot-long head and around 40 sharp teeth, perfect for grabbing fish and small dinosaurs to eat. Researchers believe the creature roamed around the region in an area once covered by the prehistoric Eromanga Sea.

“The new pterosaur, which we named Thapunngaka shawi, would have been a fearsome beast, with a spear-like mouth and a wingspan around seven meters," Richards said. "It would have cast a great shadow over some quivering little dinosaur that wouldn’t have heard it until it was too late."

The discovery of the creature's fossils is rare, according to Richards, as pterosaur bones were thin, hollow and fragile. It is the third type of pterosaur found in Australia.

“Pterosaurs don’t preserve well,” Richards told The Guardian. “Most of these things likely fell into the sea on death and were gobbled up by predatory beasts in the sea. A lot of them would never have made it to the seafloor to start that fossilization process.”

The name Thapunngaka shawi incorporates words from the now-extinct language of the Wanamara Nation, one of the country's Indigenous First Peoples groups. The terms "thapun" and "ngaka" are the Wanamara words for "spear" and "mouth," according to the study's co-author, Steve Salisbury.

The name "shawi" comes from from the fossil's discoverer Len Shaw, meaning the name is, "Shaw's spear mouth." The fossil can be seen at the Kronosaurus Korner museum in Richmond, Queensland.

900 firefighters, including teams from several countries, were in action on the island of Evia.

A massive fire that broke out last week north of Athens has been limited to part of Mount Parnitha.

PEFKI, Greece — Hundreds of firefighters from across Europe and the Middle East worked alongside Greek colleagues in rugged terrain Wednesday to contain flareups of the huge wildfires that ravaged Greece's forests for a week, destroying homes and forcing evacuations.

The spread of the blazes has been largely halted, officials said, but fronts still burned on the large island of Evia, and in Greece's southern Peloponnese region where several homes were on fire, according to state ERT TV.

The fires broke out last week as Greece had just experienced its worst and most protracted heatwave since 1987, leaving its forests tinder-dry. Other nearby nations such as Turkey and Italy also faced similar searing temperatures and quickly spreading fires, while Spain and Portugal were on alert for wildfires amid a heatwave forecast to last through Monday.

At the other end of the Mediterranean, in Algeria, wildfires have killed 65 people, authorities said Wednesday.

Worsening drought and heat – both linked to climate change – have also fueled wildfires this summer in the Western U.S. and in Russia's northern Siberia region. Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events.

Greece's fire service said a total 900 firefighters, including teams from Poland, Romania, Cyprus, Ukraine, Serbia, Slovakia and Moldova, were in action on Evia, which is the country's second-largest island and is linked to the mainland by a bridge.

Evia's rugged, forested northern part, with upland villages and small seaside resorts, has suffered the greatest damage from this month's blazes, with an estimated 50,000 hectares (123,000 acres) lost, together with dozens of homes.

Retiree Maria Roga said that although her house in Evia's village of Pefki was saved at the last moment from flames that burned a neighboring home, she still worries about flareups.

"I'm still afraid. I'm afraid," she told The Associated Press Wednesday. "(But) I can't complain, I am very grateful, I am one of the lucky ones." Though most of Pefki's homes are intact, the village — whose name means pine tree — is now surrounded by rank upon rank of blackened trees.

Some 600 firefighters from Greece, the Czech Republic, Britain, France and Germany were also deployed Wednesday near ancient Olympia and in Arcadia in the Peloponnese, assisted by 14 water-dropping aircraft — including a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 that can drop more than 40 tons at one go — and volunteers.

A massive fire that broke out last week north of Athens has been limited to a section of a national park on Mount Parnitha, with mostly ground forces trying to put it out with the help of a helicopter. Firefighters from France, Qatar, Kuwait and Israel were deployed there.

Despite the massive destruction to forests, wildlife and livestock — and homes, although official estimates are not yet available — Greek authorities' core policy of evacuating villages to protect extensive loss of life has paid off: One volunteer firefight died last week after being struck by a falling electricity pole, and two have been hospitalized in serious condition with burns.

A wildfire killed 102 people near Athens in 2018, and more than 80 died in a series of blazes in southern Greece in 2007.

The health ministry said Wednesday another three firefighters required treatment for respiratory problems and light burns suffered in the Arcadia fire.

Nevertheless, some local officials and residents have criticized the evacuation policy, saying that while it saved lives it sent away able-bodied villagers who could have helped firefighters battle the flames. Others have complained that water-dropping planes and even ground forces were absent at crucial times.

On the outskirts of Kamatriades on Evia Tuesday, residents cutting firebreaks through the forest said they had received no help in protecting their village.

"We need some help here, we need some help. We are fighting alone, (for) seven days now," said Dimitris Stefanidakis.

Officials say they used all means available against what Greece's civil protection chief described as the fire service's biggest-ever challenge. In eight days, authorities had to deal with 586 fires across the country, while billowing smoke often reduced visibility so much that waterbombing aircraft couldn't be deployed.

The causes of the blazes are under investigation, and authorities say that in at least one major blaze arson seems likely. Several people have been arrested in different parts of the country and charged with causing fires, in some cases intentionally.

The government has pledged a large compensation and reforestation program.

Big fires are also burning in Italy, which claimed a third life Wednesday when local authorities said the body of a 77-year-old shepherd was found in the southern Calabria region. Italy's La Presse news agency said he was in a farmhouse where he apparently sought refuge from the flames, along with his flock.

Last week, a woman and her nephew died of smoke inhalation as they tried to save the family olive grove at the edge of the forest.

n Turkey, firefighters worked to extinguish a wildfire in the southwest Mugla province, which runs along the Aegean Sea. At least eight people and countless animals have died in more than 200 wildfires in Turkey since July 28.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For more than 30 years, Andrew Cuomo has pushed his agenda with a bruising style.

He's had big achievements: marriage equality, $15 minimum wage, pandemic guidance.

But they've been countered by COVID nursing home deaths, a book deal and a sexual harassment scandal

One bombshell begets another. A week after the attorney general's report documented cases of sexual harassment, Gov. Andrew Cuomo sat behind a New York City microphone and announced his resignation, a stunning exit from the political stage.

When his father, Mario Cuomo, was governor, contemplating whether a run for the White House was to be or not to be, pundits dubbed him “Hamlet on the Hudson,” a man who they said thought too much.

When Andrew Cuomo took office in January 2011, he was determined not to sit around and wait for things to happen. In public life for more than 30 years at that time, the younger Cuomo pushed his legislative and executive agenda with a pugnacious my-way-or-the-highway style that bristled opponents and allies alike.

There were achievements: marriage equality, a $15 minimum wage, the $4-billion bridge he named for his father, and a science-based voice of reason at the center of the global pandemic, a stark contrast to the muddled White House messaging at the time.

There were also nursing home deaths to COVID, a book deal that raised eyebrows and, after allegations of sexual harassment emerged in March 2021, a circle-the-wagons and control-the-narrative posture that forbade media at his public events. He would wait, Cuomo had said, for the report by Attorney General Letitia James before discussing the allegations: "Hamlet on the Hudson: The Sequel."

That lasted a week, a week full of howls for his resignation and plans for his impeachment. Even before Cuomo resigned Tuesday, allies and adversaries from Rochester to Westchester began taking stock of Cuomo’s legacy and wondering how history will treat the 56th governor of New York.

'A damn shame'

James’ report arrived weeks after New York marked the 10th anniversary of marriage equality, a signature legislative success in the first months of Cuomo’s first term.

In 2011, the governor was able to do what others had failed to in 2009: convince four Republican members of the state Senate to side with the Democrats in making same-sex marriage the law in New York, the first large state to do so. The final vote came in the waning minutes of the legislative session and Cuomo was on hand to sign it, practically before the ink was dry on the bill.

Marriage equality activist Michael Sabatino of Yonkers was in the Senate chamber that night a decade ago and has come to know the governor over the years. Sabatino's husband, Robert Voorheis, had lobbied for marriage equality.

"I think a lot of people in the LGBT community will always appreciate the efforts that he made to push for marriage equality," Sabatino said. "He had really organized the whole group of people from different aspects of the movement to try and get things done."

In the near term, the AG's report and impeachment and scandal and resignation is what New Yorkers will think of when they think of the governor.

"People hold on to the negative stuff," Sabatino said. "They don't always remember the positive stuff."

There is a lot of negative stuff in James' blistering report: 165 pages of it; 179 interviews; 11 accusers. Sabatino calls the report disheartening.

The James report is part of Cuomo's legacy, alongside marriage equality, Sabatino said.

"The history will always be there. As to whether it will be part of the aftermath in news articles, literature, books, it's hard to say. But what he accomplished, he accomplished. You can't take it away. It's just such a damn shame, though, that the man has a legacy and then this has to overshadow his accomplishments. It's sad."

$15 an hour, but 'horrified'

Stuart Appelbaum didn't forget what Andrew Cuomo had done for New York's workers, but his recollections are now followed by "yet" and "but."

Hours after James' report was released, Appelbaum — president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union and executive vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union — issued a statement.

“Gov. Andrew Cuomo has provided crucial leadership during the pandemic; he raised the minimum wage to $15 before any other state; he achieved marriage equality in New York when others didn’t believe it would be possible," the statement read. "Our union will always be grateful for when his leadership supported our members."

Then came the “yet.”

“Yet after reading the 164-page report of the independent investigation overseen by the Office of the State Attorney General, we cannot ignore the facts. The Governor’s behavior towards women in his own workplace was well documented and verified through multiple sources. There can be no denying that his behavior created a toxic environment for woman, and can only be called sexual harassment.

“While we acknowledge the good things he has achieved," the statement continued, "now is the time for Governor Cuomo to resign.”

Appelbaum had followed the marriage-equality campaign, and its 2009 failure.

"I remember thinking it was going to be dead for quite some time in New York. And then he powered it through. I think it's fair to say that marriage equality in New York would not have happened when it did if it were not for Cuomo," he said.

The governor also championed the $15 minimum wage, first for fast-food workers, then more broadly, an achievement that benefited Appelbaum's union directly. The union chief also gives Cuomo credit for getting the wheels of government moving again.

"You couldn't get much worse than David Paterson," Appelbaum said, of the man Cuomo replaced. "I think that just the fact that after his failed predecessor, he was able to get government functioning again was important at the time."

Then comes a but.

"But that doesn't absolve him of all other behavior," Appelbaum said. "You can still applaud what he did in these areas and be horrified by what he did elsewhere."

A call seeking comment from Mario Cilento, president of the AFL/CIO — the powerful worker’s union that benefited from the $15 minimum wage and the construction of the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge — drew a “we are going to pass” response.

A friend in need

Hilda Rosario Escher, former president and CEO of Ibero-American Action League in Rochester, still has the website up from her unsuccessful run for the state Senate in District 56 last year.

She is still there, pictured beside Gov. Andrew Cuomo, her arm on his elbow, in front of the cameras. And she’s still beside Cuomo months later.

Rosario Escher, speaking before Cuomo resigned, was unwilling to speak about the charges that swirl around the governor. But she will talk at length about how Cuomo was there for her native Puerto Rico after the devastating Hurricane Maria in 2017, how he found the resources that allowed 5,000 of her countrymen to find refuge in Rochester.

“He was the first elected official to go to Puerto Rico,” she said. “He took a lot of supplies and took SUNY and CUNY students that wanted to go to Puerto Rico to help reconstruct the roofs and the houses. The guy is brilliant and if he’s gonna be done, it’s going to be a great loss for the state.”

Cuomo’s legacy, she said, will not be diminished.

“Independent of what happens, his work will always be here, and it will be a reminder of his love for the state.”

'He's done wonders for our state'

If Cuomo was looking for someone to buoy him — after the resignation this week of his trusted lieutenant Melissa DeRosa — he could have looked to East Rochester, and true believer Sandy Behan, who started a private Facebook group, Women for Governor Cuomo, to “support Cuomo for his leadership throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”

Its position was clear on the harassment allegations: “We all know this is a setup! He's done wonders for our state! And he needs our support!”

The private group now has 1,200 members, Behan said, with another 100 or so asking to be admitted since James' report was issued.

How ardent is Behan?

She splintered off a separate group — We Decide New York, Inc. — which now numbers about 175, she said, and supports “due process for all people, justice and equality.”

It has another goal: “To try to bring the truth to the forefront of what Gov. Cuomo is all about and to keep people's minds focused on what he has done for New Yorkers and what he continues to do. He is nationally and even overseas a hero for the way he handled the pandemic.”

The governor’s legacy, including marriage equality and the massive infrastructure plan, is being overshadowed, she said, “and that's unfortunate.”

After Cuomo's announcement, Behan said his followers were heartbroken.

"This is a travesty," she added. "We hoped that he would have fought for himself and his right to due process and justice. He is New York Tough!"

'He saved the Yonkers School District'

Like Cuomo, Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano waited for the AG's report. Unlike Cuomo, when Spano saw the report he immediately concluded it was time for the governor to resign.

Spano, a Democrat, conceded that his wasn't a full-throated howl for the governor to go, not "hard-core." He and the governor have history. Days later, he still chose his words painstakingly when talking about it.

"I thought he indicated pretty clearly that he would abide by the report. And he should do that," Spano said the day before Cuomo resigned. "But hopefully history will be kind to him."

The Yonkers mayor, who spent 20 years in the state Legislature as a Republican, said he heard talk about replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge for decades. "He was the single governor who was able to make that happen," he said.

And Spano will never forget a phone call to Cuomo in 2015, when the board of education discovered a $55 million hole in the budget, a hole that could have swallowed the city-run board of education.

"The children would have suffered for years to come," Spano said.

Cuomo took the call and said the state would help, but, Spano said, made it clear: "There are no blank checks coming out of Albany. I need reform."

Spano consolidated five departments, Cuomo found the money to fill the budget hole.

"It bridged us through," Spano said. "He saved the Yonkers School District, singlehandedly, with the help of the state legislature."

'He did this to himself'

State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi worked as a lawyer in the Cuomo Administration and helped to craft 2019's Reproductive Health Act, protecting women's reproductive rights by codifying "Roe v. Wade" into state law. But the Pelham Democrat is no fan of Cuomo.

Yes, he secured marriage equality and the $15 minimum wage and replaced the Tappan Zee Bridge. But he also sided with the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of eight Democratic state Senators who gave Republicans control of the chamber from 2011 to 2018.

That action prevented progress on climate justice, the child victims act, immigration and LGBTQ laws and "all of the sexual harassment laws that really mattered," Biaggi said.

New York will lose a seat in Congress to redistricting because Cuomo delayed the release of $20 million in legislature funds for the Census and the state came up 89 people short in the count, costing it an upstate representative in Washington.

Cuomo's legacy will include the attorney general's report, and the 11 women who accused him, but any tarnishing of his legacy, Biaggi said, "is his own doing."

"He did this to himself. Nobody else did this to him," she said. "So the idea that he is a victim in this is preposterous, and I rarely used that word."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Southwest Airlines flight attendant based in Las Vegas died Tuesday from COVID-19, according to his family and co-workers.

Maurice "Reggie" Shepperson, a native New Yorker whose brightly colored pants earned him the nickname Skittles during training in 2014, tested positive for the coronavirus in early July and had been fighting it in a hospital for a month, according to Marcia Hildreth, a Southwest flight attendant who called him her best friend.

He was on a ventilator and died early Tuesday, his mother, Dawn Shepperson, told USA TODAY. A nurse told her it was from COVID-19.

Shepperson, 36, was fully vaccinated, his mother and Hildreth said. He loved to fly and took every precaution, wearing a mask, constantly washing his hands, sanitizing surfaces and wiping everything down in hotel rooms, Hildreth said.

"It hurt me so bad because it was just so quick," Dawn Shepperson said. "I didn't have time to really even acknowledge what is going on. This is mind-blowing. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real."

Hildreth said she's in disbelief, too.

"I'm going to miss my friend," she said.

Southwest spokesman Brandy King confirmed a Las Vegas-based employee died Tuesday but declined to provide details. Shepperson's mother said the airline reached out to her, and Hildreth said Southwest contacted her after Shepperson's death and pulled her from a work trip, so she could fly home to Las Vegas Wednesday.

"We are heartbroken over the loss of our Southwest employee," King said in a statement. "Out of respect for the family, we do not have additional information to share."

COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but they’re not 100% effective in preventing infection. A small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they're exposed to the virus that causes it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, vaccinated people who have breakthrough infections are much less likely to get severely sick or die.

Southwest and other airlines have not released statistics on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among flight crews. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents flight attendants at United, Frontier, Spirit and Hawaiian airlines, among others, estimated that 4,000 flight attendants across all airlines in the USA have contracted the virus and 20 have died.

Shepperson worked throughout the pandemic and was pulled from work several times because of COVID-19 exposure, Hildreth said. He never tested positive until July, she said.

Co-workers called Shepperson a high flyer: He picked up more work trips than most, partly to make money, partly to travel wherever he could.

Kiki Lee was in Shepperson's flight attendant training class in 2014 in Dallas, where Southwest is based.

After five weeks of training, she and other newly minted flight attendants just wanted to go home. Shepperson started using his employee flight perks. One of the first trips, Lee recalls, was to China.

"He was hitting the skies right way, using his benefits," Lee said. "He loved working, and he loved the perks."

Shepperson's Facebook page shows his travel adventures, including several work trips to Hawaii. In June, he took his mother along for the ride. His mother said that was one of his last work trips for Southwest before he tested positive.

"He loved travel, and anybody who knew him knew he loved his mother," Lee said.

Travis Pittman, another Las Vegas-based flight attendant for Southwest, met Shepperson when he relocated to Nevada from Tampa in 2016.

"That New York exterior can come off hard and all that," he said. "But he was just like a teddy bear, so sweet on the inside and very, very loving. Just very fun to be around."

Dawn Shepperson said Reggie, whom she raised on her own after his father died when he was 14 months old, made her proud every time she walked through a Southwest terminal at an airport.

“People that I don't even know, once they find out I'm Reggie's mother said, ‘Ma’am, you did a beautiful job. This is a fine young man,’” she said. "As a mother, I feel so blessed and proud because that's all I wanted in life was to raise my son right."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An ex-Georgia deputy was indicted Wednestday after video showed him repeatedly punching a man in the face during an arrest last year.

Brandon Myers, 25, who is white, was fired for “excessive use of force” shortly after a September video went viral showing him and another deputy pinning and beating 26-year-old Roderick Walker, a Black man. Walker was arrested after a vehicle he was in was pulled over for a broken taillight, and the encounter was recorded on camera by Walker's girlfriend, Juanita Davis.

Myers, who was fired by the Clayton County Sheriff's Office, has now been charged with battery and violating the oath of office, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A grand jury chose not to indict Walker last month on two counts each of battery and obstructing or hindering law enforcement officers.

One of Walker's attorneys, Shean Williams, said in September that Walker, Davis, their 5-month-old son, and Davis' 5-year-old son from a previous relationship, had dropped off a rental car and paid a man $10 to drive them home. Police stopped the vehicle they were in for a broken tail light.

Williams said the deputies asked Walker, who was in the passenger seat, for his ID and Walker stated he did not have one and questioned why the police needed it. The deputies then demanded Walker get out of the vehicle and threw him to the ground as they struggled to handcuff him, Williams said.

“I was scared. I feared for my life, and I just pray, just hope that it don’t happen to nobody else,” Roderick Walker told reporters in September at his lawyer’s office, his left eye still bloodshot.

Walker suffered a mild traumatic brain injury from being thrown to the ground and beaten, said Jane Lamberti, an attorney for Walker, in September. The sheriff’s deputies denied Walker medical attention that he needed and asked for, she said.

Myers was hired by the sheriff’s office in November 2019. In less than a year, Myers was involved in five other use of force incidents during traffic stops, said Williams.

'They almost killed him': Attorney demands criminal charges in police beating of Black Georgia man

The indictment comes as Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill is being investigated for using unreasonable force when ordering pretrial detainees to be restrained for hours even as they complied with police.

Hill was suspended from office in June and indicted in April because of federal civil rights violations against him.

In the April indictment, prosecutors alleged Hill used unreasonable force despite receiving training that force may not be used as punishment. He also approved a policy that emphasized the restraint chair “will never be authorized as a form of punishment," but only used with a violent or uncontrollable person to prevent injury or property damage if other techniques are ineffective, according to the indictment.

The other deputy involved in the arrest, Deputy D. Riddick, resigned days after the September incident. He has not been charged.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Officials confirmed the first sighting of a live "murder hornet" in Washington this year.

A Whatcom County resident reported a sighting to the Washington State Department of Agriculture, and entomologists confirmed it as an Asian giant hornet Thursday, according to a news release from the WSDA.

“This hornet is exhibiting the same behavior we saw last year – attacking paper wasp nests,” Sven Spichiger, WSDA managing entomologist, said in the news release.

This is the second Asian giant hornet sighting in 2021, but it's the first time the insect was found alive. In June, officials said they found a dead hornet north of Seattle.

The invasive insect – normally found in eastern and southeast Asia – was first spotted in the USA in 2019 and poses a threat to insects and honeybees that are vital in agriculture.

A nest discovered in October 2020 was knocked down in Blaine, Washington, and the hornets were vacuumed out in what entomologists called the first Asian giant hornet nest in the USA.

The insects are the largest hornets in the world and got the "murder" nickname after they were blamed for up to 50 deaths a year in Japan.

In response to the latest sighting, WSDA said it will set up traps in the area in hopes of tagging one and tracking it back to its nest.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Since July 1, there has been a 700% increase in the week-over-week average of COVID-19 infections in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The information was presented Friday at CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting during a discussion of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for immunocompromised patients.

"There's no doubt we're seeing a surge in cases now," said Dr. William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The United States was at a low point in new cases in late June, with an average of about 10,000 a day. Today the average is closer to 125,000 a day, he said

"That’s when people in this country became really optimistic. The combination of the delta variant, susceptibility due to relatively low vaccination coverage, some relaxing of our public health measures, these all came together and we're seeing this wave," Moss said.

The delta variant is nearly twice as contagious as previous variants, and there is some evidence of increased illness severity compared with previous strains in unvaccinated people, CDC epidemiologist Heather Scobie said at Friday's meeting.

Fully vaccinated people infected with the delta variant can spread the virus to others but appear to be infectious for a shorter period of time than unvaccinated people infected with the variant, she said.

In the first 12 days of August, the United States reported more coronavirus cases than it did in all of July, according a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins University data.

That's 1.33 million cases. At this month's average rate, the country would report 3.4 million cases, making it the fourth-worst month of the entire pandemic.

"There's bad news and there's less bad news," is how Andrew Noymer, a professor of population health at the University of California, Irvine, put it.

Because older people, who are at higher risk for severe disease and death, are now highly vaccinated, "100,000 cases today is less dire than 100,000 in December of 2020," he said.

That means cases are more concentrated in younger people, who are less likely to be vaccinated. Younger people are less likely to become severely ill, "but this isn't a nothing burger," Noymer said. Hospitalizations are still high.

He looked up the numbers in his county a year ago, and there were 722 people hospitalized for COVID-19. This week there are 497 hospitalizations in Orange County.

"We have a vaccine that works wonderfully now," he said, "so our peak shouldn't be five-sevenths as big as the previous summer."

The U.S. numbers parallel what was seen in the United Kingdom and in Israel when the delta variant hit those nations, said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco.

"The only small comfort is that in areas of higher vaccination in our country, hospitalizations are not following the trend of cases to the same degree as in prior surges without vaccination," she said.

Immunity moving forward

CDC staff also presented data giving insight into the evolving pandemic. The available data shows the persistence of protective antibodies eight months after an infection and six months after the second shot of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines and eight months after a single Johnson & Johnson shot.

That's not because natural infection is more protective but simply because vaccinations began only in December, so there is very little data.

It appears vaccine effectiveness against infection with COVID-19 does wane over time, but how much and in whom isn't yet entirely clear.

Even so, protection against severe illness remains very high. For Pfizer, it is 97% and for Moderna it's 93%, CDC said.

There is some data emerging from Israel of more breakthrough infections among people vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine in January and February than in recent months.

There was a more than twofold increased risk for breakthrough infections between people vaccinated in January versus those vaccinated in April, Israeli data showed.

The older the person, the more chance they would have an infection.

Scobie emphasized an infection is different from becoming severely ill or dying.

As of Aug. 2, among more than 164 million fully vaccinated people in the United States, there were 7,101 hospitalizations and 1,507 deaths.

Such severe or deadly breakthrough infections in vaccinated people were much more likely to occur in older people. CDC reported that 74% of those cases were in people over 65.

It's not clear if that's because people over 65 were first in line to be vaccinated and therefore their immunity might be waning over time, or if because of their age their immune systems are less robust.

Among people 18 and over, about 32% of all vaccinated breakthrough cases were in immunocompromised people, compared with 11% of unvaccinated cases.

The CDC's advisory committee will meet again Aug. 24 to discuss incoming data about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, enduring immunity and the possible need for booster doses.

The pandemic, Noymer said, appears far from over.

"We should say we’re in the throes of a pandemic, not that we’re in the middle of it," he said. "The middle of something implies that we’re halfway there, and I don’t know that that’s true."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Time to check those bank accounts. More money was scheduled to be heading to families Friday for the August payment of the advance child tax credit.

Millions of households woke up Friday to see the money in their accounts — just like they did on July 15.

But others hit social media Friday morning in shock and wondering: What happened? Where's my money? Where's that extra $250 or $300 for each child for August?

For some, it could seem that the IRS's Friday drop date is looking like the release date for Kanye West's upcoming "Donda" album, which is facing more delays in August. You just never know when this one is hitting for some families. Maybe the money will get there before the album.

Troubled taxpayers on social media Friday couldn't understand why they were looking at a longer wait than expected to receive their cash.

"Got last month's DD no problem," one said. "This month's says it will be mailed. Ugh."

After checking IRS.gov website to review their status, some taxpayers learned that their advance child tax credit would be mailed this time — even though they received the advance child tax credit via direct deposit last month.

One said: "Nothing here yet. I use NetSpend," which is a prepaid debit card.

►Young investors:Millennials are quitting jobs to become crypto day traders. Here's the risk, reward.

►Cryptocurrency:Black, Latino, LGBTQ investors see crypto investments like bitcoin as 'a new path' to wealth and equity

If you're going to end up receiving the child tax credit by paper check, you might need to prepare for delays. The IRS noted Friday afternoon: "Be sure to allow extra time for delivery by mail through the end of August."

The U.S. Treasury issued a statement Friday before noon that stated: "Due to a technical issue expected to be resolved by the September payments, a small percentage of recipients — less than 15% — who received payments by direct deposit in July will be mailed paper checks for the August payment."

Yet we could be talking about roughly 4 million or so people who fall into this category of expecting direct deposit in August but getting a check.

The IRS said Friday that those affected do not need to take any action for the September payment to be issued by direct deposit.

Tax experts say this unexpected shift from direct deposit to paper checks for some is expected to be a one-time issue.

If you're in this situation, Treasury recommends visiting the Child Tax Credit Update Portal at IRS.gov to see if you're receiving a direct deposit or paper check this month.

You also can go to the IRS site for a special page of information on the Advance Child Tax Credit at IRS.gov/childtaxcredit2021.

And another update: The IRS said that families who did not get a July payment and are getting their first monthly payment in August will receive a bigger check as the total payment will spread over five months, not six.

For these families that didn't get money in July but did in August, each payment is up to $360 per month for each child age 5 and younger and up to $300 per month for each child ages 6 through 17, according to the IRS.

What was that timeline?

The six monthly rounds of advance payments are set to arrive around the 15th of the month this year. The first July advance payment hit July 15. The next payments are scheduled for Sept. 15, Oct. 15, Nov. 15 and Dec. 15.

The second child tax credit monthly advance payment for August was scheduled for Aug. 13. That's because Aug.15 is a Sunday. The way direct deposit usually works, you're getting a "pending" notice in your account before the money shows up.

We are looking at a mixed message. For some, things will work out the same as last month. But others who got their money via direct deposit in July now could need to check their mailboxes for this second round of monthly payments for August — if they're not seeing the money via direct deposit.

Nothing is really simple, is it.

The Internal Revenue Service noted in July that about 86% of the payments for July were sent by direct deposit.

The first batch of advance monthly payments were worth roughly $15 billion and were sent to about 35 million families across the country.

►Child tax credit:Payments 'help alleviate the pressure,' used for rent, food and debts

Who's getting what?

Nationwide, about 36 million advance payments will be issued for August, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury's data. The payments cover nearly 61 million children across the country and totaled about $15.4 billion. The average monthly payment was $428.

The Treasury said the number of payments for August increased, compared with July, and cover an additional 1.6 million children.

The August payout numbers reflect advance child tax credit payments disbursed to eligible recipients based on taxpayer information that the IRS is using, the Treasury noted, and do not account for reversed payments or those that end up being undeliverable.

An effort is ongoing to get those who typically aren't required to file a tax return, based on a low income, to sign up to receive the advance credit money. The Treasury announced Friday that a new, mobile-friendly, bilingual sign-up tool created by Code for America — a civic technology nonprofit — will be available in the coming weeks.

It is not too late for low-income families to sign up for advance child tax credit advance payments and you'd use tools at IRS.gov to do so. People can get these benefits, even if they don’t work and even if they receive no income.

►Child tax credit uses:Families pay for rent, food

Money pays down debt, buys food

The advance child tax credit is an influx of cash just in time for back-to-school purchases and other expenses.

Many families used the money they received in July to pay off debt, and buy groceries, clothing and to pay for child care, according to the latest U.S. Census household pulse survey.

For some families, we're talking about money that's as big as a monthly car payment — or more.

Millions of eligible families are receiving up to $300 per month from July through December for each qualifying child ages 5 and younger and $250 per month for children ages 6 to 17.

A family with three toddlers could be looking at a monthly payment of up to $900.

The expanded credit is so new that some families didn't even realize that the advance payments are coming every month from July through December this year only.

The child tax credit was expanded as part of pandemic-related relief. The IRS will pay half the total credit amount — up to $3,600 for each child for those with young children — in advance monthly payments over the six months. The other half is to be claimed on the 2021 income tax return.

If your child ages out of the credit in 2021, the IRS is expected to make some adjustments on its own. The IRS won't include a child who turns 18 in 2021 in your advance monthly payments. And the IRS is expected to adjust the payment to $250 instead of $300 a month for a child who turns 6 this year.

The monthly advance payments are a new program that was authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act, enacted in March. Right now, the monthly payouts are happening this year only, but President Joe Biden and other Democrats want to try to extend this relief into future years.

Many families don't need to do anything to get this money. The IRS is basing monthly payments on the most recently processed tax return, either the 2019 federal return or the 2020 return.

The IRS said that the August payments reflect information on tax returns that had been processed by Aug. 2, including people who don’t typically file a return but during 2020 successfully registered for Economic Impact Payments using the IRS Non-Filers tool on IRS.gov. And this group also includes those who this year successfully used the Non-filer Sign-up Tool for advance child tax credit at IRS.gov.

The new maximum credit is available to taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for singles; $112,500 or less for heads of household; and $150,000 or less for married couples filing a joint return and qualified widows and widowers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The claim: There's more evidence of UFOs being real than the COVID-19 vaccine being healthy for you

Actor and musician Chet Hanks, the son of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, claims there is more evidence supporting the existence of UFOs than for the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Hanks, whose parents were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic, recently took to Instagram to share his controversial stance on vaccinations.

"There's more evidence of UFOs being real than that vaccine being healthy for you, just saying," Hanks asserts in an Aug. 11 video with more than 260,000 views. "If the aliens are out there, I'm ready for y'all to come get me."

His comments follow a previous video, in which he jokingly encouraged people to get vaccinated and then yelled "PSYCH!" He proceeded to falsely compare the coronavirus pandemic to the flu.

Despite Hanks' viral video, data from clinical trials, peer-reviewed research studies and the vaccine rollout have shown all three vaccines authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are safe and effective. But there's no such firm evidence supporting the existence of UFOs.

Fact check: Post misuses CDC data to make false claim on COVID-19 vaccine safety for youths

USA TODAY reached out to a spokesperson for Hanks for additional comment.

COVID-19 vaccines safe, effective

COVID-19 vaccines have been proven safe and effective. They prevent hospitalizations, deaths and illnesses, contrary to Hanks' claim, which is based on false and misleading information.

Clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants found the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing COVID-19.

A clinical trial for the Moderna vaccine studied more than 30,000 participants and found it was 94% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Similarly, a trial for Pfizer’s vaccine that studied approximately 43,000 participants concluded the shot was 95% effective. A trial with more than 43,000 enrolled participants for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine found the shot was 85% effective in preventing severe diseases.

The trials found "no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an" emergency use authorization, according to FDA briefing documents for each vaccine.

For months, the FDA has authorized all three vaccines for emergency use. On Aug. 8, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that the FDA could give full approval for the vaccines by the end of August.

The evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective doesn't just come from clinical trials. The vaccine rollout has proved the shots work.

Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in mid-July that more than 97% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were unvaccinated. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of state data shows unvaccinated Americans make up more than 94% of COVID-19 cases. Nearly all deaths are among unvaccinated people, too.

As of Aug. 12, approximately 59.2% of the U.S. population has had at least one COVID-19 shot. Since December, more than 351 million vaccine doses have been administered, according to the CDC.

If the vaccines weren't safe, it stands to reason that there would be widespread, confirmed reports of severe side effects. But there aren't.

Some serious side effects reported after vaccination, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and thrombocytopenia syndrome – a blood clotting disorder – are rare, according to an Aug. 13 CDC report. Researchers analyzed confirmed side effects reported to the federal government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and found the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks.

For example, the report found that every 1 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are likely to prevent about 1,800 hospitalizations and 140 deaths, while causing 14 to 17 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and one to two cases of the blood clotting disorder.

Widespread misperceptions about the safety of the vaccines also don't hold water.

Some people claim vaccines were developed too quickly, therefore they can't be safe. However, the coronavirus spike protein was identified approximately 20 years ago, which helped accelerate the vaccine development process.

Persistent claims that vaccines change your DNA, or that they aren't safe for pregnant women have been previously debunked. On Aug. 11, the CDC said pregnant women should be vaccinated against COVID-19, based on an analysis that did not show an increased risk of miscarriage.

Fact check: Flight cancellations due to weather, labor shortage, not vaccine mandates

No firm conclusions from UFO report

Hanks' claim that there is evidence to support the existence of UFOs likely stems from a June 25 report from the office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence that did not draw any "firm conclusions" about reported sightings.

Out of 144 "unidentified aerial phenomena" (UAP) sightings between 2004 and 2021, only one could be explained: It was a large, deflating balloon.

"In a limited number of incidents, UAP reportedly appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics," the report says. "These observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis."

Sightings of aerial phenomena often include weather incidents, routine natural events, weather balloons or misfires in sensor systems and cameras, officials say.

Investigators did not find any evidence the sightings were linked to aliens, but they did not rule out the possibility. Ultimately, the report concluded there is no definitive explanation behind aerial phenomena spotted by military pilots.

Fact check:COVID-19 vaccine mandates don't violate Nuremberg Code

Our rating: False

Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that there is more evidence UFOs exist than that the COVID-19 vaccine is healthy for you. All three vaccines authorized by the FDA in the U.S. have been found to be safe and effective at preventing deaths, hospitalizations and illnesses, as shown in both clinical trials and the hundreds of millions of vaccinations administered. Meanwhile, a government report found no evidence showing any unidentified flying objects were of alien origin.

Now 7 in 10 American adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the new rise in cases fueled by the delta variant threatens to undo the country’s progress toward normality.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 16% of U.S. adults will “probably or definitely” not get the vaccine. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, other unvaccinated adults vary in their plans and concerns:

3% intend to get the vaccine as soon as possible.

6% will get a vaccine “only if required” for work or other activities.

10% want to “wait and see” before getting vaccinated.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Remnants of Fred, which was downgraded from a tropical depression on Saturday, are expected to redevelop Sunday as the system passes over the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said. It could arrive in Florida's panhandle and the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama on Monday.

Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Grace formed in the Atlantic Ocean overnight and was moving quickly. It will be days before any possible impacts from the storm affect the Florida coast, forecasters say.

That storm is expected to bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by Monday and could bring heavy rainfall to Florida late next week. It's also expected to bring 4 to 7 inches of rain, with up to 10 inches in isolated maximum totals, to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which was just hit by a massive earthquake Saturday.

A tropical storm warning was discontinued for the Florida Keys on Saturday morning as Fred approached. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for a third of the state as Fred loomed.

Both systems are expected to bring heavy rain and flooding.

"There is a good chance for two landfalls in the U.S. with Fred ... likely in the Florida Keys early Saturday and the second likely over northern Florida by early next week," AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno said on Friday.

"Through Monday, 3 to 5 inches of rain is anticipated across the Keys and southern Florida," the National Hurricane Center said.

The National Weather Service in Miami issued a flood watch for all of South Florida due to the expected heavy rainfall.

The Hurricane Center previously cautioned to "not focus on Fred's exact forecast track as heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and a chance of tornadoes will extend far to northeast and east of the center, and those hazards are likely to still affect portions of the Florida peninsula."

As of 5 p.m. EDT Saturday, Fred was about 510 miles south-southeast of Mobile, Alabama, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. It was moving west-northwest at 13 mph.

After spending a brief time as a tropical storm earlier this week, Fred weakened back to a depression due to its spin over Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power to some 400,000 customers and caused flooding that forced officials to shut down part of the country’s aqueduct system, interrupting water service for hundreds of thousands of people.

Local officials reported hundreds of people were evacuated and some buildings were damaged. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Fred became the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season late Tuesday as it moved past the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@July 2021 marked the 439th consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th-century average.

Many of the changes seen in the world's climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of years.

"This new record adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe."

Hot enough for you?

July 2021 was the planet's hottest month ever recorded, federal scientists announced Friday.

Official global temperature records "only" date back 142 years, to 1880. But looking back further, the last time the world was definitely warmer than today was some 125,000 years ago, based on paleoclimatic data from tree rings, ice cores, sediments and other ways of examining Earth's climate history, NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt said in 2017.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Administrator Rick Spinrad, in a statement on Friday, said “in this case, first place is the worst place to be. July is typically the world’s warmest month of the year, but July 2021 outdid itself as the hottest July and month ever recorded.

The combined land and ocean-surface temperature was 1.67 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th-century average of 60.4 degrees F, according to NOAA.

"This new record adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe,” he said.

According to NOAA, Asia had its hottest July on record, besting the previous record set in 2010; Europe had its second-hottest July on record – tying with July 2010 and trailing behind July 2018; and North America, South America, Africa and Oceania all had a top-10 warmest July.

In the U.S., several states in the West and the northern Plains had their hottest July on record.

July 2021 also marked the 45th consecutive July and the 439th consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th-century average, NOAA said.

NOAA's report about July's heat comes out the same week as a major report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

“Scientists from across the globe delivered the most up-to-date assessment of the ways in which the climate is changing,” Spinrad said. “It is a sobering IPCC report that finds that human influence is, unequivocally, causing climate change, and it confirms the impacts are widespread and rapidly intensifying.”

'Code red for humanity':UN report gives stark warning on climate change, says wild weather events will worsen

Many of the changes seen in the world's climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of years. Some of the changes already set in motion – such as a rise in sea levels – are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years, according to the report.

Due to human-caused climate change, Earth's average temperature has risen more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, NASA reported earlier this year.

Ralf Toumi, co-director of Grantham Institute on climate change at Imperial College London, told Reuters the recent bursts of record-breaking heat are no surprise, given the long-term pattern of rising temperatures.

"This is a constant casino we're playing, and we're just picking the high numbers again and again," he said.

Children under 12 are still not eligible for vaccines against COVID-19. And just in time for back-to-school season, the highly contagious delta variant is causing pediatric cases of the coronavirus to skyrocket.

The good news is experts agree on how to keep kids and teachers safer at in-person school: Adults and older children should be vaccinated, and everyone should wear masks.

But many schools aren't requiring them – and many states say they can't, even if administrators and parents want to.

What's a parent to do?

Masks work, even when not everyone wears one

Studies from last school year show mask-wearing is an effective prevention strategy, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report updated in July. But when mask use is inconsistent, the CDC found, outbreaks can occur.

That will be even more the case this year with the delta variant on the rise.

Most states have lifted mask mandates in schools but allow local districts to impose them as they see fit. Twelve states have imposed mask mandates in schools, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico – a group that has grown in the past week.

Nine states have banned their school districts from imposing mandates.

Wearing a mask provides instantaneous protection. It can guard a person from infection even in environments where not everyone is masked, such as schools without mask mandates.

Should everyone wear masks? Why the CDC's new mask recommendation applies to vaccinated Americans

“It's similar to a bicycle helmet," said Dr. James Versalovic, chief pediatrician at Texas Children’s Hospital. "We have things that we put on or around our bodies that may restrict our hearing or our vision momentarily, but we do that because these things protect us and they keep us safe."

More than 90% of COVID-19 cases affecting children now are a result of the delta variant, Versalovic said. He worries more children will have to be hospitalized in the coming weeks. Texas, where he works, has a ban on mask mandates via executive order from Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican.

Children who contract COVID-19 may suffer symptoms of acute infection, but of even greater concern are the consequences of long-haul COVID-19. It's estimated that 10% of children who contract COVID will have chronic symptoms that may include cardiac conditions, decreased lung function and behavioral or functional abnormalities.

With cases on the rise, 63% of parents think their child's school should require unvaccinated students and staff to wear a mask, ​​​​a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found. Rural and white parents were more likely to want schools to end COVID-19 safety protocols such as masking, and parents of color and urban parents were more likely to want them in place, another survey by the RAND Corp. found in May.

Passionate, angry parents filled school board meetings across the country this week – to plead for mask mandates or to rail against them.

"I myself have lost faith in the public school system," one parent told the Michigan State Board of Education on Wednesday when it met to pass a resolution supporting decisions on mask mandates made by individual schools.

"This is a matter of life and death," countered Mike Siegel, a parent of two elementary students in Austin, Texas, who is an attorney and a former Democratic congressional candidate.

Some school districts are implementing mask requirements in defiance of their state's bans.

Schools in Houston, Dallas and Austin have implemented a mask mandate for teachers and students, despite an executive order from the governor prohibiting mask requirements in Texas. Several districts are also engaged in a legal battle over the executive order.

Late Friday, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona wrote a letter to Abbott backing the districts that have defied his executive order and adopted "science-based strategies" for reopening schools safely. Federal law, Cardona said, requires schools that received American Rescue Plan stimulus money to develop plans for safe return to instruction.

Similar acts of defiance and legal battles are playing out in other states with bans on mask mandates.

Vaccines can help adults limit COVID-19 outbreaks

As schools reopen, it's important to remember kids are less to blame for the spread of COVID-19 than adults. Data from school reopenings in 2020 suggests adult-to-adult transmission was a higher risk than infections passed from adults to children. And some evidence suggests COVID-19 spread more easily among teens than elementary-age children.

That science puts the emphasis on vaccines for people who are eligible. Keeping cases down among teachers and parents can help schools stay open.

No vaccines for young kids, yet: Some parents are slipping young kids in for the COVID-19 vaccine, but doctors say it's 'risky'

“The fall and winter consequences of any (school) outbreaks will depend crucially on how many adults are vaccinated in the wider community, because schools are a hub connecting many different households," Bill Hanage, an epidemiology professor at Harvard University, told USA TODAY.

So far, only Hawaii and California have required teachers to be vaccinated. Puerto Rico requires the shot for children 12 and over who are taking in-person classes.

Roughly a dozen states have banned schools or employers from requiring vaccines. Bills seeking to restrict vaccine mandates have passed one house of the legislature in four other states.

On Thursday, the National Education Association, the country's largest teachers union, endorsed vaccine mandates for teachers, with requirements for regular coronavirus testing for people who want to opt out.

“Guardians of children, all adults and teachers, need to recognize their responsibility to children to get vaccinated,” Versalovic said.

Half of all Americans are fully vaccinated, CDC data show, but the percentage is much higher in some states – and much lower in others.

Is it safe to send kids to school – in masks or without?

The pandemic has made it clear children learn best in classrooms, so public health experts recommend schools do everything they can to hold in-person classes.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 is likely to spread more easily in schools when a community has high transmission, the CDC says – and much of the country has returned to those levels.

Versalovic says parents should keep their child at home if they have had a known COVID-19 exposure or are showing COVID-19 symptoms. He also recommends parents have a conversation with their kids about best practices for limiting viral spread.

Successful mitigation strategies include social distancing and proper hygiene. And, of course, masking.

Parents should be cautious but not anxious about sending their children back to school, said Dr. Chad Perlyn, president of Nicklaus Children’s Hospital's Pediatric Specialists in the Miami area. Schooling is important to a child's mental and emotional development, Perlyn said.

That's the same reason some parents have cited in protesting school mask mandates.

“We often hear the question 'Is it natural for children to wear masks in schools?' And the obvious answer is no,” Perlyn said. "That said, the protections that masks can afford by limiting the spread of the disease is very meaningful.”

The benefit of masks far outweighs any downsides, experts say. For instance, Perlyn said, wearing a mask does not impede breathing.

“Throughout the course of the pandemic there has been much discussion about whether masks cause increased (carbon dioxide) levels and whether that affects children," Perlyn said. "What we know is that the masks that children and adults would be wearing do not raise CO2 levels to any meaningful point.”

Wearing a mask has no impact on cognitive function or brain development, he added. What does are the side effects of COVID-19 such as inflammation of the brain or the weekslong phases of mental fog that have been reported in long-haul COVID-19 cases.

Perlyn encouraged parents to arrange Zoom play dates at the beginning of the school year so their children can interact and meet one another without masks.

He also suggested parents or teachers craft a "smile button" for students, which is a photo of the child's face they pin on their clothes so others can essentially see through their mask.

“Ideally, a child would be playing and laughing and interacting with other children without a mask. But I will say that I think we will see that in a matter of a few months," Vasolovic said. "I’m confident that we will reach that time before the end of the school year."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@James Hormel was the first openly gay individual appointed a U.S. ambassador.

The grandson of the founder of Hormel Foods, James Hormel supported LGBTQ causes throughout his life.

James C. Hormel, the United States' first openly gay ambassador who was appointed to Luxembourg by former President Bill Clinton, died Friday in San Francisco at 88.

The philanthropist and AIDS activist died with his husband by his side and "listening to his favorite Beethoven concerto," the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

Hormel was first nominated to ambassadorship by Clinton in 1997, but Senate Republicans blocked the nomination.

“We had the votes, and we tried to get a vote for two years,” he told The Daily Beast in August 2020. "But Trent Lott, then the Senate majority leader, wouldn’t bring it up, he absolutely refused."

Clinton re-nominated Hormel in 1999. He was granted a recess appointment as Ambassador to Luxembourg in June of that year, according to the State Department, and served in the role for nearly two years.

"The ultimate reason that I decided to go through what I went through is that it required Senate confirmation to send me out as a personal representative of the president,” Hormel told The Chronicle in April.

His perseverance against homophobic attacks and advocacy for LGBTQ rights inspired a generation of young gay people, including Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. Hormel was confirmed when Buttigieg was 17.

“I can remember watching the news… (and) seeing a story about an appointee of President Clinton named to be an ambassador attacked and denied a vote in the Senate because he was gay – ultimately able to serve only by a recess appointment,” Buttigieg said when he accepted President Joe Biden's nomination for Transportation Secretary. “And I learned something about some of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong. But just as important, I saw how those limits could be challenged."

Homophobic attacks at home that led to “moments of depression and more moments of anger" were missing from his working relationship with a foreign country, Hormel told The Daily Beast.

"It was helpful to me because when I arrived in Luxembourg, the government was very sympathetic and really went out of their way to work with me. We had an excellent relationship," he said.

Prior to his ambassadorship, Hormel represented the U.S. in various capacities at United Nations conferences in the 1990s. He also participated in the President's Conference on the Pacific Rim in 1995.

Hormel was born in 1933 in Austin, Minnesota, the grandson of Hormel Foods founder George A. Hormel. He had five children with ex-wife, Alice McElroy Parker, whom he met while attending Swarthmore College. The couple divorced in 1965, The Chronicle reported.

Hormel earned a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School. He later served as Assistant Dean and Dean of Students and established the James C. Hormel Public Service Program in 1986 to attract law students to public service.

The former ambassador had lived in San Francisco since 1977, according to The Chronicle. He was elected to the Board of Trustees of the World Affairs Council of Northern California in 1999.

Hormel also devoted his life to LGBTQ causes and developing resources for those affected by the AIDS virus. A founder of LGBTQ advocacy organization the Human Rights Campaign, Hormel worked on behalf of several local and national AIDS awareness groups, according to a press release from the organization.

Elected officials, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, remembered Hormel in statements Friday.

"San Francisco lost a great friend today. A philanthropist, civil rights pioneer and loving spouse and father, James Hormel lived an extraordinary life and will be deeply missed by many," Feinstein posted to Twitter.

"James Hormel cared deeply about supporting the community here in San Francisco, not only to advance the rights of LGBTQ people, but also to make a stronger and more welcoming city for all," Breed said, according to online publication SF Gate.

“Jim devoted his life to advancing the rights and dignity of all people, and in his trailblazing service in the diplomatic corps, he represented the United States with honor and brought us closer to living out the meaning of a more perfect union,” the Clintons said in a joint statement, according to The Chronicle.

The paper reported that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. also remembered Hormel's contributions to the community.

“When the AIDS epidemic descended upon San Francisco, he called on our conscience and rallied the city to help our neighbors suffering from the ferocious disease.” she said. “His work served as a model for national policy to defeat HIV/AIDS and improve the lives of all affected.”

Hormel is survived by his husband, Michael P.N. Araque Hormel; children Alison, Anne, Elizabeth, Jimmy, and Sarah, 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A federal judge has revived a Trump-era immigration policy that ordered asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico as they waited for their U.S. court hearings.

President Joe Biden halted the controversial Migrant Protection Protocols border policy, known as "Remain in Mexico," during his first days in office, making good on a campaign promise. The program required thousands of non-Mexican migrants to wait in Mexico– an unprecedented handling of immigration protocol.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in June formally ended the program, saying keeping it intact "would be a poor use of the department’s resources.”

However, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, directed the Biden administration to reinstate the program, saying the administration “failed to consider several critical factors” when ending the program. Kacsmaryk delayed his order for seven days to give the administration a chance to appeal.

Kacsmaryk said Mayorkas did not see the "benefits" of the program, which deterred migrants from the border. He also said Mayorkas failed to heed warnings from DHS officials who said the program's repeal would lead to a surge in undocumented immigrants into the U.S and ignored the fiscal cost to states of repealing the policy.

The lawsuit was brought in April by the Republican attorney generals of Texas and Missouri, who argued that ending the program led to a surge in migration at the U.S.-Mexico border.

"Today, in a huge win for the Missouri Attorney General’s Office and in a big step towards securing the border, a federal court issued a nationwide permanent injunction, reversing the Biden Administration’s suspension of the program and ordering the Biden Administration to reimplement the program,” Missouri state Attorney General Schmitt said in a statement.

The Immigration Reform Law Institute, the legal arm of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, celebrated Kacsmaryk's ruling, calling it "a major victory."

The policy was "arbitrary and capricious because they did not provide any justification for the change in policy nor consider relevant factors in making that change," the Immigration Reform Law Institute said in an amicus curiae supporting Texas and Missouri.

The institute also pointed to the administration ignoring "the costs that Plaintiff States would incur as a result of the suspension of the MPP program."

In his ruling, Kacsmaryk said Mayorkas' June memo formally ending the program violated federal law.

The policy must remain in effect until the Biden administration has the ability to detain all asylum-seekers, in accordance with U.S. immigration law, and until the MPP is "lawfully rescinded."

The DHS, in partnership with the Department of Justice, rolled out the policy on Jan. 29, 2019, at the San Diego-Tijuana border region.

In past decades, asylum-seekers were allowed to wait for their immigration trial hearings in the U.S. The Trump administration implemented MPP to crack down on asylum and unauthorized immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. It returned about 70,000 asylum-seekers to Mexico from January 2019 until January 2021, according to The Associated Press.

The policy led many migrants to stay in Mexican border towns often in unsafe and dangerous conditions.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A massive magnitude 7.2 earthquake hit Haiti early Saturday morning, leaving buildings crumbled, hospitals overcrowded and people rushing in fear from their homes into the streets. The quake left at least 300 people confirmed dead and 1,800 injured so far.

The earthquake came as tropical Tropical Storm Grace raced toward the island, potentially complicating rescue efforts. The storm is expected to arrive late Monday night or early Tuesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The death toll stood at 304, according to Jerry Chandler, Haiti’s director of civil protection. . Teams will be sent to the area for search and rescue missions, Chandler told the Associated Press.

Makenson Pierre, 32, found one person dead near the rubble on the main street of Jérémie, his hometown. Jérémie, a coastal city in southwestern Haiti, is about 80 miles from Saint-Louis du Sud, which is located close to the epicenter of the quake.

Pierre quickly recognized the man as his childhood friend.

"He was a great guy," Pierre told USA TODAY. "We grew up together. It was painful to watch."

The man was only in his late 20s. "He was too young," Pierre said.

Pierre described an "overwhelmed, understaffed" hospital that had set up a tent outside to increase capacity and was handing out gloves to anyone who was willing to help. He said he saw about 15 people being treated for injuries outside.

The quake has sparked comparisons to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti that killed an estimated 300,000 people.

"High casualties are probable and the disaster is likely widespread," the U.S. Geological Survey said of Saturday's quake. "Past events with this alert level have required a national or international level response."

Saturday's epicenter struck about 100 miles from Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.

"The damage should not be as bad as 2010, b/c that quake gave Intensity VII shaking to Port au Prince," tweeted seismologist Lucy Jones. But intense shaking from the latest earthquake affected about 130,000 people "so losses will be high," she warned.

Haiti's new prime minister, Ariel Henry, said on Twitter he would mobilize all available government resources following the "violent quake" that had caused loss of life and damage in various parts of the country.

Preliminary reports for the U.S. Geological Survey estimate hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. USGS reported much of the region has "structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking."

Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the country. Some towns were almost completely razed, he said at a news conference.

He added the government sent people to Les Cayes, a coastal town where local hospitals are overwhelmed with wounded people, to help coordinate a response. Haiti's overburdened hospitals were already under the strain of the worsening COVID-19 pandemic.

Henry said the International Red Cross was helping care for injured people as well.

“The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,” he said.

“The needs are enormous," he added. "We must take care of the injured and fractured, but also provide food, aid, temporary shelter and psychological support."

President Joe Biden authorized an immediate response after he and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed about the earthquake Saturday morning, according to the White House.

"In what is already a challenging time for the people of Haiti, I am saddened by the devastating earthquake that occurred in Saint-Louis du Sud, Haiti this morning. We send our deepest condolences to all those who lost a loved one or saw their homes and businesses destroyed," Biden said in a statement Saturday afternoon.

He added: "The United States remains a close and enduring friend to the people of Haiti, and we will be there in the aftermath of this tragedy."

The quake was felt as far away as Jamaica, which is 200 miles away, the New York Times reported. At least two cities — Les Cayes and Jérémie — reported major devastation, according to the newspaper.

Pierre, from Port-au-Prince, arrived Friday afternoon for a visit to his hometown.

Pierre told USA TODAY he was in the shower when he felt the first shake. At first, he thought there was something wrong with the shower but when the shaking continued, he ran out of the home with his friend and his friend's young daughter.

Many others, afraid of a possible tsunami, fled to the mountains nearby, he said.

Pierre stayed in the street for 30 minutes as a minor aftershock shook the city. Phone lines were down for some time but he was eventually able to call his wife and children in the Dominican Republic, who told him they only felt minor shaking. Pierre's brother in Port-au-Prince told him he had felt significant shaking but no one he knew had been hurt.

"Thank God they are all fine," Pierre said. "Trying to confirm everyone is safe was a long process because you have to prepare for the worst."

Pierre said there was no damage to the house he was in and only one neighbor had a small crack on the side of his house. But near the city's main street, the destruction was more severe. He said many buildings, including a church, had been destroyed or damaged.

The earthquake forced many to relive the trauma of a magnitude 7 earthquake that devastated the country in 2010. More recently, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake in 2018 left more than a dozen people dead.

When the earth began to shake, Pierre said he braced himself for the worse, remembering the devastation of the 2010 earthquake, which took the life of his niece.

"It was 10 years ago but it is one of the scars that is never going to wear off," he said. "It is something I will always remember."

Silvera Guillaume, civil protection coordinator in the coastal city of Les Cayes, told the Washington Post the city deployed first responders to rescue people from the rubble but is badly in need of more resources for search and rescue efforts.

Améthyste Arcélius, administrator of Immaculate Conception Hospital in Les Cayes, told the newspaper the hospital is in "desperate" need of emergency drugs and health professionals as "the hospital is flooded with victims."

People in Port-au-Prince rushed into the streets in fear after feeling the quake, according to the Associated Press.

Naomi Verneus, a 34-year-old Port-au-Prince resident, said she was jolted awake when her bed started shaking.

“I woke up and didn’t have time to put my shoes on," she said. "We lived the 2010 earthquake and all I could do was run."

The earthquake comes just a month after the assassination of Haiti's President Jovenel Moise left the nation in political turmoil.

“We’re concerned that this earthquake is just one more crisis on top of what the country is already facing - including the worsening political stalemate after the president’s assassination, COVID and food insecurity,” said Jean-Wickens Merone, spokesman for World Vision Haiti.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kevin Rosengren stared at the piece of paper in disbelief. No antibodies.

The 46-year-old resident of Richmond, Virginia, received theone-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine in March. He was confident in the vaccine’s effectiveness and finally felt free to leave his house, travel and meet with friends.

But lately, news of the highly contagious delta variant driving a surge of COVID-19 cases worries him. He doesn’t want to bring the virus home to his unvaccinated 11-year-old son.

Rosengren confided in his pharmacist, who offered an antibody test to dispel his concerns. Unfortunately, the results only added to them.

“I had this coat of armor on before, and now I feel completely naked in the world of COVID,” he said.

The Food and Drug Administration does not recommend antibody testing, because it's not clear what level of antibodies is protective enough and because different tests yield different results.

Rosengren knows the test may have been inaccurate, and he still has confidence in all the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA. But he can’t help wondering if he’s one of the unlucky few whose body did not react properly to the J&J vaccine.

“You always have this little thing at the back of your mind, no matter how much data you read, like, ‘I’ve had one shot, and other people have two shots,’” he said. “I don’t want to be worried anymore. I’m tired of getting worried.”

Rosengren is part of a growing group of healthy J&J vaccine recipients contemplating whether they should get a “booster” dose from one of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, hoping to improve their chances against the delta variant.

As of Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedmore than 13.7 million people had gotten the J&J jab,and about 1% of them got additional shots. Health experts said real-world evidence shows it protects against the worst outcomes of COVID-19, and it’s too early to recommend additional doses to healthy recipients.

J&J's pivotal large-scale trial showed it was effective against COVID-19, preventing more than 70% of symptomatic infections and about 86% of serious ones. New data the company presented July 22 to a federal advisory committee showed the protection lasts against all variants circulating for at least eight months.

As long as the J&J vaccine protects against the severest forms of COVID-19, healthy people don’t need a booster shot, Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Tuesday in a public conversation with Brown University School of Public Health.

“We will cross the line where we know we need a booster dose when people who are fully vaccinated nonetheless are hospitalized with (J&J) or dying of COVID,” he said. “We’re not there, yet.”

Although J&J studies show its vaccine offers protection against most of the known variants, a study posted online July 19 but not yet peer-reviewed suggested it was less effective against the delta variant. Researchers from New York University found that blood samples from people who received the J&J vaccine were less able to neutralize the delta variant than blood from people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots.

This form of lab testing offers hints of protection but is not as reliable as showing whether the vaccine works in people, experts said.

Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University, told CNBC she received a booster shot of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine in late June, about two months after she got J&J’s single dose.

She told the news outlet she was concerned about her level of protection against the delta variant. Rasmussen did not reply to USA TODAY's request for comment.

The San Francisco Department of Public Health began allowing J&J vaccine recipients to get a “supplemental dose” of one of the mRNA vaccines. To qualify, residents must have had their single dose shot in San Francisco and attest that a health care provider discussed the risks and benefits with them.

The public health department emphasizes “supplemental vaccines are not required or recommended,” and those who have gotten a J&J vaccine are considered fully vaccinated.

Mixing and matching mRNA vaccines with other vaccine technology is not a part of the FDA’s emergency use authorization, but there is some preliminary data that supports it.

A study in June led by researchers at the University of Oxford suggests mixing vaccines may protect better than the two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen. The Lancet preprint study not yet peer-reviewed, found people who received both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinesmay have had a better immune response than those vaccinated with just Pfizer.

In May, researchers at the Carlos III Health Institute in Madrid announced results from a study that found a strong immune response in people who received the same AstraZeneca-Pfizer combination. The AstraZeneca vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, the same technology used by the J&J vaccine.

Health experts are waiting formore concrete evidence.

“More is not always better,” said Tammy Lundstrom, infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at Trinity Health in Livonia, Michigan. “It’s prudent to wait for the science to dictate who needs a booster, what’s the optimal spacing (between shots) and whether mixing and matching is safe.”

While they wait for the data, she said, concerned J&J vaccine recipients should wear masks and avoid crowded areas as an extra layer of protection against the virus.

Instead of debating “boosters” for healthy vaccinated people, Offit said, the conversation should be redirected to vaccinating those who still haven’t gotten their shot, as the delta variant thrives on the unvaccinated.

“This discussion of boosters is just off point,” he said. “The problem in this country is not boosting people who have already been vaccinated, the problem in this country is vaccinating people who haven’t been vaccinated.

“That’s what we need to focus our efforts – all our efforts – on.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As Taliban fighters moved Sunday into Afghanistan's capital city, the nation's leader fled.

President Ashraf Ghani flew from Kabul to an unknown destination. At least one news report said he traveled to Uzbekistan.

Later Sunday, Ghani posted an explanation for his exit, saying if he stayed, more Afghans would die and "bloodshed" would result.

"Today I came across a tough choice," starts the post, written in Pashto and translated using Google. "I have to face the armed Taliban who want to enter the palace or leave the country where I have dedicated my life to protecting and nurturing it for the last 20 years. If left unchecked, countless patriots would be martyred and the city of Kabul would be devastated, resulting in a major humanitarian catastrophe in the six-million-strong city."

He added that the Taliban, have "won the sword and gun judgment and are now responsible for protecting the honor, property and self of their compatriots."

Abdullah Abdullah, leader of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council, criticized Ghani's exit during "this difficult situation."

"God should hold him accountable," Abdullah said.

Ghani, who has been president since 2014, then called on the Taliban to win legitimacy for its government.

Hours after Ghani left, Taliban leaders were seen in footage obtained by Al Jazeera, sitting in the presidential palace in Kabul.

Just days prior, Ghani posted that Afghan "political and jihadi" leaders were ready and committed to defend the country.

Here is the full text of Ghani's post on Sunday:

Rebekah Sanderlin has never been to Afghanistan, and yet she says the war-torn nation of 39 million has “permeated every single part of our lives’’ for the past two decades.

As the wife of an Army veteran who was deployed to Afghanistan up to seven times, the last one less than two years ago, Sanderlin developed an affinity for the Afghans based on her husband’s experience with them and her own research.

She uses terms like "terrifying’" and “heartbreaking’’ when pondering their fate now that the ruthless Taliban has taken over the country in stunningly fast fashion, toppling the government of President Ashraf Ghani, prompting him to flee and forcing the U.S. to rush out its personnel.

After more than 2,300 Americans were killed and 20,000 wounded in a 20-year war that cost the U.S. an estimated $2.26 trillion, Sanderlin said, many military families are wondering if all their blood and sweat – in addition to the months of separation and the missed special occasions – were all for naught.

"There are a lot of veterans who are grappling with: ‘Was it worth it? Were all of our sacrifices wasted?'" Sanderlin said. She added that many are conflicted about the Biden administration’s decision to pull out the U.S. troops, which opened the door for the Taliban.

"There’s a very defined, clear, loud group that feels like, as much as we hate what’s happening, it was time for the war to end. At the same time, there’s another very clear, outspoken group that says we’re betraying the Afghans, and we’re walking away from an opportunity to have done something really good."

Sanderlin, a mother of three whose husband of 18 years is now retired from the military, counts herself among those who are torn about the troop withdrawal, changing her mind seemingly every hour and feeling there were no good options.

Dig deeper with subscriber-only journalism:

Like most military families whose members have seen combat, the Sanderlins had friends die in the Afghanistan war; a close friend was paralyzed from the neck down, and others lost multiple limbs. They’ve also heard stories about the Taliban’s atrocities against their fellow citizens, especially women and children, and fear for them.

So does war veteran Denver Riggleman, a former U.S. congressman for Virginia.

"I deployed on Sept. 21, 2001. So many lost in the Towers. So many brothers & sisters in arms lost," Riggleman said on Twitter. "When I first arrived, I researched what the Taliban did to women. I briefed the troops on it. Horrific images seared in my mind: executions, hangings, stonings. I’m struggling today."

Afghanistan under Taliban control:A timeline of the US withdrawal and Taliban recapture of Afghanistan

Scott Murray, a retired Air Force colonel and former intelligence officer who spent more than two years in Afghanistan at the height of the U.S. involvement there, said he understands the decision to leave, given all the elements that stand in the way of reversing fortunes in the Middle Eastern country.

Murray told USA TODAY that a friend of his in the Afghan government suggested the American presence softened the Afghans by introducing Western comforts and ways of thinking, weakening the natives’ resolve to fight the Taliban.

“The U.S. withdrawal is bittersweet for me,’’ Murray said. “There’s such an emotional swing while you’re there, and now what? Afghanistan really becomes an ungoverned space again, and we are back where we started. Was the sacrifice worth the effort? I just don’t know how you say yes to that, after the destruction of al-Qaida, of course.

“Our nation and our allies are much safer than they would have been had we done nothing in October of 2001. We had to act. No question. But is Afghanistan better off today? I don't think so. I hope I'm wrong.’’

Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida, a decorated veteran who was the first Green Beret elected to Congress, served in Afghanistan as a special forces officer. He also worked as an adviser to former defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates and as a counterterrorism adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney.

He disputes the notion that the war in Afghanistan – launched by the administration of President George W. Bush to drive out the Taliban and pursue Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 – has been a wasted effort.

"I really bristle, and I know a lot of other veterans do, too, when I hear people say the war is a failure,’’ Waltz said. "I certainly think we could have done a lot of things better across multiple administrations. But the fact that we haven't suffered another 9/11 – and that al-Qaida has been pressured and decimated – is a success. From a counterterrorism standpoint, Americans are safe.”

Perhaps, but many are also sorry.

"It is a horribly sad situation because Afghanistan is a gorgeous country," said Jason Kirell, an infantry mortarman who was in Afghanistan in 2010-11. "The people there don't deserve to live under a brutal group of thugs like the Taliban."

Kirell added he could tell by his time in the country that whatever the U.S. was trying to do clearly wasn't going to work.

Sanderlin had the first of her three children two weeks before her husband – whose name she withheld – deployed to Afghanistan, forcing her to put her journalism career on hold. He was away again when their second child was born and didn’t get to meet her until five months later. Their third child, when she was learning to speak, thought the word for phone was "daddy," because that’s how she communicated with him.

Despite the challenges presented by his career, Sanderlin knows her family is among the fortunate ones because they survived America’s longest war and they’re now together. Many military families can’t say that.

"When you look at the impact of the war, what I keep thinking about is we’re never going to put it behind us," she said. "It’s always going to be with us because of the injuries, because of the kids who don’t have parents, because of the spouses who lost their spouse and the parents who lost their children."
