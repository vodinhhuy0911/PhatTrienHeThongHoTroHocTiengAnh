The United States once again dominated the medal podium at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

There are 206 countries competing in Tokyo with over 11,000 athletes representing them. While there are enough medals for every country to hypothetically go home with one — 309 across 33 sports — many countries will go home without any hardware. In fact, there are 72 countries recognized by the International Olympic Committee that have never won an Olympic medal.

The United States is the all-time leader in Olympic medals with nearly 3,000, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany and France.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Inevitably, the conversation often shifted back to the same topic no matter the setting.

When LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony talked after Team USA practices, NBA All-Star games, on the phone or during vacations, the two often discussed a topic that intrigued NBA fans ever since both entered the league 18 years ago. What if James and Anthony played on the same NBA team?

“For years, we always laughed about it,” Anthony said, “and spoke about it on what it would be like.”

Lately, the topic no longer became a pipedream and a joking manner. James has wanted to collect more than four NBA championship trophies. Anthony has wanted at least to receive one. So with James hoping to delay Father Time and Anthony hoping to prolong his NBA career, James recently offered a more serious message.

“The time is now. I want you,” James told Anthony. “We have to make this happen.”

And so they did. After playing for so-called “Super Teams” in Miami and Cleveland, James once again will play with a handful of future Hall of Famers. James will play with Anthony Davis for a third consecutive season. James will play with Russell Westbrook after the Lakers acquired him from Washington in exchange for the No. 22 pick in the 2021 NBA draft, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Montrezl Harrell. And James will play with Anthony, who joined the Lakers on a one-year deal after accepting similar contracts with the Portland Trail Blazers the past two seasons on a reduced role.

“Most people would say you should’ve gotten together years ago or earlier in our careers. But we were in two different lanes,” Anthony said. “We were in two different paths. Everything comes full circle.”

Back when Anthony and James played on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team, the two had talked with about teaming up together. James did the same with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. While Wade and Bosh maintained interest with aligning their free agency for the 2010 offseason, Anthony prioritized a bigger contract and role. And why wouldn’t he? A year after those discussions, Anthony led the Denver Nuggets to the 2009 Western Conference finals against the Lakers.

“Carmelo has always been one of the toughest dudes in the world to play against because of his talent, size, strength, speed and shooting ability,” said Lakers forward Trevor Ariza, who played against Anthony during that 2009 playoff matchup. “Everything he brings to the table is just like a nightmare for a defender.”

Anthony’s career soon turned into a nightmare. He became frustrated with the Nuggets’ stagnant direction. So he demanded a trade during the 2010-2011 season. The Nuggets eventually traded Anthony to the New York Knicks, but the move depleted the Knicks of having any depth around him. So when Anthony became a free agent in 2014, he entertained various proposals from the Lakers, Chicago Bulls and the Houston Rockets.

Anthony ultimately stayed with the Knicks because they could offer more years (five) and money ($129.1 million) than any other team (four years, $95.9 million). Though it helped the Lakers’ cause that Anthony remained close friends with the late Kobe Bryant, it did not help the franchise faced a hefty rebuilding project while Bryant had just absorbed the second of his third consecutive season-ending injuries.

But when Anthony met with the Lakers’ basketball operations department, business side as well as television and marketing partners for 2 ½ hours, he still walked away impressed. Movie producer Joel Silver made a four-minute trailer of Anthony’s life, which Tobey Maguire narrated. Afterwards, Anthony admitted, “I wish I could get my hands on that.”

“It seems like throughout my whole career, I’ve always stayed connected with the Lakers someway or somehow,” Anthony said. “Whether it was through my brother, Kobe, regardless to what it is, I’ve always been connected somehow.”

Not enough to forge a partnership, though. Anthony and former Knicks president Phil Jackson soon had philosophical differences on which role each person played in the organization’s dysfunction. So, Anthony waived his no-trade clause in 2017, and the Knicks dealt him to Oklahoma City. With a team that featured Westbrook, Anthony and Paul George, the Thunder still lost to the Utah Jazz in six games in the first round of the playoffs. The Thunder then waived Anthony amid luxury tax concerns. The Houston Rockets signed him the following season only to waive him after 10 games.

During those times, Anthony fielded criticism for his reluctance to play as a reserve and evolve his high-volume mid-range shooting. But during his past two years in Portland, Anthony received rave reviews for accepting any role, remaining a scoring threat and becoming a willing defender. In turn, Anthony said he accepted the reduced role because Portland’s front office and coaching staff had direct conversations about it.

“I’m cool. Just be transparent with me,” Anthony said. “I was cool with that decision. I had never done it before. I had done it with USA before. I had done it briefly in Houston for a couple of games. But I had to figure out a way to motivate myself and keep myself going in a different position in a different role. So you’re playing for 15 to 17 years and you’re the guy and the starter, then all of a sudden, someone says, 'Listen, come off the bench.' I had to swallow that ego. I had to swallow that pride. But I also had to use that ego and that pride to keep me on edge and keep me motivated.”

It does not appear Anthony will need to swallow his ego and pride to keep himself motivated with the Lakers.

“I’m coming in with a championship on my mind,” Anthony said. “We all know this is the one thing that I’m missing. This is the one thing that keeps me up at night. It motivates me. I don’t have it. I want that experience.”

So, unlike in 2014, the Lakers did not need to host an elaborate free-agency meeting. Then, the Lakers talked about their championship history without the roster to back it up. They talked about the Lakers’ branding opportunities, though Anthony already had carved out his business portfolio already. And though they talked about the appeal with living in Los Angeles, Anthony already knew since he had owned a home there.

“There wasn’t really no pitch this time,” Anthony said. “It was more of an understanding. The time is now. The time is now for both parties to merge and both parties to come together.”

Both parties have come together during unique circumstances. Anthony (37), James (36), Ariza (36), Marc Gasol (36) and Dwight Howard (35) are all past their prime. Wayne Ellington (33), Westbrook (32) and Kent Bazemore (32) have just surpassed the 30-year mark. And the 28-year-old Davis has an injury-riddled history.

When a reporter relayed the ages of these players to Anthony, he interrupted quickly. “We don’t care!” Anthony said with a smile. “We make our own narrative.”

Part of that narrative entails showing why James and Anthony were better off waiting for their partnership until this season.

“If all of us would’ve come together earlier in our career, we probably wouldn’t have had the same understanding as we’re going to have right now,” Anthony said. “I think we’re all ready to take on whatever role that is that all of us need to feel we need to take on in order to reach that ultimate goal.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As a Miami Marlins outfielder and public figure, Lewis Brinson is accustomed to catching grief. As a Black baseball player, he says that comes in the form of at least one monthly direct message or comment on Instagram using a racial slur to defile him.

So, when he heard that a Colorado Rockies fan might have shouted the name of the team mascot, Dinger, rather than a slur directed at Brinson while he was in the batter’s box, he hopes that fan is not inappropriately castigated.

Yet 24 hours after the ninth inning of Sunday’s game at Coors Field, and after watching video of the sequence in question at least 50 times, Brinson’s ears – and his mind – cannot shake what he believes he heard.

“I personally keep hearing the n-word. It’s not that I want to hear it,” Brinson said Monday on a video call from San Diego before the Marlins’ game with the Giants. “I never want to hear that word. Personally, I’ve never been called that, in person, to my face, on the baseball field, or outside the baseball field, ever, so I don’t know what my reaction would be if I got called that. I haven’t talked to the Rockies, I haven’t talked to that fan personally - but if that’s the case, I’m sorry for any backlash or anything that he’s getting right now. I know we’re getting a lot of love and support on Instagram and I’m sure on Twitter and I appreciate that.

“But again, I’m a human. I have sympathy. If he was yelling for the mascot, I am sorry for the backlash and unnecessary attention he’s getting right now.”

OPINION:What word did you hear? Rockies racial slur audio another sign of divided nation

As far as the Rockies and Major League Baseball are concerned, there is no if.

The club talked to what it believes was the fan in question and other fans, and said in a statement that after a “thorough investigation that included calls, emails and video clips from concerned fans, media and broadcast partners, the Colorado Rockies have concluded that the fan was indeed yelling for Rockies mascot Dinger in hopes of getting his attention for a photo, and there was never any racial slur that occurred.”

If Brinson sounds willing to accept that yet also leave the door open for another outcome, it’s a well-earned perspective.

Brinson, 27, is a part-time player who has spent parts of the past four seasons with the Marlins and acknowledges his burden of fame as a Black player is less than some of his better-known colleagues.

Yet, he says he still receives crude, hateful, racist messages with that word once or twice a month, typically arriving in the same grim package – a profile picture that’s not a person at all, or so you’d think.

“They don’t show their face and don’t tag themselves on their posts or the DM they send me,” he says, “but I do get it, once a month, twice a month. I know other Black players get it more. We do get called the n-word on social media. It’s disgusting. We see it and try to block it out, but it’s a disgusting, degrading word that brings nothing but hate and cowardliness.

“There’s no place for it. It does happen and I don’t want to just throw that under the rug. I want everybody to know that it does happen to Black players, quite often, way too often.”

Brinson spent part of Monday talking with former teammates Curtis Granderson and Cameron Maybin; Granderson is president of the Players’ Alliance, a coalition of mostly Black current and former major leaguers who formed last year in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. Brinson says he does not yet know if the Alliance and Black ballplayers will accept the Rockies’ conclusion.

They are unanimous, though, in the plausibility of the incident, even if it possibly did not unfold as originally believed. And that, perhaps, is what stings the most.

“All I know is that, in my opinion, it sounds a lot like the n-word. But I’m not that fan. I don’t know what he said,” says Brinson. “I only have the video and the video sounds like the n-word to me. But, if he didn’t, and didn’t initially mean for him to make it sound like that. I’m sorry for all the backlash coming.

“If it didn’t happen yesterday or it happened yesterday, it does happen. And a lot of Black players can attest to that. It’s forgotten about way too much and needs to be stopped. Anybody caught saying anything racial to anybody – white, Latino, anybody – needs to be banned from every sporting event.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic has reached a deal on an maximum salary extension with the team that will pay him $207.1 million over five years, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports.

The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is official.

The Mavericks have a press conference scheduled for Tuesday in Ljubljana, Slovenia with Doncic, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, general manager Nico Harrison, coach Jason Kidd, and Doncic’s agents, Bill Duffy and Enrique Villalobos.

This deal is not a surprise as Doncic all but confirmed he would sign the lucrative extension at the end of the season.

Doncic will play the 2021-22 season on the fourth year of his rookie contract at $10.1 million and the extension will begin in 2022-23 at $35.7 million. His salary will escalate to $38.6 million, $41.4 million, $44.3 million and $47.1 million in 2026-27.

Doncic, 22, is the franchise cornerstone. In just his third season, he is a two-time All-Star and two-time All-NBA performer, making first-time All-NBA in 2020-21. Last season, Doncic averaged 27.7 points, 8.6 assists, eight rebounds while shooting 47.9% from the field and 35% on 3-pointers.

He is a gifted shotmaker and elite playmaker who has 36 triple-doubles in three seasons.

The next step for Doncic and the Mavs: getting out of the first round of the playoffs. Doncic and the Mavs have lost to the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the postseason for two straight seasons. The franchise hasn't advanced past the first round since beating the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in 2011.

RACER

The battle for the NACAR Cup Series regular-season championship between Denny Hamlin and Kyle Larson is coming down to the wire.

Following Larson’s fifth win of the season Sunday afternoon on the road course at Watkins Glen, he moved into a tie with Hamlin for the overall points lead. Hamlin has led the standings since the second race of the season and has been one of the most consistent drivers in the series despite not having won a race.

Hamlin was fifth in the Go Bowling at The Glen, his fourth top-10 finish in five road course races this season. He and Larson lead the series with 15 top-10 finishes.

“It’s going to be a battle all the way to the end, I think,” Hamlin said.

Three races remain in the regular season. The driver who wins the regular-season championship will be awarded 15 playoff points, which likely sounds better than 10 points for being second in the standings for Hamlin.

While Larson and Hendrick Motorsports might be considered the championship favorite with his bucket of wins and playoff points, Hamlin and Joe Gibbs Racing have put in a solid season. The two are primed to race each other hard down this final stretch.

Larson is the new series leader – taking the spot from Hamlin after Watkins Glen – with 265 stage points. Hamlin has 261. But Larson is clearly ahead of Hamlin and the rest of the competition regarding race wins (five to Hamlin’s zero) and stage wins (12 to Hamlin’s five).

Larson also expects the points to be decided after the last lap in the finale at Daytona.

“(Hamlin) is so good at Daytona, too, so it would be nice to get a couple good weeks and get that point lead because I know he’s going to go there, and anything can happen at Daytona,” said Larson. “But I know he’s going to go there, and he’s going to get stage points, and he’s going to challenge for the win. I know he’s looking at me as the same.

“If he could go into Daytona being even or ahead, he’s going to feel like he’s got the advantage. I’d like to have a good couple weeks before we get there and give us a little bit of wiggle room.”

The regular-season championship has not been a source of entertainment in recent seasons. Kevin Harvick clinched it midway through the second-to-last race of the regular season last year. Kyle Busch claimed the honor in both 2018 and ’19, and in ’18, did so midway through the final race of the regular season.

“I want everybody to race me hard,” Larson said of battling Hamlin. “He ran me really hard at Road America and put me in a couple bad spots to where I almost ended up in the grass, or if I didn’t lift, I was going to send him spinning. So, then I knew points was on his mind, and trying to hold me back is definitely on his mind.

“Yeah, it’s fun racing him, and I look forward to the next few weeks and really even into the playoffs. There’s still a lot of racing left, and yeah, it’s going to be fun. I’m glad there’s a fun little regular-season point battle, and I feel like, in years past, it’s kind of been a blowout come the last race of the points. But yeah, to be tied with three races left is pretty cool.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INDIANAPOLIS — Bob Jenkins was the iconic auto racing broadcaster who called the Indianapolis 500's closest finish and who, off the track, was a music aficionado. He was a humble rarity in a media world of egos who always said of his career, "I was just a race fan who got lucky."

Jenkins died Monday after an 8-month battle with brain cancer, according to Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Doug Boles. He was 73.

Jenkins was a kid from Liberty, Indiana, whose older brother first told him about the Indy 500. A race with cars speeding around a track for 500 miles sounded magical to Jenkins.

Not long after, his dad took Jenkins on a trip to Indianapolis Motor Speedway for qualifications in 1958. Two years later, he went to his first Indy 500 and, until his cancer diagnosis, Jenkins missed only two races – 1961 and 1965.

In 1961, he wanted desperately to go, but he was 13 and didn't have a ride.

"I should have put an ad in the paper, shouldn’t I?” Jenkins told IndyStar in February when he announced he was battling brain cancer.

He missed the 1965 Indy 500 because he was on his senior trip to Washington, D.C. While classmates left the bus to tour the Washington Monument and other sites around the nation's capital, Jenkins stayed on the bus with a transistor radio to his ear listening to the race.

That a kid obsessed with cars whizzing at 200 miles an hour got to eventually be the "Voice of the 500" and work in IndyCar and NASCAR for ESPN and NBC Sports, was always a wonder to Jenkins.

"I always have been and am now a race fan who got lucky," Jenkins told IndyStar in May. "I did not put myself on a pedestal just because I had a high-profile job on radio or television. That does not make me better.

"All I want to be remembered as is a race fan who got a job in radio or TV. And for some reason, people liked me."

Mario Andretti, the 1969 Indy 500 winner, was one of those people. Jenkins was such a fixture at the track, he can't exactly remember when he first met Jenkins.

"Bob Jenkins, over the years, he was just a figure that was always there and very much front and center in Indianapolis," said Andretti. "His voice is just absolutely unique. I would always know who was talking."

"He was just one of those that developed his career alongside ours, you know," Andretti said. "He was one of us in every way."

'What a thrill'

Jenkins was born Sept. 4, 1947, in Richmond, Ind., and raised in nearby Liberty. He graduated from Short High School in 1965 and Indiana University in 1969. The only thing Jenkins loved more than racing was music.

He had an expansive collection of 45 records and knew, it seemed, every song ever produced, even if if was a one-hit wonder by a 6-member Dutch band, said Jake Query, a friend of Jenkins and turn announcer for IndyCar.

"It was amazing, amazing to be in the car with him going to and from racetracks from the hotel," he said. "We’d put on "'60s on 6" or "'50s on 5" on (Sirius) XM radio and literally every single song, it was a challenge for everyone but him. He would name within five notes the artist, the song and the year."

Out of IU, radio disk jockey was the gig Jenkins wanted. He took a job as a radio news reporter instead to get his foot in the door.

Paul Page, the play-by-play commentator for the Indy 500 for 27 years in radio and TV, caught wind of Jenkins as his local radio career flourished. Before the 1979 Indy 500, he asked Jenkins to join the IMS Radio Network.

Jenkins started the first two years calling action of the backstretch. From there, he moved to Turn 4 from 1981-89 before joining the famous motorsports fraternity of those dubbed the “Voice of the 500” – a role he served from 1990-98.

From there, he turned to TV, then IMS PA announcer.

Jenkins' most famous on-air moment came in the closing seconds of the 1992 Indy 500, the first of two won by Al Unser Jr. The victor prevailed in a seven-lap battle following the final green flag of the race in a sequence where Unser Jr. zig-zagged up and down the track trying to break Scott Goodyear’s draft.

The two came to the final straightaway with the eventual runner-up closing in on Unser Jr. to create what is still the tightest finish in the Indy 500: 0.043 seconds.

Longtime announcer Bob Lamey handed off the mic from his spot in Turn 4 that afternoon.

“Al Unser Jr. has the lead, one more turn to go. Here they come, coming to the finish line. Bob Jenkins, who’s going to win it?”

“The checkered flag is out. Goodyear makes a move. Little Al wins by just a few tenths of a second, perhaps the closest finish in the history of the Indianapolis 500. Al Unser Jr. has become the first second-generation driver to win an Indianapolis 500. Al Unser Jr. has done it, holding off the challenge from Scott Goodyear.”

Listening back to that call, Jenkins said in February, still gave him chills.

“I just don’t know who to thank most for giving me the opportunity to be part of the Radio Network and the closest finish in history,” he said. “What a thrill."

'He pinched himself every single day'

Through his career, Jenkins also worked in television, calling IndyCar and NASCAR for ESPN/ABC and NBC Sports.

Terry Lingner began working with Jenkins at ESPN in 1980. The two were also partners with Speedweek, one of the longest magazine style shows in ESPN’s history.

"I can’t even count the number of shows that I had the privilege to be in his ear," Lingner said. "Love is not a big enough word. Damn cancer. "

He often heard Jenkins talk about being lucky when it came to his career.

"Lucky only pertains to a circumstance," he said. "After that moment, you better have the skill."

Jenkins had the skill and so much more, said Doug Boles, president of IMS.

"Part of the reason that Bob is so loved is that the race fans knew Bob was a fan," he said. "You could tell by the way he told the stories. His passion came through in everything he did."

And there was his unpretentious character that also endeared him to fans.

"There has never been a day Bob Jenkins walked into a room and said, 'Hey, I'm Bob Jenkins, look at me.'" said Boles. "He still doesn't get it. He never understood what a big, big deal he was."

When Jenkins' TV contract expired, he went from anchor to doing turn announcing. Query remembers wondering how someone that had been at the pinnacle as an anchor could come back at what would seemingly be a lower position.

"Then the very first race he was on, I realized I was the dumb one there," Query said. "He did it because he loved racing. He had no ego whatsoever. There was no one I ever worked with that was less impressed by his rank than Bob Jenkins.

"He pinched himself every single day."

Jenkins was inducted into the IMS Hall of Fame in 2019, alongside the late Dan Wheldon.

“Bob has brought to life some of the most memorable moments in IMS history — the closest ‘500’ finish in 1992 and Jeff Gordon’s victory at the inaugural Brickyard 400 immediately come to mind,” Tony George, president of the IMS Foundation, said at the time. "His contributions to the Speedway are many."

That induction was the most emotional Query ever saw Jenkins.

"It meant everything to him," he said. "It meant everything."

'My family is my race fans'

It was Christmas night when Jenkins woke up with an excruciating headache, one that couldn't be ignored. He went to a Crawfordsville hospital near his home for a CAT scan and then on to another hospital for an in-depth MRI.

Doctors found the cause of the headache: two malignant tumors in his right temple.

Jenkins, who overcame colon cancer decades ago and who lost his wife to brain cancer in 2012, announced his diagnosis to IndyCar fans in February on IMS's "Behind the Bricks" YouTube show.

“With God’s help and my beloved race fans, I’m going to make it,” Jenkins said, fighting back tears. “I don’t have a large family – I have a niece and a nephew – but I consider the first people I should tell is my family, and my family is my race fans."

His plan at the time was to not completely retire and hopefully work public address in May. But in the days leading up to the race, Jenkins was able to get to the track only twice and he didn't work.

One of those visits came after a doctor's appointment that didn't bring good news. Boles invited Jenkins to IMS.

"We stood on the the yard of bricks for an hour and he just told stories," Boles said. "It was just really neat to see him at the place he loved so much, have it all to himself, telling stories."

The cards and letters are still coming in to IMS for Jenkins, Boles said. There have been more than 1,000 since he announced his battle in February.

From Parnelli Jones to the everyday race fan.

"They all have stories," said Boles, "about how they fell in love with the sport because of Bob Jenkins."

HOUSTON – Deshaun Watson returned to practice with the Houston Texans on Monday after not taking part in workouts for almost a week.

Watson reported to camp on time and was on the field for the team’s first five days of practice, participating in individual drills only. When the players wore pads for the first time this season last Tuesday, he did not participate and was not on the field.

He continued to be absent from practice until Monday when he trotted onto the field with the rest of the team. He only worked during individual drills and went into the indoor practice facility after the first five periods of work. He returned to the field near the end of the two-hour practice and watched as his teammates went through 11-on-11 work.

Coach David Culley refused to say why Watson stopped practicing with the team last week, and he wasn’t available to answer questions regarding his return Monday because he spoke before practice.

Watson’s future is uncertain after he asked for a trade in January before 22 women filed lawsuits alleging that he sexually assaulted or harassed them in March. Houston police and the NFL are investigating the allegations, but no charges have been filed.

OPINION:Josh Allen's massive contract extension is a testament to Bills' carefully executed plan

Watson still wishes to be traded and reported to training camp solely to avoid being fined. He would have faced fines of $50,000 a day if he didn’t report.

Watson signed a four-year, $156 million contract extension with the Texans last offseason and led the NFL in yards passing last season. But he became unhappy with the direction of the team and requested a trade in January after the Texans, who won the AFC South in 2018 and ’19, sank to 4-12 last season.

General manager Nick Caserio signed veteran Tyrod Taylor to a one-year deal in March to give the team an insurance policy at quarterback if Watson can’t or won’t play this season. The Texans selected Stanford’s Davis Mills in the third round of this year’s draft, and he and Jeff Driskel, a recent free-agent signee, will likely compete to back up Taylor if Watson isn’t an option.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the most entertaining parts of conference realignment is the sniping that accompanies it.

And the state of Texas is the king of delivering parting shots that age poorly.

After the Southeastern Conference announced in 1990 that Arkansas was being added from the now-defunct Southwest Conference, Baylor football coach Grant Teaff pondered, “Who is the SEC, anyway?”

Today’s youth now ask, what was the Southwest Conference? Meanwhile, Baylor endured 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1996-2009 while the SEC ascended to college football’s throne.

Then-Texas athletics director DeLoss Dodds supplied an infamous barb in 2013, following Missouri’s first season in the SEC, when he claimed, “Our bad years are better than (Missouri’s) good years.”

Missouri went on to play for the SEC championship in 2013 and ’14 while Texas compiled a 14-12 record during that stretch.

Now, it’s Texas’ turn to be on the receiving end of jabs after the SEC’s addition of the Longhorns and Oklahoma. The two Big 12 schools say they’ll join their new conference in 2025, but the move could happen sooner.

Baylor athletics director Mack Rhoades told The Athletic that the Longhorns are leaving the Big 12 because “they felt too little of themselves.” That’s funny, coming from Rhoades, whose own SEC foray as Missouri’s AD went so poorly that Tigers fans probably would have offered to pay for his gas out of town when he bolted to Baylor, ending his tumultuous 14-month tenure.

Meanwhile, Texas state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a TCU alumna, quipped that maybe Texas “would rather lose to Alabama than TCU.”

That zinger has merit. The Longhorns would rather lose to Alabama than TCU, because it’s more lucrative to do so.

Get those jabs in now, because the Longhorns will get the last laugh.

For the second time in about a decade, the Big 12 is teetering on the brink of collapse. You can bet that if the SEC offered Baylor or TCU a lifeline out, they’d grab it.

Considering the Big 12 is set to reduce to eight teams after Oklahoma and Texas bid farewell, perhaps it should dust off the old Big Eight logos.

If Texas A&M or Missouri harbored any lingering regret about leaving for the SEC – and I doubt either did – this latest Big 12 exodus proves those schools were wise to get out when they had the chance a decade ago.

Texas and Oklahoma will further strengthen the SEC’s place as the richest and most powerful conference.

But Texas’ conference swap should improve more than its finances. Joining the SEC also should help accelerate Longhorns football.

Yes, you read that correctly. Joining the nation’s best conference will improve Texas football, at least long-term.

Don’t believe me? Check out what’s happening at Texas A&M.

Certainly, hiring Jimbo Fisher is a key component in the Aggies’ ascent, but a place at the SEC’s table also lifted that program’s standing.

First, let’s back up a second. It’s all too easy – and in some ways, appropriate – to crack jokes about Texas football. The program’s production the past 11 years hasn’t matched its hubris.

But don’t conflate Texas’ underachieving football program with an underachieving athletics department. The Longhorns are the reigning winners of the Directors’ Cup, which is awarded for success throughout the athletics department.

In the 27 years the Directors’ Cup has been awarded, Texas has 21 top-10 finishes. Three Texas programs won national championships – men’s swimming and diving, women’s rowing and women’s tennis – in 2020-21, and its volleyball program finished as the national runner-up. Its baseball program reached the College World Series semifinals.

Expect Texas to annually rival Florida for the SEC’s best athletics department, top to bottom.

Now, as for football.

Being in the SEC should help Texas’ already affluent athletic department increase its cashflow to spend on the facilities arms race, coaching salaries and recruiting budgets.

During the 2011 fiscal year, while still in the Big 12, Texas A&M athletics generated $87.3 million in revenue. It brought in $212.7 million in revenue in 2019, a 143.7% increase. The Aggies’ revenue hike partly stems from a surge in donations connected to the Kyle Field renovation, but media rights and licensing revenue also soared.

Texas led the nation with $223.9 million in revenue in 2019, up 72.2% from its 2011 figure.

A home in the SEC should help Texas in recruiting battles, too.

Programs throughout the nation swoop in to poach prospects from Texas’ fertile recruiting ground. Top prospects previously had to decide whether they wanted to play for the state’s most visible school, or play in the nation’s best conference. Now, prospects can do both.

Again, use Texas A&M as a reference as to what this should do for recruiting.

The Aggies’ 2011 recruiting class – their last class before they accepted an invitation to the SEC – ranked 34th nationally in the 247Sports Composite. Their 2012 signing class ranked 16th, beginning a stretch of 10 consecutive top-20 classes, half of which ranked in the nation’s top 10.

So, get those wisecracks about Texas in now, because this move to the SEC should serve as a catalyst to awaken the Longhorns.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BATON ROUGE, La. — Mike VII, LSU's live tiger mascot that lives in a habitat near Tiger Stadium, has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, LSU announced Monday.

Mike VII, who is 4 years old and arrived at LSU in 2017, received his first shot on July 16 and his second on Aug. 6 from LSU veterinarian David Baker.

"Mike VII has not shown any adverse effects from the vaccine," an LSU release said. "His caretakers will continue to monitor him closely as always."

Barricades around the tiger's habitat that were installed in 2020 to keep visitors 10 feet away will be removed on Aug. 17, according to LSU.

The vaccine was donated by Zoetis, an animal health company, and has been used by dozens of zoos in the United States after being approved for experimental use by the Department of Agriculture, the release said.

LSU opens the 2021 season against UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Sept. 4 (8:30 p.m. ET on FOX).

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After investigating an apparent racial slur yelled by one of its fans, the Colorado Rockies said Monday that the fan was shouting to get the attention of the club's mascot, Dinger, rather than an offensive epithet.

The Rockies interviewed a fan that a camera appeared to capture gesturing and yelling at the same time what appeared to be a slur directed at Miami Marlins batter Lewis Brinson that was audible on a Bally Sports feed of Sunday's game, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation. The club also spoke to a fan sitting nearby who contacted the club independently and said the fan was shouting at the mascot, and not a slur.

The episode occurred in the top of the ninth inning of Sunday's game, won by the Rockies 13-8. Brinson had two hits and two RBI in the game.

Brinson, nor anyone on the field, did not hear the shouts at the time they happened, according to the Marlins.

“After a thorough investigation that included calls, emails and video clips from concerned fans, media and broadcast partners, the Colorado Rockies have concluded that the fan was indeed yelling for Rockies mascot Dinger in hopes of getting his attention for a photo, and there was never any racial slur that occurred," the Rockies said in a statement released Monday.

"The Rockies remain dedicated to providing an inclusive environment for all fans, players and guests at Coors Field, and any fan using derogatory language of any kind will be ejected from Coors Field.”

Major League Baseball has assisted the Rockies in the investigation and been in contact with the club, according to a baseball official with knowledge of the investigation who requested anonymity due to the sensitive subject matter.

After video of the broadcast clip circulated on social media, the Rockies released a statement condemning the apparent slur, saying the club was "disgusted by the racial slur by a fan directed at the Marlins' Lewis Brinson." MLB Players' Association executive director Tony Clark also released a statement condemning the apparent slur.

The Marlins are in San Francisco Monday to begin a three-game series. Brinson is scheduled to address the news media on Monday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Monumental Sports and Entertainment, owners of the Washington Mystics and Wizards, had a great start and finish to the Tokyo Olympics.

Wizards forward Rui Hachimura kicked off the Games by carrying the Japanese flag at the opening ceremony, and Mystics center Tina Charles and guard Ariel Atkins wrapped up the women’s basketball competition with a gold medal victory against Japan.

The Wizards and Mystics had six players at the Olympics – Hachimura, Charles, Atkins, Germany’s Isaac Bonga, Belgium’s Emma Meesseman and Australia’s Leilani Mitchell.

“It’s a unique opportunity,” Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard said. “We’re so proud of them. The international aspect of bringing athletes together for a competition and the exchange of cultural information – the entire experience makes them more rounded as individuals but it also gives us a great of pride that we have some fantastic representatives for their respective countries. It’s just such a neat thing for us.”

No other NBA/WNBA ownership group sent more players to Tokyo, and a record-121 NBA and WNBA players participated in men's and women's basketball at the Olympics.

The Wizards’ Bradley Beal made the U.S. men’s team but COVID-19 health and safety protocols prevented him from playing in Tokyo.

Sheppard appreciated Hachimura’s moment in his home country.

“Watching him carry the flag was that much more special,” he said. “It was a tremendous moment for him, his family and Japan.”

On the court, Charles and Atkins played reserve roles, and it was Charles’ third Olympic gold medal. She averaged 4.5 points and three rebounds and had 15 points and five assists in a group stage victory against France. Atkins’ best game came against Australia in the quarterfinals when she had three points and three rebounds and was a plus-five.

Meesseman, the 2019 WNBA Finals MVP, was a star, averaging 26.8 points, 10.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 3.5 steals and 1.3 blocks. Belgium lost in the quarterfinals 86-85 to Japan, which reached the gold-medal game.

Mitchell averaged 9.3 points and 5.5 assists and had 14 points and six assists in the quarterfinals loss to the U.S.

Bonga helped Germany reach the quarterfinals after it missed the 2016 Rio Olympics and 2012 London Olympics. Bonga averaged eight points and 4.8 rebounds.

Japan was 0-3 in group play, but Hachimura was clearly the standout player. He averaged 22.3 points and 6.7 rebounds and scored 34 points against semifinalist Slovenia.

“We have some elite players in global basketball,” Sheppard said. “These players from Monumental are elite in their country. Making the Olympic team is evidence of that.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – Saquon Barkley is about to take the most significant step in his return from ACL surgery yet.

The New York Giants activated the star running back from the the physically unable to perform (PUP) list, allowing him to return to practice.

Barkley has been working extensively with the team's training staff since camp began on July 27. Now, with just over a month until the Giants open the regular season at home at MetLife Stadium against the Denver Broncos, Barkley's presence is an encouraging sign that he is moving in the right direction to be ready for Week 1.

Much of a rehabbing-Barkley's work has been done an estimated 150 yards from the patio behind the Quest Diagnostics Training Center, which is where the media is relegated to watch. There's no question all eyes have been on Barkley whenever possible.

What's been easy to see: Barkley is looking more and more like his old self every day.

As Barkley joked two weeks, questions regarding a timetable for his return to action will undoubtedly create "the theme of the summer" for the Giants. He's their best player and the one that strikes fear in opposing defensive coordinators, a fact that can't be offered without the "when healthy" disclaimer.

This should be considered a significant statement about where Barkley is in that respect right now. The Giants will try to gauge how his body responds to the physical demands on a daily basis.

Judge shared insight into the Giants' plan for Barkley last week: he's matching the practice workload of the rest of the team's running backs, as if he were participating.

This doesn't necessarily mean Barkley will be a full participant in practice, however. The smart bet would be that Barkley continues to ramp up individual drills through this week and into the next two weeks when the Giants travel to Cleveland and then New England for sets of joint practices.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — The ball soared in the air for what seemed like an eternity. For a split second, Cam Newton's deep throw appeared to be headed beyond the corner of the end zone. That’s when N’Keal Harry stepped up by stretching out.

Using his entire 6-4 frame, Harry jumped into the air to make a full-extension, diving touchdown grab. The play happened during the Patriots' 1-on-1 drills. Harry looked dominant on this play and at several other times on Sunday. This catch, which was by far the best by Harry in his NFL career, had fans at training camp on their feet.

The moment highlighted another outstanding day for Harry, who’s showing the potential the Patriots saw back in 2019 when they drafted him in the first round. Three years and one trade request later, Harry is having the training camp of his life.

“Any ball that’s in my vicinity, I feel like I have to do anything in my power to get it,” Harry said. “So balls like that, I’m going to dive for it. I’m going to give my all to get there. I’ll do anything to catch that ball.”

AFC EAST:Josh Allen's massive contract extension is a testament to Bills' carefully executed plan

That wasn’t the only time Harry stuck out in Sunday’s practice or in training camp this summer. The 23-year-old has been one of the top performers in camp. This is coming off two disappointing seasons for the No. 32 selection in the 2019 NFL draft.

On Sunday, the Patriots were missing receiver Nelson Agholor, so that gave Harry more opportunities. He started off the day looking dominant.

The first play Harry made happened during 3-on-3 drills when receivers were matched up with cornerbacks playing man defense. On the first pass thrown in his direction, he jumped up over Myles Bryant to make a really nice catch. These types of contested catches are exactly what Harry should be doing with his large frame, but it wasn’t always seen last year. On the next rep he took, he made a great over-the-shoulder catch on a fade route while covered by safety Kyle Dugger.

After that, in 1-on-1s, he shook cornerback Michael Jackson Sr. on a slant route. It was the type of route-running that made the crowd scream and the defensive back look silly. After the day was over, Harry said he entered training camp feeling great physically and admitted that these recent stretches of strong, consistent practices have felt like the best of his NFL career.

“Yeah, definitely. That’s been my main focus — this whole training camp, this whole offseason. I had a vision the whole time and I’m starting to attack that vision every day,” Harry said. “I feel good. I feel more agile. I feel faster. It’s awesome.”

Back in 2019, the Patriots drafted Harry over a handful of really good receivers. There’s no denying that he has been outplayed by the majority of top receivers picked in that draft such as DK Metcalf, Deebo Samuel, Terry McLaurin and A.J. Brown. Of course, that made him a target on social media. Did the Patriots whiff on another receiver?

This summer, Harry has looked much better, but he said he’s not fueled by hate or doubt.

“For me, honestly, I could care less what he doubters think. All I know is there’s a lot of people that are still supporting me and still believe in me, so I want to prove those people right,” Harry said. “My family included, my friends, my agent, everybody. I want to prove them right and prove myself right.”

After he caught 33 passes for 309 yards last season, it was fair to wonder what Harry's future would look like in New England. The outlook didn’t look great after the Patriots signed Agholor, Kendrick Bourne, Jonnu Smith and Hunter Henry to go with Jakobi Meyers. That’s one reason why Harry's agent publicly announced in June he had asked the Patriots to trade his client. This happened on June 6. Two months later, Harry’s still in Foxborough and is playing like a man on a mission.

Does the trade request still stand? Will Harry stay in Foxborough after all?

“All that, everything that’s going on off the field, that’s really not my focus at all,” Harry said to the above questions. “I’m focused on becoming a better football player each day. Whatever happens off the field, happens. I’m not going to worry about that right now.”

CALGARY, Alberta – If NHL players are part of next year’s Beijing Olympics, Canada will have a two-time Stanley Cup champion behind its bench.

Hockey Canada has announced Tampa Bay Lightning coach Jon Cooper as the head of its provisional Olympic coaching staff. Three NHL head coaches – the Boston Bruins' Bruce Cassidy, Vegas Golden Knights’ Peter DeBoer and New York Islanders’ Barry Trotz were named assistants. All but Cassidy reach the NHL's semifinals.

Cooper, who is from Prince George, British Columbia, led the Lightning to their second consecutive Stanley Cup title last month when they defeated the Montreal Canadiens in five games.

He previously served as head coach of Team Canada at the 2017 world championships, winning a silver medal. He was an assistant coach with Team North America at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.

NHL OFFSEASON TRACKER:Analyzing the biggest moves

NHL players were not part of the 2018 Pyeongchang Games after taking part in five consecutive Olympics.

Canada won gold in three of those, with Pat Quinn leading the team to the title in 2002 at Salt Lake City and Mike Babcock doing the same in 2010 at Vancouver and in 2014 at Sochi. Canada took bronze in Pyeongchang under coach Willie Desjardins.

The schedule for the upcoming NHL season leaves room for an Olympic break, but the league says no decision has been made on whether players will compete.

The NHL has agreed to pause play between Feb. 7 and 22 in 2022, but notes that talks are ongoing between the NHL Players’ Association and the International Ice Hockey Federation. The league has said if players don’t participate, a revised schedule will be released.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@GREEN BAY, Wis. — Before addressing the media Sunday, Green Bay Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst had a conversation with Devin Funchess to inform the veteran receiver his use of a racist slur against Asians after Saturday night’s practice was “very unacceptable.”

In banter with reporters Saturday, Funchess was discussing the difficulty in noticing smiles on faces that are hidden by masks.

“I can tell you were smiling when I see your face,” Funchess told a reporter. “I can see your face. Everybody goes (slur) and that’s when I know.”

Funchess simultaneously pointed to his eyes, an anti-Asian gesture.

Funchess apologized shortly afterward on his Twitter account.

"I want to apologize for the disparaging remark I used tonight," Funchess said. "It was not OK. I have grown to develop deep personal and business relationships in the Asian community!I meant no harm, and those that know me, know I have love and respect for all cultures and people. I will learn from this and will continue to grow as a person. I'm forever sorry!"

Before taking questions, Gutekunst opened his news conference by condemning Funchess’ slur.

“Unfortunately there was a comment made by Devin Funchess (Saturday) night that was very unacceptable,” Gutekunst said, “and certainly doesn’t live up to the standards and values of the Green Bay Packers. We’ve addressed it with Devin. He knows it’s unacceptable. I do think he’s sincerely remorseful and will hopefully learn from this.

“Hopefully our team can learn from this, and we’ll move forward. I do want to say that’s something that is not condoned, and it certainly doesn’t live up to what we believe.”

Before his comment, Funchess was having his best night of training camp. He caught two passes, his most in what has been a quiet camp for him. Funchess is returning to the field after missing most of the past two seasons.

He broke his clavicle in Week 1 of the 2019 season while with the Indianapolis Colts and missed the rest of the year on injured reserve. After signing a one-year deal with the Packers before last season, Funchess opted out of the 2020 season because of COVID-19.

Gutekunst warned there was zero tolerance for racist language but said he did not consider releasing Funchess over the comment.

“Not at the moment,” Gutekunst said. “I think through the conversations that we’ve had — and there’s going to be more — but I think his apology was sincere. I think he made a mistake, and certainly it can’t happen again.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin finally looked in the mirror and didn't like what he saw.

He decided to make some changes, starting with losing 30 pounds over the offseason. It's all part of holding himself and his players accountable if they want to become a consistent winner in the brutal SEC.

"I saw a picture of me at the bowl game last year and told the players I looked like an anaconda that had swallowed a deer and the deer got stuck in its neck," Kiffin said to ESPN. "Here I am in postseason meetings back in January telling my offensive linemen and other guys that they needed to eat better, lose weight, get in better shape, and I looked like a whale."

Kiffin also challenged his assistant coaches to a weight loss competition to prove his point.

Another important point Kiffin made: his team's entire staff, along with his players, are 100% vaccinated against COVID-19.

The Rebels finished the 2020 season 5-5 after an Outback Bowl win over Indiana.

Ole Miss was picked to finished fourth in the SEC West and have only won 10 or more games in a season twice this century.

The team's season opener is Sept. 6 opener against Louisville.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For the first time in three months, the New York Mets don't lead the National League East.

The Mets' recent decline has coincided with hot streaks from the (now) first-place Philadelphia Phillies and second-place Atlanta Braves, who both made significant improvements at the deadline to make a run in the division.

The Phillies swept the Mets over the weekend in Philadelphia to capture first place, holding the visitors to five runs and 13 hits in the three-game set. Offense has been the main problem for the Mets, with the team batting .179 while going 1-7 to start the month of August.

With a brutal August schedule featuring 13 games in a row against the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, the Mets' season is in danger of slipping away.

7. Oakland Athletics (+1)

Ramon Laureano suspended 80 games after positive steroid test.

8. New York Yankees (+2)

Weekend series against White Sox will be a big road test.

9. San Diego Padres (–)

Big chance to stack up wins with series vs. Marlins, Diamondbacks and Rockies.

10. Cincinnati Reds (+2)

Jonathan India almost at even odds to win NL Rookie of the Year.

11. Toronto Blue Jays (+2)

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (35 HR through Sunday) closing in on Ohtani for MLB lead.

12. Boston Red Sox (-5)

Lost nine of 11 while Rays, Yankees and Blue Jays all won eight of 10.

13. Philadelphia Phillies (+2)

Ian Kennedy converts first two saves – but gave up 3 HR in first four outings.

14. Atlanta Braves (–)

Jorge Soler (3 HR) and Adam Duvall (8 RBI) raked in first week with Braves.

15. New York Mets (-4)

After nearly three months in first place, Mets get overtaken by Phillies.

16. Seattle Mariners (–)

After series win in Tampa, the Mariners won once in four games in the Bronx.

17. Los Angeles Angels (+1)

Tough week ahead with four vs. Blue Jays, three vs. Astros.

26. Miami Marlins (-2)

Outfielder Bryan De La Cruz has been turning heads since his debut.

27. Pittsburgh Pirates (–)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After 339 events in 33 sports and more than 11,000 athletes getting their shot at glory over the course of 17 days, there was plenty to be said about the accomplishments during the Olympics.

Here are the memorable quotes from the Tokyo Games:

"Walking away here without a medal wasn't even a reality for this team. It would be kind of like (gymnast) Simone Biles not making the cut in all-around. I don't know what else to say besides pissed."

— Brady Ellison after U.S. men's archery loss in team quarterfinals

“I wouldn’t be here without her,. She set this amazing standard for middle-distance racing, and if I didn’t have someone like her to chase, I definitely wouldn’t be swimming the way I am. So I’m really grateful to have her and now it’s good to have someone that I can race all the time and just have fun out there. Being in the battle is the best thing."

— Australian swimmer Ariarne Titmus after beating Katie Ledecky in the women’s 400 free

"I can finish the match, but I can die. If I die, who will take responsibility?"

— Russian tennis player Daniil Medvedev on Tokyo heat and humidity

"I get my proof-of-life videos every morning."

— U.S. soccer player Crystal Dunn on her chickens at home

“Excuse my French but the fact that we don't celebrate silver and bronze is bull(blank)."

— U.S. swimmer Lilly King

“For me it’s pretty hard to breathe in after kind of sacrificing my body in the water, so I feel like my health is a little more tied to being able to breathe than protecting what’s coming out of my mouth."

— U.S. swimmer Michael Andrew on not wearing a mask in the mixed zone

"I just try to be calm. I always say to myself, the worst that’s going to happen is you’re going to lose the thing. You could lose the Olympics for your country! That’s how I look at it. Just try to go up there, do my routine and be confident."

— U.S. women's soccer player Megan Rapinoe after converting on penalty kick vs. Netherlands

"MyKayla wanted french fries the whole time she was here. Simone (Biles) ordered french fries and had them waiting for her when she got home," after winning vault silver medal." — Lisa Spini, coach of U.S. gymnast MyKayla Skinner

"That was my version of trying to be a hero."

— U.S. middle distance runner Isaiah Jewett on helping Botswana's Nigel Amos get up and finishing together after their 800-meter track crash

"In the track, we are opponents, but still supporting each other. We want to win, we want to beat each other — but still, we know how hard it is to do this sport, how many sacrifices you have to do."

— Italy's Gianmarco Tamberi on mutual decision to share men's high jump gold medal with Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim

"It just sucks that, you know, if I was on the track side of the sport, I’d be the Usain Bolt of long jump. But just being on the field-event side, it just doesn’t get that attention that it deserves."

— U.S. long jumper Brittney Reese

“I took a shower, listened to some music, called home, talked to my husband, had a little dance party.’’

— U.S. surfer Carissa Moore between the semifinals and finals, when she won the gold medal.

“The ref will call you to the center of the ring and you’ll touch gloves, and usually I have to touch gloves above my head, now it’s definitely an experience.’’

— Richard Torrez Jr., undersized American super heavyweight boxer

"I just remember thinking it would be kind of silly if I stood out there with a black mask and I asked them if they had an extra (pink) one, and they go, 'Oh, no.' "

— U.S. fencer Alen Hadzic, under investigation for sexual misconduct, on three of his teammates wearing pink masks in apparent protest of Hazdic being on the U.S. Olympic team

"I just googled Canada’s most decorated Olympian and my name came up. I want to thank that teacher in high school who told me to stop swimming to focus on school because swimming wouldn’t get me anywhere. This is what dreams are made of."

— Canadian swimmer Penny Oleksiak

“I told her you may feel like yesterday was one of the worst days of your life, but today can be the best. Yesterday is over, let’s go get it."

— Coach/father Brian Carey to U.S. gymnast Jade Carey, who recovered from her trip in the vault finals to win gold on floor exercise

"There’s a lot of relief. I don’t really know how I’m feeling. Right now, I just feel I have to go home and work on myself and be OK with what’s happened. I kind of got to process that while I’ve been here. I just feel like support of the girls and everybody out there meant the world to me."

— U.S. gymnast Simone Biles

"There’s a lot of joy that can be had in the struggle, too, and trying to figure it out and it not always going well and who are you in that moment ... this is always a revealing process and one that I really enjoy and love."

— U.S. soccer forward Megan Rapinoe

"I think people maybe feel bad for me that I'm not winning everything, but I want people to be more concerned about other things going on in the world where people are truly suffering."

— U.S. swimmer Katie Ledecky

TOKYO OLYMPICS:After 17 days of action, these are the moments we won't soon forget

TRACK AND FIELD:Here are the eight brightest Olympic stars, including some surprises

“This is not easy, not an easy week at all. Some parts were extremely enjoyable. I would say the majority of them were not. You can’t sleep right, you can’t nap, shaking all the time. I probably lost 10 pounds. I’m going to weigh myself and eat some food when I get back. It’s a lot of stress we put on the body.”

— U.S. swimmer Caeleb Dressel

"I can be honest and say this is the most responsibility I’ve ever felt. I felt it every day for several years so I’m feeling pretty light now and looking forward to getting back to the hotel and having...something."

— U.S. men's basketball coach Gregg Popovich

“It's an amazing feeling, man. I've got a gold medal. My mother has a gold medal. ... You can't really explain it. Just knowing you're the best in the world, amazing, man."

— U.S. men's basketball post JaVale McGee, half of the first mother-son gold medal duo in U.S. Olympic history

"Not much."

— U.S. sprinter Ronnie Baker when asked about how much practice time the men's 4x100 relay team had before its first race, where it finished sixth and failed to advance to the final.

"I would say this was probably the best race ever, in Olympic history."

— U.S. hurdler Rai Benjamin, speaking about the men's 400-meter hurdles final. Benjamin finished second to Norway's Karsten Warholm in the race, and both men broke the previous world record.

"After the second hurdle, I was like '(expletive).' "

— Kyron McMaster of the British Virgin Islands, who finished fourth in the above 400-meter hurdles final, when asked if there was a point in the race when he knew it would be historically fast.

"When she lost the match, she felt very, very sad. So maybe this proposal will change the mentality of the situation."

— Argentinian fencing coach Lucas Saucedo on his decision to propose to María Belén Pérez Maurice after she lost her opening bout.

"No! Do you know who that girl is?"

—U.S. swimmer Erica Sullivan, when asked if she ever thought she could catch Katie Ledecky in the women's 1500-meter final. Ledecky won gold, Sullivan silver.

"My goal today was just to go in and for people to think who the hell is this girl?"

— U.S. marathoner Molly Seidel after winning a bronze medal

OWINGS MILLS, Md. – It’s been quite a couple of weeks for Lamar Jackson.

He tested positive for COVID-19 again, missing the beginning of training camp. While he was away, Buffalo’s Josh Allen – another quarterback from Jackson’s draft class – signed a big extension, raising more questions about how Jackson’s negotiations are going with the Ravens.

Now Jackson is practicing again, trying to make up for lost time while adjusting to some important new teammates.

Jackson spoke to the media Monday for the first time since returning from the COVID-19 list. He began practicing Saturday. Jackson’s positive COVID-19 test came right before the start of training camp. He also tested positive last season and missed a game.

“Just like last time probably – fatigued, if anything. I was sleeping a lot,” Jackson said. “But I’m glad to be back.”

Although Jackson was in good spirits Monday, he said the positive test was tough to take, especially given the timing.

“It was crazy. I was heartbroken, because I wasn’t looking forward to that at all – right before camp,” he said. “It was like, not again, not right now. But it’s over with.”

When asked if the Ravens have talked to him about getting vaccinated, he sounded noncommittal.

“I just got off the COVID list, so I’ve got to talk to my team doctors and try to see how they feel about it,” he said. “Keep learning as much as I can about it, and we’ll go from there.”

OPINION:Lamar Jackson's COVID-induced absence could prompt more NFL players to receive vaccine

Jackson said he tried to stay sharp by throwing in his backyard – his cousins served as receivers. Baltimore plays its first exhibition game Saturday night against New Orleans. The preseason games may not be all that significant for a player of Jackson’s stature, but he could use time on the field.

Baltimore added receiver Sammy Watkins in the offseason and drafted receiver Rashod Bateman, part of an effort to improve what was the lowest passing output in the league a season ago.

“Sammy makes my job a lot easier, and my job is to make his a lot easier,” Jackson said. “Even when we’re doing scramble drills and stuff like that, he’s fighting off defenders, getting open. I missed him in the end zone, little back shoulder, he was right there. I’m mad I missed him. I’m still mad right now.”

As for Allen’s contract, Jackson wasn’t saying much about how that might affect his negotiations.

“That’s good for him, but like I said, I’m not worried about that,” Jackson said. “I’m just trying to work on getting better right now. I just got off COVID, I’m worried about my teammates, and we’re trying to get somewhere. The time will come about that.”

Coach John Harbaugh also indicated there wasn’t anything new to report on that front.

“It’ll happen when it’s going to happen. It’s best for both sides to happen, both sides want it to happen,” he said. “There’s really not a hurry.”

NOTES: T Ronnie Stanley (ankle) was on the field at practice Monday. “It’s good that he’s out here. I think we were hoping for right around now,” Harbaugh said. “He’s certainly very much on schedule.” … Harbaugh is fine with the reduction in the number of preseason games from four to three this year, as the NFL prepares for a 17-game regular season. “I think three’s the right number of games,” Harbaugh said. “The fourth game really wasn’t a relevant game that way. You were just trying to get through that game and get to the regular season. So three will be good.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@NCAA investigations have something in common with a doctor placing a mark on an appendage to track the growth of an infection.

In both cases, the central question is “how high will it go?"

A reminder of that came Monday morning when Yahoo Sports broke the news that two more Arizona State assistant football coaches had been placed on administrative leave.

Receivers coach Prentice Gill and defensive backs coach Chris Hawkins joined former tight ends coach Adam Breneman as Sun Devil assistants collecting checks but not working.

All are entangled in an investigation into alleged recruiting violations that include recruits visiting campus during a dead period mandated by the NCAA because of Covid-19.

That means about one-third of the on-field staff ASU had at the beginning of the summer is not on the field less than a month before the start of the season. Or in the office.

That’s left coach Herm Edwards to explore his bench of coaches. His depth is being depleted.

PAC-20 CONFERENCE?:How a potential Pac/Big 12 merger could look

PRESEASON RANKINGS:How will college football coaches' poll shake out?

Edwards is next scheduled to meet with reporters on Tuesday and is likely to say he can’t say much about the “review,” the word he prefers over “investigation.”

All Edwards has said so far about the NCAA’s curiosity about how ASU does business is that it hasn’t been a distraction to anyone, including his players.

Coaches hate distractions, a trait usually revealed in the context of warnings to players to follow the rules.

As Bruce Arians once told his Cardinals players, don’t get tased in Miami during a weekend off.

In ASU’s case, it’s the coaches who are the distractions. And even the charismatic Edwards can't successfully pitch the “nothing to see here” approach to anyone with a brain and eyes.

Not when they watch practice and see former graduate assistant Bobby Wade coaching receivers instead of Gill. And former analyst Juston Wood coaching tight ends instead of Breneman. And former consultant/special advisor Donnie Henderson working with defensive backs in place of Hawkins.

There should be little confidence from the Sun Devil faithful that the investigation will stop here. Or take a hiatus until the most promising ASU football season in years is over.

The allegations are disturbing on multiple levels. The violations allegedly took place during a global pandemic and were committed by a program that played only four games because of it.

If proven true, the stupidity, brazenness and hypocrisy of the transgressions are astounding.

The Athletic has reported ASU hid recruits in a suite during a game last fall, according to a source, and brought a recruit through the backstairs of the football offices to meet Edwards.

Yahoo reported at least 30 athletes visited ASU during the dead period and coaches routinely “bumped into” recruits in the back stairwell. Many tours happened at night, according to the story.

As I wrote in June, if those allegations prove true, then Edwards, his staff and some further up the organization chart at ASU should be fired.

The reaction from some Sun Devil followers back then was, “Oh, everyone was doing it. We just got caught.”

That’s doubtful. But if true, it means that everyone else was a lot smarter about cheating than the Sun Devils, who reportedly left a trail of receipts, pictures and other evidence that an anonymous source sent to ASU’s compliance department.

And I don’t know about you, but the “everyone else is doing it” line never worked one time for me.

To think this ends with the departures of the Sun Devils’ three youngest coaches is naïve.

All three had severely limited experience at coaching, but were known as dynamic recruiters. They worked closely with associate head coach/defensive coordinator/recruiting coordinator Antonio Pierce, who was given all those titles by Edwards.

It’s hard to imagine three young coaches went rogue and arranged to have recruits visit during a dead period without the approval of one or more supervisors.

Pierce might have more titles than anyone else in college football, and it’s fair to wonder if he will have any of them for much longer.

ASU President Michael Crow is intently following the investigation and made the decision to place the three coaches on administrative leave, in consultation with senior vice president and general counsel Jose Cardenas.

Those three coaches won’t return, but my guess that doesn't eliminate the infection inside the football program. The question now is when, not if, others will follow.

NORWICH, England (AP) — U.S. men's national soccer team forward Josh Sargent completed his move to English Premier League club Norwich City FC by signing a four-year contract on Monday.

The 21-year-old Sargent arrives from German Bundesliga team Werder Bremen, where he had played since turning professional in 2018.

Sargent scored seven goals in 35 games for Bremen last season, before the team was relegated from the Bundesliga. He netted two more goals in two matches this season in 2. Bundesliga.

“I’ve always wanted to play in the Premier League, so it’s a very exciting opportunity for me,” Sargent told club media.

Neither team disclosed the transfer fee but British media reported it to be around 9.5 million euros ($11 million).

“I like to think my main position is a number nine, but I am also very versatile,” he said. “No matter where I play, everyone can expect that I will give my all, my 100 percent and hopefully score some goals.”

Canaries manager Daniel Farke said Sargent has “lots of potential.”

“He's a very good striking option for us but is someone who can also play on the wing,” Farke said. “He has pace and is also good with his head. We know he is always there with a big workload and has a fantastic character.”

Newly promoted Norwich, which hosts Liverpool in the season opener on Saturday (12:30 p.m. ET on NBC), signed midfielder Milot Rashica from Bremen earlier this summer.

“We think we have a player in Josh who can contribute and develop into a top goalscorer on Premier League level,” said Farke, who is German.

For Bremen, Sargent recorded the fastest goal by a debutant in the club’s history. His farewell was less celebrated, however.

Bremen sporting director Frank Baumann said Monday it was “disappointing” that the American had asked not to play in the German Cup game on Saturday, after the transfer deal had been reached. Bremen lost the game. He added: "We wish Josh all the best for the future."

Other teams expressed interest but Baumann said they fell short of Bremen's target, which had been reported to be around 10 million euros ($11.7 million).

Sargent made his international debut in 2018 and has scored five goals in 16 appearances.

American Joe Scally shines on Gladbach debut in German Cup

American teen Joe Scally made his debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach on Monday when he helped the team to a 1-0 win over former heavyweight Kaiserslautern in the first round of the German Cup.

The 18-year-old Scally, who joined Gladbach from New York City FC in January, shone despite playing on the left of defense. He usually likes to play on the right. Scally played in Patrick Herrmann, who hit the post before the break, and made a good case for his Bundesliga debut against Bayern Munich in the league-opener on Friday.

Lars Stindl’s early goal was enough for Gladbach to beat Kaiserslautern and give new coach Adi Hütter a winning start on his debut.

The home team made it difficult for Gladbach despite playing in the third division. Kaiserslautern, one of the founding members of the Bundesliga, won the last of its four German championships in 1998.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fred would be the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.

The chance the disturbance forms into a tropical storm is high at 90% through 48 hours.

Most of Florida remains in the system's five-day forecast cone.

SARASOTA, Fla. — Tropical Storm Fred developed just south of Puerto Rico late Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center confirmed, heading for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, with forecasters warning that its heavy rains could cause dangerous flooding and mudslides.

After a quiet month of no named storms in the region, Fred became the sixth of the Atlantic hurricane season as expected late Tuesday and tropical storm warnings were already in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

“The most important thing today is preparation,” said Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi. “I am not going to minimize the potential impact of this event … we expect a lot of rain.”

Florida could be in the storm's path, but forecasters said it was too early to determine the exact track.

Data from the aircraft and surface observations indicate the disturbance gained some strength Tuesday night, with maximum sustained winds near 40 mph with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is forecast overnight before Fred reaches eastern Dominican Republic on Wednesday morning.

Fred was the first named storm since Hurricane Elsa dissipated one month ago on July 9.

Gradual strengthening was forecast, and the disturbance was expected to become a tropical storm Tuesday night, the center said.

The disturbance is expected to pass near or over the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico late Tuesday and early Wednesday, be near or over Hispaniola on Wednesday and be near the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands on Thursday. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic.

Heavy rain is likely over the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, which could lead to flash, urban and small stream flooding and potential mudslides. The greatest threat for flooding will be across the eastern and southeastern portions of Puerto Rico.

Tropical storm conditions are possible elsewhere along the northern coasts of the Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, the Turks and Caicos, and the southeastern Bahamas beginning late Wednesday.

The system could intensify once it reaches the waters south of Florida or the eastern Gulf of Mexico by this weekend, forecasters said. But that path is subject to change depending on wind shear and whether the storm tracks over water or land.

"The system is being guided along to the west-northwest by the circulation around a large area of high pressure over the central Atlantic," AccuWeather hurricane expert Dan Kottlowski said.

Florida and the Keys could be in the system's path. This scenario could unfold if the high-pressure area weakens and allows the system to turn more to the north, Kottlowski said.

The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be active, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in an updated forecast last week: 15 to 21 named storms could develop; seven to 10 could be hurricanes.

An average season spawns seven hurricanes and peaks in August, September and October. If predictions hold true, this year will be a record sixth consecutive year of above-normal activity.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dak Prescott’s hunger to play football is insatiable, Micah Parsons’ hunger for mid-practice snacks is not satisfied, Ezekiel Elliott needs help wrapping birthday gifts and Jerry Jones takes notes with a No. 2 pencil.

The season premiere Tuesday night of the Dallas Cowboys’ third appearance on “Hard Knocks” had no shortage of banter, quirks and expletives.

The “Hard Knocks” premiere shed light on Prescott’s return from a gruesome ankle injury and subsequent development of a shoulder strain. In short: The Cowboys’ $40 million quarterback would not stop working ... and worked so hard he suffered an overuse injury related to the latissimus muscle in his throwing shoulder. Prescott has not meaningfully thrown for two weeks since exiting the Cowboys’ first padded practice. Cowboys doctors consulted Texas Rangers and New York Yankees trainers for advice, “Hard Knocks” footage confirmed.

Head coach Mike McCarthy, mics revealed, needed just a single word to express his emotion from the sideline that afternoon. It rhymed with “duck.”

And yet, Tuesday’s debut episode featured far more humor than it did frustration from injury. Prescott’s friendship with draft classmate Elliott peaked as Elliott aimed to surprise his quarterback with a gift-wrapped luggage bag ... only for Prescott to knock on Elliott’s hotel room door at an inopportune moment, just as Elliott was preparing the gift, complete with an apt card reading “YOU MUST BE REALLY EXHAUSTED FROM KICKING SO MUCH ASS.”

Elliott’s response when Prescott interrupted the YouTube video-guided gift-wrapping session? The running back slammed the door in the face of his QB.

“What you want, man?” said Elliott, who would also help his offensive linemen smash a cake in Prescott’s face on his 28th birthday. “You trying to ruin the surprise.”

Here are five more key highlights from the debut episode:

1. Dak Prescott’s work ethic

“Hard Knocks” took viewers behind the scenes of Prescott’s initial maniacal training, including his “575” GPS measurement that trainers and coaches ruled too high. Prescott’s response to the pitch count: “I’m not coming out this [expletive]. I sat last year enough. … I don’t know why the [expletive] they took me out of them reps for.

“I’ll let y’all know if I’m [expletive] sore or something’s bothering me.”

Days later, after his shoulder strain, he would need to.

2. The Micah Parsons-Dan Quinn dynamic

Parsons’ personality has been on display since the day the Cowboys selected the linebacker 12th overall in the 2021 NFL draft. “Hard Knocks” further showed what’s on his mind, from mid-practice snacks – “Penn State used to have snacks at practice. I loved that. … The lion’s always hungry,” Parsons says – to special tutelage from his defensive coordinator. Footage showed Parsons beat on one deep route, then diving for an interception shortly later. Parsons displayed the ability to learn and grow quickly.

“That was your first time on the run away from you. That’s why you’ve got to [expletive] go,” Quinn told him. Parsons explained how he was caught up on an initial play before discerning how to break free on the second.

The coach-player dynamic continued into the Hall of Fame Game, in which Parsons flashed ball hawk skills to recover a fumble. Still, Quinn called down from the booth to alert Parsons his opportunities were over after 11 defensive snaps.

“Be super [expletive] aggressive,” Quinn tells Parsons, who answers a corded phone on the sideline. Parsons implores: “Can I get one more (series) for tonight?” Quinn declines. “This sucks,” says Parsons who then calculates nine collective hours of sitting awaiting him on the sideline, in buses and on airplanes.

3. Inside look at Mike McCarthy’s motivation

The “Hard Knocks” debut captured Mike McCarthy’s Austin Powers-themed footage introducing “Mojo Moments” to Cowboys practice, in which unprompted situational work befell the offense and defense. But perhaps McCarthy’s mojo moment of the debut came when he compelled players to embrace the work ethic a Super Bowl champion team must exhibit.

“It’s hard not to reflect on what we went through last year,” McCarthy began, referencing the Cowboys’ 6-10 campaign in his debut season. “[Expletive] last year.”

McCarthy demanded players not “waste each other’s time” in the training camp that would set the tone for their 17-game 2021 slate.

“Charlie [expletive]-around, he doesn’t work here, OK?” McCarthy said. “High school Harry, get his ass out the [expletive] door. This is about winning. It’s about winning the world championship. Period. Period. Because that’s all that matters.”

McCarthy, who won Super Bowl XLV as head coach of the Green Bay Packers told players that winning records and postseason success aren’t enough.

“And once you hold that [expletive] trophy up, I’m going to tell you: It’s [expletive] heavier than you think it is.”

4. John Fassel’s ... vasectomy?

Coaches are teachers after all, right? “Hard Knocks” cleverly opened the scene with a note that players on 90-man training camp rosters always worry about getting cut. Then, the scene dissolves into special teams coordinator and de facto minister of fun John Fassel taking questions about his vasectomy.

“Did you lose your drive?” asked one player, whose face the camera crew did not show. “Oh no,” Fassel quipped immediately to a room full of laughter. “Everything is exactly the same.” After further details, a special teams contributor told Fassel: “Coach, you a soldier.”

Tune into HBO Max for a further anatomy lesson.

5. Dak Prescott, wingman of the week

If viewers shut off “Hard Knocks” before the credits finished rolling, they’d have missed some of Prescott’s best lines. Prescott, knowing he was miced up for “Hard Knocks,” asks what appears to be an equipment assistant whether he has any girlfriends the assistant would like to shout out via the mic.

“Just making sure,” Prescott tells a blonde youth with a Gatorade towel draped over his shoulder. “I can help you with your love life if you need it.”

The assistant’s response: “Yeah, I need all the help I can get it.”

Episode 2 of “Hard Knocks: The Dallas Cowboys” debuts on HBO and HBO Max on Tuesday, Aug. 17 at 10 p.m. ET.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Whether it's politics or college football, polls are still an inexact science that try to predict outcomes.

So while there are 25 teams able to celebrate their inclusion in the preseason USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll this season, there is also reason for hesitation. Many of them won't be there when the season ends.

In the past three seasons, an average of 10 teams ranked in the preseason missed out on the final poll. That's only a 60% success rate. That doesn't account for other teams that started high and finished lower in the Top 25.

So the question is not if there are overrated teams in this year's preseason poll, but which ones are overrated? Five teams immediately come to mind.

No. 7 Notre Dame

Yes, the Fighting Irish have not come close in their two College Football Playoff appearances in the past three years, but if you take a step back you can appreciate their success in that span. Brian Kelly's team has gone 33-5 and finished in the top five twice. It's not a surprise to see them firmly in the preseason top 10 this year.

However, this looks like a step-back year with so many issues to resolve. Wisconsin transfer Jack Coan is expected to be the replacement for outgoing quarterback Ian Book, who led Notre Dame to those two playoff berths. After missing last season with injury, Coan has to get settled in quickly as the leader of the offense. Around him some receivers need to be developed and the offensive line has major holes to fill.

The defense brings in new coordinator Marcus Freeman from Cincinnati, but loses star Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and two of of its other top five tacklers. This will be another good group. It just isn't enough to carry the team against tough opponents with the offense also regressing. Expect an upset or two to knock the Irish out of the playoff, especially with a tough schedule in the first half that includes Cincinnati and Wisconsin.

No. 14 Southern California

There are two ways to look at the Trojans. They went undefeated in the regular season and lost a close Pac-12 championship game to Oregon. Not bad. Looking beneath the surface, however, they played just six games during the pandemic season and three of their five wins were by a combined 10 points that required fourth-quarter comebacks.

Can they continue to win those close games this season? The law of averages would say no. Even with QB Kedon Slovis, one of the preseason favorites for the Heisman Trophy, leading the offense, USC still has questions at running back, receiver and offensive line to answer. The ground attack is a particular area for improvement after averaging just 97.3 yards per game.

The defense benefitted from creating 16 turnovers that helped hide some of its issues. Talanoa Hufanga contributed four interceptions to the takeaways, but the Pac-12 defensive player of the year won't be part of this year's secondary. Up front, the run defense will need to get better. The one saving grace for the Trojans is a schedule that avoids Washington and Oregon from the North division, but the South is super competitive with Arizona State, UCLA and Utah nipping at their heels. There won't be any unbeaten regular season this year and there could be some unexpected defeats.

THE POLL: From No. 1 Alabama to No. 25 Mississippi

ANALYSIS: Closer look at what the Top 25 teams have to do to contend

FIVE BIGGEST SNUBS: Michigan headlines list of teams that didn't crack Top 25

No. 16 Miami (Florida)

The concerns for the Hurricanes start at quarterback. D'Eriq King went down with a knee injury in the bowl game and his status for the opener against Alabama is uncertain. There's no experience behind King, so that's something to watch even if he is healthy for Week 1. More will be needed from the running game to keep defenses honest and take some of the pressure off King. Charleston Rambo is projected as a starting receiver, but arrives from Oklahoma after a disappointing campaign.

Worries on defense led coach Manny Diaz to take over calling plays for the unit this season. His first order of business is to sort out the front seven that lost its top pass rushers and needs to be better against the run. The biggest challenge will be improvement against top competition. In its three toughest ACC games in 2020, the Hurricanes allowed 145 points and were blown out in two of them.

While a potential loss in the opener to the Crimson Tide wouldn't be a killer, there's other difficult games against Michigan State and Appalachian State that could get the season off on the wrong foot before the ACC program starts.

No. 19 Texas

Expectations are always high for the Longhorns, so don't expect much of a honeymoon for coach Steve Sarkisian. Difficulties come right away.

First, he must figure out his quarterback situation with four-year starter Sam Ehlinger off to the NFL. Neither Casey Thompson nor Hudson Card have seen significant action except for Thompson's impressive second half of last year's bowl game. Add to the equation that Sarkisian's offense isn't an exact fit for what was run the past four years under Tom Herman and there are some expected growing pains. The problem is that there isn't much time for that with No. 23 Louisiana-Lafayette visiting in the opener and a trip to Arkansas the following week.

New defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski has his own challenges. Texas hasn't broken the top 50 in scoring defense in the past three years. With all the other Big 12 contenders returning starting quarterbacks, more will be expected out of this group to possibly contend in the league.

No. 25 Mississippi

If only offense wins games then it's possible the Rebels could finish much higher than their starting point after raking third in total offense last season. The problem is that defense is also an important factor.

Ole Miss allowed more than 38 points per game and finished 117th in scoring defense last season. Though several starters return, this is a case where maybe that isn't such a good thing. Major improvement will be needed to slow opponents.

Even on offense, there are some concerns. QB Matt Corral has to limit mistakes after 14 interceptions, including six in a loss to Arkansas. Top receiver Elijah Moore will not be easily replaced. And the SEC West should be much stronger with LSU and Auburn rebounding. The road isn't going to be easy for the Rebels.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Serena and Venus Williams are the latest stars to withdraw from the 2021 Western & Southern Open, the tournament, which kicks off Saturday at Ohio's Lindner Family Tennis Center, announced Tuesday evening.

The Williams sisters join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as high-profile stars who've all withdrawn.

Serena Williams, a two-time W&S Open champion, said the leg injury she suffered last month at Wimbledon is still bothering her.

“Unfortunately, I will not be playing in the Western & Southern Open next week as I am still in recovery from my leg injury at Wimbledon. I will miss all of my fans in Cincinnati whom I look forward to seeing every summer. I plan to be back on the court very soon," Serena said in a W&S Open press release.

Venus, whose reason for withdrawing was undisclosed, spoke to The Cincinnati Enquirer recently about how excited she was to return to Cincinnati for the eighth time.

Sofia Kenin, a 2019 semifinalist in Cincinnati, also withdrew from the field Tuesday with a foot injury.

“Unfortunately I had to make the difficult decision to withdraw from the Western & Southern Open next week," Kenin said in a statement. "I am rehabbing well in hopes to play the US Open later this month. I feel another week of recovery is necessary. I want to thank the USTA for all their efforts in holding the event during such challenging times. Best of luck to all the players.”

The W&S Open also announced Tuesday several other wild card entries into the field. Americans Jenson Brooksby, Brandon Nakashima and Frances Tiafoe have been awarded men’s wild cards, and so have Bernada Pera, Samantha Stosur and Jil Teichmann in the women’s field.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The preseason USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll, with 2020 records and outlooks for the Top 25. All times Eastern.

No. 1 Alabama (13-0)

Points: 1,621 (63 first-place votes). Previous ranking: 1. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. No. 16 Miami (Florida) in Atlanta (ABC, 3:30).

Outlook: There hasn’t been this kind of quarterback uncertainty for the Crimson Tide since Jalen Hurts won the job as a true freshman in 2016. Bryce Young seems destined to be the program’s latest great signal caller, but he threw just 22 passes last year as a freshman. Even if he has the expected growing pains of a first-year starter, there’s plenty of talent around him as Nick Saban looks for his seventh national title at the school. John Metchie III looks like the school’s next great receiver. The offensive line again should be excellent. The defense is full of talent and will benefit at linebacker from Tennessee transfer Henry To’o To’o.

No. 2 Clemson (10-2)

Points: 1,508. Previous ranking: 3. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. No. 5 Georgia at Charlotte, North Carolina (ABC, 7:30).

Outlook: The Tigers once again are heavily favored to win the ACC. We won’t have to wait long to see how they might stack up against other playoff contenders as they’ll face Georgia in the marquee game of opening weekend. The quarterback job is in good hands with D.J. Uiagalelei. Travis Etienne’s versatility out of the backfield will be missed, but Lyn-J Dixon can get the tough yards. Myles Murphy and Bryan Bresee will anchor the defensive line, which figures to be the strength of the unit.

No. 3 Oklahoma (9-2)

Points: 1,481 (2 first-place votes). Previous ranking: 6. Opens: Sept. 4 at Tulane (ABC, noon).

Outlook: The Sooners won their sixth Big 12 title in a row during a rebuilding year that saw QB Spencer Rattler struggle early in his first year as a starter. He enters this season as a Heisman Trophy favorite. A talented group of skill players were bolstered by transfers, including running backs Eric Gray of Tennessee and Kevontre Bradford of LSU. Wanya Morris – also from Tennessee – joins to help solidify an offensive line that was inconsistent. What really makes this team capable of breaking through in the playoff is the defense. Gone are the days of wondering if it is good enough. The Sooners boast an impressive front seven, led by Nik Bonitto and Perrion Winfrey, that stops the run and pressures the passer.

No. 4 Ohio State (7-1)

Points: 1,435. Previous ranking: 2. Opens: Sept. 2 at Minnesota (Fox, 8).

Outlook: A national championship always is the goal for the Buckeyes, though it's harder to peg their prospects without knowing exactly what Ryan Day will get at quarterback. (C.J. Stroud is the heavy favorite to replace Justin Fields.) But it's no surprise to see Ohio State overflowing with talent across the board on offense, especially at wide receiver with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson. What may determine the Buckeyes' 2021 season is whether the defense can improve along the back seven; all three starters must be replaced at linebacker.

No. 5 Georgia (8-2)

Points: 1,386. Previous ranking: 7. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. No. 2 Clemson at Charlotte, North Carolina (ABC, 7:30).

Outlook: The Bulldogs will benefit from quarterback JT Daniels and his strong run as the starter over the second half of last season. There is tremendous talent and depth at the skill positions and the front seven on defense, especially if wide receiver George Pickens can recover from a spring ACL injury. Kirby Smart countered the loss of Pickens with the transfer of Arik Gilbert from LSU. Concerns in the defensive backfield also were addressed through the transfer portal as Derion Kendrick joined from Clemson to provide a major boost at cornerback. Now Georgia just needs to prove itself by finally defeating Alabama and winning the SEC title.

No. 6 Texas A&M (9-1)

Points: 1,286. Previous ranking: 4. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. Kent State (ESPNU, 8).

Outlook: Is this the year the Aggies make the playoff? The disappointment of coming close last year could motivate them to leave no doubt in 2021, though that likely would demand a win against Alabama and a West division championship. A&M must first find a replacement for quarterback Kellen Mond, a four-year starter. Haynes King looks to be the favorite but Zach Calzada is still in the running. The rebuilding of the offensive line is key with RB Isaiah Spiller leading a talented group of skill people. DL DeMarvin Leal and DB Myles Jones are part of a defense full of talented recruits who could be lethal.

No. 7 Notre Dame (10-2)

Points: 1,139. Previous ranking: 5. Opens: Sept. 5 at Florida State (ABC, 7:30).

Outlook: In hopes of seamlessly replacing QB Ian Book, the Irish turned to Wisconsin transfer Jack Coan, who was missed last season due to injury after 18 starts for the Badgers. Should Cohen provide stability, the offense looks to be on solid footing with RBs Kyren Williams and David Tyree carrying the load. The biggest concern is an offensive line that lacks experience. DB Kyle Hamilton is the star of the defense that brings in coordinator Marcus Freeman from Cincinnati. How quickly that unit gels will be key as the offense finds its way against a difficult early schedule.

No. 8 Iowa State (9-3)

Points: 1,131. Previous ranking: 9. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. Northern Iowa.

Outlook: The hypothesis may seem strange, but it’s hard to argue against the Cyclones being among the top College Football Playoff contenders with Breece Hall and Mike Rose returning as Big 12 offensive and defensive players of the year, respectively. QB Brock Purdy enters his senior season as one of the country’s better quarterbacks, but he still needs to limit turnovers. Several veterans stayed to bolster a defense that led the conference against the run and was second in total defense. Now that they’re ranked the highest they've been in the preseason poll, how do the Cyclones adjust to big expectations?

No. 9 North Carolina (8-4)

Points: 999. Previous ranking: 17. Opens: Sept. 3 at Virginia Tech (ESPN, 6).

Outlook: Coming off an 8-4 campaign and with prolific passer Sam Howell back in Chapel Hill, the Tar Heels are the popular pick to win the ACC Coastal and possibly give Clemson a run for the league title. A lot of Howell’s weapons are gone, but Tennessee transfer Ty Chandler could emerge quickly as the featured running back. Tomon Fox, an outside linebacker/rush end hybrid, has next-level talent, but the defensive secondary must tighten things up to compete with elite aerial attacks.

No. 10 Cincinnati (9-1)

Points: 979. Previous ranking: 8. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. Miami (Ohio).

Outlook: Matching last season’s perfect regular season and major bowl appearance will be a challenge for the Bearcats, who have a lot of returning talent but also some question marks. The headliner again will be dynamic QB Desmond Ridder, who’ll be rejoined by primary targets WR Michael Young and TE Josh Whyle. RB Gerrid Doaks is gone, so Jerome Ford will become the main ball carrier behind a line that must replace both starting tackles. The defensive backfield, featuring CBs Coby Bryant and Ahmad Gardner, will be solid. Road wins against Indiana and Notre Dame could put this team in the playoff picture come December.

No. 11 Florida (8-4)

Points: 870. Previous ranking: 12. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. Florida Atlantic (SEC Network, 7:30).

Outlook: Emory Jones replaces Kyle Trask at quarterback, but don’t expect the Gators to continue to air things out as they did last year. Jones is more of a dual threat and his running ability will provide a different dimension. Focusing more on the ground should take some pressure off a defense that was statistically the worst in the program’s history. There’s some top-level talent with DL Zachary Carter and DB Kaiir Elam plus the linebacking duo of Ventrell Miller and Brenton Cox. The pressure is on coordinator Todd Grantham to put the pieces together.

No. 12 Oregon (4-3)

Points: 842. Previous ranking: Not ranked. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. Fresno State (Pac-12 Network, 2).

Outlook: The defending Pac-12 champion Ducks have the league’s highest starting point, and the opportunities are there to aim even higher. That would mean an upset at Ohio State on Sept. 11 in addition to handling all challengers in the conference, but it’s at least conceivable. Anthony Brown takes over at QB with Tyler Shough off to Texas Tech. The RB tandem of Travis Dye and C.J. Verdell are back, and all three should benefit from an experienced line. The late start to the 2020 season didn’t help the talented defense come together, so Kayvon Thibodeaux and Co. should have more success this year with a full camp.

No. 13 LSU (5-5)

Points: 664. Previous ranking: Not ranked. Opens: Sept. 4 at UCLA (Fox, 8:30).

Outlook: Opt-outs and injuries last season doomed the Tigers, who cratered on defense, forcing them to cut ties with coordinator Bo Pelini after just one season. His replacement, Daronte Jones, spent the last five seasons in the NFL. All-America cornerback Derek Stingley Jr.'s impact as a shutdown defender should allow the secondary to thrive. The situation at quarterback could determine whether LSU can contend in the SEC. Myles Brennan was expected to compete with Max Johnson, but Brennan was lost to arm surgery, leaving Johnson and true freshman Garrett Nussmeier as the only scholarship signal callers until Brennan recovers.

No. 14 Southern California (5-1)

Points: 655. Previous ranking: 21. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. San Jose State (Pac-12 Network, 5).

Outlook: The Trojans will enter as the Pac-12 South favorites, thanks in part to a favorable cross-divisional schedule that avoids Oregon and Washington from the North. They face a challenging slate nonetheless, and some close calls last year suggest they aren’t likely to run away with it. QB Kedon Slovis is back, but he’ll need to develop new targets behind top returnee Drake London. The defense must generate more pressure, and DEs Drake Jackson and Nick Figueroa are capable of delivering.

No. 15 Wisconsin (4-3)

Points: 654. Previous ranking: Not ranked. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. No. 20 Penn State (Fox, noon).

Outlook: Pressed into action early by a preseason injury, QB Graham Mertz struggled in his first year as a starter. He will be helped by the healthy return of receivers Danny Davis and Kendric Pryor. More important is the return of a usually dominating Badgers offensive line that struggled to establish the run. The defense ranked in the top 10 in scoring for the second consecutive year. The unit is led by a strong linebacker contingent that includes Nick Herbig and Jack Sanborn. Up front, there's some replacement needed from a line that held opponents to 3.4 yards per carry and just two scores in 2020.

No. 16 Miami (Florida) (8-3)

Points: 575. Previous ranking: 22. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. No. 1 Alabama in Atlanta (ABC, 3:30).

Outlook: Whether the Hurricanes live up to their preseason projection largely will depend on the health of QB D’Eriq King, who suffered a torn ACL in Miami’s bowl game. He expects to be ready, but won’t have time to ease back into game shape with the ‘Canes opener coming against Alabama. His top target, Mike Harley, is back, and Oklahoma transfer Charleston Rambo’s arrival should provide a good complement. There are holes to fill on defense, but DB Bubba Bolden returns to anchor the secondary.

No. 17 Indiana (6-2)

Points: 573. Previous ranking: 13. Opens: Sept. 4 at No. 18 Iowa (BTN, 3:30).

Outlook: The ability for the Hoosiers to build upon their landmark season that saw them beat Penn State, Michigan and Michigan State starts with the recovery of QB Michael Penix. The senior tore his ACL last November and is hopeful of being ready for a tough opener against Iowa. Ty Fryfogle could emerge as the Big Ten's top receiver, while Southern Cal transfer Stephen Carr is expected to provide some needed juice to the running game. The defense that was stingy last year returns LB Micah McFadden and several other important contributors.

No. 18 Iowa (6-2)

Points: 554. Previous ranking: 15. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. No. 17 Indiana (BTN, 3:30).

Outlook: After losing their first two games by a combined five points, the Hawkeyes were one of the hottest teams in the country at the end of last season. How does that momentum carry over? QB Spencer Petras must be more productive in the passing game to open up the offense for RB Tyler Goodson. Iowa is replacing three starters on a line that keyed the stiffest run defense in the Big Ten (2.8 yards allowed per carry). The new group will build around a good one in DL Zach VanValkenburg.

No. 19 Texas (7-3)

Points: 427. Previous ranking: 20. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. No. 23 Louisiana-Lafayette (Fox, 4:30).

Outlook: After four frustrating years under Tom Herman, Texas moved on by hiring Steve Sarkisian after his impressive stint as Alabama’s offensive coordinator. Optimism runs high in Austin with the hope the Longhorns will look like Crimson Tide’s high-powered offense, but that will take some time. RB Bijan Robinson should be an elite performer as long as he gets enough touches, something that didn’t happen last year. Casey Thompson and Hudson Card have the inside track on filling the shoes of Sam Ehlinger, a four-year starter at quarterback who leaves a leadership void. Whomever wins the job must be up to speed quickly with an early schedule that starts with challenging non-conference games against Louisiana-Lafayette and Arkansas.

No. 20 Penn State (4-5)

Points: 422. Previous ranking: Not ranked. Opens: Sept. 4 at No. 15 Wisconsin (Fox, noon).

Outlook: A disastrous start to the season saw the Nittany Lions lose their first five games. The results mirrored the play of QB Sean Clifford, who got his footing late in the year when the team won its last four. In an attempt to improve the offense, Mike Yurcich was brought in as the coordinator. He'll have an impressive stable of running backs and standout WR Jahan Dotson to work with. The defense will be boosted by the arrival of Temple transfer Arnold Ebiketie on the line and strong returners in the secondary.

No. 21 Washington (3-1)

Points: 404. Previous ranking: Not ranked. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. Montana (Pac-12, 8).

Outlook: The Jimmy Lake era in Seattle got off to a difficult but promising start as the Huskies were only able to get in four games during the pandemic season. The offense should be more explosive this year with plenty of experienced people, starting with an intact line featuring standout OL Jaxson Kirkland. Dylan Morris will likely retain the quarterback job, and there will be a number of options behind him to take handoffs. LB Edefuan Ulofoshio will be the centerpiece of the defense that should be among the Pac-12’s best.

No. 22 Oklahoma State (8-3)

Points: 216. Previous ranking: 19. Opens: Sept. 4 vs. Missouri State, (Big 12 Network, 7).

Outlook: Everything seemed in place for the Cowboys to make their first Big 12 title game last season before injuries hit. QB Spencer Sanders had an up-and-down campaign dimming some of the high expectations for him. He will be joined by Dezmon Jackson, who looks to be another in the line of the program’s talented running backs. LB Malcolm Rodriguez and the secondary tandem of Tre Sterling and Kolby Harvell-Peel lead a veteran defense that could be a strength and may be the difference in changing this season's outcome.

No. 23 Louisiana-Lafayette (10-1)

Points: 153. Previous ranking: 16. Opens: Sept. 4 at No. 19 Texas (Fox, 4:30).

Outlook: Perhaps the biggest win of the offseason following the Ragin’ Cajuns’ historic 2020 campaign is that coach Billy Napier is still around. After pulling off last year’s stunner at Iowa State, they won’t sneak up on Texas, but they’re well positioned to win their division in the Sun Belt. Dual threat QB Levi Lewis is back along with his entire offensive line. The defense that snagged 16 interceptions regains the services of DB Bralen Trahan.

No. 24 Coastal Carolina (11-1)

Points: 150. Previous ranking: 14. Opens: Sept. 2 vs. The Citadel.

Outlook: One of the feel-good stories of the strange 2020 season, the Chanticleers, now entering their fifth season in the Sun Belt, look to produce an encore after running the table in the conference. Most of the key contributors on the offensive side are back, including breakout star QB Grayson McCall. WR Jaivon Heiligh and TE Isaiah Likely also return. Leading rusher C.J. Marable is the lone key departure. The defense returns largely intact as well, with the exception of DE Tarron Jackson. The strength will be the LB corps featuring Silas Kelly and Teddy Gallagher.

No. 25 Mississippi (5-5)

Points: 149. Previous ranking: Not ranked. Opens: Sept. 6 vs. Louisville in Atlanta (ESPN, 8).

Outlook: The defense needs to make up major ground to join an offense that already is one of the most electric in the SEC. Such is the challenge for coach Lane Kiffin in his second season that follows an entertaining debut that brought points for both sides. Two areas in immediate need of improvement: the pass rush and forcing turnovers. Matt Corral gives Kiffin possibly the best QB in the SEC. You know this team is going to put up points at a high rate. The Rebels, however, need to do it more efficiently to support their defense.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hall of Fame goaltender Tony Esposito, who starred for the Chicago Blackhawks for 15 seasons, died Tuesday of pancreatic cancer. He was 78.

Esposito began his career with the Montreal Canadiens but moved to the Blackhawks in in an intraleague draft his second season. He won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in 1970 after recording 15 shutouts, which remains a modern-day NHL record.

He won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalie in 1970, 1972 and 1974 and was a five-time All-Star.

He and his brother, Phil, starred in the 1970s, with Tony leading the league in shutouts three times and Phil terrorizing opposing goalies as a six-time NHL leading goal scorer. Phil scored two goals against Tony during goalie's first start with Montreal in December 1968.

Known for his quick glove and as a pioneer of the butterfly goaltending style, Tony Esposito had eight seasons of 30 or more wins (seven in a row) and finished with 423 wins, which ranks 10th all time.

"He was tireless, reliable and a great teammate," Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz said in a statement. "If you were a new player in Chicago, Tony and Marilyn always made you feel welcome and comfortable. Rookies were invited to their home for countless dinners, and when the Espositos held their annual Christmas party, everybody associated with the Blackhawks was there."

Esposito's 418 victories and 74 shutouts with Chicago remain team records. He helped the Blackhawks reach the Stanley Cup Final in 1971 and 1973, and his No. 35 was retired by the team in 1988.

He played for Canada in the Summit Series against the Soviet Union in 1972 and played for the United States in the Canada Cup in 1981 after gaining U.S. citizenship.

Esposito was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1988, joining his brother, who entered in 1984.

After he retired in 1984, he was general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1988-89 and part of the following season before being replaced by Craig Patrick. He drafted Mark Recchi and traded for goalie Tom Barrasso.

He later became chief scout for the Tampa Bay Lightning, a team that the Esposito brothers helped found.

"His role cannot be understated," the Lightning said in a statement. "Tony was a true legend on the ice and off of it."

The Blackhawks named him a team ambassador in 2008.

"He was born for that role, too, as he reached out – whether by request or on his own – to fans, sponsors, and friends of our team," Wirtz said. "He rejected thousands of pucks in his first job; he never said no in his second job."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Simone Biles defended her stance on abortion, claiming she was "misconstrued" for a social media post in which she revealed she is pro-choice.

The Olympic star and recent silver and bronze medalist at the Tokyo Games vented over an Instagram story Monday night after she felt like her stance was framed as not caring about children in foster care. Biles herself grew up in the system.

Biles originally put a callout on her Instagram story to solicit "unpopular opinions," one of which was that "abortion is wrong." In response, Biles originally wrote: "I already know this is going to start the biggest argument & may even lose followers BUT I'm very much pro-choice," Biles answered on Instagram. "Your body. your choice.

"Also for everyone gonna say 'just put it up for adoption' it's not that easy & coming from someone who was in the foster care system TRUST me foster care system is broken & it's TOUGH especially on the kids & young adults who age out & adoption is expensive ... im just saying."

Biles later claimed that a Twitter user's comment "misconstrued" her stance and that her words were twisted to "spew hate."

She responded to a since-deleted tweet by a follower with a rebuttal: "DO NOT misconstrue my words. That is not at all what I implied. I did NOT say I support to abort rather than to put them through the foster care system. What I did imply is that you should not control someone elses body/decision. Let’s be real what you care about is control…

"I have forever & will continue to support foster kids. AS I WAS ONE. I’ve been an advocate for foster kids and the system but you wouldn’t know that because you don’t follow me, you just like to open your mouth."

Biles, the winningest female gymnast of all-time with four gold medals from the Rio Games, captivated the Tokyo Games this past month when she made the decision to withdraw from several events in which she was the favorite to win gold. Biles cited putting her mental and physical health first, noting that she was experiencing the twisties, a disorienting condition that can lead to serious injury.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Associated Press

RICHMOND, Va. — A Virginia Union freshman football player has died after collapsing during football practice over the weekend. He was 19.

Quandarius Wilburn’s death was announced by the Division II university.

The 6-foot-2, 230-pound defensive end collapsed Sunday during a conditioning session, according to a letter the university’s president sent to students and staff Monday.

The letter said Wilburn was taken to VCU Medical Center, where he later died, news outlets reported. The football team had spent a full day together – breakfast, church and lunch before the workout, the letter said.

“This is a heartbreaking loss for our campus community,” Hakim Lucas, the university’s president and CEO, wrote. “I want to personally encourage each of you to keep Mr. Wilburn’s family in your prayers, as well as the VUU athletics department.”

The school said it is ready to support families and students as they “work to process this devastating loss.”

Wilburn was from Wadley, Georgia. He graduated this year from Jefferson County High School in Louisville, Georgia.

The Panthers did not play football last fall or in the spring because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team is to open its season Sept. 4 at Hampton.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cameron Burrell, the son of two Olympic gold medalists who became an NCAA track and field champion, died Monday at 26.

No cause of death was given.

Burrell starred at the University of Houston, where his father, Leroy, is the longtime track and field coach.

"My family is extremely saddened with the loss of our son, Cameron, last night," Leroy Burrell said in a release Tuesday. "We are going through profound sorrow and ask that all of our friends, extended University of Houston family and the track and field community in the U.S. and abroad allow us to gather with our closest family and friends. We are profoundly grief stricken, and thank everyone for the outpouring of prayers and support."

Cameron Burrell's father won gold in the 4x100-meter relay at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and gold on the same relay at the 1991 and 1993 world championships. His mother, Michelle Finn-Burrell, won an Olympic gold medal in the 4x100 relay in 1992 and was an All-American sprinter at Florida State

Burrell was a member of the Houston Cougars track and field team from 2013-18. He captured the NCAA individual national championship in the 100-meters in 2018, matching his father's feat from 28 years earlier. That season, he also ran the anchor leg of the Cougars' 4x100-meter relay team, which successfully defended its NCAA championship.

He earned multiple All-American honors throughout his collegiate career. Burrell ran the 100-meters in 9.93 seconds, topping his father's school record by 0.01 seconds.

“Words cannot express how we feel for Leroy, Michelle and their family. Cameron grew up around the Houston Athletics Department, worked hard and developed himself into one of our greatest Track and Field stars,” university athletics director Chris Pezman said in a release. “To lose him so suddenly is tragic. We ask all University of Houston and track and field fans to keep Coach Burrell and his family in their thoughts and prayers.”

Burrell was a member of the United States 4x100-meter relay team, which won gold at the World Junior Championships in 2012 and captured silver at the 2019 World Relays. He also anchored the U.S. relay team to gold at the 2018 Athletics World Cup.

Burrell is survived by his parents and his brothers, Joshua and Jaden Burrell.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Valparaiso University announced Tuesday that it is adopting Beacons as its new nickname.

The school's previous nickname, the Crusaders, was dropped in February. The Beacon also has been the name of the university's yearbook for the past eight decades.

More than 1,000 suggestions for a new nickname were submitted.

“Our new nickname directly connects to the University’s motto, ‘In Thy Light We See Light,’ and represents the Valparaiso University community in many ways,” university president José D. Padilla said. “We are beacons of light and hope in our communities. We are beacons of change on campus, in our region and in our country. We are beacons of knowledge for our students’ academic, social and spiritual growth.

"Above all, we are beacons of God’s light around the world. We light the way for our students, so that once they graduate, they shine their light for others. We are all Beacons at Valparaiso University.”

The private university, with about 3,500 students, is located in Valparaiso, Indiana, about an hour's drive southeast of Chicago.

Perhaps the most famous sports moment for the school came in 1998 in the NCAA men's basketball tournament when No. 13 seed Valparaiso beat No. 4 seed Mississippi 70–69 on a Bryce Drew 3-point shot at the buzzer.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The NFL says it is going to crack down on players who taunt others during the game.

This is nothing new, as the league has made stances like this in previous seasons.

The league said in a video that players who receive two taunting penalties will be ejected from the game and that player will also be subject to fines and suspensions when deemed necessary.

The taunting penalty is assessed a15 yards. Taunting is under the rules of unsportsmanlike conduct, which is "any act which is contrary to the generally understood principles of sportsmanship."

The league's officials are also going to be looking more closely at illegal use of helmet, which is a 15-yard infraction and an automatic first down.

"The NFL Players Association, coaches and competition committee have all made a strong statement regarding respect among everyone on the field," competition committee chairman Rich McKay said. "We saw an increase in actions that clearly are not within the spirit and intent of this rule is not representative of the respect to opponents and others on the field. Game officials have been instructed to strictly enforce the taunting rules, and players and coaches are reminded that two taunting penalties committed by an individual player will result in automatic disqualification. In addition, the taunting player may be fined and/or suspended depending on the severity of the actions."

There were only 10 taunting penalties called last season, while false start was the most penalized infraction.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@By their very nature, preseason polls are essentially guesses. They’re educated guesses, but since no football has been played, they should never be taken as ultimate predictors of success or failure.

They can, however, be gauges of the anticipation levels in various college towns throughout the country. But first and foremost, they should generate excitement, because their arrival means the season is near at hand.

In that spirit, we present the preseason USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll, which features a lot of familiar names at the top but also some programs with truly unprecedented expectations.

Alabama will open at No. 1, claiming 63 of 65 first-place votes despite losing a lot of talent from last year’s title team. The voters clearly believe there are ready replacements to step in for the Crimson Tide, and Nick Saban has earned the benefit of the doubt with many voters thanks to his six national championships won in Tuscaloosa.

Clemson, the preseason No. 1 in each of the past two years, will open at No. 2. That could prove to be good news for Tigers fans, however, as Clemson opened second before its title run in 2018 but came up short in the playoff each of the past two years when starting at the top.

Oklahoma received the remaining two first-place votes but will open at No. 3. Ohio State and Georgia round out the top five. If the top five looks familiar, you shouldn’t be surprised. The quintet has occupied every spot in the top five in the past four preseason polls except when LSU edged Oklahoma for No. 5 last season.

TOP 25:The complete USA TODAY Sports AFCA preseason coaches poll

SEASON OUTLOOKS:Breaking down every team in the preseason Top 25

OVERLOOKED:Michigan headlines five teams snubbed in the poll

OVERRATED:Notre Dame headlines five teams in preseason poll ready for fall

Coming in right behind them are Texas A&M and Notre Dame, two teams that finished in the top five last season.

It is after the top seven that we start to encounter schools that don’t usually get this kind of attention in preseason balloting. Iowa State will enter the campaign ranked eighth, its highest starting position since USA TODAY assumed administration of the coaches poll in 1991. No. 10 Cincinnati also has its best preseason ranking, and No. 17 Indiana is in the preseason poll for the first time. Not to be overlooked, No. 9 North Carolina has its highest starting point since opening at No. 8 in 1997 during Mack Brown’s first coaching stint in Chapel Hill.

The Sun Belt Conference also is worthy of mention. The league has never had a team ranked in the preseason. This year, there are two: No. 23 Louisiana-Lafayette and No. 24 Coastal Carolina.

On the other side of the coin, a couple of programs accustomed to lofty expectations will begin the season unranked. Michigan and Auburn received votes but not enough to crack The top 25. The Wolverines will open without a number for the first time since 2015, and the Tigers for the first time since 2016.

The SEC has the most representatives in the poll with six teams, thanks to Mississippi edging out Utah for the No. 25 spot. The Big Ten is next with five, followed by the Big 12 with four (Yes, Oklahoma and No. 19 Texas are still there for now). No. 16 Miami (Florida) gives the ACC a third ranked club. The Pac-12 also has a trio headed by No. 12 Oregon.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TOKYO – They say nothing prepares you for covering your first Olympics. “They” are 100% correct.

They forgot to mention you also learn about yourself, sometimes just by doing your job.

What’s up everyone, this is sports reporter Chris Bumbaca, and on Tuesday I returned from the most rewarding professional experience of my life: covering the Tokyo Olympics.

I was at the first day of the men’s golf tournament when I heard something I felt like I’d been waiting my whole life to hear. Sepp Straka, a white man born in Austria to an American-born mother, represented his birth country at the Olympics and had just finished the first round as the leader.

Although not your traditional “mixed” person, he’d been asked a question people with multiple backgrounds are asked frequently, almost always innocently, but is awkward for the one being asked.

“How connected do you feel to Austria?”

His answer helped me make sense of who I am.

But first: Race and justice news we're watching

Important stories of the past week from USA TODAY.

Half-Italian, half-Puerto Rican, 100% me

Had the reporter done basic research, he’d have known Straka is quite connected to Austria; he lived there for the first 14 years of his life.

But here’s what Straka said that crystallized my own identity as a half-Italian and half-Puerto Rican man.

(Yes, the Broadway musical “West Side Story” is conflicting. But watching that gives me less anxiety than a standard-form “please pick one” race inquiry. Don’t even get me started on the “ethnicity” question.)

“I used to say that I was 50% Austrian and 50% American,” he said. “A friend of mine corrected me and said I’m 100% Austrian and 100% American.”

I guess I needed to travel 6,000 miles away from home to learn that I can be 100% me without worrying which half I am that day. I can be both — wholly and simultaneously both. That is the beauty of my identity. There doesn’t need to be a “winner.”

And these Games were a celebration of the totality of my identity, as a Puerto Rican, as an Italian (shoutout Lamont Marcell Jacobs), as an American.

I want to highlight one person though: Jasmine Camacho-Quinn.

Born in South Carolina to a Black father and Puerto Rican mother, she became the second boricua to win a gold medal after she became the 100 meter hurdles champion. I remember exactly where I was when Monica Puig won the first gold medal in Puerto Rico’s history five years ago by defeating Angelique Kerber in the women’s tennis final and the pride I felt then.

“La Boriqueña” played as Camacho-Quinn stood on top of the podium. The scene had me going “¡Wepa!” and tweeting flag emojis. More seriously, as an Afro-Puerto Rican, Camacho-Quinn offers representation for an even deeper-marginalized group and is proof that the diaspora is wide-ranging. It spans skin color and generations.

“She challenged the models that were set up,” Antonio Sotomayor, professor of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Illinois, told Rich Tenorio for the National Association of Hispanic Journalists-run publication "palabra."

"It's not based on being a white man from the island, Spanish-speaking," Sotomayor added.

My grandmother, “Bila” – a nickname deriving from a failed attempt by my then-toddler cousin attempting to say “abuelita” – does three things, aside from loving her family: 1) go to (or, during the pandemic, watch) church; 2) watch telenovelas and Univision; and 3) make the most fire rice and beans in all of Brooklyn.

I’ve visited family in Puerto Rico only twice in my life, yet I feel tremendous pride that my grandmother and late grandfather lived the first 20-plus years of their lives there. They moved to the U.S. in search of greater opportunity for their future children (they certainly succeeded). And Camacho-Quinn and I are in lockstep on this point of pride despite not being born there.

“It means a lot to represent such a small country,” she said.

The last word she uttered is why I often feel sadness and frustration for a place I love, a place that feels like home, but can sometimes feel so far away because of the forces at work against it in the country I’ve called home my whole life.

As my own newspaper awkwardly pointed out in a Twitter thread, Puerto Rico is not a country. It is a U.S. territory.

The statehood vs. independence debate has only intensified in recent years. In Congress, a pair of boricua representatives from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velazquez, have authored a self-determination bill for the more than 3 million people of the island to conduct a binding vote, rather than the three low-turnout plebiscites (non-binding referendums, as the power lies with Congress) that have occurred in the last nine years.

So while the U.S., which has essentially been a colonial occupier of the island since 1898, continues to sit on its hands, the International Olympic Committee has – and this is a weird set of words to write after “International Olympic Committee” – done the right thing by recognizing Puerto Rico as an independent entity, going back nearly 70 years.

On the Olympic stage, the Puerto Rican flag processes through the opening and closing ceremony, equal to the other 205 Olympic national committees and the Refugee Olympic Committee.

Between horrid domestic leadership, gender-violence crimes that have led to marches in the streets, devastating natural disasters like Hurricane Maria, and a dissatisfied younger generation, Puerto Rico could have used a success story in Tokyo.

A Black woman from South Carolina stepped up, and gave the island – and make no mistake, Puerto Rico has fully claimed Camacho-Quinn – a dose of something it had been searching for lately: hope.

As Cesar Torres, a co-editor of "Olimpismo: The Olympic Movement in the Making of Latin America and the Caribbean," told Tenorio:

“(Camacho-Quinn) represents that experience of Puerto Ricans in the continent, being, in many cases, a second-generation or third- or fourth-generation Puerto Rican. She manifests how those roots are kept, how those roots are developed and understood.”

That’s me, right there. Second-generation.

What I realized in Japan is that those roots, while not immediate, are 100% me. I will always keep and develop those roots. And I am only starting to understand them.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Inside the Pacers locker room in the bowels of The Palace at Auburn Hills, an arena that just minutes before had become a battle zone, Ron Artest leaned over to Stephen Jackson.

"Are we going to get in trouble?" he asked.

Jermaine O'Neal, who was sitting on the bench just staring ahead, in shock, heard what Artest asked.

"I said, 'What you mean?'" O'Neal says in the Netflix documentary "Untold: Malice at the Palace," which debuts Tuesday.

What did Artest mean: Were they going to get in trouble? Of course they were.

"I just lost it," O'Neal said.

"He charged Ron," Jackson said. "And we ended up breaking it up."

Another fight erupting that night of Nov. 19, 2004 from leftover rage, a smaller fight than the one that had just taken place between the Detroit Pistons, Pacers and fans.

It was an unprecedented, violent brawl for the NBA. It was a fight that would change the league, the fans, the players – and change everything for the Pacers.

In a split moment ... it's gone

"It's hard to explain to people from suburban America," Metta World Peace (formerly Ron Artest) says as he sits on a leather couch in the documentary. "I want the story out there. Like what happened frame by frame."

He and O'Neal contend in the film that the total footage of the brawl was never shown, just edited versions on network television. That if people see the raw, full footage from that night, they would see the Pacers were just protecting themselves.

"Show people all the footage and then at the end of the day when it's told you make your own conclusion on what it is," O'Neal said.

Pacers-Pistons brawl:What you need to know about the Malice at the Palace in 2004

What it is, the Malice at the Palace, began during a regular season game, the Pacers leading the Pistons 97-82 with 45.9 seconds left. As the Pistons' Ben Wallace went up for a layup, Artest fouled him – hard.

Wallace shoved Artest then continued after him as players and coaches from both teams spilled onto the court.

By the end of the brawl, beer was thrown, punches were thrown and the Pacers were sitting in that locker room.

Outside the arena, television stations were live with footage of stretchers taking injured fans away in ambulances. People poured onto the the streets saying it was the worst fight they've ever seen in sports, that it was like something from a movie.

When O'Neal got home, he stayed up all night watching the coverage as analysts labeled the team as "thugs," called them "hooligans" and "players with no self-control or respect."

"I just remember watching TV and now I'm thinking about all the work that I've put in as a pro player to get to the point that I've gotten to," O'Neal said. "Everything you work for, in a split moment..."

It's gone.

'Get on the same page'

Many say the brawl started brewing when the Pacers lost to the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals just months before.

But some say it began long before that, when a couple of young players with fiery personalities came to the Pacers.

"We had never won a championship," Reggie Miller says in the documentary. "Looking at all the contracts and age, it was time for us to get younger. They pulled the plug in getting Jermaine."

For team president Donnie Walsh, he saw a leader in O'Neal, a 20-year-old the Pacers acquired in 2000. "I was thinking down the road maybe he could replace Reggie," Walsh said in "Untold."

Then in 2002 the Pacers got Artest. Watching Artest and O'Neal was magical, said Miller.

"At the time, we had the best interior defender in Jermaine and we had the best perimeter defender in Ron," he said. "It was like poetry in motion at times when they were on the court."

But Artest says he and O'Neal were "loose cannons." O'Neal says "we had a lot of the same mentalities, dogged, hard-nosed ,we gonna go get you."

Not the same person any more:Metta Sandiford-Artest, 40, blames himself for Pacers not winning NBA title

Often, that clashed.

"I knew we were putting together young guys who could rub each other wrong," Walsh said.

Miller calls the dynamic between O'Neal and Artest "unsettling," but this team, it had a legitimate chance to win a title.

"I could not get them to understand the opportunity," Miller said. "I'm pleading with these guys (to) get on the same page."

Artest and O'Neal did get on the same page. That night in the palace – as they fought.

'I'm fed up'

As Artest lay on the scorer's table, after he and Wallace had their altercation, he remembers thinking O'Neal would be there for him.

"I know Jermaine is not going to just let Ben (Wallace) come over and touch me," Artest said. "I know that for a fact."

It was not normal for a player to lie on the scorer's table like that, said Jim Gray, a sportscaster who covered the game, in the documentary.

The brawl:A devastating time, a new direction for Pacers, NBA

"The dust up, I had no problem with. That happens all the time, the pushing, the shoving, that's all fake," said Miller. "Where it all turned is when Ron went and laid on the scorer's table."

Not long after, Miller saw it coming out of the corner of his eye. The cup of beer that hit Artest square in the chest.

As Artest jumped up to go after the fan he thought threw it, Jackson reacted.

"Once I saw him go, I went. He needed aid," said Jackson. "I saw another beer is thrown in his face and that's the guy I..."

The guy he went after. Dozens of others joined and the brawl erupted.

As it was breaking up, Artest was walking on the court and says he thought it was over. Then another fan came his way.

"Coming to the court to fight?"Artest said. "Because at that point I'm fed up."

O'Neal saw what was about to play out. "I just all out sprint over there to try to help him," O'Neal said. He lunged toward the fan.

"He slipped, thank god," said Miller. "It was the best miss of Jermaine's career because if Jermaine would have connected on that punch, that fan would have been dead."

'That cup of beer changed everything'

Two days after the fight, then-NBA commissioner David Stern issued the Pacers' punishments.

Artest was suspended for the rest of the season, Jackson 30 games and O'Neal 25.

"Not one time have I thought that I shouldn't be punished," O'Neal said. "But 25 games, I ain't OK with that because everything I did, I had to do in protection."

Looking back, Jackson feels the same way.

"I was put in a situation where I either help my brother or not help him. I chose to help him," he said. "I apologized for going into the stands, I apologized for embarrassing the league and that's where I left it."

For Miller, the brawl is clear cut. A couple of players shoving on the court. A player lying on the scorer's table. That should have been the end.

"That cup of beer changed everything," he said. "It cost all of us a lot of money and time, you know, it cost a lot of people a lot of things."

For the Pacers, it cost the franchise a real shot at a championship. It cost Miller – who retired after the season and after 18 years with the Pacers – his championship.

"If the brawl wouldn't of happened, we would have been champions no question about it, no question," said Jackson. "That's the only thing I regret about the whole situation is not being able to do what we said we were going to do for Reggie."

More:What would have happened to the Pacers if there wasn't a brawl?

O'Neal said the loss of a possible ring and that ill-fated night has stayed with him.

"I've never really tried to use the word regret but it's a part of me that has always bothered me," he said of the brawl. "I didn't want to talk to anybody. I just wanted to move on with my life. I've never been able to get away from it though."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton dismissed any speculating about Pro Bowl receiver Michael Thomas on Monday, who has ignored calls from coaches and trainers for three months this offseason, according to several reports.

Thomas insinuated Monday that the New Orleans Saints "tried to damage my reputation" in a cryptic tweet. Thomas did not name the team in his rant, in which he said he saved another entity's "reputation by not telling your side of the story."

When pressed by reporters about what Thomas could be implying, Payton said: "No. I don't want to have a press conference based on social media."

Thomas, the NFL's 2019 offensive player of the year, underwent surgery to repair ligaments in his ankle in June. He's expected to miss the start of the 2021 campaign. The 28-year-old receiver missed eight games due to injury last year. He also missed a game for punching teammate ﻿Chauncey Gardner-Johnson﻿ during a practice scuffle.

Payton also dismissed the notion of Thomas being a distraction to the team.

"We're focused on our guys, and obviously we're focused on Mike getting healthy," Payton said, "but outside of that, it's never been an issue."

AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Craig Ogletree, an Auburn linebacker who played on three straight Southeastern Conference championship teams in the 1980s, has died. He was 53.

He died Monday from complications related to COVID-19, his family said.

Known as “Tree” to his teammates, Ogletree was part of Auburn's title teams from 1987-89. He was a co-captain in 1989 and led that team with 11 sacks in addition to 113 tackles.

Ogletree played briefly in the NFL with the Cincinnati Bengals before returning to Auburn and completing his degree in business management. He worked in sales, marketing and management with Georgia Power while also serving as pastor of Greater Spring Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Milner, Georgia.

Ogletree officiated at the funeral last year of his Auburn coach, Pat Dye.

“He was the kindest person you’d ever meet,” said Pedro Cherry, an Auburn teammate who worked with Ogletree at Southern Company. “He had a spirit about him that always made people feel good. You won’t meet anybody who didn’t love Craig Ogletree."

Ogletree, from Barnesville, Georgia, is survived by his wife, Sherrelle, and sons Austin and Dallas and daughter Olivia.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Through the first two weeks of training camp, we have seen some terrible throws from Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts.

There was a pass over the middle that was intercepted by rookie JaCoby Stevens. There was another when Hurts rolled out and tried to fit in a sideline pass that was picked off by Eric Wilson.

There were times when Hurts stood in the pocket and misfired. And there were other times when his passes were a step behind a receiver or too far in front.

But hold off, for now, on hoping the Eagles can trade for Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson or position themselves for a top-five pick to use on a franchise quarterback in the 2022 NFL draft.

That's because so far, we have mostly seen Hurts operate from the pocket, which is not his strength.

NFC EAST:Five Cowboys figures who could be in spotlight on "Hard Knocks"

"I understand that some part of his game is to be able to move around and make plays," Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. "But, again, a wise man avoids all extremes. It can't be all rhythm, and it can't be all scramble. So, it's like, ‘Hey, what's the happy medium there?’"

This, of course, is what training camp is for.

Hurts has made some spectacular plays while on the run, which if used effectively could provide the Eagles with an element they didn't have since Michael Vick played for them from 2009-13.

There were 25,896 fans on hand at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday night to see two of those plays. One such play came when Hurts escaped pressure, scrambled to his left and heaved a pass from midfield into the end zone where receiver Quez Watkins outleaped a defender to snare.

The other came on a deep sideline pass in which Hurts, scrambling to his right, feathered a pass over Travis Fulgham's shoulder and into his arms.

Hurts has made other passes like that as well during training camp. And those seem to be his strength.

But it's hard to tell how successful the Eagles will be finding that balance, not only with the pocket passes and throws on the run, but also in the run-pass options, where the quarterback reacts based on what the defensive end does.

"I clearly understand that they don’t want to take away my athleticism, but we haven’t gotten to a point where that has needed to be displayed," Hurts said last week. "So we’re just playing ball, trying to execute and being efficient in what we’re doing."

Perhaps we'll see some of that Thursday night when the Eagles play their first preseason game against the Steelers. Then again, maybe not.

It's not known yet if Hurts will play, or for how long. And if Hurts does play, it's possible the Eagles will keep the offense simple so opponents can't use that video to prepare when the season starts.

Either way, Sirianni said Hurts' bad plays aren't as bad as they seem, mainly because he's not using his running ability. In addition, quarterbacks can't be hit, meaning that it's hard to gauge Hurts' ability to break tackles.

Sirianni, in fact, said that was a factor in determining that practice last Saturday wasn't as bad for Hurts and the offense as it seemed. Sirianni said plays that defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon scored as a win for the defense were actually wins for the offense.

"There were a couple plays that Coach Gannon looked at me and said, ‘That's an offensive win?’" Sirianni said. "And I said, ‘Jonathan, you guys got that push in the pocket, but Jalen has a very unique skill set of being able to scramble and make the play.’

"So there was enough protection there that I didn't call a sack on a couple of those, and Jalen scrambled to make a play on a third down."

The Eagles saw some of that last season, albeit on a limited scale, when Hurts replaced Carson Wentz for the final 4½ games last season.

During that time, Hurts ran for 301 yards, including 106 in a win against the Saints. He became the first quarterback since 1950 to throw for a touchdown pass and run for 100 yards or more in his first career start.

Hurts' running ability helped offset somewhat his issues with accuracy. Hurts completed just 51% of his passes for a passer rating of 76.5.

Those stats aren't much different from Wentz's, who completed 57.8% of his passes with a 72.8 rating, both among the league's worst. That decline was a major reason why Wentz was traded to Indianapolis during the offseason.

As a senior at Oklahoma in 2019, Hurts ran for 1,298 yards and threw for 3,851.

Sirianni acknowledges that the accuracy has to improve, both when Hurts is in the pocket and on the run. And that's what the Eagles are working on during training camp.

"Right now he's back and forth," Sirianni said. "He's getting some good throws on rhythm, but just want to make those numbers grow a little bit because we know how valuable of a tool his legs are."

And yes, the RPOs will be a part of the offense, which should also play more to Hurts' strengths.

"It's a piece of the puzzle of what we do, and we're just continuing to grow in it," Sirianni said.

That is a process. And it's something that will take more than two weeks of training camp to figure out.

"Him especially, having the quarterback position, he’s taking a stride every day," running back Miles Sanders said. "Everybody’s still hanging behind him, got his back. We’re going to go as far as he goes. He knows that."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@GREEN BAY - Jordan Love’s turbulent, sometimes spectacular practice Saturday was a microcosm of how his second camp with the Green Bay Packers has gone overall.

Ball security was coach Matt LaFleur’s message to Love after he lost the football three times in the team’s Family Night practice inside a rain-soaked Lambeau Field. Two of Love’s fumbles were on botched snaps with undrafted rookie center Jacob Capra, with whom Love has worked minimally in camp. The third, and most technically alarming, came when Love held onto the football with just one hand as he stepped up in the pocket. The football smacked off Love’s thigh pad, onto the ground.

The young quarterback showed his arm talent, especially on a deep throw into double coverage to receiver Reggie Begelton. Love fit his pass over a pair of defensive backs who were closely trailing Begelton, but Begelton could not hold on for the reception.

“I don’t know how that ball got through,” LaFleur said, “but it was a great pass to Reggie and one that I think Reggie would like to have back. So there was a lot of good.”

For Love, the next step is to take his game into a live-snapping setting in preseason. LaFleur confirmed Tuesday that Love will start the preseason opener Saturday against Houston at Lambeau Field. LaFleur said Aaron Rodgers is unlikely to appear in any of the three preseason games, so Love will get plenty of playing time.

LaFleur wants to see how Love handles game situations.

“More than anything else,” LaFleur said, “the one thing that we’ll make sure to keep pressing on to him is just the tempo in and out of the huddle. There were a couple times he may have gotten a bad play call in there in terms of how we set the formations, and he’s got to be able to figure that out and get everybody lined up so we can go out there and execute.”

Preston Smith poised for ‘heck of a year’

Outside linebackers coach Mike Smith pushed back on the idea fewer pass-rush opportunities led to Preston Smith’s diminished production in 2020.

Preston Smith took a $4 million pay cut this offseason after his sack total dropped to four in 2020, down from 12 the previous season. He said his role was a big reason for the decline, citing fewer pass-rush attempts and more coverage drops.

“I get it,” Mike Smith said, “(edge rushers) are way better at going forward. I’ve been in a 3-4 for 20 years. The year (2014) that Justin Houston got 22 sacks, half a sack away (from Michael Strahan's single-season record in 2001), he dropped 150 times."

Mike Smith, who coached Houston for three years with the Kansas City Chiefs, said Preston Smith is a “team player” and doesn’t doubt the veteran is willing to do whatever is needed. He also knows the Packers need their edge rusher to have more impact harassing quarterbacks this fall.

As a player, Mike Smith spent his career in a 3-4 defense with the Baltimore Ravens. He has coached predominately in a 3-4 defense, starting in 2010 as a New York Jets intern under former Packers coordinator and good friend Mike Pettine. He said a benefit of the 3-4 defense is keeping offenses guessing which outside linebackers are rushing and which are dropping in coverage.

Mike Smith said it’s important for Preston Smith to not think about his role, but simply go out and play.

“Once you start putting negativity in your mind or heart,” Mike Smith said, “that’s usually a sign you’re done. It happens a lot with young guys. … Same thing with dropping. If you start complaining about it, don’t want to do it, whatever it may be — that’s just human nature. So you’ve just got to get back. Preston is not complaining about it, but I guarantee you he loves going forward more than backward. So you’ve just got to let that stuff go, and do your job. The rest takes care of itself.”

Instead of complaining, Mike Smith said his veteran trained hard this offseason. Preston Smith reported to camp in better shape than a year ago, his coach said.

Mike Smith expects Preston Smith to have “a heck of a year” in 2021.

“I thought he looked good,” Mike Smith said. “I could tell he had a good summer. He hit it hard. He’s looking a little bit leaner, and he’s looking stronger. His arms got a little definition to them. That’s another thing about playing, how much we do, dropping in space. You’ve got to be able to move, change direction and all that stuff.

“He looks like he did the first year when he got here.”

Braden taking his shot

For a couple years, Packers guard Ben Braden questioned whether he should continue his football career.

He’d been a two-year starter at Michigan, even sliding out to left tackle. But Braden went undrafted in 2017. He was on the New York Jets' practice squad that season. He played three games with the Jets in the past two seasons, then four games with the Packers last season.

“It was definitely tough,” Braden said. “I’d say in the last couple years, there was some moments where I was kind of, I was very proud of what I’d done at that point. At the same time, I have a wife and son, and I have a family. So I was kind of like, ‘At what point is this too much on all of us, and I need to make a decision on what’s best for our family?’”

Braden said he had a conversation with his wife, Andrea. They checked their finances before deciding they could continue the gamble.

“At the end of the day,” Braden said, “I love football. … In my heart, I just felt like I wasn’t done yet.”

In his second camp with the Packers, Braden is seeing his long path start to pay off. With Elgton Jenkins sliding out to left tackle to replace the injured David Bakhtiari, Braden isn’t only making a run at a 53-man roster spot. He’s competing for a starting left guard spot with fellow former Michigan lineman Jon Runyan Jr.

Coach Matt LaFleur said Braden has earned the opportunity.

“He’s a massive guy,” LaFleur said of the 6-6, 329-pound Braden, “that has really good athleticism for his size. He’s got good ownership of what we're asking these guys to do, and he’s done a nice job.”

Mr. Longevity

Mason Crosby enters his 15th season as the Packers' kicker in 2021, a benchmark of longevity for kickers.

“It was kind of a goal to get to a point like this,” Crosby said.

Crosby will turn 37 in September. The Packers drafted him in the sixth round in 2007. He won the job as a rookie and never looked back, becoming the franchise’s all-time leading scorer.

At this stage, Crosby knows he’ll face plenty of questions on how much longer he plans to continue his kicking. He said there are no plans to retire anytime soon as long as he continues at a high level. Crosby made all 16 of his field goals last season, the first time in his career he’d finished 100 percent. That followed a 2019 in which he made 22-of-24, a 91.7 percentage that had been the best in his career.

Crosby was asked Monday about the possibility of playing as long as the legendary Adam Vinatieri, who retired this offseason at age 48.

“Yeah, you know, 48 would be pretty cool,” Crosby said. “It seems like that’s just a whole other career to think that far out. To me, I want to play out this contract and just kind of evaluate it.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@WESTFIELD, Ind. — The battle for the Indianapolis backup quarterback job is starting to boil.

The Colts gave rookie Sam Ehlinger first-team repetitions for the first time in training camp, splitting snaps with the No. 1 offense between the sixth-round pick and Jacob Eason, the second-year passer who had taken every first-team snap since a piece of bone broke loose in Carson Wentz’s foot during the team’s second practice.

Ehlinger has shown a remarkable grasp of the offense throughout training camp, getting the ball out of the pocket on time and accurately, and he didn’t throw an interception in 11-on-11 work until Sunday’s practice, the 10th workout of camp. Colts head coach Frank Reich said Saturday that there weren’t any imminent plans to give Ehlinger first-team reps, but after evaluating the way the rookie has played, Indianapolis decided to start splitting up the work.

“That wasn’t anything Jacob did wrong, but you know, this is a meritocracy, and we decided to split it up,” Reich said.

MORE:32 NFL training camp standout players you need to know in 2021

Ehlinger opened his first-team work by firing a strike to T.Y. Hiltonin man-to-man coverage, and he finished 4 of 6 with the No. 1s. The two incompletions came on a ball batted down by nose tackle Grover Stewartat the line of scrimmage and a drop by tight endFarrod Green, who was open in the flat.

The rookie finished the day 5 of 11 overall, according to the unofficial count by IndyStar.

Eason, for his part, responded to the change with one of his better practices so far. The 2020 fourth-round pick completed 9 of 10 throws, including a deep ball to Dezmon Patmon and a short throw to DeMichael Harris that might have been one of Eason’s best plays of training camp.

Patmon did the bulk of the work on the deep ball. If it had been a game, Eason would have been forced to do more to evade the free rushes of Zaire Franklinand Isaac Rochell, but he let fly a slightly underthrown ball that the 6-4 Patmon went up and ripped away from a defender hanging all over him. Two plays later, Eason saw pressure coming, made a nifty escape up into the pocket and found Harris with room to run.

“I was proud of the way both guys responded today, especially with Jacob, because he comes in, finds out, ‘Hey, you’re going to split the reps,’ and he comes out and has a good day,” Reich said. “That’s a good sign for Jacob, and there’s a lot on the line. Sam has done a good job.”

Both quarterbacks had to deal with a relentless pass rush. No quarterback can be taken down in practice, so it’s hard to identify sacks, but by IndyStar’s count, there were six, spread among Tyquan Lewis, Franklin and Rochell, Ben Banogu, Bobby Okereke, Kameron Cline and another by Rochell.

The Colts plan to continue splitting snaps between Ehlinger and Eason during joint practices with the Carolina Panthers later this week, although it will be more of a traditional division of labor during Sunday’s preseason opener.

“We’ll split the reps with the ones, more than likely, in practice, at quarterback, against the Panthers,” Reich said. “In the game, we’ll just let one guy go. Jacob will probably start and go, and then Sam will probably come in whenever, at some point in the second.”

Full (E.J.) Speed ahead

With Darius Leonardout for the first two weeks of training camp, the Colts have gotten an extended look atE.J. Speed, their fifth-round pick out of 2019 in Tarleton State.

Speed has only played 34 snaps on defense in his first two seasons, but he looks ready for more defensive action this season. Speed blew up a screen to Jack Doyle, fighting off a block by Julién Davenport to make the play.

The third-year linebacker then made back-to-back plays on Nyheim Hineslater in the practice, ranging to the sideline to make one stop and fighting through traffic for the other. Now that Leonard’s on his way back, the Colts will likely start working Speed in at the strong-side linebacker position, where he’ll battleZaire Franklinfor the role. Franklin has also had a good camp; he flew through the line for a tackle-for-loss on Deon Jackson at one point on Tuesday.

Injury report

Leonard practiced for the first time in training camp, but the All-Pro linebacker was limited considerably, taking only a handful of snaps in 11-on-11 as he continues to work his way back from June ankle surgery.

“Having 53 out there doesn’t hurt, he brings a little extra juice to practice,” Reich said.

Defensive tackle DeForest Bucknerwas held out for the second consecutive practice for precautionary reasons, according to Reich, and starting right tackle Braden Smith did not practice for “maintenance” reasons. Smith was spotted on the field wearing a walking boot on his left foot.

Wentz and left guard Quenton Nelson, who each had surgery last week to remove a loose piece of bone from a foot, were back on the practice field for the first time to watch. Reich said it’s encouraging that both players are up and moving around, but he said the Colts are still waiting for two weeks to pass before making an evaluation on a potential timetable for return.

Free safety Julian Blackmon (knee), centerRyan Kelly(elbow), wide receiver Ashton Dulin (hamstring), tight end Mo Alie-Cox(knee), defensive tackle Taylor Stallworth (hamstring), tight end Noah Togiai (knee), linebacker Jordan Glasgow(back), Skai Moore (back) and safety Nick Nelson (undisclosed) also did not practice due to injury.

Eric Fisher, the starting left tackle the Colts signed in free agency, has been getting some workouts in after practice. Reich has been optimistic about Fisher, saying he watched one of Fisher’s workouts last week and jokingly told the trainers to put some pads on the veteran.

The Colts signed former Texans and Packers linebacker Curtis Bolton on Tuesday and waived offensive tackleJake Benzinger.

Quick hitters

Davenport was given his first chance with the starters at left tackle, and he had some issues. Davenport got beat by Speed on the screen, and he also false started twice. … With Buckner and Stallworth out of action, veteran Antwaun Woods lined up next to Grover Stewart at defensive tackle. … Defensive back Andre Chachere, who has fought his way into the mix for a roster spot because of his versatility, picked off a pass in 1-on-1’s. Both Chachere andT.J. Carrie have played some free safety with Blackmon out of action. … The kick returners are Isaiah Rodgers, Nyheim Hines, Marlon Mack and likely Dulin when he comes back to the field.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As Mike McCarthy tells it, he just about drove off the road when Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called to alert McCarthy his team would be featured on this season’s "Hard Knocks."

Dozens of NFL Films cameras granted inside access to the Cowboys? An even brighter spotlight than "America’s Team" already commands, all while McCarthy looks to remedy a shoddy 6-10 debut campaign in Dallas? McCarthy wouldn’t have voted for the arrangement.

“I am just going to be honest: I almost wrecked my truck when Jerry called,” McCarthy said when the Cowboys arrived at training camp. “But once I got back on the road, I am all in.”

Cowboys fans, granted an inside look into players’ and coaches’ conversations and personalities, are all in, too. The first episode of "Hard Knocks: The Dallas Cowboys" debuts Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET on on HBO. Five weekly episodes are scheduled in total, the final episode streaming two days before the Cowboys travel to Tampa Bay for the NFL’s season opener.

HARD KNOCKS:16 most memorable moments through the years

But which players on the 90-man roster are most likely to shine on the docuseries? Which coaches will emerge as key 2021 faces? Here are USA TODAY Sports’ top five recommendations for who to track in the series:

Rookie linebacker Micah Parsons

Parsons already worked with the NFL Films crew this spring, a comfort level reflected by Parsons fraternizing with camera people at some Southern California practices. Parsons is a natural "Hard Knocks" star selection both because of his vibrant, congenial personality and because of the tantalizing talent he projects to be on the field. He offers filmmakers smiles and jokes as well as team-drill pass breakups and interceptions.

How soon will the versatile cover man/pass rusher threaten with this Cowboys defense? Coordinator Dan Quinn is aiming to expedite that timeline by giving Parsons extra attention, including during one-on-one sessions after practices. A closer glimpse into that dynamic would delight Cowboys fans.

So, too, would an exploration of Parsons’ multifaceted competitive nature. The 22-year-old has already challenged teammates like Amari Cooper to games of chess and Connect Four. Results of those games have been mostly under wraps. Could "Hard Knocks" episodes change that?

Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn

Whether he is coaching defensive ends on their get-off or defensive tackles on how best to disengage from a guard, Dan Quinn has already demonstrated a knack for connecting effectively with his players in practices and around facilities. Cowboys players marveled as he challenged their note-taking skills with a vintage rap song, and they celebrate critiques from him as a sign he believes in their potential.

Perhaps "Hard Knocks" will temper the expletives that fly from Quinn’s mouth as he flies through installations and drills. Either way, the man tasked with turning around a historically bad Cowboys defense is likely to command screen time throughout the five episodes.

Quarterback Dak Prescott

Sure, the first 15 seasons of "Hard Knocks" embraced the underdog and fringe roster players. But the NFL Films/HBO partnership would be wise to consider compelling veterans on the Cowboys roster, and none is more compelling than Prescott.

The quarterback started 73 straight Cowboys games before his season-ending ankle injury last October. He’s mounting a comeback and getting paid a handsome $40 million to lead the team this season. How much will Prescott’s wit and snark shine through in mic-ed up elements? How about his friendship with fellow draft classmate Ezekiel Elliott, as each enter their sixth year - and each celebrated a birthday during training camp? Already, NFL Films has released a clip of Prescott jabbing second-year quarterback Ben DiNucci about his swag meter. Expect more zingers from Prescott as the season unfolds.

Linebacker Jaylon Smith

Along with Prescott and Elliott, Smith could push the 2016 draft class into contention for screen time with the 2021 bunch. Smith already embraces the spotlight, his Clear Eye View mentality driving his energy as well as his motivation to prove the Cowboys right in drafting him despite a gruesome knee injury - and then in signing him before fully gauging his potential. Smith and 2018 first-rounder Leighton Vander Esch will be challenging Parsons for the claim of best linebacker on this Dallas roster. The veteran duo thrived during Vander Esch’s rookie year, but Vander Esch has since missed time due to injury while Smith’s tackling and on-field leadership has been inconsistent. Smith has embraced Quinn’s scheme and its potential to include blitz packages for him.

Smith’s also been adamant he’s blocking out the heavy criticism showered on him in 2020 - because “Michael Jordan had criticism. LeBron James. Some of the best players in the world.” Cowboys fans looking to discern whether Smith has shored his game will be eager for any insight "Hard Knocks" can provide.

Cowboys owner and GM Jerry Jones

It was Jones who embraced the "Hard Knocks" crew as an “easy decision.” Jones celebrates any and all attention on the franchise he’s built into a spectacle larger than football. And the Cowboys owner is also intimately involved in talent evaluation during training camp, watching practices from an observation tower between the two fields -often with members of his family.

"Hard Knocks" cameras spent time in those observation towers, and Jones likely will give them leeway to capture his reaction when players like receiver CeeDee Lamb and defensive end Randy Gregory flash. Perhaps an earlier episode is more likely to include Jones’ opening press conference, when he was overcome by emotion about how deeply he longs to return the Cowboys to the Super Bowl. But expect multiple lenses into the 78-year-old throughout the docuseries, including a seat beside him at practice.

Bonus: The roughly 30-person "Hard Knocks" crew has eyes and ears throughout Cowboys camp. So they’ll determine which lower-profile players are most compelling. But based on practice, defenders including defensive end Tarell Basham and rookie cornerback Kelvin Joseph showed the type of edge that excites a camera crew. Receiver Malik Turner and tight end Sean McKeon are talents who have distinguished themselves in practices, but face an uphill battle in crowded position rooms. An interesting consideration: Would Cowboys staffers, who review the footage before it airs, consider downplaying stars like Turner and McKeon in hopes of stashing one on the practice squad? NFL fans will soon find out if they tune into the Cowboys’ third season appearance on "Hard Knocks."

“The Cowboys are going to take care of us,” Prescott said. “If you want to be great, you’ve got to understand the cameras and all those things are going to happen. So it’s something that I have embraced. We have fun, and we don’t necessarily worry about it.

“They do their job. We do our job.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LOS ANGELES – The moment left him feeling inspired. And why not? As a child, Russell Westbrook grew up in this city and watched numerous Lakers’ championship parades.

As an adult, Westbrook will spend his 14th NBA season wearing a Lakers uniform. So just imagine what Russell felt like on Tuesday when he held his Lakers’ jersey for the first time nearly two weeks after the Lakers acquired him in a deal with the Washington Wizards.

“It’s incredible and surreal,” Westbrook said. “It still hasn’t hit me yet.”

The moment also left him feeling wistful. And why not? Westbrook became one of many NBA stars to form a close bond with former Lakers star Kobe Bryant. And now Westbrook will join the same franchise that Bryant helped win five NBA titles about 19 months after Bryant's tragic death.

“It hasn’t left my head,” Westbrook said. “There’s things we have talked about – me and him and just the potential in me being able to be a Laker and understanding what that entails. It’s just crazy to think about. That will be with me every time I put that Lakers jersey on.”

How can Westbrook blend his unmatched competitiveness and speed with a team that features LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Carmelo Anthony and handful of established veteran role players? Bryant went through the same experience with Shaquille O’Neal, Pau Gasol and others.

“I always want to stay true to who I am. But with that, making sure I’m willing to listen and be all ears,” Westbrook said. “I’m coming to an unbelievable organization, team and players I’m able to learn from. Each year, I try to find things I can learn and help improve my game and be a better player. I will do that here as well.”

How that actually plays out in real time will become one of the Lakers’ primary themes in the 2021-22 season. Shortly before and after the Lakers acquired Westbrook from Washington for their No. 22 pick, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Montrezl Harrell, Westbrook said he had “brief conversations” with James and Davis about the fit.

Westbrook’s main message: “We’ll figure it out.” But how will Westbrook and James figured out how to share ball-handling and playmaking duties when that partly explains why they have become such great players?

“LeBron is one of the best players to play this game. His ability to be able to do kind of everything on the floor allows me to be able to just figure it out,” Westbrook said. “I’m coming to a championship-caliber team. My job is to make sure that I’m able to make his game easy for him. I’ll find ways to do that throughout the game. As it pertains to ball handling and all of that, it really doesn’t matter. There are many ways you can impact the game without having the ball in your hands. I’ve been able to do that for many years. I will figure it out.”

Yet, Westbrook has figured those things out with mixed results.

Westbrook and Kevin Durant formed a dynamic duo for eight years in Oklahoma City only for Durant to leave in 2016 for Golden State partly because of Westbrook’s hard-driving, ball-heavy style. Westbrook’s partnership with other stars didn’t last as long. He played only two seasons with Paul George with the Thunder (2017-19) before George quickly course corrected his decision to re-sign with the franchise a year earlier. He played only one season with James Harden with the Houston Rockets (2019-20) before the two both asked to be traded. He played only one season with Bradley Beal with the Wizards (2020-21) before another deal took place.

JAZZED UP:NBA free agency: Mike Conley details how he'll reward Jazz's generous contract with good health

Yet, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka viewed Westbrook’s previous tenure through a different lens.

“He’s one of the most liked, respected and beloved players in the league by players he played with,” Pelinka said. “He’s an incredible leader. When you talk to teammates from the other storied franchises he played for, to a man, the input you get is he is one of the greatest teammates he ever played with. That speaks to his character and his leadership. Those are qualities that are incredibly important to our team.”

Durant has considered the tension between he and Westbrook to be overblown, and largely credited the Warriors’ culture and talent factoring into his departure. George insisted he simply wanted to play for the Clippers and remain close friends with Westbrook. Both Westbrook and Harden argued their dynamic worked out just fine that entailed both a mix of Harden isolation plays and Westbrook fast-break plays. Beal and Westbrook appeared to co-exist just fine, too.

Westbrook spoke candidly on what it will be like to co-exist with James and Davis.

“AD and LeBron are friends of mine first,” Westbrook said. “Me being a teammate, it’s my job to come in and uplift them. They’ll do the same to me, and vice versa. As the season prolongs, there will be ups; there will be downs. That’s normal. That’s okay. But we’ll figure it out on how to play the best way that we want to play to win a championship.”

What will be that best way to win a championship?

“Anytime you have three great players like this, there is an element of sacrifice required,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “We’ve all talked about that and are all in on that. But these three guys can do it all. What I love about our group – ‘Bron, AD and Russ – is they’re all about ‘make-the-right-play’ players. It’s not just about scoring or being a one dimensional player. They can all do it all. I’m most excited about what seeing them on the court at the same time looks like.”

So even if Westbrook insists he doesn’t have anything to prove, he kind of does. He wants to win his first NBA championship. He wants to play in a way that would make Bryant proud. He wants to inspire those that knew him well at UCLA and Leuzinger High.

“Everything coming full circle for me,” Westbrook said. “I’ve been blessed to be in my 14th season. Each year, I try to find ways to uplift my teammates around me.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dan Campbell will be looking for players with one trait in particular as he whittles the Detroit Lions' roster down to 53 players in the coming weeks.

"It’s grit is No. 1," Campbell said Tuesday. "It’s always been from Day 1. It’s grit."

A month out from their Sept. 12 regular season opener against the San Francisco 49ers, the Lions appear to have most of their starting lineup set on both sides of the ball.

Campbell said Monday the majority of players on the two-deep roster will be evident in the coming weeks, and that only about the final three to five roster spots will be up for grabs by the time the Lions close the preseason Aug. 27 against the Indianapolis Colts.

More than players who flash potential, Campbell said he wants resilient, tough, hard-nosed players he knows he can trust at the back end of his roster.

Teams must cut from 90 to 85 players on Aug. 17, from 85 to 80 players on Aug. 24, and be down to 53 players by Aug. 31.

"You’re a guy that your body demeanor never changes (no matter) what happens to you," Campbell said. "You’re dependable, you’re accountable. It’s everything that you would want in somebody. If you said I need one guy to do a job for me, this is the guy that I’m, really a guy that I’m good with, I trust you. I know exactly who you’re going to be every day, you’re not up and down. You’re the same guy every day. I know who you are."

The Lions are coming off a 5-11 season and have not had a winning record since 2017, but Campbell said he inherited a roster full of gritty players from his predecessors, Matt Patricia and Bob Quinn.

"I said this when I walked in. There was a number of guys that were here and I think Patricia and Quinn did a great job of, there’s no turds here." Campbell said. "There’s no bad guys. Like these guys work now. We don’t have guys, 'Ah, I'm lazy.' We don’t really have those guys and that’s a good thing. That’s not always the case when you walk in and it hasn’t been a successful program.

"These guys work, and they are, they’re pretty tough-minded, it’s just a matter of, hey, we got to — this is how you got to win. This is what it takes to win, this is what takes to be a winner. This is what it looks like. This is how you walk-through. That’s all it is. It’s just a matter of, sometimes you don’t know what you don’t know, that’s all."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On Tuesday night, the 16th season of HBO's "Hard Knocks" kicks off as NFL Films' sports reality documentary series follows the training camp and preseason exploits of the Dallas Cowboys.

This will be the third season that the Cowboys will be featured on the show (2002 and 2008); the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams have each appeared on the show twice.

If viewers are lucky, the Cowboys will provide a moment or two that could be considered among the best the show has ever produced.

7 STORYLINES TO WATCH:From Dak Precott's return to a refurbished defense

HARD KNOCKS: 5 Cowboys to watch

So cue up David Robidoux's iconic theme music, and enjoy 16 of the most memorable moments from "Hard Knocks":

(Warning: Many of the videos below contain NSFW language.)

16. 2018 Browns — Carl Nassib, financial advisor

Carl Nassib was one of a healthy number of breakout stars when the "Hard Knocks" crew followed the Cleveland Browns -- he revealed that he believes aliens are real and didn't appreciate offensive coordinator Todd Haley making fun of his first name.

But the moment that was most memorable was Nassib giving financial advice to his teammates.

"Who knows what compound interest is? This is real (expletive)," Nassib says. "Financial advisors are everywhere. They’ll (expletive) take your money and they’ll take one percent of everything you got, and you’ll be like 'Oh it's one percent it doesn’t (expletive) matter.' It matters. It matters a (expletive) lot."

15. 2019 Raiders — 'I'm into (expletive) nightmares'

Oakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden provided a number of zingers for the "Hard Knocks" cameras. From his familiar "knock on wood if you're with me" slogan to telling receiver Keelan Doss that he's "more excited to see you play than I am to see my wife, and I haven't seen her in two weeks."

Gruden's speech to open the 14th season of "Hard Knocks" was intense.

"Everybody right now has dreams, don't they guys?" Gruden says. "I got a dream of winning the Super Bowl. I got a dream of being in the Pro Bowl. I'm not really into dreams, anymore. I'm into (expletive) nightmares. Guys with me on that?

"You gotta end somebody's dream. You gotta take their job. You gotta take their heart. You guys clear about this NFL (expletive) now? We're not trying to go to the Peach Bowl. We're not trying to go to the Gator Bowl or the Bluebonnet Bowl. We're trying to go to the Super Bowl."

The Bluebonnet Bowl, by the way, hasn't been played since 1987.

14. 2012 Dolphins — Vontae Davis gets traded

"Hard Knocks" viewers had grown accustomed to players getting dealt the devastating news that they'd been released and — for many — that their pro football dreams were over.

During the 2012 series with the Miami Dolphins, people saw a player learn he was being traded. It was awkward. Immediately after Dolphins GM Jeff Ireland delivers the news to Davis, the new Indianapolis Colts cornerback wants to call his grandmother. Ireland levels with him.

"You know Vontae, you're kind of up and down," Ireland tells him.

It worked out well for Davis, who went on to become a two-time Pro Bowl selection with the Colts.

13. 2010 Jets — Darrelle Revis' return caps season

Darrelle Revis' offseason holdout played out on reality television as "Hard Knocks" followed the Jets, giving viewers an inside-the-team headquarters view of the intense negotiations.

By the season finale, a deal was struck and "Revis Island" appeared at practice to the applause of his teammates. It was an appropriate capper to one of the best seasons of "Hard Knocks."

12. 2019 Raiders — Antonio Brown's eventful camp

Antonio Brown never played a down for the Oakland Raiders, but he sure did take up a lot of air time during the 2019 edition of "Hard Knocks."

From showing up to training camp in a hot-air balloon — "float like a butterfly, sting like AB" — to his refusal to wear a league-mandated helmet — "This lid? This lid ugly as (expletive) yo." But, Brown showing viewer's his cryotherapy-damaged feet that prevented him from practicing was quite something.

"Yeah, I (expletive) got circumcised on my feet, you know," Brown said.

11. 2016 Rams — Jeff Fisher's 7-9 rant

When "Hard Knocks" followed the Los Angeles Rams, version 2.0, in 2016, the team was coming off its second 7-9 finish in three seasons. Fisher had seen enough nonsense during a morning practice session and laid into his team.

"You follow me?” Fisher said. “I am not (expletive) going 7-9 or 8-8 or 9-7, OK? Or 10-6 for that matter. This team is too talented. I am not going to settle for that, OK? I know what I am doing. We had some 7-9 (expletive) this morning. Now, Deon’s gone. That is 7-9 (expletive). We don’t need it."

The "Deon" who Fisher references is wide receiver Deon Long, who was released for violating a team rule (bringing a female visitor to his dorm room).

After a 4-9 start to the 2016 season, Fisher was fired by the Rams.

10. 2012 Dolphins — Chad Johnson gets cut after arrest

A day after an arrest on a domestic violence charge, Johnson was called into the office of head coach Joe Philbin and subsequently released.

Just three years earlier, Johnson — then known as Chad Ochocinco — was one of the stars of "Hard Knocks" featuring the Cincinnati Bengals, talking about his catchphrases such as "child please" and "kiss da baby."

When Johnson's brief tenure with the Dolphins came to an end, so did his NFL career.

9. 2018 Browns — Coaches meeting

It was quite apparent during the 2018 edition of "Hard Knocks" that Hue Jackson wasn't long for the head coach's chair, and it all started in the first episode.

Jackson, coming off an 0-16 season, was questioned by then-running backs coach Freddie Kitchens over his decision to not dress injured players at practice, specifically running back Duke Johnson. Todd Haley, then the offensive coordinator, came to Kitchens' defense. Jackson wasn't having any of it.

"The chair I sit in, it's a little different than the chair you guys sit in. I get to watch from a different lens. I think you guys can all respect that," Jackson said. "At the end of the day, I get to drive this bus. And I'm going to get it the way I want it."

Jackson was fired that season after the Browns started 2-5-1.

8. 2016 Rams — Player denies dinosaurs existed

Defensive end William Hayes provided much-needed levity in what was a rather dull season featuring the newly relocated Rams in their first season in Los Angeles. Hayes had some thoughts, most notably that dinosaurs are a hoax and that mermaids exist. A "mermaid" showed up to Rams practice, too, much to the delight of Hayes.

Less than a year later, Hayes was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for "a stapler and a coffee machine."

7. 2015 Texans — Vince Wilfork shows up in overalls

Entering his first season with the Houston Texans, Vince Wilfork opted to embrace his new home by showing up to training camp shirtless and wearing overalls and cowboy boots. Wilfork had a starring role in the show, as he also took on U.S. World Cup winner Carli Lloyd in a field goal contest.

6. 2018 Browns — Jarvis Landry delivers epic speech

Landry, entering his first season with the Browns, unleashed a 1,080-word, expletive-laced speech in the receivers room.

"I don’t know what the (expletive) has been going on here, and I don’t know why it’s been going on here, but this — if you’re not hurt, if your hamstring ain’t falling off the (expletive) bone, if your leg ain’t broke, I don’t know, you should be (expletive) practicing. Straight up. That (expletive) is weakness. That (expletive) is contagious as (expletive), and that (expletive) ain’t going to be in this room,” Landry said.

Browns rookie receiver Blake Jackson later staged a spoof of Landry's speech, and the results were hilarious.

5. 2007 Chiefs — Dance off

Bernard Pollard has moves.

"This is how we do it in Fort Wayne. We got dancers. We got dancers in Fort Wayne. I'm gonna show y'all."

You were warned.

4. 2015 Texans — J.J. Watt puts in work

J.J. Watt is an intense dude, and NFL Films caught how dedicated the defensive end is to his craft. Watt first is shown lifting 1,000-pound tires. Later, there's a post-practice workout when Watt practices pass-rushing moves on tackling dummies, takes on blocking sleds, catches balls from the JUGS machine and, for good measure, does some running.

A year earlier, during the Falcons' "Hard Knocks" series, Watt — then embarking on the second of what would be three NFL defensive player of the year seasons — made a dramatic entrance and proceeded to dominate Falcons rookie lineman Jake Matthews (in front of his Hall of Fame father, too) during a scrimmage. So, when the Texans were announced to be the "Hard Knocks" team the following year, you just knew Watt would be one of the attractions. He didn't let viewers down.

3. 2001 Ravens — Shannon Sharpe and Ray Lewis impressions

The defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens were the so-called guinea pig in this experiment by NFL Films and HBO back in 2001. The highlight of the first season of "Hard Knocks" was the rookie talent show, which featured spectacular impersonations of future Pro Football Hall of Famers Shannon Sharpe and Ray Lewis.

2. 2018 Browns — Bob Wylie on stretching and the Normandy invasion

Cleveland Browns offensive line coach Bob Wylie went viral for a couple things during 2018's excellent "Hard Knocks" season. There's Wylie's stomach every time he says, "set hut!"

Then, of course, there was the epic rant about stretching and D-Day.

"Did you know, World War I and World War II, all those guys that fought in that war ... they did pushups, jumping jacks, situps, climb the rope and ran. None of this fancy (expletive). And they won two World Wars," Wylie said. "Do you think they were worried when they were running across Normandy about (expletive) stretching?"

No, they weren't. And there are no reports of pulled hamstrings in the history books, either.

1. 2010 Jets — Let's go eat a snack!

This is the transcendent "Hard Knocks" moment.

Coach Rex Ryan wasn't pleased with his New York Jets, and gave them a verbal dressing-down that ended with what is the most famous line ever uttered on "Hard Knocks."

"Let’s make sure we play like the (expletive) New York Jets and not some (expletive) slap (expletive) team. That’s what I want to see tomorrow. Do we understand what the (expletive) I want to see tomorrow? Let’s go eat a (expletive) snack."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@So, it's really happening. After spending two decades with FC Barcelona, soccer superstar Lionel Messi has joined Paris Saint-Germain on a two-year contract (with an option for a third year).

Messi's departure from FC Barcelona wasn't necessarily his choice, but FCB's financial mismanagement left it impossible to re-sign Messi while adhering to financial fair play, La Liga regulations and Spanish law. That law prohibited Messi from taking a pay cut exceeding 50 percent of his previous year's salary.

All that financial whirlwind eventually led to the scene in Paris on Tuesday where Messi arrived at Le Parc des Princes in a motorcade. He was also ready to sport a new number.

LA LIGA MOVES ON:After 17 seasons, post-Lionel Messi era begins in Spanish league

UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE:Three title winners eliminated in third qualifying round

PSG announced the Messi signing with a presentation video of Messi in his new uniform, and he settled on No. 30 with his new club.

Given the earlier teasers that included Neymar's No. 10 jersey, we knew a number change was coming for the Argentinian superstar. French outlet bfmtv.com reported that Neymar offered to give up No. 10 in order to bring in Messi, but Messi declined and opted to go with a throwback to the early days of his legendary career.

Messi wore No. 30 in his Barcelona debut before changing to No. 19 in 2006. He took over the storied No. 10 jersey once Ronaldinho left Barcelona in 2008.

The choice in Paris seemingly came down to 30 and 19, and after PSG backup goalkeeper Alexandre Letellier agreed to give up No. 30, Messi's choice was made.

The number is going to take some getting used to, but then again, all of this is new - number included.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BEREA, Ohio — If you’re still on the fence or are adamantly opposed to getting vaccinated for COVID-19, listen to Myles Garrett.

Just do it.

“You have your own personal liberties…it’s up to anybody, what you want to do with your body,” the Cleveland Browns star defensive end told USA TODAY Sports. “I would say go do it, get the vaccine, to decrease the risk of getting COVID or spreading it to someone who is going to have an adverse reaction like myself.”

Garrett, 25, is undoubtedly one of the most credible players in the NFL to deliver a message about risks associated with COVID-19 given his experiences.

His father, Lawrence, suffered immensely before rebounding after contracting COVID-19 in 2020. His mother, Audrey, was also struck and experienced mild symptoms. Garrett also lost a great-grandmother to COVID-19.

And one of the game's most dominant players had a scary bout with COVID-19 during the second half of last season that derailed a campaign seemingly on course to challenge Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald for NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors.

“Personally, it whipped my ass,” Garrett said during an interview at the Browns headquarters last weekend. “It took me out.”

Garrett ripped off some of the classic symptoms: "I couldn’t smell, and what I could smell was like an iron, like a metallic sensation in my nose. It felt like it was burning. Like sometimes for 30 minutes, an hour. It made my head hurt. My eyes watered. Stuffy. Had phlegm. Felt weak.”

Of course, the labored breathing took a toll. Garrett missed two games after testing positive in late November, returning for a contest at Tennessee on Dec. 6.

“I come back and I feel like I can go,” he recalled. “Then three plays in, I feel like I’m exhausted. My first game back, I’m using oxygen in the first quarter.”

He shook his head as he reflected.

"You hear about some people who have no symptoms at all,” Garrett said. "It’s just strange how it affects each and every person.”

Although there are a handful of high-profile players across the league who have acknowledged that they are not vaccinated or won’t confirm that they have been vaccinated – including Buffalo Bills receiver Cole Beasley, Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins and Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson – the message from Garrett at this point is more relevant for society at large than it is for his NFL brethren.

As of Tuesday, 92% of NFL players were fully vaccinated or had at least one of the shots, according to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, with 15 of the league’s 32 teams hitting vaccination rates of at least 95%.

Now compare that to the overall rate in the nation. According to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about 50% of adults in the United States are fully vaccinated, with 58.8% having had at least one shot.

Imagine if the rest of the country had the same rate as NFL players, who largely fall in the 21-to-34 age range that has lagged with vaccinations.

Sure, the COVID-19 protocols instituted by the league and the NFL Players Association have contributed to the league vaccination rates that have increased in recent weeks as teams reported to training camps. The protocols dictate that unvaccinated players must wear masks at team facilities and submit to daily testing, among other measures. Also, the league has indicated that if outbreaks occur during the season, teams will more likely lose games through forfeit (without pay for the players) rather than have the season extended to squeeze contests in. So, yes, the NFL’s culture has strongly encouraged vaccinations.

Regardless, Garrett wasn’t one who needed to be convinced. He said he never hesitated after a vaccine became available to him in Texas.

“I got it a couple of months ago,” Garrett said. He took the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and now hopes that it will protect his against the delta variant that has fueled a spike in COVID-19 cases.

“I saw something the other day where they were asking if it’s even viable?” Garrett said. “I’m like, ‘Don’t say that.’ There’s a new tenacity with this variant of the disease. What do you want us to do?

“I don’t recommend doing nothing. Nothing is not the best option. You can still take precautions in staying away from people, wearing your mask, making sure you lower your risk of passing it on to someone else who doesn’t want to get the vaccine. Just be smart.”

The episode that involved his father a little more than a year ago has resonated with Garrett and other family members, as you’d expect. It was easy to sense how emotional it was for Garrett, who reflected on his visits home to Arlington, Texas, to see his father before training camp opened last year.

“My dad was real sick,” he said. “I went to see him a couple of times. He was barely walking. He couldn’t breathe. He was coughing up. He was tired. When I saw him, I was in the driveway and he was sitting in a chair with my mother next to him. The closest I could get to him was about 10 feet away. He was just tired, sluggish, exhausted.”

Garrett said his parents were vaccinated as soon as they were able. In his circle of family and close friends, there has been no debate.

“Everybody else I’ve talked to has gotten it,” Garrett said.

Garrett, who entered the NFL as the No. 1 pick overall in 2017, is eager to demonstrate his previous form. After returning last season for the Browns’ playoff run, Garrett had lingering effects that seemingly can be linked to sack statistics – just one measure of his prowess.

In the nine games last season before he tested positive for COVID-19, Garrett led the NFL with 9 1⁄2 sacks. Over the course of his final seven games, including two playoff starts, Garrett had 3 1⁄2 sacks.

Asked if he had any concern that the COVID-19 effects will carry over to this season, Garrett dismissed the question as he might brush off some rookie left tackle trying to block him as he attacked with a speed rush.

“I can’t worry about that,” Garrett responded.

In any event, he lost no desire in his mission to go down among the game’s greats. He was the last Browns player off the field — again — after a recent practice as he worked alone for more than a half-hour, finishing up in the grueling heat with a series of wind sprints.

He said, “You’re either going to get better or you’re getting worse.”

In Garrett’s view, that's a matter of choice in more ways than one.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LEXINGTON, Ky. — There’s a crowd of fresh faces vying for playing time at wide receiver for Kentucky football, and Rahsaan Lewis — the son of NFL Hall of Famer Ray Lewis — jumped into the conversation with a couple of terrific catches during an open practice in front of fans Saturday.

He leaped and twisted his body mid-air for two long catches in 11-on-11 drills during UK Fan Day, which generated buzz among fans about the junior walk-on. His father, who was named to 13 Pro Bowls and won two Super Bowls during his 17 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, also took notice of the videos, the younger Lewis said.

“Competition is how I’ve always grown up, it’s how my dad’s raised me, that mentality he has. So I love it. We’re all fighting for the same position, and whoever has it, has it,” Lewis said.

Fifth-year senior Josh Ali and star transfer Wan'Dale Robinson, who was named Mr. Football at Western Hills and earned honorable mention all-Big Ten last year at Nebraska, figure to be the team’s top receiving targets, but a slew of others are seeking the remainder of the snaps at receiver.

“He’s showing up quite a bit, which is really good,” coach Mark Stoops said of Lewis. “That’s a position that we need somebody to show up and make plays, he’s doing that, he’s been consistent.”

Breaking down the Top 25:Analyzing the preseason college football coaches poll

The 5-foot-11 receiver played just one season of football in high school and was primarily a basketball player, averaging 18 points, five assists, four steals and six rebounds per game as a senior point guard. He was so dominant for Windermere Prep (Fla.) on the hardwood that a regional opponent played a diamond-and-one defense in an effort to slow him down.

Lewis said his vertical leap as a high school junior was an impressive 45 inches — for reference, only two players have ever jumped that high in NBA Draft combine history.

He hasn’t recently tested his vertical, so he added a caveat on the eve of his 21st birthday this week: “I’ve gained some weight, I’ve got a little older, (my) body’s not as fresh as it used to be.”

Regardless, his leaping ability has still been noticeable.

“Rahsaan’s a savvy football player who has unbelievable ball skills,” offensive coordinator Liam Cohen said. “And he has like a 40-inch vertical. He can jump through the roof.”

Lewis was also a two-way football standout during his senior year of high school and began his college career at Central Florida, playing defensive back for a season before transferring to Florida Atlantic. After coach Lane Kiffin left for Ole Miss, Lewis again transferred, this time to UK to join his older brother Rayshad, who had previously played at Utah State under Jovon Bouknight, now the Wildcats' wide receivers coach.

“It’s been a rough college career for me, transferring a couple of times, all the injuries and everything,” Rahsaan Lewis said, “so (my goals are) mainly just doing my part, no matter what it is: catching the ball, making a block, making a play.”

Lewis was slowed by injuries in 2020, but if Saturday's performance is any indication, he could very well see the field this season, once again wowing fans; among them may even be his father, the NFL's all-time leading tackler, who Lewis said will attend some games this season.

“I feel that I’m just a playmaker,” Lewis said. “Whether it’s a deep ball, I’m gonna go make a play. Whether you give me the ball on a screen or something short, I’m always trying to make a play.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When J.R. Smith retired from the NBA after 16 years, it seemed as if his athletic career had come to its natural conclusion.

However, the two-time NBA champion who entered the league straight out of high school is starting fresh at 35 years old. He is enrolling at North Carolina A&T, a historically Black university, and is considering competing for the school's Division I golf team.

In high school, Smith committed to the University of North Carolina, but he decided to become a professional before enrolling. Since he never attended college, Smith still has four years of NCAA athletic eligibility should he choose to use them.

“It's a big deal for A&T. It's a big deal for him,” Richard Watkins, the golf coach at A&T, told reporters at the Wyndham Championship pro-am. “It's not very often that somebody in his position really has an opportunity to have a thought, a dream, an idea, and to be able to go ahead and move in that direction."

Smith said he was inspired to go back to college to pursue his degree after talking with Hall of Famer Ray Allen and current Phoenix Suns star Chris Paul about their experiences returning to school. However, neither Allen nor Paul have attempted to play college sports other than basketball.

NCAA rules state that "an individual shall not be eligible for intercollegiate athletics in a sport if the individual ever competed on a professional team in that sport," but since Smith never played professional golf, he retains his eligibility for a college team. He is currently petitioning the NCAA to get around the organization's rule that athletes must complete their four years of eligibility within five years.

Smith began playing golf 12 years ago after attending a charity event for the late Basketball Hall of Famer Moses Malone.

“Golf is one of those games that has you feeling really high and or can bring you down to your knees and humble you,” Smith said. “All of the game’s pretty much on my own hands and I don’t have to worry about teammates to pass the ball and receiving passes and playing defense, so I can play my game and just have fun.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Baylor's football program avoided NCAA sanctions for failing to report allegations of sexual violence by players and for not addressing those issues on its campus.

The Committee on Infractions hearing could not conclude that Baylor violated NCAA rules with its actions, according to a release Wednesday.

The school has been punished by the NCAA after the Bears were found to have violated recruiting rules and provided impermissible benefits to players.

The punishments handed down in the case include four years of probation, a reduction in official and unofficial visits during the 2021-22 academic year and a show-cause order of five years for a former assistant director of football operations.

The decision comes almost 10 years after the NCAA hit Penn State with major sanctions for its handling of child sexual abuse allegations against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. In that case, the school was hit with a four-year postseason ban, a reduction of 10 scholarships in each year of the ban and a $60 million fine. The football program also was forced to vacate 112 victories during a 14-year period.

A lawsuit forced the NCAA to rescind much of the penalties two years later when the organization backed down after emails showed some of its leadership questioned whether it had the jurisdiction to impose sanctions for something outside its purview.

The Committee on Infractions panel overseeing the Baylor case found the football staff's failure to report three instances of alleged actual or threatened violence by football players did not constitute impermissible benefits because of a campus-wide culture of nonreporting.

"Baylor admitted to moral and ethical failings in its handling of sexual and interpersonal violence on campus but argued those failings, however egregious, did not constitute violations of NCAA rules. Ultimately, and with tremendous reluctance, this panel agrees," the panel said in its decision. "To arrive at a different outcome would require the [committee] to ignore the rules the Association's membership has adopted — rules under which the [committee] is required to adjudicate. Such an outcome would be antithetical to the integrity of the infractions process."

NCAA President Mark Emmert suggested the organization's constitution committee being convened in November and national convention in January should be used to create new rules that would make schools culpable for behavior related to sexual violence.

"The conduct by some former Baylor administrators, coaches, and student-athletes described in today's Committee on Infractions decision is unacceptable and runs counter to the values of the NCAA," a statement by Emmert said. "Schools have taken many steps to address sexual violence on campus, but as the COI points out, the authority of the NCAA in this area is very limited today. This is a clear demonstration of why the Association needs transformational change to create alignment between authority and responsibility to address the most critical issues in college sports."

The 51-page report by the Committee on Infractions noted the actions of former Baylor football coach Art Biles, who was fired in 2016 amid the sexual assault scandal. While not attributing an NCAA violation to his behavior, the panel found it "troubling."

"The panel gave careful scrutiny to the head coach's handling of the specific instances of alleged sexual assault, interpersonal violence and threats of violence that are at the center of this case," the report said. "In each instance, when the head coach received information from a staff member regarding potential criminal conduct by a football student-athlete, he did not report the information and did not personally look any further into the matter. He generally relied on the information provided to him by his staff and likewise relied on them to handle problems. His incurious attitude toward potential criminal conduct by his student-athletes was deeply troubling to the panel. "

Briles has not returned to college coaching since his dismissal. Most recently, he coached at Mount Vernon High School in Texas before resigning in 2020.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — New York Jets wide receiver Denzel Mims is healthy this training camp, a year after a series of injuries robbed him of the early part of his rookie season.

But in year two, he's still had to overcome physical adversity. Not because of something that happened on the football field, but because of something he ate.

Mims said he lost 20 pounds during the spring after eating some bad salmon.

"It took a big toll on me," Mims said. "And no, I haven't touched salmon ever since then."

Mims wasn't on the field for most of the offseason program because of his bout with food poisoning. He said he went from 217 pounds down to 197. He hasn't gained all the weight back — he's now about 208 pounds — but he says he's feeling good and ready to contribute after a slow start to training camp.

Missing all that time during the offseason program wasn't ideal for Mims, a 2020 second-round pick who showed promise as a rookie and is hoping to take a big step forward in 2021. The Jets added several new receivers this offseason, including free agents Corey Davis and Keelan Cole and second-round pick Elijah Moore.

So by the time he got back on the field full-time early in training camp, he was playing catch up behind guys who had been working within the new offense throughout the spring.

"Well, it set me back a lot because those guys are out there practicing every day," Mims said. "So I'm trying to do everything I can to make sure I bounce back and catch up to where they are."

There are signs that he's making progress on that front. Mims had the chance to catch several passes from starting quarterback Zach Wilson in practice this week — something we didn't see early in training camp. And he had a long catch from Mike White in Wednesday's practice that drew a big roar from the crowd.

"He’s got that fire right now, man," Wilson said of Mims. "He just wants to be great. He’s really just trying to show everybody what he can do. He’s just doing everything he can to make sure he follows his assignment, gives that full effort. We’re going to do what we can to get him the ball."

The timing for Mims' reemergence couldn't be better with the Jets set to face the Giants on Saturday in the preseason opener (7:30 p.m.) at MetLife Stadium. With Mims getting limited opportunities in recent practices, there was some chatter that the Jets might not be the right long-time fit for the former TCU receiver.

But Jets coach Robert Saleh said that the team feels good about where Mims is at and is looking forward to seeing what he can do in the preseason games.

"There isn't a player on this organization that anyone is ready to give up on," Saleh said. "We’re in the second week of camp so they haven’t even gotten a chance to go against another roster yet. They’ve got three opportunities to go against other rosters and to continue to compete and establish themselves as what we want on this 53-man roster. Every single player is competing their tails off and they’re doing a really good job and I’m just excited for them to get an opportunity to go against a different colored jersey."

Mims didn't get into specifics when asked about how he fits in the offense. His ability to stretch the field and catch the ball in traffic could be an asset for the Jets. But his route-running will need to improve for him to get the most out of an offense that relies on precision in tight spaces.

Mims says he's willing to do whatever it takes to improve and has been putting in extra work before and during practice with the quarterbacks to get up to speed and improve his craft.

But while his spot on the roster is likely safe, it's unclear how much of a role he'll have on this year's team. That will be determined in the coming weeks. And Mims made it clear that he's not worried about losing his spot to other receivers who have been more of the focus this summer. He's focused on fighting for it.

"I mean, you've always got to battle each and every day no matter where you're at," Mims said. "Because if you slack, someone else can take your spot. Worrying? No, I've just got to focus on my job and just continue to be myself and focus on my craft so I can get better."

Aldon Smith's time with the Seattle Seahawks was short as the team released the embattled defensive end Wednesday.

Smith was reinstated by the NFL in the spring of 2020 after he missed four seasons because of off-field issues. He appeared in 16 games for the Dallas Cowboys last season and had five sacks along with 48 tackles.

He signed a one-year deal with Seattle in April, but he was arrested two days later on a second-degree battery charge in St. Bernard Parish near New Orleans. He is scheduled to be arraigned later this month.

Even though Smith missed the Seahawks' offseason program, coach Pete Carroll said early in training camp that the team was ready to support Smith.

Smith was the 11th overall pick by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2011 draft. He set an NFL record with 33 1/2 sacks in his first two seasons before his career spiraled out of control due to multiple drunken-driving charges. He was also arrested in 2018 on a domestic violence charge in San Francisco.

The Seahawks also announced they signed linebacker Lakiem Williams.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Becky Hammon can't wait for the time when it's normal for women to interview for head coaching positions in the NBA and their gender isn't the story.

“It’s huge and important. It’s something that can’t be (checking) the box,” the Spurs assistant told The Associated Press. “You have to hire the best person. Half the world’s population hasn’t been tapped for their mind and ability and skill sets in the sports world. It’s something that needs to change.”

Hammon is entering her eighth season as an assistant and has been interviewed for several head coach openings but hasn't gotten an offer to be the first woman to lead a NBA team.

“There's 30 jobs and they are incredibly hard to get,” Hammon said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “When I saw there are 30 jobs, not all 30 are available, so I'm really talking about three or four and they are really hard to get.”

While Hammon would love to be the first, she hopes it's for the right reasons.

“Please don’t hire me to check a box. That’s the worst thing you can do for me,” she said. “Hire me because of my skill sets and coaching, who am I as a person, hire me for those."

Hammon was a finalist for the Portland Trail Blazers job, which went to Chauncey Billups.

“I can’t speak for organizations across the league and the whole sports world. I can tell you they were asking me legitimate coaching questions,” the 44-year-old said. “When you get to this level, you've got to hire the best person for the job and the person who fits your organization the best.”

Hammon spoke from Las Vegas, where she was watching the NBA summer league, but on Thursday her eyes will be on Phoenix, the site of the inaugural WNBA Commissioner's Cup championship game between Seattle and Connecticut, which will be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.

“It's a really good idea. Another opportunity for people to see these women compete at the highest level,” she said. “It's not foreign to women playing overseas. The WNBA players are used to it.”

She played in a few cup championships while competing overseas during the winters.

“They are always fun, always bonuses in everyone’s contract. That was overseas,” she said. “Put a little something extra on the line.”

While Hammon is excited about the game, not all the players are thrilled by the timing. Five of the Storm's players were at the Tokyo Olympics, including stars Breanna Stewart, Jewell Loyd and Sue Bird, who helped the U.S. win a seventh consecutive gold medal.

“Obviously it's not the best for us,” Stewart said in Tokyo. “We'll see what happens.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nate Burleson will spend more time in front of the CBS cameras after the network announced a new long-term deal with "The NFL Today" analyst Wednesday.

The deal will expand the former wide receiver's role across CBS News and CBS Sports, including joining "CBS This Morning," the network's morning program, as co-host alongside Gayle King and Tony Dokoupil, starting in September. He'll replace longtime journalist Anthony Mason, who will remain with CBS to report on culture.

"This is an extraordinary opportunity, and I look forward to the challenge of upholding the standard set by the legends who came before me,” said Burleson in a statement. “Life is about being ready for the right opportunities, and I have been preparing for this moment since my first day on television."

Burleson, 39, regularly appeared on the network since 2017 when he joined "The NFL Today," the network's pregame, halftime and post-game show. He'll continue as an analyst on the show.

"Nate is an extremely gifted broadcaster, interviewer and storyteller, whose deep curiosity and enthusiasm is the perfect fit for mornings on CBS," said Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations. "His wide range of experience and interests -- from news to sports, from music to poetry, and from fashion to cryptocurrency -- provides a unique perspective that will deepen the show's connection with our viewers. He excites audiences in every arena, and we're fortunate to have Nate joining Gayle and Tony at the table in September."

Burleson's new contract includes yearly appearances on Nickelodeon, which debuted kids-themed NFL coverage in 2020 with Burleson as part of the broadcast team.

He will also continue to have a role on NFL Network, where he most recently served as co-host for the daily show, "Good Morning Football."

Burleson played in the NFL from 2003-13 with the Minnesota Vikings, Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions, compiling 5,630 receiving yards and 39 receiving touchdowns in his career.

"Having a chance to inform, enhance or simply brighten up the morning for our viewers is an honor," Burleson said. "The sport of football and I will always be inextricably intertwined."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The next line of superstars from the nation's best programs lead the USA TODAY Sports preseason All-America teams, including multiple selections from each of the top five teams in the debut USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll.

Oklahoma quarterback Spencer Rattler is the first-team quarterback, with North Carolina's Sam Howell drawing second-team honors. Other first-team skill players include Iowa State running back Breece Hall, Ohio State wide receiver Chris Olave and Alabama wide receiver John Metchie.

Olave is one of four Buckeyes to earn All-America accolades, joining offensive lineman Thayer Munford, defensive lineman Haskell Garrett and fellow receiver Garrett Wilson. Another three Alabama standouts join Metchie, including first-team offensive lineman Evan Neal and first-team linebacker Will Anderson.

Clemson leads the way with six picks, including sophomore defensive lineman Bryan Bresee and wide receiver Justyn Ross, who is healthy after missing all of last season. Iowa State has four selections, with Hall and linebacker Mike Rose earning first-team honors.

FIRST TEAM

Offense

QB: Spencer Rattler, Oklahoma (So.)

After a sluggish start, Rattler tossed 18 touchdowns and just three interceptions as the Sooners closed last season on an eight-game winning streak. He's the next OU quarterback in heavy contention for the Heisman Trophy.

RB: Breece Hall, Iowa State (Jr.)

RB: Bijan Robinson, Texas (So.)

Hall could challenge for 2,000 rushing yards after averaging 131 yards per game and scoring 21 touchdowns in an abbreviated 2020 season. Robinson came on strong late in his debut year and should be the focal point of new Texas coach Steve Sarkisian's explosive offensive scheme.

WR: Chris Olave, Ohio State (Sr.)

WR: John Metchie, Alabama (Jr.)

TE: Charlie Kolar, Iowa State (Sr.)

Olave (50 receptions for 729 yards in 2020) turned down a spot in the first round of this past spring's NFL draft for another chance at bullying Big Ten defensive backs on a weekly basis. Metchie will step into Alabama's void at wide receiver and help new quarterback Bryce Young slide into the starting job. Kolar (44 receptions for 591 yards), Hall and ISU quarterback Brock Purdy form as good a trio as you'll see in the Football Bowl Subdivision.

OL: Evan Neal, Alabama (Jr.)

OL: Kenyon Green, Texas A&M (Jr.)

OL: Tyler Linderbaum, Iowa (Jr.)

OL: Darian Kinnard, Kentucky (Sr.)

OL: Thayer Munford, Ohio State (Sr.)

Neal has the athleticism, aggressiveness and smarts to rank among the most dominant Alabama linemen of the Nick Saban era. Green is the linchpin of an offensive front that led the SEC in 2020 in sacks allowed per game and yards per carry. Linderbaum is the preseason favorite for the Rimington Trophy, given annually to the best center in the country. Kinnard is poised to lock down a spot among the best offensive linemen in Kentucky's history. Munford is a three-time All-Big Ten pick.

Defense

DL: Kayvon Thibodeaux, Oregon (So.)

DL: Haskell Garrett, Ohio State (Sr.)

DL: Bryan Bresee, Clemson (So.)

DL: DeMarvin Leal, Texas A&M (Jr.)

Thibodeaux is an absolute menace who has lived up to his billing as the nation's top-ranked recruit — even as he's still managed to fly under the radar. A late bloomer, Garrett was enormously disruptive after stepping into the starting lineup for the first time in 2020. Bresee has the potential to be seen as the best defender (and even the best overall player) in the FBS before his college career is done. Leal (37 tackles, 7.0 tackles for loss) is one of many talented prospects who have flourished under Jimbo Fisher and his staff as the Aggies take aim at the national championship.

LB: Nik Bonitto, Oklahoma (Jr.)

LB: Mike Rose, Iowa State (Sr.)

LB: Will Anderson, Alabama (So.)

Bonitto (32 tackles, 8.0 sacks) grades out as the best edge rusher in the country. But Rose (96 tackles) is the most impactful defender in the Big 12 from his spot on the second level of the Cyclones' defense. The sky is the limit for Anderson, who has already proven himself to be one of the best in the SEC.

CB: Ahmad Gardner, Cincinnati (Jr.)

CB: Derek Stingley Jr., LSU (Jr.)

S: Brandon Joseph, Northwestern (So.)

S: Kyle Hamilton, Notre Dame (Jr.)

Gardner is the star of a Cincinnati defense that ranked third nationally in 2020 in interceptions and pass-efficiency defense. As he heads into his third and likely final season with the Tigers, Stingley already has accumulated enough accolades to rank among the most decorated defensive backs in program history — quite a statement given the Tigers' track record at cornerback and safety. Joseph pulled down an FBS-best six interceptions as a freshman. Hamilton (63 tackles) is one of the most complete players in the country.

Special teams

K: Cade York, LSU (Jr.)

P: Lou Hedley, Miami (Jr.)

RET: Aron Cruickshank, Rutgers (Jr.)

York leads the SEC with 39 made field goals during the past two seasons. Hedley (47.2 yards per punt) is an absolute boomer with the leg to flip field position in the Hurricanes' favor. Cruickshank (26.8 yards per return) is the only player in the FBS with multiple kickoff returns for touchdowns in each of the past two years.

Story continues below video:

SECOND TEAM

Offense

QB: Sam Howell, North Carolina (Jr.)

RB: Deuce Vaughn, Kansas State (So.)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One day after the NWSL's Washington Spirit announced that former coach Richie Burke was being reassigned to the organization's front office, a report came out that alleges Burke was emotionally abusive toward players.

In the report from the Washington Post, former Spirit defender Kaiya McCullough said she quit the sport last season because of Burke's treatment.

The Post said McCullough is one of at least four players who have left the club because of Burke.

“I was 100 percent in a situation where I was being emotionally abused by Richie,” McCullough told the Washington Post. “He created this environment where I knew I wasn’t playing as well, because I was so, so scared to mess up and be yelled at. It crippled my performance, and it made me super anxious.”

McCullough also told the Post that Burke made racially insensitive jokes off the field that made her feel “very uncomfortable.”

McCullough identifies as Black.

“He made me hate soccer,” McCullough added.

On Tuesday, the Spirit had announced that Burke was being reassigned to the front office, citing health issues.

But on Wednesday, after the report was published, Spirit managing partner Steve Baldwin issued a statement indicating that the Washington Post contacted the organization “on the heels” of the team's announcement of Burke's reassignment.

“We take these allegations very seriously and are undertaking an immediate investigation,” Baldwin said in the statement. “Burke has been suspended pending the investigation and is prohibited from contacting players and staff and our facilities. We, as a team, will not tolerate any situation for our players and staff that is less than professional. Our athletes, and all of those who support them, deserve the absolute best.”

The Post said the NWSL confirmed an investigation, under the league's anti-harassment policy.

The Post reported that two players spoke to the newspaper under the condition of anonymity, citing concerns of retaliation. The report also indicated that a fourth player declined to comment, but that the allegations of abusive behavior were corroborated by two other people with knowledge of the situation.

The two players who spoke anonymously said Burke was “unbelievably volatile” and alleged that he targeted certain players with “personal attacks” under the threat of losing their jobs. Burke called players “dog (expletive)” and “a waste of space,” the players said.

“I cried after practice a few times,” McCullough told the Post. “Once it became clear how (Burke) coached, what the culture was with the coaching staff, I went into survival mode. You can only do that for so long and still find joy in what you do.”

In a separate report, the Washington Post said that the Spirit defended Burke shortly after he was hired in 2018, when two former youth players called him “emotionally abusive” while Burke coached them.

“I read it, and I was immediately like: ‘How did this guy get hired? Those seem like really credible allegations,’ ” McCullough said. “But it felt like they pushed that to the side, and nothing ever came of it. I got the impression that people didn’t care.”

The Post reported that during one game, Burke was chastising a rookie, when she appeared to have a panic attack on the sideline, clutching her chest because she could not breathe. One of the players who spoke to the Post anonymously said Burke continued berating the rookie, saying, “When he smells blood, he goes harder.”

McCullough also described an incident during a small preseason dinner, in which she alleges that Burke used the n-word in front of her, while trying to describe a moment when Burke defended her sister from racial abuse.

“It wasn’t directed at me, but it was still very deeply jarring, and very uncomfortable, to hear a white person say that,” McCullough said.

According to the report, McCullough also said that Burke allegedly made a joke about a player who had been hit in the face by saying “Black eyes matter,” a reference to the Black Lives Matter movement. McCullough said that another time, when players posed for a photo of themselves kneeling on the field, Burke made a joke that they should pose while kneeling on top of a white, inflatable practice dummy, this coming in the wake of the death of George Floyd.

The Spirit are currently seventh in the NWSL standings with a record of 5-5-3 and are in danger of missing the postseason.

“Being in that position made me feel small. That’s not something I’ve ever felt in my whole life, and it’s not something I’d ever want someone else to feel,” McCullough said. “The other thing it made me feel was betrayed. I feel betrayed that people would put me in that position.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mitchell Trubisky knew that his time in Chicago was coming to an end a year before it actually did.

In the spring of 2020, the Bears opted against exercising the fifth-year option on the original contract they awarded Trubisky after making him the second overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, a rather uncommon occurrence when it involves a quarterback.

When that happened, the Bears might as well have just rented a plane to fly over the quarterback’s Chicagoland home with a banner that read “It’s been nice knowing you” as they plunged Trubisky into a state of limbo.

The decision meant that barring a breakthrough performance in 2020 that could not be ignored, the team had already made up its mind that it was going to move on from Trubisky and allow him to test the free agent market heading into 2021.

BIG DEAL:Josh Allen's extension is a testament to Bills' carefully executed plan

“I kind of saw it coming, just the way I was progressing,” Trubisky said Tuesday following practice with his new Buffalo Bills teammates. “Year two was really good and then year three and four, not as good; I was dealing with some injuries and some other things going on there. It was disappointing but it wasn’t a surprise. You can kind of see that they were just continuously believing in me less and less and that’s just kind of how that process went.”

Trubisky’s agents pursued opportunities where he could compete for a starting job, but nothing came to fruition.

“Not as many options as you think,” Trubisky said of his market. “It was a very interesting free agency process for me, first time going through it, so I tried to be patient ... tried to reach out to a lot of people that I trust. At first, I wanted to go to a spot where I would be able to compete for a starting position, but the right situation didn’t come up.”

So Trubisky made the decision to take what he could get, even if it was a clear cut backup job, so that he could continue to work on his game and hopefully take another swing at the market in 2022.

The Bills were thrilled to hear that and they pounced quickly, offering a one-year, $2.5 million deal for him to caddie for Josh Allen.

“I looked at the next best thing where I could continue to develop and continue to progress and become a better player and a person,” he said. “I fell into this organization and I’ve loved it ever since coming to Buffalo. Just working with this coaching staff, being with the caliber type of players that we’ve got here, the people, and using all the resources, it’s just really nice to be a part of a great team.”

Allen has ascended to superstar status following his 2020 performance and as of last week, he’s now being paid like one, too. He is as entrenched as any starter in the league, but at least now, if something were to happen to him, the Bills have a backup who would, in all likelihood, be able to step in and keep the offense from falling apart.

“Mitch has been a really good addition since he’s been here,” said offensive coordinator Brian Daboll. “A guy that’s played 50-some games, has seen a lot of football. Standing back at that position, it’s different than watching it from the press box or watching it from the sideline or anything like that. There’s things that have happened to him throughout his young career so far that I think can help Josh and assist Josh, and vice-versa. I’m glad we have Mitch.”

Said Allen: “Yeah, Mitch has been awesome. He’s quickly developed into one of my good friends. He comes in with a great attitude every day and he’s working his tail off and he’s not afraid to ask questions about the offense. He’s here to help this team win in whatever way that may be. We’re lucky to have him, I’ll tell you that.”

Trubisky was a lightning rod for criticism throughout his rocky four-year tenure in Chicago. The Bears traded up to the No. 2 spot in the 2017 draft to get him, and that move raised eyebrows the moment commissioner Roger Goodell announced the pick.

The native of Mentor, Ohio, had been a starter in college just one season at North Carolina and the draft community was split regarding his NFL pedigree. It also didn’t help him or the Bears that later in that first round, the Chiefs picked Patrick Mahomes 10th overall and the Texans took Deshaun Watson at No. 12.

Clearly, Trubisky never breathed in the same stratosphere as those two during their first four years in the league together, but while his 64 TDs and 37 interceptions and a 87.2 passer rating were mediocre, he wasn’t as bad as many in Chicago painted him to be.

“You’re playing in one of the biggest markets in the country and it’s a tough football town,” he said of Chicago. “I went out there and won games. People are always gonna have something to say about your journey and what everything goes to, but not everybody could have done what I did.”

What he did was produce a regular season record of 29-21 as a starter and helped get the Bears to the playoffs twice. Pre-Allen, Bills fans would have gladly taken the record Trubisky put together in Chicago, but in the Windy City, it wasn’t enough.

In 2018 he led the Bears to the NFC Central crown when he won 11 of the 14 games he started, but that season ended bitterly with a 16-15 home field loss to the Eagles, a game in which Trubisky threw for 303 yards and a touchdown.

Last year he split the starts with Nick Foles and while the Bears were 2-5 under Foles, they were 6-3 under Trubisky. Again, though, the Bears lost in the postseason, this time 21-9 at New Orleans and Trubisky passed for just 199 yards in his final Chicago appearance.

“I really don’t like to dwell on the past and I don’t want to go too far into it, but the point of this game is to win,” he said. “Stats are stats, numbers are numbers. What I was trying to do is go out there and win games so I feel like now, if given the opportunity, I could go out there and help my team win. I know my role here and I’m just trying to get better. But the past is past, I’m not really trying to dwell on it. People are always gonna have something to say, but I’m just happy to be where I am right now.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BALTIMORE — The collision looked awful and seems likely to impact the Detroit Tigers moving forward.

Anthony Santander crushed a fly ball between Tigers left fielder Akil Baddoo and center fielder Derek Hill, with reliever Michael Fulmer pitching in the eighth inning of Tuesday's 9-4 win over the Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

Baddoo and Hill, who made the catch, ran into each other and dropped to the warning track in pain. Both players exited the game with injures.

"It was a ball hit probably in the perfect spot for both guys to be going full speed and both with a chance to catch it," manager AJ Hinch said. "You don't see it a lot at this level, but when you see them, they're nasty. Two big, physical athletes."

Hinch provided immediate updates on Baddoo and Hill, two of the most exciting young players on the roster, but they're still undergoing tests.

"Akil is getting checked out for a concussion and shoulder," Hinch said. "I'll be surprised if he doesn't need at least a few days, if not an (injured list) stint. Derek's getting his ribs checked out. It looked like Akil's head went right into his ribcage. I think Derek's elbow smoked Akil."

"When I got out there, both guys were pretty beat up and in a lot of pain. Very scary incident, and hopefully it's just minimal at best. I just talked to Akil in the clubhouse, so he's alert and doing OK, just a little beat up. I haven't seen Derek yet."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Recently retired quarterback Alex Smith will join ESPN as an NFL analyst, according to a report Wednesday.

The New York Post reported that Smith, who most recently played for the Washington Football Team, will appear on shows such as "Monday Night Countdown" but will not hold a full-time position. The Post reported, however, that the deal could turn into a long-term commitment.

Smith, 37, announced his retirement from the NFL in April after he successfully completed a comeback from a gruesome leg injury.

After suffering a compound fracture to his right tibia and fibula in a November 2018 game against the Houston Texans, Smith underwent 17 surgeries and sat out the entire 2019 season. He also developed sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication from an infection, and had to wear a brace to combat his drop foot.

Smith won the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year award last season for his efforts in returning to the field. He went 5-1 as a starter and helped Washington secure the NFC East title.

The Post also reported that Smith also had tryouts with CBS and FOX to become a Sunday game analyst, but that FOX opted to hire another retired NFL quarterback, Mark Sanchez, instead. The Post reported that CBS will not be filling the role left vacant by former analyst and another retired quarterback, Rich Gannon.

Smith played 16 seasons in the NFL. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, he finished his career with 35,650 passing yards on a 62.6% completion rate, with 199 touchdowns versus 109 interceptions.

He was the No. 1 overall selection by the San Franisco 49ers in the 2005 NFL draft. After spending the first eight seasons of his career with the 49ers, he was traded to the Chiefs and later was dealt to Washington.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@DYERSVILLE, Ia. — It’s a little after 2:30 p.m. on a hot summer afternoon when a car with a Wisconsin license plate creeps down the gravel road of the "Field of Dreams" movie site.

The car, full of visitors in the front and back seats, stops before it gets to the famed ball diamond. The driver rolls down the window to greet Marcia Weigel, who is taking donations and providing directions.

“You can walk, run or crawl the bases,” Weigel tells the group.

It’s a conversation Weigel, a resident of Dyersville who was an extra in the 1989 movie, has been having for hours this July day. Cars with plates from Missouri, Colorado, California and beyond have also made their way down Lansing Road in rural northeast Iowa in a pilgrimage to a ballpark made famous by Hollywood and enjoying renewed interest because of the Major League Baseball game to be played here this month.

MLB POWER RANKINGS:Phillies surge to first place, Mets fall apart in NL East

On Aug. 12, the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox, two historic franchises featured in the film, will play in the first official MLB game in Iowa history on a specially built field right next to the diamond featured in the movie.

“Because of the MLB game, a lot of people like to try to go back there to see it,” Weigel said. “But of course, you know, they can’t go back there (to the new field)."

In the movie, James Earl Jones' character sketches a vision for farmer Ray Kinsella, played by Kevin Costner, of a mystical baseball field built out of Iowa cornfields that will lure people who are seeking to reconnect with childhood memories of baseball and are yearning for simpler times.

“People will come, Ray," Jones says, "people will most definitely come.”

And they have, baseball fans and movie buffs alike.

After MLB announced in August of 2019 that two teams would play here, people have flocked to Dyersville in record numbers. The matchup will be broadcast nationally on FOX.

"This is as big as it gets," said Roman Weinberg, director of operations for Go The Distance, the organization that owns and operates the movie site. "Especially in baseball, there's no bigger platform than Major League Baseball. When you get someone of that … caliber shining the spotlight on your location, all you can do is tip your cap, smile and say, 'Thank you very much.'"

After announcement: 'Hundreds or thousands of calls that same day'

The game had an immediate impact on Dyersville the moment it was announced. Tickets would not be sold for two more years, but the phone at the Super 8 by Wyndham in Dyersville rang nonstop. People wanted to make sure they had a place to crash if they were lucky enough to land the hottest ticket in baseball.

And with only three hotels in the city of about 4,000, it made for a busy day for hotel staff.

"We probably had almost hundreds or thousands of calls that same day," said Dipen Patel, the hotel's general manager.

But the 2020 game never happened. MLB eventually pulled the plug and rescheduled it for 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, interest never waned. Patel said as soon as a makeup date for 2021 was scheduled, the phones started ringing again.

Four months before the game, the majority of his 45 rooms were booked.

Kathy Polfer, manager of the Plaza Antique Mall in Dyersville, has seen business pick up, and it hasn't stopped. The business has over 150 vendors selling antiques, farm toys and, since the 2019 announcement, as many "Field of Dreams" collectibles as they can.

"We've seen a great increase," Polfer said.

Karla Thompson, executive director of the Dyersville Area Chamber of Commerce, said other businesses, including boutiques and home décor stores, have benefited, too, as national media have done stories on the town.

"We were up to 120% just on the website views and hits," Thompson said. "That was back in June."

New life for the movie site — for years?

In the movie, Kinsella plows under his corn to build a baseball field for Joe Jackson and other members of the 1919 White Sox team, banished for gambling on baseball. Soon, ghosts of baseball legends materialize from out of the corn. The farm faces bankruptcy because of Kinsella's supposedly foolish decision to destroy his crop, but by the movie's end, a string of headlights of cars headed to the field signals that tourists will indeed come, and the farm will be saved.

Just like in the movie, the diamond became a tourist attraction — but not without plenty of controversy along the way. Land from two farms was used for the diamond, and the families that owned the farms feuded in and out of court for years, even operating competing souvenir stands on opposite sides of the field. Then Dyersville was roiled by yet-unrealized plans to build a youth sports complex near the diamond, envisioned as hosting tournaments for traveling teams and bringing jobs to the region.

Still, through 32 years, people have come.

On a warm July day this year, Sam Stein stands on the mound at the "Field of Dreams" diamond and gets ready to throw a pitch to a random stranger.

Stein, 47, is from Wilmington, Delaware, and made the stop here with his two sons and a friend.

"Nothing hot back up the middle," Stein says as he gets ready to throw.

The four had never been to the site before. After watching the movie together earlier that week, they showed up in Dyersville, walked in and out of the outfield cornfield, played catch and took hacks in the batter's box.

"We got to do everything we wanted to do," Stein said. "It was great.”

That's how most visits go. The difference these days is how many fans are coming.

In past years, most visitors have come during the summer, then traffic dies down after Labor Day. When the game was announced in 2019, the site welcomed a record 150,000 visitors. This year, Weinberg expects to see traffic through the fall and hit 200,000 visitors.

"It's put us on another platform and has helped us reach a whole other level of brand awareness for baseball fans and the national and international markets out there," Weinberg said.

Some visitors had never heard of the movie site until MLB announced the game, Weinberg said. The league has featured the site heavily since, and FOX included shots of the new park during the All-Star Game earlier this summer.

"Is it a godsend?" Weinberg says. "Yes, I would say so."

Weinberg hopes the renewed attention could propel the organization's goal of putting in youth baseball fields near the original diamond.

Jessica Molnar, from Arizona, had hoped to visit before construction started on the new MLB field. When she and her family came to Dyersville in July while visiting relatives in Iowa, it was too late for that. Final preparations on a MLB park were underway.

"I just hope it doesn't take some of the beauty away from it," Molnar said of the movie site diamond.

Rolling out the red carpet

A busy week lies ahead for Dyersville and the movie site — and how the week goes could influence the area's future for years to come.

City leaders have organized live music, vendors and a movie viewing the night before the game. Fans without precious tickets — distributed in a lottery for Iowans only and sold for $375 apiece or available on StubHub for up to $11,000 or more — can gather for a viewing of the game in the city square.

It's another opportunity for businesses in town to shine — and profit.

"We are looking to roll out the red carpet and welcome all the guests," said Polfer, the antiques mall manager. "And we hope they find us."

It's possible MLB could make a trip to Dyersville part of its calendar for future seasons, as it has with the Little League Classic in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. That prospect may hinge on how Dyersville and the "Field of Dreams" movie site does with hosting the game.

Both are working hard to make a good showing. The city has helped MLB find volunteers for the game, including ushers. Go The Distance has provided its iconic diamond as a spot for fans to walk on during their trek over to the new field.

Polfer and others in Dyersville would love for an MLB game to become a regular event.

"That would be wonderful," Polfer said of an annual return by MLB. "It would be a game-changer."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@CHICAGO — For the second time this season, Corbin Burnes etched his name into the major-league record book.

Burnes became only the third pitcher in major-league history – yet the second this season – to strike out 10 batters in a row, keeping the Milwaukee Brewers in command after a seven-run first inning that propelled them to a 10-0 victory Wednesday night over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.

Following a doubleheader sweep the previous day, the Brewers boosted their record to 23 games over .500 (69-46) for the first time this season and have won 12 of 15 meetings with the Cubs, including eight in a row.

With the Cincinnati Reds' 11-inning loss in Atlanta, the first-place Brewers also boosted their lead in the NL Central to eight games, matching their season high.

Burnes, who established a major-league mark by striking out 58 hitters to begin the year before issuing his first walk, tied the record of 10 consecutive strikeouts established by Hall of Famer Tom Seaver on April 22, 1970 and matched by Philadelphia’s Aaron Nola on June 25 of this season.

Burnes went on to record a career-high 15 strikeouts over eight innings, the highest individual total in franchise history behind Ben Sheets’ 18 strikeouts against Atlanta on May 16, 2004. He allowed only four hits and issued no walks in throwing 74 of his 99 pitches for strikes, a 75% rate.

Burnes' battery mate, catcher Omar Narváez, paced the offense by going 3 for 3 with four RBI, reaching base four times with a walk, two singles, a two-run home run and sacrifice fly.

Veteran right-hander Jake Arrieta, last seen by the Brewers being unable to hold a 7-0 lead in the first inning on June 30 in Milwaukee, this time saw the 7-0 lead go the other way. Kolten Wong started the rally with a double and capped it with another double, and there were many, many hits in between.

Christian Yelich scored Wong by punching a hit through the left side and Willy Adames followed with another hit in that direction. The runners moved up when Eduardo Escobar grounded out to first and both scored when Narváez singled to right and Greg Deichmann let it get past for an error.

Avisaíl García was hit on the left hand by a pitch and exited the game with what proved to be a bruise but was ruled to have gone around on the pitch and did not get the base. Tyrone Taylor took over he at-bat and singled to right, scoring Narváez.

After a single by Rowdy Tellez, Lorenzo Cain’s double into the left-field corner scored both Taylor and Tellez to make it 6-0. Cain moved to third on a grounder to second by Burnes and scored when Wong collected his second double of the inning. Tellez would exit in the third inning with discomfort in his right knee.

Unlike Arrieta the last time he faced the Brewers, Burnes had no intention of letting a 7-0 first-inning lead disappear. It was still 7-0 when the Brewers scored their next run in the fourth on a sacrifice fly by Narváez in the last inning Arrieta would pitch.

By that time, Burnes was well into his streak of 10 consecutive strikeouts. He struck out the side in the second, third and fourth innings, all nine hitters going down swinging.

When Frank Schwindel struck out for the second consecutive time, Burnes had a piece of the big-league record. Matt Duffy wasn’t about to become victim No. 11, swinging at the first pitch he saw from Burnes, a fastball down in the zone, lining it the other way to right for a base hit.

Burnes then caught Deichmann looking at a called third strike, giving him 11 whiffs in a span of 12 batters.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On the eve of MLB's first regular season game in Iowa, the Register has learned that talks are underway for the Chicago Cubs to potentially play in a future game at the "Field of Dreams" site.

The news initially broke when Cubs manager David Ross seemingly insinuated to Chicago reporters before his team's Wednesday game that the Cubs would be playing in another MLB "Field of Dreams" game next year, according to NBC Sports reporter Gordon Wittenmyer and other media on hand.

Wittenmyer reported that Ross then tried to walk back those comments.

However, a baseball source with direct knowledge told The Register on Wednesday evening that there's momentum behind the idea of the Cubs playing near the "Field of Dreams" site in rural northeast Iowa that the MLB constructed. The source said the Cubs would be one of the teams featured if the MLB returns for a future game in Dyersville, Iowa.

There have been no official announcements regarding the future of the ballpark built for Thursday night's game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox.

Roman Weinberg, the director of operations for Go The Distance, which owns and operates the "Field of Dreams" movie site,recently told The Register this week that his No. 1 goal for the future of the newly constructed ballpark is for Major League Baseball to play more games there in the future.

In an interview with The Register last week, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred didn't rule out a return visit. He said he wanted to see how things went in Dyersville before deciding if another game could come.

"It is important for us to play live in states where we don't play on a regular basis, and I think Iowa certainly fits that bill," Manfred said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Memphis basketball assistant coach Larry Brown contracted the delta variant of COVID-19 following the 2021 Nike EYBL Peach Jam Basketball Tournament last month. Brown disclosed the news during an appearance on the Jason and John Show on 92.9 FM ESPN Friday.

"Unfortunately I got sick, right after it was over, I got that delta variant, and I was kind of out for about 10 to 12 days, but I'm all good now and anxious to get back," Brown said.

Brown, 80, is vaccinated and said he has made a full recovery.

The recent hire attended the event with coach Penny Hardaway. He said that his favorite part of traveling was being able to spend time with Hardaway. While at the tournament in Augusta, South Carolina, the two coaches saw recent Memphis signee Jalen Duren play.

Brown compared Duren to a young version of Shawn Kemp, citing his athleticism and size as two factors that remind him of the six-time NBA All-Star.

He added that what stands out about Duren is his attitude.

"He just seems like a great teammate who wants to get better, and those are the people that I think Penny is lookin to recruit, and those are the kind of kids I want to be associated with, you know having an open mind, want to come to practice every day want to get better, and I think that's entirely what Jalen is about," Brown said.

Brown said he had been on a Zoom call with Hardaway and Duren before as well and was impressed by his maturity. According to Brown, Duren turned down an offer of over a million dollars to play in the G League, as well as offers from other top basketball programs.

"When you're able to compete against Miami and Kentucky for a kid, it tells you what they think of Penny, of his program and what he's trying to build," Brown said.

Brown said other factors that may have pushed Duren to college basketball over the G League.He would prefer young athletes to assimilate into a college environment that teaches them the importance of an education.

"I wish the NBA would realize that college basketball might be the greatest minor league system that we have ... I really think they're going to do away with this one-and-done because of this likeness. I'm not opposed to that ... but a lot of times kids that make that decision really aren't ready, and we don't talk about those kids that fail. I think the system fails more than the kids fail," Brown said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Matt Prater's 47-yard field goal as time expired sent the Arizona Cardinals to a 19-16 win over the Dallas Cowboys on Friday night in their preseason opener at State Farm Stadium.

Prater made all four of his kicks and former Arizona State running back Eno Benjamin scored on a 6-yard touchdown run in the Cardinals' first preseason game in almost two years. Benjamin, a seventh-round draft pick in 2020 who wasn't active for any games last season, had a 35-yard kickoff return in the first half and, after starting the second half, broke off a 38-yard run to set up a Cardinals field goal. He totaled 50 rushing yards.

The largest crowd (59,954 fans) to see a Cardinals game since the 2019 regular season saw the home team play without a number of stars and regulars, including quarterback Kyler Murray, wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, linebacker Chandler Jones and safety Budda Baker.

No more than 4,200 fans saw a Cardinals game last season amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Great to experience the fans. It feels like football is normal again," said quarterback Colt McCoy, who got the start in place of Murray.

Head coach Kliff Kingsbury wasn't completely conservative on offense, calling a direct snap to running back Chase Edmonds and a deep pass from McCoy to Christian Kirk in the first quarter.

The Cardinals went to rookie second-round draft pick Rondale Moore often early in the game, with short passes and end-arounds designed to get the speedster out into the open field.

Moore's yardage on the second possession of the game for the Cardinals set up a 33-yard Prater field goal.

Rookie Zaven Collins started at linebacker and played the first three defensive series for the Cardinals. The 2021 first-round pick tackled well and was calling signals in the huddle.

"It was more than what I thought it would be. When you're in the NFL, you're like, 'This is the best,' " Collins said. "I felt pretty poised. I felt pretty comfortable within our defense, with our schemes that we had drawn up."

After cornerback Daryl Worley forced a fumble midway through the second quarter, Chris Streveler came in for McCoy at quarterback and ran up the middle for a 23-yard gain, colliding with Cowboys safety Israel Mukuamu rather than sliding or going down on his own.

That play energized the crowd, which roared when Benjamin scored to make it 10-3 before halftime.

"Everything about (Friday) night felt great. Just going out there with my teammates and being back here in Arizona was also another thing that made it a little bit easier as far suiting up for the night," Benjamin said.

"It wasn't too big for them," Kingsbury said of his young players. "I know it's just a preseason game, but there's fans in the stands and it's NFL football and it's playing the Dallas Cowboys. I thought they went out there and competed. It looked like the effort was good."

Streveler's 10 carries for 55 yards led the Cardinals in rushing for the game. He also completed 12 of 24 passes for 107 yards. The Cardinals gave up four sacks but did not sack the Cowboys QBs once.

Marco Wilson and Tay Gowan, a pair of rookie cornerbacks, showed well in their NFL preseason debuts. Wilson had four tackles and two pass breakups.

Benjamin's long run in the third quarter set up another Prater field goal. But the Cardinals defense, made up of backups and roster hopefuls in the second half, lost the lead in the fourth quarter before the offense rallied the team.

Streveler led a late-game drive and got the Cardinals to the Dallas 25-yard line with 1:55 to play. After a sack and false start penalty on fourth down, Arizona was given another fourth-down play, and Prater booted a 48-yard field goal.

Then the Cardinals' defense held, the offense got the ball back with 51 seconds left and Streveler engineered the winning drive.

" 'Strev,' just very scrappy there at the end. Made play after play and was getting knocked around and kept getting up and kept fighting and found a way at the end," Kingsbury said.

Notes

— There were two announced injuries in the game for the Cardinals. RB Jonathan Ward left the game in the third quarter with an ankle injury, and S Chris Banjo also came out in the second half with a hamstring injury.

— Kingsbury didn't indicate that Murray, Hopkins, Jones and Baker were injured. He noted that they all had a good week of practice and were simply held out.

— The Cardinals left an empty seat in the State Farm Stadium press box, reserved and decorated with flowers and framed photos for the late Pedro Gomez, a former Arizona Republic sports writer who was one of the country's leading baseball journalists before his death in February at age 58.

On Thursday night, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox played a game that rivaled Hollywood fairy tales. It was the first official MLB game played in Iowa, in a ballpark built among the Dyersville's corn fields where the iconic 1989 movie "Field of Dreams" was shot.

The game, with its Hollywood ending and its setting within America's heartland, was the most-watched regular season MLB game in 16 years, with 5.9 million viewers across FOX and FOX Deportes. It was also the most streamed regular season baseball game in FOX Sports history. Chicago and New York ranked as the top two markets.

Kevin Costner and the two teams emerged from the corn stalks in the outfield before the lineups were announced. The score was kept on a board built with wood planks. And in the bottom of the ninth, with a runner on first, Chicago's Tim Anderson crushed a pitch and the baseball disappeared within the sea of green stalks that embraced the outfield wall to give the White Sox a 9-8 walk-off win.

The game was originally planned to be played last year, however the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the league's plans. That originally-planned game also included the Yankees and White Sox, but due to 2020's pod scheduling the Yankees were replaced by the St. Louis Cardinals. But the game was ultimately scrapped and moved to this year, with the Yankees picked to play the White Sox once again.

Before the pitches were thrown and runs were scored, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred confirmed that the league will return to play another game in Dyersville.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Associated Press

SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Joe Thornton’s pursuit of an elusive Stanley Cup is bringing him to the Florida Panthers at age 42.

The forward signed a one-year deal Friday, making Florida his fourth franchise in a now 24-year NHL career. He has more points than any other active NHL player and is 14th all-time on that list with 1,529.

The 13 players ahead of him in points are in the Hall of Fame.

“I see their team on paper, I watched their team last year, I love their team and that's it," Thornton said. “I love what they're building and I'm excited to be part of it. But everything is about ultimately winning the Stanley Cup and the Panthers are right there in my opinion."

Thornton said he watched Florida's playoff series with Tampa Bay last spring and was impressed by what he saw from the Panthers. The Lightning went on to win the Stanley Cup, their second consecutive title. The Panthers have spent a summer making moves to get closer to that level, and Thornton was contacted by the Panthers weeks ago in an effort to make him part of the mix.

“With more than 1,600 games played in the NHL, Joe will bring a wealth of experience to our locker room and lineup,” Panthers general manager Bill Zito said. “His drive to succeed is unmistakable and we are thrilled that he chose to sign with our club and that he believes in what we are building here in South Florida.”

Conversations with the Panthers' braintrust — including Zito, head coach Joel Quenneville and his former Team Canada teammate Roberto Luongo — helped convince Thornton this was the right move, he said.

“The energy these guys bring every day, they want to work every day, they want to get better every day," Thornton said. “I'm just really looking forward to joining them on the journey."

Thornton has done about all there is in hockey, except win a Stanley Cup. He went to the final once, with San Jose in 2016 when the Sharks lost in six games to the Pittsburgh Penguins.

He’s won an Olympic gold medal with Canada in 2010, the Hart Trophy as the league’s MVP in 2005-06 and the scoring title that same season.

He was the No. 1 pick in the 1997 draft and started his career playing parts of eight seasons with Boston. He then went on to a 15-year run with the Sharks and spent last season with Toronto — scoring five goals in 44 games.

Thornton has been playing on essentially a year-to-year basis for the last few seasons, taking time each summer to decide if it was right to return. He said in June, after Toronto’s season ended, that he hadn't made up his mind and wanted to focus on being a father before settling on any plans.

“We’ll see,” Thornton said at the time.

And then the Panthers called, with the offer that helped Thornton — the second-oldest skater in the NHL last season behind Zdeno Chara — decide that it wasn’t time to retire quite yet. He's been going through two-a-day workouts for much of the summer and is convinced he can still contribute at the NHL level.

“The body feels good, the mind feels good and I knew pretty much after the season, I started training right away and I felt good," Thornton said. “Here we go again."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This story is part of USA TODAY Sports' 25 days to college football countdown.

A fixture in the race for the College Football Playoff, Oklahoma's championship hopes feel even more legitimate thanks to the growth of a defense that is suddenly an asset, not a liability.

Last season saw the Sooners hold five straight conference opponents to 400 or fewer yards of offense, the program's longest such streak since 2012. After giving up 40 points per game against its first three Big 12 foes, OU allowed just 17 points per game and 4.2 yards per play in closing 7-0, capped by a 55-20 win against Florida in the Cotton Bowl.

It's a simple formula: OU's offense, plus this defense, makes the Sooners tough to beat. One Big 12 team that may disrupt that equation is Iowa State, the No. 8 team in the preseason USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll and a national championship contender in its own right. These two teams top the preseason Big 12 power rankings.

1. Oklahoma (2020 record: 9-2)

That last year's finish is viewed as a slight disappointment speaks to the standards in place under coach Lincoln Riley. With the nation's top quarterback in Spencer Rattler to go with that reborn defense, OU has the parts needed to reach the playoff and beat Clemson, Ohio State and the best the SEC has to offer.

2. Iowa State (9-3)

The perception of ISU as a bunch of plucky underdogs maximizing its talent behind superb talent development and execution is only slightly correct. The Cyclones are far more talented than most people believe, with several players ranked among the nation's best at their positions and perhaps a dozen or more players heavily in the mix for all-conference honors. In other words, this is a team with the roster to match its preseason ranking and compete for the title.

3. Oklahoma State (8-3)

The baseline should be set at a Top 25 finish. Should even more be expected? It'll be hard to crack into the top two given the teams in place at OU and ISU. But the Cowboys' defense has made huge strides since 2018 and the offense is ready to roll at quarterback, running back and the line. OSU does need to develop two or more go-to receivers, however.

4. Texas (7-3)

There are loads of top-tier recruits on the roster and, in coach Steve Sarkisian, a leader with a track record to suggest he can develop an explosive offense. One of the obvious beneficiaries of Sarkisian's arrival is sophomore running back Bijan Robinson, a preseason USA TODAY Sports All-America pick.

5. West Virginia (6-4)

There is a whole lot to like about WVU, which might be an improved running game away from making a serious run at third place in the Big 12. As average as the ground attack was in 2020 (3.8 yards per carry), that was a marked improvement over 2019, coach Neal Brown's first year, when the Mountaineers ranked 129th nationally in yards per carry and 128th in yards per game.

6. TCU (6-4)

Getting a healthy and complete season from quarterback Max Duggan is mandatory should TCU look to reverse three years of relative mediocrity under coach Gary Patterson and crack the 10-win mark. The potential is there, especially given the state of a defense that should challenge OU and WVU for the title of the league's best. The schedule is unkind, however, with trips to Norman, Oklahoma State and Iowa State.

7. Kansas State (4-6)

The room for error is small, and not helped much by non-conference games against Stanford and Nevada. One key to improvement in coach Chris Klieman's third year is the health of quarterback Skyler Thompson; the Wildcats are a different team with him in the lineup. The offense also has an outstanding all-around weapon in second-year running back Deuce Vaughn.

8. Baylor (2-7)

Three easy games to open the year — Texas State, Texas Southern and Kansas — should provide the Bears with a needed dose of optimism after winning just twice in 2020. But is there enough here to climb out of the bottom third of the conference? It depends on your faith in second-year coach Dave Aranda and new offensive coordinator Jeff Grimes, who has the task of improving last season's putrid attack.

9. Texas Tech (4-6)

In a strange shift, concerns over this year's team focus far more on offense than with the defense, which brings back nine starters and a healthy portion of last year's two-deep. The offense has regressed in each of coach Matt Wells' two seasons but could be sparked by a return to the pass-happy style embraced by coordinator Sonny Cumbie.

10. Kansas (0-9)

Kansas is bad enough to defy description. But there is hope in the form of new coach Lance Leipold, a proven winner drawn to the sort of massive building project necessary in Lawrence. Just be patient.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@From Day 1, Dan Campbell has emphasized the need for his team to give itself a chance to win football games. Despite a sluggish offensive start and a few defensive mistakes late, the Detroit Lions did that Friday.

The Lions lost their preseason opener, 16-15, to the Buffalo Bills on Tyler Bass’ 44-yard field goal with 15 seconds to play, but Campbell walked away mostly pleased with his team’s performance.

“We said we wanted to give ourselves a chance to win at the end of the game, and even for a preseason game we did do that,” Campbell said. “We were in it at the end. Certainly, we all know it’s not good enough, but this is also about evaluating the talent and giving these guys an opportunity to run the ball, catch the ball, pressure. Stunt. Cover. All those things, and so we got a really good look at guys.”

Playing without starting running back D’Andre Swift and top pass catcher T.J. Hockenson because of injuries, the Lions sputtered out of the gate Friday.

Jared Goff, in his Lions debut, completed 7 of 9 passes but threw for just 56 yards while playing the entire first quarter. His first pass was deflected by Bills linebacker Tyler Matakevich, and the Lions went three-and-out on their first series after No. 7 overall pick Penei Sewell allowed a drive-killing sack.

Goff led a 10-minute, 18-play, 75-yard drive on his second series, though the Lions settled for a 28-yard Randy Bullock field goal.

“That was good, but you can’t always count on 18-play drive, either,” Campbell said. “I think there’s something to possessing the ball, but I think that as good as that is, if you’re going to possess that long you need to come away with a touchdown, which those things we’ll talk about.”

The Bills, coming off a 13-3 season, sat most of their starters on both sides of the ball, including quarterback Josh Allen, receiver Stefon Diggs and top defensive players Tre’Davious White and Jerry Hughes.

Goff gave way to backup quarterback Tim Boyle in the second and third quarters before third-string quarterback David Blough nearly rallied the Lions to victory.

Blough led two fourth-quarter scoring drives to give the Lions a brief 15-13 lead.

Craig Reynolds, who signed Thursday, scored on a 24-yard run with 7:36 to play.

Julian Okwara sacked Jake Fromm on the ensuing possession to force a Buffalo punt, and Blough drove the Lions for a go-ahead field goal with 1:38 remaining.

Buffalo started its final possession at its own 20. After three straight incompletions to start the drive, Fromm hit Marquez Stevenson for a 42-yard gain on fourth-and-10 to put the Bills in field goal range.

Blough finished 5 of 6 passing for 76 yards. Boyle, playing behind a leaky second-string offensive line, was 8 of 15 passing for 38 yards. And Reynolds had a game-high 49 yards rushing on six carries for the Lions.

“It’s preseason and we’re still figuring things out a little bit and doing our thing,” Goff said. “The second drive is what we want it to look like. Make plays down the field, guys getting open. I was throwing some good balls and they were making plays and the line was protecting their nuts off. Excuse me, they were protecting really hard. It was fun.”

Defensively, the Lions played their starters two series – the unit allowed one field goal – and got solid efforts from Okwara and Kevin Strong, who had six tackles, including one for loss, and forced a fumble.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INDIANAPOLIS — Alexander Albon has been through the wringer in Formula 1, the world’s premier open-wheel racing series, over the last 24 months. From inter-team politics, to mid-season ride swaps, two trips to the world’s most coveted podium and eventually losing his ride altogether; the 25-year-old Thai-born Brit finds himself at a pivotal moment in his still very young racing career.

And like several of his fellow competitors in the European racing scene have over the last five years, Albon is giving IndyCar more than just a glance to see if the series that quickly turned Marcus Ericsson into a two-time race-winner and saw Romain Grosjean take a pole in just his third race could be a future home.

“(IndyCar) is something I followed and loved when I was a kid,” Albon told IndyStar in an exclusive interview. “I’m just looking at the future right now and seeing what’s up.”

Amid IndyCar’s return to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course this weekend for the fifth time in 13 months, and as the NASCAR Cup series prepares to take on the road course for the first time since it arrived at the Racing Capital of the World in 1994, Albon’s presence took the paddock by storm Friday afternoon. He’d long been rumored to be interested in IndyCar as his uncertain last two years in F1 continued to unfold, but not until Friday had he been able to take any on-track action in live.

Though not an official guest of an IndyCar team, Albon said he arrived in Indianapolis late Thursday evening and, after picking up his credential at the IMS offices and a string of selfies with eager fans – he wandered the paddock and pitlane for the day. There, the tall, lanky driver, sporting a black polo with dark-wash jeans and white sneakers did his best to blend in and roam between IndyCar transporters.

That quest for anonymity didn’t last long for the driver who was the center of multiple major storylines across the F1 paddock during the 2019 and 2020 editions of Netflix’s “Drive to Survive” reality TV series.

To start 2019, after taking third-place in the Formula 2 championship the year prior with four victories and eight podiums in 24 races, Albon landed a seat on the Toro Rosso team, essentially the second-tier program of Red Bull Racing, who for years has been a top-rated team in F1. The Brit put together a relatively solid start to his career in F1, registering five top-10s over his first 12 races, but no finishes higher than sixth. Just past the halfway point, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner swapped Albon and then-Red Bull No. 2 driver Pierre Gasly, 12 races into the latter’s start with Red Bull after spending 2018 at Toro Rosso.

Though without a podium to end 2019, Albon provided Red Bull some much-needed consistency, finishing in the top-6 in eight of the nine remaining races. Albon held onto the seat through the offseason and run 2020 with Red Bull to mixed success. He finished out of the points (outside the top-10) five times, but took home two podiums and finished seventh in the points race.

But near the end of the year, Horner elected to sign free-agent driver Sergio Perez. Perez, up until 2020, had never finished better than seventh in points but took fourth last year, including his first F1 win in the second-to-last race of the year in the Sakhir Grand Prix. With Gasly continuing to stick with Red Bull’s second-tier team, rebranded Alpha Tauri, Albon’s demotion was fairly severe, having to hold onto a reserve driver role within the Red Bull F1 program.

To fill the void, Albon’s been racing in DTM, the German touring car series, where he’s grabbed a pair of third-place finishes through six races. When asked about his future Friday, Albon made clear that DTM isn’t where he’d like to be long-term and, though he's holding on for another shot in F1, Albon also knows how difficult that is, with young, fresh, untapped talent coming through the F2 ranks every year.

While still keeping one foot firmly planted in the F1 scene, where nearly 10 seats are unconfirmed for the 2022 season, the timing of F1 taking a break and IndyCar ramping back up couldn’t have been better for the ever-curious driver.

“(IndyCar) racing is exciting, the cars are quick and the teams and level of the series need to be given some more credit,” he said. “It’s always been something which I’ve been interested in, even when I was in F3 and F2. I knew this could be a possible career path. IndyCar right now would be right up there as my next choice.

“It would be crazy to do a championship and never see a race or do a race, so it’s good to see what (IndyCar’s) about.”

MORE MOTORSPORTS COVERAGE:

Albon said he didn’t have any specific teams he’d set up meetings with, as he strolled from team transporter to transporter. He spent close to 30 minutes in conversations with Dale Coyne Racing with Rick Ware Racing’s outfit. Albon had his first chance to chat in-person with former F1 competitor Romain Grosjean since he left his longtime home in F1. Albon and Grosjean were fairly close during the two years they were in the circuit together.

Since then, the current Coyne driver has proven just how seamless a transition between the world’s two premier open-wheel racing series can be. The Frenchman scored a pole in his third race in May, also on the IMS road course, settling for second-place in an effort that grabbed the world’s attention. That weekend, Grosjean told IndyStar that Albon was the only member of F1 who reached out after his pole.

Grosjean had back-to-back top-seven finishes at Road America and Mid-Ohio before undertaking an oval test in July. Next week, he plans to enter his first oval race as he juggles whether to dive into IndyCar full-time in 2022.

“I think (Romain) is doing a very good job,” Albon said. “Not only racing, but for the series and promoting himself as well. He seems like he’s kept all this momentum on his side, which is great to see. Seeing him now and the speed he’s got, especially for a rookie, is very impressive.

“I just wanted to ask him how the transition was like for him and how he’s felt straight away. He seems really comfortable.”

Additionally, under the watchful eyes of Coyne and Ware, Albon stepped into the cockpit of Cody Ware’s No. 52 car while it was at the team’s makeshift garage. Among other things, Albon got his first look at IndyCar’s aeroscreen, which was developed by folks on the Red Bull Racing engineering department.

“It’s a race car, and it always feels at home when you’re in one,” he said. “I just wanted to have the first feeling of what it’s like because I haven’t driven the car before.”

Even before the weekend, Albon said he’d had the chance to meet a half-dozen IndyCar drivers at various points of his racing career – Grosjean, Conor Daly, Alex Palou, Jack Harvey, Pato O’Ward and Felix Rosenqvist – but couldn’t believe just how friendly, inviting and relaxed the IndyCar paddock was in comparison to his traditional digs.

“Everyone is really friendly here," he said. "That’s not to say F1 isn’t, but the teams are so big that, in F1, you never really talk outside your group because teams are so big. But you see everyone here walking around, having a good time, and I sense a lot less pressure here.”

Noticeable, too, to the IndyCar novice is that a team like Coyne, who has a deep history within the sport but who has won two races in six-plus seasons, now has a history of taking overseas talent and turning them into the faces of IndyCar. Santino Ferrucci signed on late in 2018 following a disgraced stint in F2 and finished fourth in his second Indy 500. Two years ago, Alex Palou was relatively unknown to the casual IndyCar fan, and after with year with Coyne, he was scooped up by Chip Ganassi Racing and currently leads the points race.

Now, Grosjean is the hottest name in Silly Season, believed to be in serious talks with Andretti Autosport about one of the team’s potential vacancies at the end of the year. Even before that, Coyne told IndyStar he’d spoken with Albon last offseason about a potential IndyCar future, and less than a year later, it’s safe to say those curiosities have only grown stronger.

Because, unlike F1, Albon knows he doesn’t have to latch on with a Red Bull-like team for a chance at success.

“You look at a small team like that, and it’s very hard in F1 to achieve what they have when you’re that small-budget,” Albon said. “Romain took a risk when he signed on with them, but he’s shown that in IndyCar, every team out here can win a race and do a good job.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ATLANTA – The Tennessee Titansbeat the Atlanta Falcons 23-3 in their preseason opener at Mercedes Benz Stadium on Friday night.

Here are a few quick takeaways:

Most defensive starters got some playing time

The Titans started the game with seven projected starters playing: nose tackle Tear Tart; safeties Kevin Byard and Amani Hooker; inside linebackers Rashaan Evans and Jayon Brown; and cornerbacks Kristian Fulton and Jackrabbit Jenkins. It was in sharp contrast to the offense, which played with mainly reserves.

With so many new faces on the defensive side of the ball, head coach Mike Vrabel took advantage of the opportunity in the preseason opener for his defense to start building much-need chemistry after the struggles in 2020.

Opinion:Browns star Myles Garrett may be the NFL's best COVID-19 vaccine advocate

Rookie cornerback Caleb Farley and outside linebackers Bud Dupree and Harold Landry III did not play on Friday, though, as expected. Farley (back) and Dupree (knee) have been working their way back from injuries, as they started training camp on the NFI and PUP lists, respectively. Landry has missed the last several training camp practices.

Offensive line struggles early, but settles down late

The Titans played without their top six offensive lineman Friday, and it showed early in the game.

The pass protection, particularly on the inside, was very shaky to start. Backup quarterback Logan Woodside, who played up until the 9:41 mark of the third quarter, was rocked by two hits in the first half: a free rusher in the A gap and a safety blitz that wasn’t picked up. He was sacked three times in the first two quarters.

The group settled down by the mid-third quarter, though. Matt Barkley was not sacked.

Defensive front continues to impress

The Titans’ defensive front carried over a strong first couple weeks of training camp into the preseason opener. It was officially credited with four sacks. Linebacker David Long Jr. also had an interception.

Rashad Weaver flashes potential

Vrabel said on Friday that rookie fourth-round pick Rashad Weaver was one of the players he was looking forward to watching in the preseason opener.

The ex-Pitt standout delivered.

Weaver was the most impressive player on a Titans' defensive front that dominated the game. He was flying around and always seemed to be around the ball. Weaver had three tackles, 1.5 sacks, two quarterback hits, a tackle for loss and a pass defensed.

Encouraging showing for defense overall

It was against primarily Falcons' reserves, but the the play of the Titans' defense Friday was encouraging after historically bad third-down efficiency a year ago. It held the Falcons to 2-of-11 on third down.

Chester Rogers, Mason Kinsey shine at wide receiver

In the Titans’ competitive wide receiver room, Chester Rogers and Mason Kinsey were the biggest standouts in the preseason opener.

Special teams value is crucially important at the position behind A.J. Brown, Julio Jones and Josh Reynolds, and Rogers shined in that phase of the game. The veteran receiver had a 57-yard punt return in the first half that set up the Titans’ offense at their own 14.

Kinsey was the Titans’ leading receiver with four receptions for 51 yards.

The Titans will have joint practice with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Wednesday and Thursday ahead of their preseason matchup next Saturday at Raymond James Stadium.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@DYERSVILLE, Ia. — Let’s get this out of the way right now.

Thursday night’s Field of Dreams game was a showcase, an extravaganza, a happening. You can't even dream this stuff up, how magical this night was. The center of the sports universe, at least for one day, was smack dab in the middle of an Iowa cornfield way up here in northeast Iowa.

Put plainly, baseball's grand showing at the "Field of Dreams" movie site was our state’s greatest sports event ever.

Yes, I said it.

Ever.

Don't @ me.

We've had wonderful college sports moments in this state. We've had wonderful lower-level professional sports in this state.

TIME TO REGROUP:Walk-off loss in Field of Dreams game 'ruined it a little bit' for Yankees

THE GAME:Kevin Costner, White Sox and Yankees put on a show

But this was a big-league event, historic for Iowa. It all seemed unbelievable. But it was more than that.

It was perfect.

Thousands of people came from many states to watch the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox play in an honest-to-goodness baseball game that actually meant something.

This was an Iowa first, a regular season MLB baseball game here.

It had to have a special finish, and it did. To end it, White Sox superstar Tim Anderson hammered a home run over the right-field fence into an ink-black country sky, the eighth and final cornfield shot of this wonderfully entertaining game.

Chicago 9, New York 8.

And a walk-off homer to boot.

Really, does it get any better than that?

Millions more watched all over the world. Whether you were in rural Dyersville or plugged in on the FOX broadcast, you were left inspired, stupefied, slack-jawed by the majesty of it all. You didn't have to look hard on social media for people to say they were brought to tears by the surreal scenes unfolding here.

They played on a ball diamond that a few years ago was a cornfield, adjacent to the "Field of Dreams" movie site.

Kids played catch on the Field of Dreams field featured in the 1989 film hours before this game started.

Have a catch? Absolutely!

Players walked out from a cornfield, just like in the movie. The star of the film, Kevin Costner, gave a speech to the crowd of about 8,000 before the game. He did so while walking through the outfield, almost as if narrating an opening for what would have been a wonderful sequel -— right down to the sudden and iconic finish.

"We've come to see the first-place White Sox play the mighty Yankees in a field that was once corn,” Costner said over the mic. “It's perfect. We've kept our promise. Major League Baseball has kept its promise. The dream is still alive. There's probably just one question to answer: 'Is this heaven?'

“Yes, it is.”

And after, there was a terrific baseball game that started under a salmon-colored late summer sky. We saw eight home runs. We saw pitchers throwing 100 miles per hour. We saw perhaps the finest team in baseball — the White Sox — and the finest franchise in sports — the Yankees.

In the modern era, there's nothing like it. Not here. Not anywhere.

This wasn't just a baseball game. It was a time capsule from a different era.

“That’s probably the greatest setting for a baseball game that I’ve ever been a part of,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after the tough loss.

He later added, “Kevin Costner standing out there in short center field — that’s probably a moment I’ll remember the rest of my life.”

So will millions who watched.

And you have this afterward from Miguel Cairo, the White Sox skipper who was subbing for Tony LaRussa and had played in the minors for the Iowa Cubs in the 1990s: “It was a dream come true.”

Whether Iowa can pull it off again next summer — and yes, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said this game is coming back — we’ll see. A high bar has been set, even if one of the teams coming next year just happens to be the beloved Chicago Cubs. But that's a worry for another day.

As the movie taught us 32 years ago, live in the moment. Appreciate the moment.

From the festivities before the game to the action that took place on this pristine field, this was more than a sporting event. It was a celebration.

Who won? Who lost?

Did anyone watching in the stands or at home care all that much?

It happened.

And it was perfection.

Costner was right.

It really was heaven.

The statement from Tulane comes after New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell issued an directive for the city that requires people engaged in many large indoor and outdoor activities to either show proof of the vaccine or a negative test. The guidelines also extend to those attending New Orleans Saints football games or concerts, eating at restaurants and going to the gym. The requirement goes into effect Aug. 16.

Louisiana, which ranks among the states with the lowest rates of vaccinations, has been hit hard by the Delta variant of COVID-19 and seen cases rise, prompting the decision by Cantrell.

The game against Oklahoma, which will be played on campus at Yulman Stadium, is a rare marquee matchup for Tulane against of the sport's biggest programs. The Green Wave previously played on the road against the Sooners in 2017 and also visited Ohio State and Auburn recently.

Tulane said 95% of its student body and 92% of the faculty and staff are vaccinated.

"It is our hope that the mayor's directive will encourage the unvaccinated to receive a vaccination for their own benefit and for the benefit of all of us," a statement from Tulane athletics director Troy Dannen said. "It also serves as a strong reminder that in a pandemic there are expectations for all who want to participate in activities in which they share an environment with others."

Hardly a week removed from dominating her way to gold in the women's 68kg freestyle wrestling, Mensah-Stock is already repaying those who helped her reach her dream – with some help.

According to local Houston, Texas, television station ABC 13, Mensah-Stock planned to use part of her Olympic winnings ($250,000) to buy a food truck for her mother, Shonda Wells. Mensah-Stock promised Wells a truck of her own five years ago while her mother sold BBQ out of a pit with two wheels.

Then Cameron Davies, the owner of Cruising Kitchens – a food-truck manufacturing company – heard of Mensah-Stock's plans to buy a $30,000 truck. Instead of donating a food truck with a similar price tag, Cruising Kitchens is gifting Wells a $250,000 truck with "all the bells and whistles," as Davies put it in a Zoom call with the family captured by ABC 13.

"It's time for you to take care of her, because she's been taking care of you," Davies said to Mensah-Stock.

Davies said he quickly researched Mensah-Stock and "fell in love with the person she (is)."

"I've been wanting this for (Wells) for so long," Mensah-Stock said.

USA Wrestling has a reward program that gives wrestlers who win gold $250,000. That money includes the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee's program that awards $37,500 for gold.

The process of designing and building the truck will take more than three months, but it won't be long before "P'lickles Famous BBQ" will be serving up grub in the Houston area.

"Oh my God, I can't believe it," Wells said. "Thank you so much. This is a dream come true."

Mensah-Stock became the first Black woman to win a gold medal in wrestling when she defeated Nigeria's Blessing Oborududu 4-1 in the final.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Simone Manuel is one of the most decorated swimmers in the world, and after the Tokyo Olympics, she added another medal to her impressive hardware collection.

Manuel anchored the U.S. women’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay with a 52.96 split and helped the Team USA win a bronze medal behind Australia and Canada. Individually, she also competed in the 50-meter freestyle and tied for sixth in her semifinal heat but failed to advance to the final.

After the swimming program ended, Manuel posted a thoughtful reflection on Instagram and wrote that she’ll “remember this point in [her] career forever” because she “didn’t give up.” At the Olympic Trials in June, she missed the final for the 100-meter freestyle — an event she won gold in at the 2016 Rio Games — and opened up about being diagnosed with overtraining syndrome in March. She also said she had been dealing with depression and anxiety, which began to impact her physically this year.

For The Win spoke with Manuel — who was promoting her partnership with Toyota — about her experience at this summer’s unique Olympics, athletes’ mental health and what’s up next for the 25-year-old star.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

How are you feeling now that the Tokyo Olympics are over?

Simone Manuel: I’m just glad it’s over. It was a tough year for me, so I’m grateful and blessed that I was able to make the team and come home with the medal. But just given everything that I went through, I’m glad to be home and enter rest up.

At Olympic Trials, you spoke about being diagnosed with overtraining syndrome and dealing with depression and anxiety. Were you still working through that at the Games?

SM: Absolutely, and I probably still am. But I think that heading into the Olympic Games, I still had to manage my physical energy. I wasn’t able to go 100 percent. It was annoying and emotionally exhausting because your body’s not doing what you know it’s capable of doing or what it has done in the past. And the Olympics are coming up and you’re still having to modify practices, or you’re still having to get out early because you’re tired, or you come in and you can only do a recovery practice because you didn’t sleep well, or your body just continuously feels sore.

So the physical part is tough, but the mental part of knowing that you’re not at your best and you’re getting ready to perform on the biggest stage is really hard. And it takes a toll on you, so those weeks leading up to the Games were a roller coaster. Some practices were good, some days were good, and some days weren’t that great, but I had to keep my head in it to get to the finish line. But I’m glad that I’m home, and I can kind of start over and hopefully get ready for some competitions in the future.

Tokyo Olympics medal count:Which country took home the most medals?

When you look at the experience of these Olympics compared with Rio in 2016, what was the atmosphere like, and was it totally different?

SM: It was just different for me from a performance standpoint. I wasn’t as busy. I only had a couple of races, versus in 2016, I had multiple events to focus on. Being a veteran swimmer, you kind of know what to expect, so the experience is different in that sense, as far as getting to the Olympics and performing there.

I think the hardest part of the Olympics this year was just COVID. You feel a little anxiety every day when you have to take your COVID test, and you’re hoping that you don’t have it or that you didn’t get contact traced with someone and then you can’t compete. You’re in a village with a lot of different countries and athletes, and everybody has different ways on how they handle COVID or the precautions they have around it. So I think more than anything, there was just a lot of anxiety around [the idea of]: I hope I don’t have positive and can’t compete at all.

What was the Olympic Village like with so many athletes probably trying to stay away from each other as much as possible?

SM: The population of the village makes it hard to really social distance. You get on the bus to the pool, you’re not always sitting by a USA athlete. And so you’re sitting next to someone who you don’t know has been in contact with who. You just have to do the best you can to manage how you’re interacting with others and how you’re sanitizing and controlling what you can control. But there was still a little bit of fear around it.

After you were done swimming, you tweeted a thread about athletes' mental health and being interviewed immediately after falling short of their goals at the Olympics. What would you like to see more of from the media and how they work with elite athletes in these moments?

SM: I saw some interviews being done by athletes after a disappointing performance when I was at home, and that was tough to see because I’ve also had those experiences myself. So that’s kind of where the tweet came from. After I didn’t qualify for the 50 free finals at the Olympics, you go to the mixed zone [to talk to reporters], and I was asked to do some interviews not more than two minutes after that race when I’m trying to walk through the media area. And I had to pass at that moment.

But I guess for me, I just kind of felt like, why even ask? You know that I had a disappointing performance. You know that — or you should know that — I’m struggling in some sense. The story of me going into the Olympic Games was my overtraining syndrome, so you kind of know where the performance came from — or the lack of performance. So it becomes mentally and emotionally exhausting to have to say no in that moment, because it’s better to just let us go process what’s going on or give us some time to really think about what we’re going to say because we know we’re going to have to go back and talk to the media.

What I would be suggesting is recognize when athletes are disappointed. Recognize when they may have fallen short of the goal that they have for themselves or their performance wasn’t up to par, what they may deem as acceptable. It’s written all over our face. You can kind of tell we don’t want to talk to the media, so just give them a moment to process and then ask them if they’re willing to come back and talk about what happened or how they’re feeling.

And oftentimes, I have felt a little pressure to go back, especially at the Olympic Games. I expressed that I didn’t want to do it; “Could I do it tomorrow?” Because I still had to process the swim, but also, I just hadn’t processed really all that I went through in the past several months. And so I went back to the media, and I cried the whole time. You’re trying to get words out. You’re choking through your tears, and it’s just kind of like, what? Thank God that the interview wasn’t in front of the camera, but it’s kind of like, why did I have to go through that?

2024 Olympics: Get ready for Parisian landmarks to play starring role

LOOKING FORWARD: Will Olympics be a game-changer in how we view athletes' mental health?

Do you think there's a general lack of empathy for athletes?

SM: I wouldn’t say a general lack of empathy, but I think that there just needs to be a balance in terms of taking care of the athlete in some ways in that moment because I do know that it would benefit all of us — not just the athlete, but the media.

You might get a more well-thought out answer from the athlete because, from my own experience, I went back, and I could really only get three questions answered. I know that they probably wanted to ask me more than that, but because I was so emotionally drained and was crying, I was like, “That’s all you’re getting from me.”

On Instagram, you posted some photos of a mural in your hometown in Texas. Is that new, and what does something like that means to you?

SM: Nike surprised me with that, so that was really special and for it to be in my hometown. And then I found out that the artist allowed kids in the community to be able to build in parts of the mural in whatever way they wanted to. And so just to know that it was in my hometown, to have kids involved, and to see that mural was really special, especially given the year that I had.

It really just made me feel good about the impact that I hope that I have on other people on both in and out of the sport, and especially in my community in my hometown of Sugar Land.

Going forward after something as taxing as the Olympics and an Olympic year, are you taking a break from swimming or already looking ahead to some meets?

SM: I’m taking a break. I don’t know what my future competitions will be, I just know that I’m going to get back in the pool and compete again. But right now, I’m still going through the process of overtraining, especially since I probably didn’t take enough time off.

I took three weeks off [between March and April], but that wasn’t enough time for my body. It was only enough time for me to try to get to Olympic Trials and the Olympic Games. So I’m taking the time to be a normal 25 year old and rest up my body for when I get back into the pool.

Are the 2024 Paris Games too far ahead in the future to even talk about?

SM: It’s absolutely something I’m thinking about. In the now, I’m thinking about getting my body back healthy, and then after that, it will be practicing and my first competitions.

I’m always someone that likes to focus on what’s right in front of me instead of what’s farther away, so that I can focus on those daily goals. But, yes, obviously, I’m focused on trying to compete in 2024.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Little League World Series announced Friday it has closed admission to the general public due to the rise of COVID-19 cases throughout the country.

"The health and well-being of our teams and mitigating their exposure to COVID-19 must continue to be our main priority, as we conclude our World Series events," said Stephen D. Keener, Little League President and CEO in a statement.

“With updated guidance from the CDC, and in consultation with our Pandemic Response Advisory Commission and medical advisors, we feel it’s essential to revert our attendance policy to unfortunately limit the spectators in Williamsport to the family and friends of our 16 participating teams and our highest-level volunteers and supporters."

The Little League Baseball World Series is scheduled from August 19-29, with the top two teams from the eight U.S. Region Tournaments advancing to Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

However, each team will receive 250 passes for their friends, families, and community members.

"We are disappointed that we must rollback our spectators joining us in Williamsport this year, but are eager to provide a safe, enjoyable experience for the 16 teams who will compete in the World Series this summer.”

Additional passes have been committed to high-level volunteers and supporters, which will still be honored. All spectators, regardless of vaccination status, will also be strongly encouraged to wear a face mask when on the complex, especially while in any indoor facility during their visit, according to the statement.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A sponsor of the BYU Cougars football program will pay the tuition for all 36 walk-ons through a name, image and likeness deal (NIL) that the university's athletic department helped set up.

A video posted to the BYU football team's verified Twitter account showed the announcement taking place during a team meeting Thursday morning. In the video, Nick Greer, the CEO of a protein bar company based in Utah called Built Bar, was addressing the entire team. Greer called up freshman walk-on quarterback Nick Billoups.

"We want you to be employee No. 1," Greer told Billoups. "We want to pay for your tuition."

The coaches and players in attendance all cheered and applauded after the announcement was made. Later in the video, Greer does the same thing with Talmage Gunther, a walk-on wide receiver.

"Talmage, you can thank coach," Greer said. "We want you to be employee No. 2 and we want to pay for your tuition."

Finally, Greer asks all walk-ons to stand up and refers to them as "employees one through 36."

Built Bar is part of the Built Brands company, which is an official sponsor of the BYU football team.

BYU released a statement and said that all 123 football players on the team were being offered an endorsement deal with Built, though scholarship athletes can earn $1,000 for being brand ambassadors.

"I love these boys, and I am overwhelmed with gratitude to be partnering with a company that is equally committed to assisting BYU football in building a culture of love and learning while enhancing the experience for all players," BYU head coach Kalani Sitake said in a statement.

The players who signed the NIL deals will wear Built branding on their helmets in practice and will also "participate in experiential events" for the company, the school said. Walk-on players will also do additional social media and experience promotions as part of their deals.

Under the arrangement, Built will pay the players directly.

"We're trying to put BYU on the map for all the right reasons," BYU associate athletic director Gary Vernon told ESPN. "We knew this would be exciting to be kind of the first ones to the dance in this area."

The deal raises questions about "pay-to-play" arrangements that are forbidden by the NCAA, in which an athletic department is not allowed to pay for student-athletes to be recruited or play for any team. Yet, since Built Bar is a sponsor and since the university helped secure the arrangement, the line becomes potentially blurry.

The state of Utah, however, does not have a law restricting NIL endorsement deals for student-athletes, making this arrangement possible. The NCAA has opted not to enforce strict guidelines against any such agreements, allowing individual schools to establish their own policies.

"We feel blessed because we don't have a state law on the books," Veron told ESPN.

The program announced that Built will also provide additional funding to the football team as part of its corporate sponsorship with BYU.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@NEW YORK — Jacob deGrom’s sixth injury of the year — right elbow inflammation — is coming dangerously close to costing him the rest of his season.

DeGrom, whom the New York Mets on July 30 shut down from throwing for two weeks, will not throw for two more, manager Luis Rojas said on Friday. The Mets plan to send deGrom for another MRI in two weeks and reassess the plan based on those results.

DeGrom flew to Los Angeles on Thursday to see Dr. Near El Attrache, who provided another opinion on an MRI deGrom received this week. The verdict: The elbow inflammation has improved but not enough for deGrom to begin a throwing program.

It now seems the ace won’t be able to return until the middle of September at the earliest, a person with knowledge of the situation said. And that’s only if the next MRI is clean and deGrom is able to successfully complete a throwing progression.

"He's frustrated," Rojas said. "He wants to pitch. He wants to help the team. There's nothing he can do.

"We just have to commit to these two weeks again now and just follow the experts' indications and the treatment so he keeps improving there. There is some improvement, but they would like to see more, probably."

Rojas said deGrom’s injury is "strictly elbow inflammation." The MRI did not reveal ligament damage. The Mets don’t seem to know why deGrom first experienced the inflammation.

On the Mets' recent road trip to Miami, deGrom said he would need to do plyometrics before picking up a baseball. This, of course, was before his most recent MRI. After these two weeks, deGrom will not have thrown a baseball in a month.

If he were to return this season, deGrom would be a starter, Rojas said. The Mets have not discussed using him out of the bullpen, like Noah Syndergaard. This also means deGrom would need a more thorough progression to properly stretch out as a starter.

The Mets entered Friday’s series opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers a half-game behind the first-place Philadelphia Phillies. The Mets have 13 games against the Dodgers and Giants, two of baseball’s best teams.

They knew they wouldn’t have their ace for this brutal stretch. Now they know he might not return for quite some time after it.

"We’ve faced these things all year," Rojas said. "I think we've done a really good job. We've had a lot of guys go down, right? Significant guys. Jacob deGrom is the best pitcher in the game and he hasn't pitched for us now well over a month. We miss his presence on the field. We're not going to think differently than what we thought going into spring training. We're going to compete and we're going to face tough opponents and we're growing our mindset since then to where we are now that we're going to win. That's how we approach each game.

"After hearing this news and Jake telling everyone in the clubhouse what he heard from the doctors, I don't think that's going to put the guys' heads down. These guys are going to move forward the same way they have in the past. We're just going to get ready."

DeGrom, who has a 1.08 ERA over 15 starts this season, has not pitched since July 7. When the Mets returned from the All-Star break, they announced their ace had been experiencing right forearm tightness. The team soon placed him on the injured list.

On July 30, a day after deGrom threw a bullpen session, the Mets sent him for an MRI because he had been feeling something in his elbow. It revealed elbow inflammation.

That inflammation has since improved, but not to the degree that doctors would have liked.

DeGrom's season — which he recently said began as the best year of his career — might be in jeopardy.

"Right now we are playing without him and I feel like we have the talent to compete and win games," Rojas said. "And I felt like that for the whole season, so I have to say the same thing. I can’t say about for the rest of the season. We don’t know that yet.

"Right now we have a lot of talent on our roster and the guys work hard and trust in each other’s abilities and we have dealt with this same thing the entire season, so I don’t think that’s changing. And my thoughts of this group, they believe in each other and they show it every day out on the field. So I believe that we are going to win some games with this group of guys. Nothing is making us less or more right now because we have gone through this the whole season."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Detroit Lions made a rare in-season move to their training staff Friday, firing head athletic trainer Dave Granito.

First-year Lions coach Dan Campbell confirmed the move after Friday's preseason loss to the Buffalo Bills.

Campbell said the decision to fire Granito, who was hired in 2019, was not based on one incident.

"Really it’s just, felt like this was the way that we needed to go," Campbell said. "I don’t really want to get into detail of it. I can tell you this, our guys were getting proper treatment, it was nothing like that. But it just, it felt like we needed to go another way and communication, some of those things, and so we did make that move."

Granito was one of the last ex-New England Patriots brought into the organization under former Lions general manager Bob Quinn and head coach Matt Patricia. He worked for the Patriots from 2002-2016, during of much of Quinn's and Patricia's time in New England, and spent three seasons (2016-18) as director of athletic training at Michigan.

Assistant athletic trainer Tom Holt will serve as the Lions' interim head trainer until the team hires a replacement.

"We are in talks with someone," Campbell said. "I’m not going to give you that name, but we are in talks. And in the meantime, Tom Holt is taking over, assistant trainer, who’s done a really good job. We’ve put some stress on him and he’s answered the bell and been outstanding."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@GREENWOOD, Ind. – Out on the golf course, Ted Kitchel had no idea his hand was shaking before he took a swing. But they noticed. The golf pros and friends saw the tremor as he stood above the tee ready to smash the ball.

Kitchel had no idea why he felt so tired, why he was going to bed at 5 p.m., coming home and lying down on the couch. But the doctors did. A trip to the ER revealed blood clots in his lungs and legs.

Blood thinners were prescribed and the shaking worsened. Kitchel had no idea why. Maybe it was the blood thinners causing the incontrollable tiniest of movements.

His neighbor and doctor didn't think so. Those were tremors Kitchel was having. The doctor put him on medicine to try to calm them down.

"You know, you're cruising along in life and you don't think about anything being wrong," Kitchel, 61, said from his Carmel, Indiana, home last week.

But the medicine to stop the tremors didn't work.

"That's when I really noticed it," Kitchel said. "I told my doctor I don't think that medicine is doing any good. I still shake in my right arm."

In 2015, Kitchel took a trip to Boston to see a neurologist. She had him walk up and down a hall, do different movements, then she brought her colleague in to watch Kitchel do the same.

"And after looking at me for about 15 minutes, she says, 'You've got Parkinson's," Kitchel said. "I mean basically it hit me...like boom, like what?"

He flew home that night and walked into the bedroom where his wife, Kristi, was watching TV.

"And she says, 'Well, how'd it go?'" Kitchel said. "I said, 'I've got Parkinson's.'"

"It just kind of stuns everybody that you tell."

'You learn to live with it'

Sitting in his Carmel home on Thursday, talking about his days of playing basketball, a standout at Lewis Cass high, recruited by Bob Knight, winning an NCAA championship in 1981, it's impossible to tell Kitchel is six years past his diagnosis.

Parkinson's disease, in its simplest explanation, is a disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's. Kitchel is on medicine to boost the dopamine in his body.

Like Kitchel's initial symptoms, Parkinson's often starts with a tremor in one hand. Other symptoms are slow movement, stiffness and loss of balance.

As the specialist in Boston started to explain the disease to Kitchel that day in 2015, his mind went to neuromuscular diseases like ALS and multiple sclerosis.

"It's not a big deal. There are millions of people that have Parkinson's," Kitchel recalls the neurologist telling him. "You don't die because of Parkinson's. You die with Parkinson's. You learn to live with it. She's like, 'It's not a big deal.'"

"And it really isn't that big of a deal," Kitchel said. "You learn to live with it."

Kitchel concedes he has been fortunate. People progress differently with the disease.

"Some people have it and it's fast moving," he said. "Some people have it and their bodies fight it off a little more and it's slower moving. Mine seems to be a little slower moving."

Kitchel is grateful for that. And he wants to help others fighting the disease. So, he took his love of golf (he has three holes in one) and turned it into a way to raise awareness and money for research. His first Ted Kitchel Golf Outing for Parkinson's in 2019 raised $45,000.

The IU brotherhood of former players was there. Those players have been big supporters of Kitchel and his cause.

Because long before there was golf, there was basketball.

Coach Knight wants to stop by

He was a farm kid born in Galveston who grew up on big John Deere tractors and combines. His mom and dad farmed 1,500 acres, mostly corn and beans – plus 60 acres of tomatoes.

At Lewis Cass High, Kitchel was a star athlete. He played football, pitched for the baseball team and was a basketball star.

By the second game of Kitchel's senior season, a red-sweatered coach from Bloomington, Indiana, had heard about this 6-8 farm kid who could play ball. Knight came to the game against Peru, which had beaten Lewis Cass twice the year before.

"I don't know why, but he kind of showed up that night," Kitchel said.

Kitchel scored 40-some points.

Knight stood up in the corner, a few people saw him, but he didn't talk to anyone. "They had said coach Knight was there," Kitchel said. "I didn't think much about it."

Kitchel had been getting letters from interested colleges since he was a sophomore. By the time Knight came around, there were more than 200.

A couple of weeks after the Peru game, Kitchel was sitting in algebra class when his high school basketball coach knocked on the door.

"And he says, 'Hey, Bob Knight, he's on the phone and he wants to know if it'd be OK if he stopped by tonight," Kitchel said.

Well, of course, Kitchel said, that would be just fine.

'They're all scared to talk'

Knight was a huge deal. This was 1978 and the coach had just led his 1976 team to an undefeated season that ended in an NCAA title. The year before that, the team had gone undefeated before being beaten by Kentucky in the third round of the tournament.

Other coaches had come to visit the Kitchels' home. But this was different.

Kitchel's dad was a big strong farm guy. When other coaches came to visit, selling their school, his dad and mom and the high school coach would ask all sorts of questions.

"Knight comes, sits there and talks and nobody asks any questions," he said. "They're all scared, scared to say anything, scared to talk."

Before Knight came, Kitchel's dad had even considered shaving off his mustache. He knew Knight didn't approve of facial hair on his team.

Knight showed up about 8 p.m., after his IU practice, sat down, told stories, talked about the program and made his pitch to the Kitchels.

"Basically, it was just 'I'll make you the best player you can possibly be. That doesn't mean you'll ever play a lot. That doesn't mean you'll ever be a star,'" Knight told the family. "But the things I can promise you is I'll make you the best player you can possibly be and you'll get a college education.'"

Knight came to a couple more of Kitchel's high school games and, during the blizzard of 1978, Kitchel made his decision. He called Knight, stuck in Michigan with his IU basketball team, and told him he wanted to be a Hoosier.

"He didn't sell you anything that he didn't tell you from the start," Kitchel said. "It was not going to be easy."

'It was deep stuff'

Playing for Knight, there was pressure every day.

"He is not just like that on game day. He's like that every day," Kitchel said. "He is pushing and kicking and shoving and scratching and trying to make you the absolute best."

And the work didn't stop off the court. The first day Kitchel arrived at IU, he was given a notebook.

"And if he was talking, you better be writing," he said. Knight told the team how to stop each and every player on opposing teams. This guy likes to take two dribbles then cross over. Don't let him do it. That guy, the post man, likes to catch the ball and turn to his right shoulder. Make him turn left.

"We knew every out of bounds play they ran, everything," he said. "It was deep stuff."

And it worked.

During Kitchel's time at IU, the team won three Big Ten tournaments, an NIT tournament and the 1981 championship – when Kitchel, along with starters Landon Turner, Isiah Thomas, Ray Tolbert and Randy Wittman, beat Dean Smith's North Carolina 63-50.

While at IU, Kitchel met Kristi. She had gone to Perry Meridian, where she was a diver and state champion on the balance beam. She started college at UNLV on a diving scholarship but then came to IU to dive. Back issues forced her to give up the sport so she became a cheerleader.

The two have three children, Scott, Tyler and MacKenzie, and two grandchildren with one on the way. It is Kitchel's family who has been his strongest support as he battles Parkinson's.

'Parkinson's is not a death sentence'

When he first told his children his diagnosis, they started doing their own research, things dad should do.

No. 1 was to stay active. Kitchel sees a movement specialist, plays a lot of golf and several times a week does Rock Steady Boxing.

"I want to encourage people with Parkinson's to get out and get active, not just sit around doing nothing," he said. "They kind of give up. People want to give up. But they feel better when they get out and start doing things."

It has worked well for Kitchel.

"When I sit here you probably don't even notice I have it," he said. If he's watching the Stanley Cup or an intense game or a golf match, his hand will start shaking.

He remembers the feeling when he was first diagnosed. He didn't know what Parkinson's would mean for him and it was scary. Now, he wants to help others facing that same uncertain prognosis.

His family first suggested Kitchel do something to raise awareness for Parkinson's. Golf was perfect. This year will be Kitchel's second golf outing; 2020 was canceled due to the pandemic.

"Yeah the golf outing is great," Kitchel said. "But mostly, I just want to encourage people to stay active. I just want people to know that Parkinson's is not a death sentence."

Golf outing to raise Parkinson's awareness

Kitchel's golf outing will take place Aug. 23 at Valle Vista Golf Club in Greenwood. There are no open spots with 37 teams already signed up. People can still help by visiting Kitchel's research fund and golf outing page.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The ball left Eric Hosmer’s bat at 96 mph and appeared ticketed for center field when Arizona Diamondbacks left-hander Tyler Gilbert snatched it out of the air. It was one of many balls the San Diego Padres scorched on Saturday night, but it was the one, Gilbert said later, that made him realize something special might be happening.

Gilbert entered the day as anonymous as any pitcher in the majors. He ended it with his own claim on baseball history.

In blanking the Padres 7-0 at Chase Field, Gilbert became just the fourth pitcher to throw a no-hitter in his first career start and the first to do since 1953. He also became just the third pitcher in Diamondbacks history to throw a no-hitter, following Hall of Famer Randy Johnson (2004) and Edwin Jackson (2010).

“That was pretty cool,” Gilbert said. “Incredible. It was just one of those days. I don’t know. I know balls were getting hit around, but they were getting hit to guys. I was making pitches. It was just kind of a rush the whole time, to be honest.”

It is hard to overstate how unlikely a performance it was. Throughout his professional career, Gilbert has never appeared on an organization’s Baseball America Top 30 prospects list. His fastball barely scratches the low-90s. He came to the Diamondbacks via a byzantine route: the Triple-A phase of the Rule 5 draft, not exactly a common path for a big leaguer. With the minor league season canceled last year, he spent part of the quarantine summer learning his father’s electrical trade.

“It’s what the game of baseball is all about,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. “As long as you have a uniform, as long as you give the right effort, anything is possible.”

And then there was the game itself. The evening felt like a sort of reversal of the crummy fortune the Diamondbacks have endured this season. The Padres hit 10 balls at 95 mph or harder, including six at 100 mph or above. All were converted into outs.

Gilbert said he first noticed his good fortune when the Padres’ Adam Frazier crushed a liner right at first baseman Pavin Smith in the fourth, a ball that was easily converted into a double play. Hosmer’s liner came one inning later.

“That almost took my head off,” Gilbert said. “When I caught that, I was like, ‘OK, these balls are getting hit hard, but there are people right there to make the play.’ ”

In a sense, the game ended in fitting fashion. With two out in the ninth, the Padres’ Tommy Pham hit a line drive to center field that looked like it had a chance to fall. Instead, it hung up long enough for Ketel Marte to make a running catch.

“I did think it was going to get down, but it kind of carried a little bit,” Gilbert said. “I think he backspinned it just enough. I saw it hang in the air and I was like, ‘OK, this is it. It’s happening.’ It was cool.”

The 10 balls at 95 mph or harder are the second-most in a no-hitter since baseball began tracking batted-ball data in 2015. Chicago Cubs right-hander Alec Mills allowed 11 in his no-hitter in September 2020.

A sixth-round pick by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2015, Gilbert languished in the Phillies system before being sent to the Dodgers in a small trade in February 2020. After the Dodgers left him unprotected, the Diamondbacks rolled the dice on him largely on recommendation of scout Matt Hahn, who “really pounded the table for him,” pro scouting director Jason Parks said.

“He saw him for several years in the Phillies organization,” Parks said. “He liked his control and his composure, and he thought he had the ability to get the most out of his repertoire. There was some data that also raised flags on him. It was a good organizational effort, from scouting to data to player development.”

Gilbert spent the first four months of the season at the alternate site and Triple-A Reno, where he worked regularly as a starter for the first time since 2016. He was called to the majors earlier this month to provide a fresh arm out of the bullpen, and when the Diamondbacks had a need in the rotation, Gilbert on Saturday became the 15th different pitcher to start a game for them this season.

Gilbert’s parents, Greg and Peggy, were among the group of friends and family in attendance who took center stage during the Bally Sports Arizona broadcast. A year ago, when he wasn’t throwing bullpen sessions to his high school coach to stay sharp, Gilbert was working alongside his dad, making money and learning the electrical trade.

“That really made me realize how much I missed baseball, taking that whole summer off,” Gilbert said. “I’d rather be doing this than pulling wires — no offense, Dad.”

Gilbert became the first pitcher to throw a no-hitter in his first career start since the St. Louis Browns’ Bobo Holloman did so on May 6, 1953. Two others also accomplished the feat, doing so in baseball’s dead-ball era: the St. Louis Browns’ Theodore Breitenstein in 1891 and the Cincinnati Reds’ Bumpus Jones in 1892.

His no-hitter is also the eighth in MLB this year, matching the record set way back in 1884 for most in a single baseball season. The Padres kicked off the no-hitter frenzy in 2021 as Joe Musgrove recorded the first one in franchise history. Other no-hitters this season came from: the White Sox's Carlos Rodon; the Orioles' John Means; the Reds' Wade Miley; the Tigers' Spencer Turnbull; the Yankees' Corey Kluber; and a combined no-hitter from the Cubs.

Gilbert said he chatted between innings with coach Mike Fetters in the dugout, going over the matchups for the next half-inning before shifting conversations to non-baseball subjects.

“I was just trying to keep it easy,” he said, “and keep it relaxed.”

He even surprised himself with his ability to control his emotions, saying that at one point he marveled at how calm he was on the field.

“I wasn’t nervous at all and I felt like I should have been,” he said. “I kept just going out there and doing my thing.”

As Lovullo was growing increasingly concerned about the pitch count, Gilbert just kept getting outs, and doing so with efficiency. He needed just three pitches to record three outs in the eighth inning, with the Padres putting each ball in play at 98 mph or harder. Austin Nola flew out just shy of the wall in left field; Eric Hosmer hit a sharp grounder to short, where Nick Ahmed made a nice pickup before Smith dug out a low throw at first; and Wil Myers flew out to deep right-center field to end the inning.

Gilbert struck out each of the first two batters of the ninth, freezing the Padres’ Trent Grisham on a cutter over the plate, then getting Ha-Seong Kim looking on a borderline pitch.

“I was using that all the time — inside, outside, up, away,” Gilbert said of his cutter. “I was trying to use that off my two-seam fastball. And it was working.”

Gilbert said he had already heard from the Baseball Hall of Fame, which requested his glove, jersey and cleats and a game ball to display in Cooperstown, New York.

“To be honest, it hasn’t hit me too much yet,” Gilbert said. “It’s really cool. I can’t really describe it, I’m sorry.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AP

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — With one deep strike, Trey Lance showed why the San Francisco 49ers invested so heavily to draft him this offseason. With a few shakier moments in his preseason debut, Lance showed why the Niners aren't rushing to make him their starter.

Lance threw an 80-yard touchdown pass that led to loud cheers from San Francisco fans, and also showed some rookie traits in his preseason debut during the 49ers' 19-16 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday night.

“It was fun," Lance said. “Obviously left a lot of big plays out there. I wish I would have taken advantage of the opportunities that were given a few times. ... But it’s awesome to be out there playing again.”

The Niners traded three first-round picks to draft Lance third overall in April to be their quarterback of the future. But they also still have incumbent Jimmy Garoppolo, so how soon that future comes remains to be seen.

Lance had an up-and-down first performance with a few off-target throws, three sharp passes that were dropped by his receivers, and four sacks behind a spotty offensive line.

But he also delivered that perfectly placed deep pass.

“There was some good and some bad,” coach Kyle Shanahan said. “By no means was it perfect. Good first day. I didn’t want it to go perfect for him.”

Chad Henne threw a TD pass to Byron Pringle after a short cameo by Patrick Mahomes to begin the game, and rookie Shane Buechele scored on a 1-yard keeper with 1:14 to play to win it for Kansas City.

On the first play of his second possession, Lance faked a handoff and rolled to his left on a staple play in Shanahan's offense. With Brandon Aiyuk open in front of him, Lance stopped on the hash mark and threw a strike nearly 40 yards downfield to the right side of the field for the TD pass to Trent Sherfield.

“Being able to play with Trey is an amazing thing,” Sherfield said. “He’s a real phenom. He’s going to be really, really good in this league.”

That was the only TD for San Francisco in Lance's eight drives. He also led the Niners to one field goal and got them out of the shadow of their goal posts with a 34-yard pass to Charlie Woerner from his end zone.

Lance even got two opportunities late in the half to run the two-minute offense, but had little success. San Francisco managed just one first down on the two possessions and Lance nearly threw an interception to Rashad Fenton.

Lance finished 5 of 14 for 128 yards and the one TD and didn't run the ball once despite excelling at that in college at North Dakota State.

Garoppolo went 3 for 3 for 26 yards on his one drive that ended in a punt.

DIFFERENT APPROACH

The Niners held out 22 players, including nearly their entire starting defense, along with tight end George Kittle, running back Raheem Mostert, fullback Kyle Juszczyk and offensive linemen Trent Williams and Alex Mack.

Kansas City took a different approach, with only one starter held out in linebacker Willie Gay.

INJURY UPDATE

Chiefs LB Darius Harris left with a hand injury and didn't return. ... Niners rookie Aaron Banks left with an injured shoulder. ... San Francisco rookie RB Elijah Mitchell didn't dress for the game because of a hip injury that will likely sideline him for a couple of weeks.

MAHOMES' DAY

Patrick Mahomes played one series behind Kansas City's overhauled offensive line that features five new starters from last season, including three players who have never suited up for an NFL game.

Mahomes took part in four plays, handing off twice, completing a short pass to Travis Kelce and then a third-down incompletion to Mecole Hardman that led to a punt.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Whether it was through faith, through family or through football – the three “F’s” – as former Florida State linebacker Derrick Brooks referred to them, Bobby Bowden touched the lives of countless people during his Hall of Fame career at FSU.

The impressive gathering of former players and coaches who flocked to the Donald L. Tucker Center for Bowden’s “Celebration of Life” memorial at FSU on Saturday morning gave evidence of the importance of Bowden’s legacy.

“I know him. He would be so happy right now, seeing all these former players, coaches here together,” said Rev. Dr. Bobby Butler, one of Bowden’s first great players at the school who presided over the ceremony, and is now the assistant pastor at New Destiny Christian Ministries in Norcross, Georgia.

Over 300 of Bowden’s former players along with former assistant coaches like Mark Richt, Chuck Amato, Mickey Andrews and Jimbo Fisher were among the crowd of roughly 1,200 who came to pay their respects to the legendary FSU coach who passed away last Sunday at age 91 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.

As they did when Bowden Lied in Repose on campus at the Moore Athletic Center and Lied in Honor at the state Capitol building on Friday, fans lined up over an hour before doors opened to attend the ceremony, mostly clad in garnet and gold jerseys and T-shirts.

Bowden memorial:Crowds go the extra mile to say goodbye to legendary Florida State coach Bobby Bowden

Andrews, who served as the Seminoles’ defensive coordinator from 1984-2001 and coached with Bowden until he retired in 2009, asked how many people in attendance coached for Bowden.

A few stood.

But when he asked how many played for Bowden, nearly everyone seated in the section of floor seats, which stretched across the area where FSU typically plays its basketball games, stood up.

“He didn’t have his biggest wins on Saturday. They weren’t in 1993 or 1999. It was on Sunday morning, when he walked in and said, ‘Jesus, great job, buddy!” Andrews said barely holding back tears. “Thank you, Coach.”

Impressive guest list of players, coaches

Andrews was among the guest speakers at the event, which included other former players such as Charlie Ward and Warrick Dunn. Others attending included Terrell Buckley and Kez McCorvey.

Fisher, the head coach at Texas A&M since leaving FSU in 2017, returned to the school for the first time since then. Fisher, Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney and USF coach Jeff Scott took time from their respective preseason preparations to be in attendance.

Alabama head coach Nick Saban did not attend, but sent flowers to Bowden’s memorial service at the Tallahassee Capitol Building on Friday on his and his wife’s behalf.

Bowden’s sons, Tommy (a former coach at Clemson) and Terry, who has taken a leave of absence from his coaching position at Louisiana-Monroe, spoke at the service.

Deion Sanders, now the coach at Jackson State, was originally scheduled to speak at the memorial, but was unable to attend. Sanders planned to be with Bowden’s family on Sunday before a family-only service will be held in Trussville, Alabama on Monday morning.

Ceremony highlights

Saturday’s ceremony began with a violin rendition of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way,” played by former FSU quarterback Charlie Ward’s daughter, Hope, and accompanied on the piano by Bill Peterson, a professor of music in Jazz Studies and Music Theory/Composition at the school.

Bowden definitely did things his way during a career in which he won 377 games during his four-decade Hall of Fame career, which included 34 seasons at FSU. Bowden’s Hall of Fame career included a pair of national championships and 12 ACC championships at a Seminoles’ program he put on the map by the end of the 1970s.

It also featured performances by the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir and a final performance to conclude the ceremony by the FSU Marching Chiefs.

Faith mattered

Brooks, who spoke in Sanders’ place, and shared a message from Sanders to Bowden’s family expressing such gratitude.

“When (Sanders) needed a Godly man in his life, coach Bowden made him a Godly man and helped him have a belief in Jesus Christ every day,” Brooks said.

Ward, the Seminoles’ first Heisman Trophy winner and quarterback of their first national championship team in 1993, also reflected on how much Bowden’s influenced strengthened their religious faith.

“He prepared me to see what humility looked like as a leader,” Ward said.

Family mattered to Bobby Bowden

Brooks shared a story from his freshman season when he was called into Bowden’s office due to getting a C in a class with his mom on the phone. Brooks said he didn’t know his mom was on the phone and Bowden didn’t know explicit language that would come out of her mouth when she was told.

Brooks credited Bowden’s influence in moments like those when he kept a close relationship with his family to make sure his academics stayed on track.

Bowden’s daughter, Ginger Bowden Madden, read from a note that Bobby wrote his then-girlfriend, Ann, who went on to be his wife of 72 years, when he went to go play football at Alabama in 1949.

Bowden transferred from Alabama to Howard College (now Samford) because Alabama didn't allow scholarship players to be married at that time.

Football a priority, but not 'THE' priority

Dunn noted how three recipients of the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year Award (himself, Brooks and former Seminoles wide receiver Anquan Boldin), which recognizes outstanding community service, were coached by Bowden.

Dunn met Bowden only months after the tragic death of his mother. Says he's where he is now because Coach Bowden took a chance on him, a 5-foot-9 running back who was really 5-foot-7.

As he stepped onto the stage, which was adorned with several assortments of flowers, Richt took a long pause before opening his speech and softly said: “It was an honor to coach for him.”

Terry Bowden reminisced about the kindness his father always showed them, said: “Football was always A priority for my father, but it was never THE priority.”

“There was not a single player on his team he didn’t care about,” Andrews said. “It didn’t matter whether they were a star or a walk-on.”

Ward expressed his gratitude for Bowden maintaining his faith in his abilities and supporting him, as a two-sport college athlete, to continue playing basketball.

But most of all it was Bowden’s lessons on perseverance that made the biggest impact on him and so many of his teammates.

“He may be dancing in Heaven,” Ward said. “But his legacy will stay behind though all the people he impacted.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BALTIMORE — In their quests to prove themselves as worthy successors to retired future Hall of Famer Drew Brees, New Orleans Saints quarterbacks Taysom Hill and Jameis Winston each gave the hosting Baltimore Ravens their best shots in their preseason opener Saturday night at M&T Bank Stadium.

But unfortunately for the dueling quarterbacks and their team, neither delivered an authoritative, statement type performance that their coaches and fans had hoped. And so, the Saints will head to Week 2 of the preseason with just as muddled a quarterback picture as they did when Brees retired back in March.

The Ravens — playing without Lamar Jackson, who was on hand but has had limited practice time after missing the first 10 days of camp while in quarantine — won the game 17-14, thanks largely to six takeaways by the defense and promising second-half play by backup quarterback Tyler Huntley.

Here are three things we learned Saturday night:

1. This could take a while: Saints coach Sean Payton said he wanted to see his quarterbacks for a preseason game or two before making his decision on a starter. And for good reason. In practices, both have been solid, but neither has shined. Things didn’t change once Hill and Winston took the field for an actual game. Both did some good things, stringing together consecutive passes and directing promising drives. But both had an interception credited to them, and both displayed inconsistencies.

Payton may wind up having to go with a quarterback-by-committee approach by necessity. We’ll see if either can deliver a stronger performance next week.

2. The Saints need Michael Thomas: One of the challenges of evaluating these quarterbacks is the limited resources they have to work with. Thomas remains hobbled, and friction remains between he and Payton. But the Saints really do need him because there’s such little proven talent to work with as Hill and Winston threw to a cast of largely undrafted wideouts. Players like Thomas and star running back Alvin Kamara could help elevate each.

3. Young opportunistic defense for Baltimore: It’s just the preseason, yes. But you want to see promising play out of young players, and the Ravens did receive that from young players like Geno Stone, Patrick Queen, Sean Wade and others. Many veterans didn't play, but that meant opportunity for others, and the Ravens do appear to have improved the young depth of their defense.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — It was a moment New York Jets fans have been waiting for since the NFL draft in April. And it finally happened Saturday night.

Rookie quarterback Zach Wilson, the No. 2 overall pick, played his first professional game as the Jets faced the Giants at MetLife Stadium. It was just a preseason game, of course. But it was an important milestone and our first chance to evaluate Wilson in a non-practice setting.

So how did he look? And how much did he play? Here are our takeaways from his first professional outing.

1. An efficient beginning

Wilson was on the field for two drives and a little over one quarter, which was the plan laid out by coach Robert Saleh late in the week. He completed 6-of-9 passes for 63 yards and led the Jets on one scoring drive — Chris Naggar converted a field goal on the Jets' opening possession of the game.

Wilson didn't do anything flashy during his 20 plays on the field. And the Jets didn't ask him to. Offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur took a balanced approach, running the ball 11 times with nine passes during Wilson's time on the field. He completed his first pass as a pro for a 9-yard gain to Corey Davis and went from there.

2. Best throws come at critical times

Wilson didn't have any huge plays in this game. But his two best throws both came on third down, which is exactly what you want to see from the rookie quarterback.

On the first drive, with the Jets facing third-and-6 on the Giants 27, Wilson found Davis on a perfectly timed out route on the left sideline. It was a quick release and the throw had good velocity. Davis picked up nine yards near the sideline and the drive stayed alive.

On his second and final drive of the game, Wilson and the Jets started deep in their own territory. And Wilson helped the Jets get out of the shadow of their own end zone with his biggest gain of the night: on third-and-9 from his own 20, Wilson delivered a strike to Keelan Cole for a 16-yard gain and a first down.

Wilson had plenty of time to throw and he used it, as Cole found a soft spot in the middle of the defense and caught the perfectly-placed throw from Wilson.

Wilson ended up going 3-for-4 on third down while converting two into first downs. He couldn't find Davis on third-and-4 from the Giants 12, ending the first drive. And on the second drive, on third-and-14, he found tight end Tyler Croft for a 13-yard gain — that came after Wilson converted the third down with a short pass to Jamison Crowder on the previous play, but it was wiped out by offensive interference.

The Jets went for it on fourth-and-1 from the Giants 42, ending the drive and his night.

3. The bottom line

Wilson was playing against the Giants' backup defense, so we still don't know exactly how he's going to look against a real NFL defense. But that shouldn't take much away from his performance. This was the first time he faced a defense he'd never seen before and his first time on a professional field, and it went pretty well for him.

And he faced some real challenges, like the possibility of actually getting tackled for the first time since he played a college game nearly eight months ago. On the second drive, the Jets failed to pick up a blitz and Giants linebacker Tae Crowder came running through untouched. Wilson saw him and got rid of the ball quickly, avoiding a big hit.

Overall, Wilson wasn't spectacular. But he left the field without taking a big hit and he had a solid, efficient performance. An ideal result for his first preseason game.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This story is part of USA TODAY Sports' 25 days to college football countdown.

It's been almost three years since Ohio State's last loss to a Big Ten opponent, a 49-20 shocker against Purdue on Oct. 20, 2018, and it's been a decade since the Buckeyes' last season with more than one loss in conference play.

In a sport owned by the power four — OSU, Alabama, Clemson and Oklahoma — the Buckeyes have a case for being the most dominant regular-season team of them all since 2012, especially when given the Big Ten's overall depth compared to, say, the ACC.

To get back into this year's College Football Playoff and play for the program's first national title since 2014, OSU will have to get past Oregon, Penn State and the winner of the Big Ten West division, which has two rivals more than capable of pulling off the upset on a single Saturday in December.

Those opponents and the rest of the Big Ten are still chasing the Buckeyes, who top the league's preseason power rankings.

1. Ohio State (2020 record: 7-1)

As C.J. Stroud prepares to take over under center, consider how the past two Ohio State first-year starting quarterbacks — Dwayne Haskins in 2018 and Justin Fields a year later — have fared since coach Ryan Day's arrival: 91 combined touchdowns, 11 interceptions and 8,104 yards on 9.1 yards per attempt. Oh, and a 26-2 record. Stroud will take over huge expectations along with the keys to the kingdom.

2. Penn State (4-5)

Overlooked and undervalued after struggling during the pandemic season, the Nittany Lions will rebound behind a veteran quarterback, loads of talent at the skill positions and an experienced defensive back seven. The one concern is the ability to generate a pass rush up front, a necessity for slowing the Buckeyes' offense.

3. Wisconsin (4-3)

Do not sleep on the Badgers as a legitimate threat to reach the playoff. We'll know for sure by the end of September, after games against Penn State and Notre Dame, but the biggest factor may be the resurgence of a running game that averaged just 3.9 yards per carry in 2020, the program's worst effort since 2015. If that total rebounds, the Badgers are good enough to win 10 or more games during the regular season.

4. Iowa (6-2)

Five points is all that separated Iowa from an unbeaten 2020 season. Like West division rival Wisconsin, the Hawkeyes have the talent, depth and coaching to be a playoff factor. But the schedule has to be taken into consideration: Iowa plays Indiana and Penn State from the East, though both at home, and takes on Iowa State, Wisconsin and Nebraska on the road.

5. Indiana (6-2)

Getting to nine wins for the first time in more than 50 years demands a healthy season from star quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and a strong start against a tough early schedule: Indiana gets Iowa, Cincinnati and Penn State by the first week of October. The Hoosiers believe they can get there, and maybe even beyond, in a testament to the confident mindset instilled by coach Tom Allen.

6. Michigan (2-4)

A more veteran team enters what resembles a make-or-break season for Jim Harbaugh. While heavy attention continues to be paid to the ongoing quarterback competition, an even more important factor may be Michigan's ability to stop the run. While against a shortened schedule and in difficult conditions, last year's defense allowed 178.8 yards per game on the ground, the program's worst total since 2010.

7. Nebraska (3-5)

The roster sure looks different compared to coach Scott Frost's first team, which was physically well short of the challenge posed by life in the Big Ten. Now 12-20 across three years, Frost brings into 2021 an imposing defense and the makings of a vastly better offense, especially in the passing game. The key to a breakthrough season will be a clean year from quarterback Adrian Martinez and a strong start, since a friendlier first half to the schedule turns brutal with a three-game close against Ohio State, Wisconsin and Iowa.

8. Northwestern (7-2)

Experienced Northwestern teams under Pat Fitzgerald always manage to outperform expectations and find a home in the Top 25. (Last year's team, which went 7-2 and won the division, is the latest example.) Based on returning starters and production, the 2021 Wildcats are one of the least experienced teams in the country. Let's meet in the middle and call this a solid bowl team based on Fitzgerald's terrific track record and the worrisome lack of proven commodities at nearly every position.

Story continues below video:

9. Minnesota (3-4)

The Golden Gophers have one of the best backs in the country in Mohamed Ibrahim, who cracked the 100-yard mark in all seven of his games in 2020 and scored 15 touchdowns, good for fifth in the FBS. Like more teams than not, you can link the Gophers' running game to the team's overall success: Minnesota is 16-3 under P.J. Fleck when averaging at least 4.3 yards per carry and 10-16 when not.

10. Rutgers (3-6)

A bowl bid may not come in 2021 but it's coming, period. The rebuilding project under coach Greg Schiano is very clearly ahead of schedule after a highly competitive first year back on the sidelines, raising hopes that Rutgers will soon reclaim a place in annual Top 25 contention. It'll probably take another two recruiting classes before the roster is really up to the challenge in a difficult East division, however.

11. Maryland (2-3)

Recruiting has gone about as well as expected under coach Mike Locksley and the offense has taken a good step forward, again as expected. The defense lags behind the curve but does return most of last year's two-deep, with that experience expected to boost the Terrapins' 2020 numbers against the run. The biggest worry is a schedule that includes two strong bowl teams in non-conference play (West Virginia and Kent State) in addition to the normally brutal Big Ten slate.

25 DAYS TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL COUNTDOWN

Preseason Top 25: From No. 1 Alabama to No. 25 Mississippi

All-America teams: Clemson leads all schools with six players named

ACC power rankings: Three teams vying for playoff consideration

Big 12 power rankings: Oklahoma, Iowa State cut above

12. Michigan State (2-5)

The roster overhaul continues at a frenzied pace, with the hope that this influx of arrivals eventually allows Mel Tucker to build a program in his likeness. Transfers alone have remade almost every position and should help MSU be more competitive than in 2020, when the Spartans were outscored by just over 17 points per game. Even with greater depth and a stronger grasp of Tucker's vision, this team could realistically be 1-3 after September and 2-6 after October before taking on OSU and PSU to end the regular season.

13. Purdue (2-4)

Games against Oregon State and Minnesota will decide whether Purdue can get back into bowl play and reclaim some of the goodwill that followed coach Jeff Brohm's first two seasons (2017-18). Wins in both would likely leave the Boilermakers at 4-1 heading into an off week Oct. 9, after which point the schedule gets pretty nasty: at Iowa, vs. Wisconsin, at Nebraska, vs. Michigan State, at Ohio State, vs. Northwestern (in Chicago) and vs. Indiana.

14. Illinois (2-6)

This is the weakest team in the Big Ten but not a terrible team overall, which is a statement about the depth in the conference, the pieces left in place by ex-coach Lovie Smith and the track record of new hire Bret Bielema. But this is a multiple-year process aided somewhat by Illinois playing in the West division.

CHICAGO — Once rookie quarterback Justin Fields settled in, the Chicago Bears saw the playmaking ability they dreamed about on draft day.

Fields rallied Chicago back Saturday from a 13-0 deficit in his preseason debut by throwing for a touchdown and running for another in a 20-13 victory over the Miami Dolphins.

"It is preseason and we understand that there’s variables involved and all that, but at the same time, if you said is he doing what you want him to do? Absolutely," Bears coach Matt Nagy said.

In just over two quarters of playing time, Fields was 14-of-20 for 142 yards and was at his best rolling outside the pocket and throwing.

"I definitely feel good outside of the pocket," Fields said. "It puts a lot of pressure on the defense and allows me to play backyard football with the receivers."

Fields’ passing also helped the Bears get on the scoreboard for the first time with a 53-yard Cairo Santos field goal on the final play of the first half. Until that possession, the Bears hadn’t picked up a first down as Miami dominated play early.

With Soldier Field fans chanting "Let’s Go Fields," the former Ohio State passer replaced starter Andy Dalton with 12:11 left until halftime but needed a few drives to get warmed up. Fields did fumble during a scramble following a spin move in the second quarter before the rally began, but the ball went out of bounds.

"I think after that I’m going to officially retire the spin move," Fields said.

The Bears put away the win with Brian Johnson’s 44-yard field goal following a 51-yard run by Artavis Pierce in the fourth quarter after Fields left the game.

The performance left Bears players bubbling.

"He’s a natural," said receiver Rodney Adams, who led the Bears with four catches for 57 yards.

The passing of Jacoby Brissett and Tua Tagovailoa staked the Dolphins to their early lead. Brissett threw a 23-yard TD pass to Salvon Ahmed, and Jason Sanders had field goals of 21 and 35 yards in the first half.

Tagovailoa, who started for Miami, found tight end Mike Gesicke for a 50-yard completion to set up the 21-yard field goal. Tagovailoa went 8-of-11 for 99 yards. Brissett was 6-of-10 for 67 yards.

The Dolphins were stopped once on the 1-yard line and also by an interception in the end zone.

"Offensively we actually moved the ball, we just didn’t finish drives," Dolphins coach Brian Flores said. "So you know, you don’t finish the drives, you can’t punch it in from the 1, turn it over in that area of the field, it comes back to bite you. And it did today."

FUTURE STARTER? Fields will keep his focus on improving for now and not on what he might need to do to take the starting spot from Dalton. Nagy has insisted Dalton is the starter.

"I think when you look into the future you start worrying about way too much stuff," Fields said. "You start thinking too much ahead."

HELP ARRIVES: The Bears have reached agreement with former Eagles and Bills veteran Jason Peters, 39, and will let him have a chance to win the left tackle spot.

"I think he’s coming in here to be the left tackle," Nagy said. "It’s open, man. It’s competition."

Rookie Teven Jenkins had been expected to start there but has had back issues. The team hasn’t said he’s going on injured reserve.

"It’s more about familiarity with a guy that’s played in this league for a long time," Nagy said. "He’s been very good."

Peters played for current Bears offensive line coach Juan Castillo in Philadelphia.

LEBRON SHOUT-OUT: LeBron James gave Fields a shout-out on social media during the game.

"Of course, I think this is my second shout-out from him," Fields said, noting he had one in the national semifinal win over Clemson last year. "I think it’s awesome for a prestigious athlete to give me a shout-out like that. Of course, I’ve been a LeBron fan since I was 6 or 7 years old. I used to have his poster up in my room."

TAKEAWAY REBIRTH: The Bears’ defense has made a huge point of forcing more turnovers under new coordinator Sean Desai. They succeeded against Miami with an interception and a fumble recovery.

Tagovailoa’s pass to former Bears tight end Adam Shaheen was plucked by backup Bears safety DeAndre Houston-Carson just inside the end zone in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, safety Marqui Christian stripped tight end Kai Locksley of the ball after a completion and Dionte Ruffin recovered for Chicago.

The interception was on Tagovailoa, Flores said.

"I was late," Tagovailoa said. "And in this league you can never be late over the middle in the red area. Like I said, those are recipes for disaster and that’s what happened."

RETURN SPARK: Miami first-round draft pick Jaylen Waddle did nothing in the passing game in his debut but started the Dolphins out well with a 24-yard punt return. The Dolphins also had a 34-yard punt return by Jakeem Grant Sr.

INJURY REPORT: Bears WR Allen Robinson missed the game due to hamstring tightness. The Dolphins were without WR Will Fuller, who has been out with a foot injury.

UP NEXT: The Dolphins host Atlanta on Aug. 21. They will host the Falcons in joint practices on Wednesday and Thursday leading up to the game.

The Bears host Buffalo on Aug. 21 as former Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky comes to Soldier Field.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Trevor Bauer, currently on administrative leave from the Los Angeles Dodgers as he faces investigations he sexually assaulted a woman earlier this year, faced a previous order of protection filed by an Ohio woman in 2020, according to a published report.

In a series of events that partially mirror the order of protection filed against Bauer in Pasadena earlier this year, the Washington Post reported that a woman alleged Bauer choked her without her consent and injured her while they had sex in 2017, and proceeded to send her threatening messages via text and social media. The protective order obtained by the Post has remained sealed, while a police report detailing a 2017 incident in which the woman showed police injuries to her eyes has been expunged.

Bauer, then 26, was pitching for Cleveland in August 2017 when police were summoned to his apartment, according to the expunged police report obtained by the Post. The report says said Bauer complained the woman tried to physically harm him, while the woman showed officers pictures of injuries she said were sustained during a previous encounter with Bauer, including damage to her eyes as a result of him choking her.

The woman was arrested for underage drinking, according to the police report. The Post also obtained photos of bruises the woman said she sustained when he struck her without her consent during a 2018 encounter.

Cleveland traded Bauer to Cincinnati in July 2019, and he won the NL Cy Young Award during the shortened 2020 season

The woman filed the protective order in June 2020, which according to the Post came after Bauer sent her threatening messages, including one stating, “I don’t feel like spending time in jail for killing someone. And that’s what would happen if I saw you again.”

Bauer and his attorneys have denied the allegations, Bauer tweeting a statement that said the woman was creating a “false narrative” and that she continued to contact him in subsequent years after the encounter in question. A statement from Bauer’s attorneys, Jon Fetterolf and Rachel Luba, says the woman raised the specter of a protective order “as a means to threaten and extort money from Mr. Bauer, demanding $3.4 million for her to ‘remain silent.’”

However, emails obtained by the Post indicate it was one of Bauer’s attorneys who first raised the specter of a monetary settlement.

Major League Baseball is investigating the Ohio woman's allegations against Bauer, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.

The Post reported that in July, an MLB investigator sought police records related to the 2017 incident.

MLB placed Bauer on administrative leave on July 2, and it has been mutually extended by the league and the union on multiple occasions as a judge in Los Angeles awaits to determine whether to grant an order of protection to a San Diego woman who claimed Bauer punched and injured her without her consent.

The hearing on the order has been delayed multiple times as attorneys for Bauer and the woman receive new evidence. It is expected to move forward over multiple days next week.

Kendra Barkoff, spokesperson for the Ohio woman, released a statement to USA TODAY Sports attributed to one of the woman's attorneys, Joseph Darwal, indicating the woman was not intending to come forward before the Post obtained police and court documents.

"My client had no interest in coming forward about her experience as she feared the possible consequences of doing so, as seen in what is occurring in California," Darwal said in the statement. "However, once the Post reached out for comment regarding documents they received from third parties, she was left with no other choice but to come forward and confirm the documents they received."

Bauer is in the first year of a three-year, $102 million contract he signed with the Dodgers last winter. While he has been paid during his administrative leave, he faces a potentially lengthy unpaid suspension from MLB under its domestic violence policy. Any discipline by the league against Bauer will not occur until its investigation is complete.

MLB and the union's joint domestic violence policy states that players may be disciplined in the absence of criminal charges filed.

“The MLB should be applauded for their handling of this investigation," said Darwal in a statement. "Although they could not have known of our client’s story prior to the tragic events in California, their approach is both thorough and respectful. Our client is currently assisting the MLB in this investigation; however, as the process is ongoing I cannot comment further at this time.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Neither Drew Lock nor Teddy Bridgewater stood out from the other as both of Denver’s quarterback candidates faced Minnesota backups.

There sure was no reason to complain about any lack of clarity, though. The whole team looked sharp in the Broncos’ exhibition opener.

Lock passed for 151 yards and two touchdowns in three possessions in a crisp first audition for the open competition, Bridgewater followed suit and the Broncos beat the Minnesota Vikings 33-6 on Saturday afternoon.

"I’m thrilled that both of them played well. I want it to be a hard decision," said coach Vic Fangio, repeating the "even-steven" declaration he’s made on the race all summer.

Broncos first-round draft pick Pat Surtain II scored on a 30-yard interception return after a misdirected throw by Vikings backup Jake Browning, who was then pulled for rookie Kellen Mond.

K.J. Hamler had 105 receiving yards, including an 80-yard catch, sprint and score from Lock on the first play after a safety against the Vikings. Trinity Benson had two touchdowns, one from each of the quarterbacks vying to be the starter for September.

"From a mental standpoint and a physical standpoint, I feel like I’m a little past where I left off and it feels good to be able to say that," said Lock, the third-year passer who took the first turn and finished 5-for-7.

Bridgewater, acquired by new general manager George Paton in an offseason trade with Carolina, was 7-for-9 for 74 yards. Fangio has already promised to flip the order for the next game, but neither of them seems to be sweating the situation.

"There’s 10 other guys out there on the field competing to earn a spot on this team. If I make it about me in that moment, I’m hurting the team," said Bridgewater, who again received a rousing cheer from the Vikings fans still fond of him from his time here from 2014-17.

With the late-summer sun streaming through the giant glass front doors, the crowd — much of it in Broncos orange — was just happy to be back at U.S. Bank Stadium after the gates were closed for 2020 due to the pandemic.

The Vikings rested more than 30 players after two full days of practice against the Broncos at the team’s suburban headquarters this week. The only projected starter who played was defensive end Stephen Weatherly, leaving a lot to be desired for the competition level for Lock and Bridgewater.

The Broncos used most of their first-team offense, with running back Melvin Gordon III, wide receiver Courtland Sutton and left guard Dalton Risner the most notable absences, but Fangio kept his starting defense on the sideline.

Surtain, who was selected ninth overall out of Alabama ahead of quarterbacks Justin Fields and Mac Jones, made his mark when he muscled in front of an out route by fellow rookie Ihmir Smith-Marsette.

"I felt it coming. They ran the same route concept the drive before, so I was expecting it," Surtain said. "I just made a play on the ball."

Browning went 5-for-10 for 31 yards. Vikings right guard Dakota Dozier, who fell behind Oli Udoh in the competition for a starting spot, was whistled for holding on former teammate Shamar Stephen in the end zone for a safety. Dozier had a false start penalty later and was from the only Viking who turned in a less-than-stellar effort.

Coach Mike Zimmer was upset enough about the "very poor performance" that he vowed to send the same second-stringers out for an intense intra-squad scrimmage on the practice field next week.

"We were going to give these other guys some opportunities to see if they could make the club," Zimmer said. "Some of them proved us right. Some of them proved us wrong."

MOND DEBUTS: Mond, the third-round draft pick out of Texas A&M who could supplant Cousins in a year or two, went 6-for-16 for 53 yards. He rushed five times for 25 yards after missing a big chunk of training camp to COVID-19 recovery. He tested positive on July 31 and returned to practice earlier this week.

"I didn’t feel rusty at all," Mond said.

IN BLOOM: The standout for the Vikings was undrafted rookie A.J. Rose, who rushed 25 times for 100 yards. Rose, who played at Kentucky, has his action extended by an early injury to rookie Kene Nwangwu.

INJURY REPORT: Broncos — FS Trey Marshall sprained his ankle covering the opening kickoff and needed help to limp off the field. RB LeVante Bellamy, who had a 62-yard kickoff return, also hurt his ankle.

Vikings — Nwangwu, whose speed has been one of the highlights of training camp, returned the opening kickoff for 18 yards but hurt his knee and was declared out shortly after. LB Cam Smith, who sat out the 2020 season after open heart surgery, left with a concussion in the second quarter.

UP NEXT: The Broncos play at Seattle next Saturday night. The Vikings host Indianapolis next Saturday night.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INDIANAPOLIS -- In the largest IndyCar field outside of the Indianapolis 500 in a decade, Will Power beat 27 other cars to win his first race of 2021 in Saturday's Big Machine Spiked Coolers Grand Prix.

In a race with minimal yellows, perfect pit strategy was key to any kind of success. That’s typically the trend around the Indianapolis road course, and in a down year for Team Penske, great pit strategy was necessary to get their season turned around. It was just the second win for Team Penske this season.

The race was relatively uneventful until about 20 laps to go. While running in the top 5, points leader Alex Palou blew an engine to bring out the first full-course caution of the day. Scoring minimal points from a DNF, the championship leader saw his advantage in the championship drop to just 21 points over Pato O’Ward.

On the subsequent restart, Power’s lead increased when Colton Herta and Romain Grosjean battled for the second position. Grosjean, who won the pole and finished 2nd at the GMR Grand Prix in May, couldn't chase down Power in the closing laps.

Grosjean had one more chance to pass Power after Rinus VeeKay, May’s GMR Grand Prix winner, stalled in Turn 7 to bring out the second and final full-course yellow. That set up a 6-lap dash for the win.

It looked like Grosjean would be able to attack Power on the restart, but Grosjean had run out of push to pass, whereas Power had over a minute of the extra horsepower boost remaining.

As the laps ticked away, Power was able to gap Grosjean during the sprint to the finish and cruise to his fifth career victory on the IMS road course and sixth career win at IMS overall. Grosjean scored his second podium on the IMS road course while Colton Herta rounded out the podium, earning redemption for his late race crash that cost him victory in Nashville.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nico Ali Walsh, grandson of Muhammad Ali, won by TKO in his professional boxing debut Saturday night.

Ali Walsh, 21, defeated Jordan Weeks (4-2) when the referee stopped the fight at 1:49 of the first round.

“This lived up completely to my expectations,'' Ali Walsh said during an in-ring interview after the fight.

Ali Walsh landed a barrage of punches and prompted an eight-count earlier in the first round. While the referee allowed the fight to continue, it didn't go on for much longer, with Ali Walsh landing a flurry of punches on the overmatched Weeks.

The fight, at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was a middleweight bout scheduled to go four rounds.

Ali Walsh became the first grandchild of the boxing legend to fight professionally.

“Obviously my grandfather, I’ve been thinking about him so much,'' Ali Walsh said. "I miss him. And it’s just an emotional journey.''

Ali Walsh has signed a multi-fight deal with Top Rank Boxing, owned by legendary promoter Bob Arum, and has secured an endorsement deal with Everlast.

He estimated he had about 30 amateur fights and said he decided to turn pro after spending a few months working with notable trainer Abel Sanchez in Big Bear, California. After signing with Top Rank Boxing, Ali Walsh began working with SugarHill Steward, who trains heavyweight champion Tyson Fury.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sha'Carri Richardson couldn't race in the Olympics. Soon, she'll race the medalists.

Richardson missed the Tokyo Olympics after failing a drug test for marijuana after qualifying first at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency suspended her for a month and nullified her results in the trials on July 2. She later said she smoked after her biological mother died.

Now, Richardson will race the Jamaicans that swept the 100-meter sprint in a meet on Aug. 21 in Eugene, Oregon. Richardson will race Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson in the Prefontaine Classic.

The race will be a return to the University of Oregon's Hayward Field, the location of this year's Olympic Trialswhere the 21-year-old Richardson posted a time of 10.86 seconds. The Prefontaine Classic race includes six of the eight women who raced in the 100-meter final in Tokyo.

The race sets up a glimpse of what could have happened in Tokyo had Richardson not been suspended. Richardson's suspension spurred a debate on whether marijuana belongs on the banned-substances list.

Richardson rose to fame in 2019 when, as a freshman at Louisiana State University, she broke the 100-meter record at the NCAA Outdoor National Championships.

In April 2021, Richardson ran a new personal best of 10.72 seconds at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, to win gold. She became the sixth-fastest woman of all time and the fourth-fastest American woman in history with that mark.

As a teenager in 2016, she won the 100-meter title at the AAU Junior Olympics. She won another title at the USA Track & Field Junior Championships in 2017.

Richardson's international debut was at the 2017 Pan American U20 Athletics Championships where she won a gold medal in the 4x100-meter relay.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@To the crowd's delight, No.1 overall pick Trevor Lawrence trotted on the field on the Jacksonville Jaguars' opening drive in Saturday night's preseason opener against the Cleveland Browns.

It was indeed the start of a new era with Urban Meyer making his coaching debut.

But the Jaguars struggled with some familiar problems during their 23-13 loss to the Browns in front of 57,508 at TIAA Bank Field.

Not even Lawrence's strong arm and pinpoint accuracy could keep him from experiencing the impact of relentless pass-rush pressure from the Browns.

On his first play from scrimmage, Lawrence was dropped for a sack when the pocket collapsed in a hurry.

Playing with the starters, Lawrence was 6-of-9 for 71 yards.

He was sacked twice and often pressured, an indication the Jaguars' offensive line is a work in progress with just under a month to go before they open the regular season against the Houston Texans.

''Just disappointed offensively… I don’t wanna be one of those slow, wallowing offenses,” Meyer said. ''(Lawrence) held the ball a little bit. He certainly wasn't awe-struck. I saw good plays.

''I saw a guy who made a couple nice plays on third down. I think he held the ball a little bit a couple times, which you would expect out of him maybe. Instead of anticipating the throws (he was) holding on to it a little bit but we have a long way to go.”

Lawrence's first sack occurred because starting right guard A.J. Cann got beat inside by former Jaguars defensive tackle Sheldon Day.

Lawrence was sacked two plays into the Jaguars' second drive. Cleveland brought pressure from the edge and right tackle Jawaan Taylor struggled to set his feet and seal the edge.

With nowhere to go, Lawrence was sacked by Browns defensive end Porter Gustin for a 5-yard loss.

On the Jaguars' next play, though, Lawrence performed like he so often did at Clemson as a three-year starter. He threw a beautiful deep pass to wide receiver Marvin Jones for a 35-yard catch.

It was Lawrence's longest completion of the night and it came after the offensive line allowed him time to survey the field and wait for Jones to a get step on Browns cornerback Greg Newsome II.

After his opening play sack, Lawrence made consecutive completions to slot receiver Laviska Shenault for 8 yards and Jones for 10. In nine plays, the Jaguars behind Lawrence gained 30 yards.

But on a third-and-4 play from their own 45, Lawrence was unable to connect with Shenault on a pass attempt that led to the drive ending with a punt.

On the Jaguars' next drive, the Jaguars couldn't convert a fourth-and-1 play when running back James Robinson was stopped for no gain after Lawrence handed him the ball after being lined up in a shotgun formation.

''One of the sacks was on me holding the ball too long,'' Lawrence said. ''Obviously, there are things we have to clean up. It's disappointing anytime you lose.''

Regardless of who took snaps from behind center, the Jaguars quarterbacks struggled to get into a rhythm because of the Browns' constant blitzes and pressure off the edge.

Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew replaced Lawrence in the second quarter on the Jaguars' third drive of the game. He completed 4-of-8 for 47 yards with an interception and was sacked once on a blitz when Cann failed to recognize whom to pick up.

Most of the Browns' top players – quarterback Baker Mayfield, wide receiver Jarvis Landry and edge rushers Myles Garrett and Jadeveon Clowney – sat out the game. The Browns played only one offensive starter and only three on defense. But during a stretch in the second quarter, the Jaguars were outgained 176-85 in total offense.

Still, backup C.J. Beathard directed the Jaguars on their first scoring drive of the game. It came early in the fourth quarter when Beathard threw a 5-yard TD pass to Tavon Austin. Before giving way to Jake Luton, Beathard completed 13-of-16 passes for 102 yards with no turnovers.

Luton led the Jaguars downfield on their final drive of the game, going 52 yards in 11 plays. With 29 seconds remaining in the game, Luton threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tyler Davis. Luton completed 8 of 13 for 53 yards.

Next up for the Jaguars is the New Orleans Saints in their second preseason game Aug. 23 at the Superdome. The Saints lost their preseason opener to the Baltimore Ravens 17-14 Saturday night.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler announced on Twitter that he has been dropped from an Uber Eats ad campaign due to his views on mask mandates for children in schools.

"Lost a commercial with Uber eats partnering with the NFL," Cutler wrote on Twitter. "Was going to film in LA, 'views aren't aligned.' Guess they don't like future School board members. Frees up my weekend."

The 38-year-old Cutler only recently returned to Twitter and has used the social media platform to voice his displeasure with health regulations related to the coronavirus pandemic, including mask mandates.

The one-time Pro Bowl passer-turned-reality TV star also has hinted at a possible run for school board in Tennessee over mask mandates.

"We are proud of all the work Uber has done over the last year to help get as many people vaccinated as possible. As such, we prefer to partner with those who support that work," an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement to USA TODAY.

Cutler was a first-round selection – No. 11 overall – by the Denver Broncos in the 2006 NFL draft. After three seasons in Denver, Cutler was traded to the Chicago Bears. He had an up-and-down career in Chicago, twice leading the NFL in interceptions, while also helping the team reach the 2010 NFC championship game and becoming the Bears' all-time career passing yardage leader. After a brief retirement, Cutler signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins in 2017. He finished his 12-year NFL career passing for 35,133 yards and 227 touchdowns.

In 2013, Cutler married reality TV star Kristin Cavallari, and he made appearances on her show "Very Cavallari." Their marriage ended in divorce in 2020.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INDIANAPOLIS – Excitement was the goal, but chaos took its place Sunday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the NASCAR Cup series’ inaugural race on the road course. What transpired may very well go down with Formula 1’s tire debacle, and NASCAR’s own rubber mess in 2008, as one of the darkest days on the competition front in the history of the Racing Capital of the World.

Years later, record books will state that A.J. Allmendinger, racing’s definition of a journeyman, won the Verizon 200 at the Brickyard — the replacement for the Brickyard 400 — with a NASCAR Cup Series team still in its infancy. Together, Kaulig Racing and Allmendinger have run just four races during the 2021 campaign, and Sunday’s victory is just the second in Allmendinger’s Cup career.

A résumé that includes 2004 Champ Car Rookie of the Year honors, a 2003 Atlantic Championship, a devastating near-miss in the 2013 Indy 500 and various other close calls, now has the type of memorable victory at the world’s most famous racetrack that elevates the 39-year-old into a different class.

But five, 10, 20 or 50 years into the future, it will serve as a footnote to a race created nearly a year ago as Roger Penske’s first major experiment in his IMS track ownership. Through his first 19 months in charge of IMS and IndyCar, Penske has fought tooth and nail to keep a track and a series alive amid a once-in-a-century pandemic and has, so far, come away with an ever-growing, thriving series and a race venue that was bustling with energy, excitement and intrigue Sunday morning.

It started with the Brickyard 400

In 1994, then-owner Tony George finally opened the track’s gates to the world of stock cars, permitting them to run on the world’s most famous oval at a time when the world’s most famous race may have been at or near its peak. Those were the days when overhead shots of IMS on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend couldn't find untouched swaths of grass. The crowd was too big.

And for a few years in the Brickyard 400’s infancy, it, too, took central Indiana and the racing world by storm, with the grandstands that now hold 250,00 nearly full. The racing was great, or as good as it could have been expected on the “asphalt rectangle.” Before long, though, NASCAR’s technological developments and regulations created a form of racing that many have long deemed untenable.

Though a not-so-quiet fraternity of veteran drivers have long staked their claim that any racing on the IMS oval has and always will be worth what it takes to have that opportunity in the first place, the powers that be – Penske and the France family – finally ruled nearly a year ago that change had to come.

In late-September of last year, NASCAR announced that, for the first time, and after what appeared to be a rousing success for its Xfinity series in July of last year, the Cup field would tackle the IMS road course and put the series’ oval history in Speedway on pause. After spending an initial $15 million during 2020 to bring the infrastructure of IMS up to his "Penske Perfect" standards, Penske spent another five-plus-million in recent months, including bolstering the road course’s curbs for this weekend’s impending stock car races.

Deeper investigation in the coming days by officials from Penske Entertainment Corp. and NASCAR will determine whether those curbs – particularly around Turns 5 and 6 on the road course – were the cause of Sunday’s late-race hysteria that ultimately saw nearly a dozen cars lost to the carnage, or whether it was repeated driver error, a poor racing series-track marriage, or some combination of all three.

Immediately after Allmendinger’s race, the driver who had a front seat for much of the wreckage that took place mid-pack near the end of Sunday’s race didn’t yet have an answer.

“I think it’s tough with these cars. I get it, in the sense we’ve all got to race to the limits of the track, but when these (cars) get out of control, you’re along for the ride at times,” Allmendinger said post-race. “In IndyCar, you can save and correct a little, but you need room to be able to maneuver (stock cars) and make a mistake and still get away with it.

“With these curbs, you pay a price, and we saw that when you hit it wrong, that’s a lot of money these team owners have to go through. Sitting under red, I looked over and thought, ‘Holy moly, we’ve gone through a lot.’ But it’s our job not to run over it that way. It’s a fine line, and this track doesn’t allow for much.”

Hints of issues in Xfinity action

On Saturday, the Xfinity series dealt with issues with what’s called a turtle curb that was inserted on the outer left side of Turn 6. On the first lap of the Pennzoil 150, several cars ran too wide a launched into the air and flew yards down the track. For Sunday, NASCAR removed that and left the traditional curb along the turn’s border, along with one on the right that, theoretically, would prevent cars from cutting straight through Turns 5 and 6.

The ideal racing line through that section was already nearly a straight line, and the closer you could get to the curb, the more speed you could keep, but a straight line a few feet the wrong way sent drivers soaring.

“That was wild during the end,” Kyle Larson said. “I couldn’t always see where I was going, and it was really easy to get off-line there a little bit.”

With 10 laps to go, NASCAR called a caution for debris in Turn 6. With most of the field pitting, series vet Denny Hamlin took over the race lead with Hendrick Motorsports’ trio of Chase Elliott, William Byron and Larson not far behind on fresh tires.

With five to go, Martin Truex Jr. spun following Turn 6, but as watchful eyes saw him skid down the track, they missed the debris cloud stemming from the Turn 6 curb that was nearing a breaking point. The next lap, Byron, running in the top-10, ran over it, and his 3,400-pound machine turned the metal curbing into something more like paper.

Nearly a dozen cars spun behind him, with some days ending in the tire barriers and others with thrashed bumpers and side panels at-best. After a nearly hour-long red/yellow flagged period – delayed by oil leakage from James Davison – the first of two overtimes took place after IMS’s AMR safety team removed the problem curb.

But the one that could still send cars visibly airborne existed, and the risk-reward dilemma still weighed enough in favor of taking risks. Michael McDowell went airborne, sending another pileup into motion.

At that point, some in the paddock wondered whether NASCAR and IMS would elect to finish the 200-mile experiment at all.

Though not without more spun out, busted cars, they did, and Allmendinger was left kissing the bricks.

But not without more questions than answers for a track and a series that knew it was taking a risk with its controversial move. Entering Sunday, two-time defending Brickyard champ Kevin Harvick called it “just another race,” and Kurt Busch said sliding around the track felt like racing in a parking lot.

The inaugural Verizon 200 by no means lacked in viral clips and quotes or memorable moments, and its second edition won’t be seen as “another race” on the calendar by teams and fans alike. Intrigue will no doubt follow, but not with the sparks Penske and NASCAR had in mind.

Joe Walton, the former New York Jets coach who built Robert Morris University's football program from the ground up, has died. He was 85.

Robert Morris announced in an obituary posted on its website that Walton died Sunday. No cause of death was provided.

Walton, a native of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania — the hometown of Pro Football Hall of Famer Joe Namath — coached the Jets for seven years and went 53-57-1 while leading New York to the playoffs twice.

A former NFL tight end for Washington and the Giants, Walton caught 178 passes for 2,628 yards and 28 touchdowns in seven seasons. He retired from playing after the 1963 season and joined the Giants as a scout two years later. Walton was promoted to wide receivers coach in 1969, a role he would serve for five years before going to Washington as the running backs coach.

Walton became Washington's offensive coordinator in 1978 and moved to the Jets in the same role in 1981. He replaced Walt Michaels as the Jets' head coach in 1983 and had one of the more successful coaching runs for the franchise with the two playoff runs, but he was fired after a 4-12 season in 1989.

“Joe Walton poured his heart into this franchise for nine seasons,” the Jets said in a statement. “Joining us as an offensive coordinator before taking over as the head coach, Joe fielded some of the franchise's most productive offenses and helped the teams to four playoff appearances during his tenure.

"He was a good man who cared for his players and loved the game of football.”

Walton closed out his NFL coaching career in Pittsburgh, where he served as the Steelers' offensive coordinator for two years.

Among the quarterbacks Walton worked with during his NFL career were Joe Theismann, Fran Tarkenton, Norm Snead, Ken O’Brien and Richard Todd.

In 1993, Walton was hired as the first coach in Robert Morris history and built the program by recruiting players, hiring assistants and even buying equipment for the team to play in its first season in 1994.

It was the beginning of a 20-year run during which the Colonials won outright Northeast Conference championships three times — in 1997, ‘99 and 2000 — and shared three others — 1996, ’98 and 2010. Walton also led Robert Morris to consecutive ECAC Bowl victories in 1996 and '97.

Walton finished 114-92-1 at the school, was a four-time conference coach of the year and is one of just a few men to win 50 games as a head coach in both the NFL and college. He was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 2013. The football stadium is also named after him.

“Coach Walton took our football program from nothing to something special," Robert Morris senior associate athletic director Marty Galosi said in a statement. "The fact that he built it from scratch and won early on was a bonus. He was a great coach, but he was a better man as well as a role model for all of the student-athletes and coaches that were under his tutelage. His legacy at RMU will last a long time.”

The son of former Washington guard Frank “Tiger” Walton, Joe Walton was an All-America selection at tight end twice at the University of Pittsburgh before being drafted by Washington in the second round in 1957.

Walton, who moved back to Beaver Falls in 1990, was married for 47 years before wife Ginger died in 2007. They had three children — daughters Jodi and Stacy, and son Joe — and six grandchildren. Walton also is survived by his second wife, Patty Sheehan Walton.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Round 1 goes to Jacob Eason.

The Indianapolis Colts' 2020 fourth-round pick completed 15 of 21 passes for 183 yards Sunday in a 21-18 preseason opening win against the Carolina Panthers. He outshined rookie Sam Ehlinger (10-for-15, 155 yards), the man standing between him and the spot directly behind Carson Wentz on the Colts' quarterback depth chart.

Eason, who earned the start Sunday, was far from perfect, but there's little doubt he played with the kind of poise and confidence coach Frank Reich wants to see out of one of his quarterbacks. He led the Colts to 10 points during his two quarters on the field, including a touchdown drive in the two-minute drill to end the half.

He also also didn't put the ball in danger in the air, unlike Ehlinger, who was intercepted on his fourth attempt of the game. The interception was definitely the low point for Ehlinger, who bounced back big time in the fourth quarter, making some great throws and leading the Colts to 11 points.

It's too soon to draw any firm conclusions, but it's probably fair to say that after Sunday's game, the Colts have every right to feel good about their quarterback room -- as is -- moving forward.

Eason inspires confidence

Throughout training camp, a recurring theme for Eason has been his tendency to hold onto the ball a little too long. That showed up on occasion Sunday, but for the most part, he stood tall in the pocket, got the ball out on time and even flashed better touch than he has during camp.

Eason made what might be his best throw of 2021, dropping a 37-yard pass to Parris Campbell in the bucket. It was beautifully run slot fade by Campbell, and Eason took advantage of the separation his third-year receiver got by hitting him in stride.

Eason also frequently flashed his impressive arm, including one memorable time on the run. On a 3rd-and-10, Eason rolled to his right to evade pressure and fired a seed to rookie Michael Strachan for a first down.

While he made a couple of fantastic throws, accuracy remains an issue for Eason. While his receivers should have hauled in at least three more of his passes Sunday, Eason could also do a better job of making their lives easier. He too often puts the ball in places where the receiver has to do a lot of work to make the catch.

If that sounds like nitpicking, it is. But make no mistake about it: When Eason watches this tape with his Colts coaches, they're going to be saying the same things to him.

Eason also fumbled once, though it's hard to assign him too much blame him for it. Feeling pressure from the left side, he stepped up in the pocket. But Carolina's Marquis Haynes made a great play, beating left tackle Will Holden and stripping Eason before he could make a throw.

Ehlinger starts slow, rebounds

Ehlinger's day started off rough. After a couple of short completions, Ehlinger tossed a bad interception on his fourth throw of the day.

Unlike his confident training camp persona, Ehlinger looked a bit indecisive early. On the interception, he pulled the trigger far too late and badly undershot rookie tight end --- and his former high school teammate -- Kylen Granson.

Ehlinger's indecisiveness came up again later, costing the Colts a chance to extend a drive. He failed to identify an open receiver on 3rd-and-5, then tried to scramble before not having the requisite arm strength to complete a pass to the sideline.

Still, it was far from all bad for Ehlinger. He rebounded from a rough third quarter to play quite well in the fourth. On a touchdown drive, he dropped a dime to Tarik Black, connecting for the Colts' biggest play of the day (47 yards). A few plays later, he flipped a pass to undrafted rookie Tyler Vaughns, who made a sensational one-handed grab to position the Colts at the one-yard line ahead of a Benny LeMay touchdown run.

Ehlinger also showed off his scrambling ability, punching in a game-tying two-point conversion and scrambling for 34 yards on four attempts.

Battle at wide receiver

Here's what we think we know about the Colts wide receiver position. T.Y. Hilton, Michael Pittman Jr. Zach Pascal and Parris Campbell are locks for the top four spots. Ashton Dulin has served as an excellent gunner for Bubba Ventrone's special teams unit for the past two years, and there's little reason to think he isn't primed to do so again this year. That means there's probably only one spot left for another wide receiver to make this team, and Michael Strachan and Dezmon Patmon aren't making that decision an easy one.

Strachan, a 2020 seventh-round pick, has been a training camp standout and put his immense skills on display Sunday with three catches for 57 yards, including one supremely impressive snag on a 50-50 ball from Eason. The 6-5 Strachan jumped high above his defender and plucked the football out of the air for a 32-yard gain to help position the Colts for a touchdown at the end of the first half. Strachan, however, also had two drops. Neither ball was perfectly thrown -- one too far outside and the other behind him -- but both were receptions NFL wide receivers are supposed to make.

Patmon, meanwhile, didn't make any highlight-reel plays, but consistently found ways to get open. The 2020 sixth-round pick led the Colts with five catches to go along with 49 yards. He, too, let an imperfect pass slip through his fingers, but for the most part he showed strong hands and route-running ability on Sunday.

Given their potential, maybe the Colts try to find a way to keep both on the roster, but the more likely reality is that these two are competing for the last spot on the wide receiver depth chart. With a month to go before the season starts, this competition will continue to be a fun one to watch.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This story is part of USA TODAY Sports' 25 days to college football countdown.

The first three weeks of September will determine whether the Pac-12 can garner the national recognition needed to be placed in the same conversation with the ACC, Big Ten and SEC.

Washington goes to Michigan. Stanford takes on Kansas State. Oregon State meets Purdue. California's at TCU. Colorado plays Texas A&M in Denver. UCLA hosts LSU.

Most important of all, Oregon's trip to Ohio State on Sept. 11 has the potential to drastically increase the level of respect paid to a conference that hasn't been a true factor in the chase for the national championship since 2016.

An Oregon win in Columbus would put the Pac-12 back on the map and make the eventual conference champion a strong contender for the College Football Playoff. There's pressure on the Ducks, who top the league's preseason power rankings.

1. Oregon (2020 record: 4-3)

The Ducks may end up being the best team in the Pac-12 but still fall short of the playoff, which might sound familiar for a conference that hasn't sent a team into the four-team field since 2016. If so, that would likely be the result of a schedule that sends Oregon to Ohio State in non-conference play and on the road against Stanford and Washington, the team's two biggest threats in the North division. Multiple top-ranked recruiting classes have beefed up the roster to an impressive level but the fate of the year may hinge on the play of quarterback Anthony Brown, a former Boston College transfer.

2. Southern California (5-1)

Almost every piece is in place for 10 or more wins during the regular season and a spot in the playoff conversation. One key factor is increased coaching continuity, with offensive coordinator Graham Harrell in his third season and defensive coordinator Todd Orlando heading into his second. There's also one of the nation's top quarterbacks in Kedon Slovis, though the Trojans must be noticeably more productive on the ground to find the offensive balance needed to be a true national threat.

25 DAYS TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL COUNTDOWN

Preseason Top 25: From No. 1 Alabama to No. 25 Mississippi

All-America teams: Clemson leads all schools with six players named

Power rankings: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten

3. Washington (3-1)

The biggest question mark may come on the sideline, where second-year coach Jimmy Lake has to show the right touch in pushing this team to the top of the conference. There is no doubt the Huskies are good enough to do just that and maybe even more, especially given the amount of depth seen in almost every position group.

4. Utah (3-2)

Utah's offensive and defensive lines could control the line of scrimmage against every opponents on its schedule. These imposing groups bolster confidence in the Utes' ability to again come out of relative anonymity — they're just outside the preseason USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll — and rise to the top of the South division. The offensive line in particular is the best in the conference and one of the best in the entire country.

5. Arizona State (2-2)

How will Arizona State's off-field drama impact a team pegged for eight-plus wins during the regular season? With three coaches on administrative leave amid an NCAA investigation into alleged recruiting violations, the Sun Devils will open the season against more background noise than almost any other program in the Football Bowl Subdivision. In a vacuum, ASU has the quarterback and overall roster to win the conference.

6. Stanford (4-2)

Stanford averaged 29.3 points per game against a six-game schedule last season, a positive sign given the average play of the offense in 2019. Despite the smaller sample size, that uptick bodes well for a team that takes on 12 Power Five opponents during the regular season — the nine Pac-12 games plus Kansas State, Vanderbilt and Notre Dame. And the offense needs to maintain that production while breaking in a new quarterback; if not, the Stanford defense needs to carry a heavy load after an uncharacteristically down 2020 season.

7. UCLA (3-4)

This is the year that UCLA finally breaks into the postseason under coach Chip Kelly, thanks to a roster with enough depth and experience to match wits with the best teams in the Pac-12. But with LSU on the schedule in non-conference play and both Oregon and Stanford drawn from the North division, the Bruins might take that step forward in overall performance yet still only get to six or seven wins before bowl play.

8. California (1-3)

The offense is an annual concern but the defense looks to be in great shape at linebacker and in the secondary, as coach Justin Wilcox continues to build that side of the ball into one of the best in the conference. The lack of answers on offense essentially eliminates the Golden Bears as a real factor in the divisional race but a very friendly schedule of home games does suggest a good chance at six wins.

9. Oregon State (2-5)

Nine of Oregon State's 12 losses across the past two seasons have come by 14 or fewer points. Experience may help address this issue. The Beavers bring back 19 starters and add a veteran quarterback in Colorado transfer Sam Noyer, though one of the few losses is worrisome: running back Jermar Jefferson ran for 2,938 yards in his three seasons, finishing second in the Pac-12 in rushing in 2020.

10. Colorado (4-2)

Colorado remains one the bigger enigmas in the Power Five after a surprisingly successful 2020 season under coach Karl Dorrell. Was that a lightning-in-a-bottle season or a sign of things to come? One thing that changes is the quality of the schedule, which pits the Buffaloes against Texas A&M and Minnesota in September and includes road games against Arizona State, Oregon, UCLA and Utah.

11. Washington State (1-3)

The Cougars will benefit from a complete offseason under second-year coach Nick Rolovich, which should speed up the learning curve for his offensive scheme. The Cougars have one of the most interesting transfers in the Power Five in former Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano, who has always had the talent to play at a high level and may blossom under a new staff and in a new system.

12. Arizona (0-5)

New coach Jedd Fisch has restored some energy to the program and started the process of rebuilding a roster lagging behind the rest of the conference. In time, the Wildcats' recruiting push could bring them back into the mix for bowl bids coming out of the South division. In the meantime, four wins in 2021 would be a terrific accomplishment.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Naomi Osaka says she will donate her winnings from the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati to help the victims of the Haiti earthquake that struck on Saturday.

The 7.2 magnitude earthquake has killed more than 700 people and injured nearly 2,000.

"Really hurts to see all the devastation that’s going on in Haiti, and I feel like we really can’t catch a break," Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, said on social media. "I’m about to play a tournament this week and I’ll give all the prize money to relief efforts for Haiti. I know our ancestors blood is strong we’ll keep rising."

Osaka, who is of Haitian and Japanese descent, is ranked number two in the world and last played in the Tokyo Olympics, where she lost in the third round to Marketa Vondrousova.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PHILADELPHIA – Nick Castellanos had a short afternoon in the Cincinnati Reds' series finale Sunday against the Philadelphia Phillies.

Castellanos disagreed with two called strikes on the outside corner during the first inning. After the called third strike, he turned toward home-plate umpire Sean Barber to say a few words. Five seconds into their chat, Barber ejected Castellanos.

Reds manager David Bell ran out of the dugout when Castellanos turned to Barber, but he didn't reach him in time to prevent an ejection.

After the ejection, Bell stood in front of Castellanos and argued with Barber as Castellanos turned to head back to the dugout.

Bell argued with Barber and crew chief Alan Porter for more than 30 seconds before he was ejected by Porter.

It was Castellanos' second ejection of his career. Castellanos was ejected during the second game of the season when he shouted and flexed over St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Jake Woodford after scoring on a wild pitch. Castellanos later received a two-game suspension and a $10,000 fine because the benches cleared.

Bell has been ejected 15 times in his three-year managerial career with the Reds, including four times this season.

The Reds went on to win the game, 7-4, taking two of three games from a playoff hopeful.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tennis legend Roger Federer announced Sunday that he will have knee surgery and be out of the game for "many months."

The surgery, his third in the last two years, will keep him out of the U.S. Open.

"I want to give myself a glimmer of hope to return to the tour in some shape or form," Federer, who turned 40 last week, said in an Instagram video. "I am realistic, don't get me wrong. I know how difficult it is at this age right now to do another surgery."

The Swiss superstar had his first knee surgery in February 2020 and then had a second to repair complications from the first. He returned to tennis with the Qatar Open in March, where he was eliminated in the quarterfinals. He had the same result at Wimbledon last month and he skipped the Tokyo Olympics.

Federer is one of the oldest players ranked in the top 100 on the ATP Tour. His longtime rivals, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, are 35 and 34 respectively.

He is tied with Nadal and Djokovic for the most men's individual Grand Slam titles with 20. He is one of only eight men ever to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in his career. He owns countless other records, including the longest streak ranked No. 1 by the ATP at 237 consecutive weeks.

"It's going to be difficult, of course, in some ways, but I know it's the right thing to do because I want to be healthy," Federer said of his surgery. "I want to be running around later as well."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PHOENIX — The struggling San Diego Padres tried to convince everyone that Fernando Tatis Jr. wasn’t coming off the injured list, and learning a new position on the fly, just to save their season.

Well, after watching Tatis’ breathtaking debut as their new right fielder Sunday, the Padres realize there’s no lingering reason for them to bother with diplomacy.

The 22-year-old marvel is here to save their season.

Tatis, who separated his left shoulder two weeks ago and missed 15 games, promptly went out and hit two homers, a double, single, four RBI, scored three runs, while tying his career-high with four hits.

“Fernando being Fernando,’’ Padres first baseman Eric Hosmer said, “he never ceases to amaze any of us. Coming off the IL, not missing a beat, and just doing what he does.’’

And, oh, yes, in the process, the Padres snapped their four-game losing streak with an 8-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field.

It’s too dramatic to say the game might save the Padres’ season, but considering their struggles, and a players-only meeting after being no-hit Saturday night, this certainly felt like more than a simple victory against the worst team in the major leagues.

“I just felt like as a team, after losing those games,’’ Tatis said, “having this game for us was pretty big.’’

Really, it was a huge momentum-changer simply having Tatis back in the lineup, with Padres manager Jayce Tingler saying they were “as upset, frustrated and embarrassed’’ as they’ve been after being no-hit.

Tatis singlehandedly made them forget all of their troubles.

“Most definitely,’’ Tingler said, “it’s great having him back. Obviously, he played very well today. More important, it’s nice having him back in the field, in the dugout, in the clubhouse, and just the personality guys gravitate to.’’

And no one was more thrilled than Tatis, who has impatiently watched the Padres struggle night after night. They scored just five runs and hit .181 with a .224 on-base percentage and .283 slugging percentage during their skid.

“It was not fun, not fun at all,’’ Tatis said, “seeing them struggle like that, and not being part of the team at that moment. It felt pretty bad not being able to be out there with them. It was pretty hard for me.

“It’s one of those things you really hate, especially a guy like me because I have so much energy, and the passion I have for this game.

So what does he do as the leadoff hitter while playing right field for the first time in his career?

First inning: Hits a double on a 94-mph fastball.

Third inning: Hits a solo homer, traveling 416 feet, on an 88-mph slider.

Fifth inning: Hits a solo homer, 382 feet, on an 86-mph changeup.

Eighth inning: Hits a two-run single on an 93-mph sinker.

And, oh yeah, he played the outfield flawlessly.

Certainly, there’s something about that first game coming off the injured list that Tatis relishes.

He homered in his first game returning from the injured list on April 16 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He homered May 19 in his first game back against the Colorado Rockies. And then for an encore he goes deep twice Sunday.

“Make them remember why they miss you,’’ Tatis said. “The hunger on being outside and not doing anything for my team so long, I felt pretty bad.’’

NIGHTENGALE'S NOTEBOOK:Eric Hosmer, Luke Voit suddenly feeling unwanted with uncertain futures

OPINION:Field of Dreams game was more than unbelievable. It was perfect.

Oh, he brought back memories all right, with the Padres’ offense exploding for 11 hits with three homers and three doubles, with Tatis reminding everyone why he’s the favorite to win the National League MVP award.

Tatis leads the NL with 33 homers, 23 stolen bases and a 1.054 OPS [on-base-plus-slugging percentage], despite playing in just 88 games this season after three stints on the injured list.

Still, he has hit more homers than any player in history at the age of 22 or younger, eclipsing Joe DiMaggio’s 32 homers in 1937.

And he could become the first player to lead the league in homers and stolen base since 1932, when Chuck Klein of the Philadelphia Phillies hit 38 homers and stole 20 bases. The only other players to accomplish the feat in baseball history were Jimmy Sheckard for the 1903 Brooklyn Superbas and Hall of Famer Ty Cobb for the 1909 Detroit Tigers.

Can you imagine if Tatis was healthy all season?

Tatis says he’ll do everything in his power to stay healthy the remainder of the season, trying to make sure he doesn’t take unnecessary risks on the field, particularly playing a new position.

“I feel like I can stay in control,’’ Tatis says, “especially knowing the situation and knowing my problems this year. I’ll probably be more smarter.’’

The Padres are hoping they can limit his risk of separating his shoulder again by playing him primarily in right field, while also playing in center field and shortstop. Tatis might still need shoulder surgery in the off-season, but for now, he’s all in on their plan.

“I felt pretty comfortable when they brought that to me,’’ Tatis said. “Knowing the situation, knowing the players we have, I feel it was a great move for the team and for myself to be careful, not doing all those plays I usually do in the field.’’

The Padres know they need a healthy Tatis if they’re going to make the playoffs and have a chance for a deep run in October.

He certainly reminded them again Sunday in his triumphant return.
