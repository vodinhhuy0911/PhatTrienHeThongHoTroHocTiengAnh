@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Most of us come into the world viewing our parents as healthy, strong and everlasting. As we grow, and as they age, the naive feeling that they are a perpetual part of our lives fades. Their hearing weakens, their gait slows, their memories dim, and for adult children the experience can provoke feelings of anger, anxiety, fear and frustration.

"Many people struggle as they witness age-related decline in their parents’ functioning," said Laura Carstensen, a psychology professor at Stanford University and the director of its Center on Longevity. "Cultural scripts that greatly value agency and autonomy equate vulnerability with failure. Pushing that message to its extreme, we all fail at some point."

It's a stressful transition, experts say, when adult children begin to see their parents less as capable caregivers and more as those needing care themselves. Children begin to wonder how quickly a decline will accelerate, how financially sound their parents are, what their future living situation will be. The shifting roles between child and parent can challenge family dynamics, made more complicated by negative stereotypes about aging, which contribute to the feeling that growing older is something people must resist or deny.

"It's a strange shift from when they were responsible for you. Now you might be responsible for them, and they're not listening to your orders the way an 8-year-old would," said Alan Castel, principal investigator at UCLA's Memory & Lifespan Cognition Lab and author of "Better with Age: The Psychology of Successful Aging."

A desire to deny the decline

There is a subtle grief children experience as their aging parents begin to lose functioning. Children may want to deny their parents' decline, which experts say can be amplified by a culture that suggests aging should be fought or hidden.

Tips:The part of aging that people don't talk about – and five ways to deal with it

Hair dye and wrinkle cream are embraced while hearing aids and walkers are shunned.

Negative stereotypes about aging can complicate the dynamic between adult children who see their parents in need of help and the parents who are apt to reject anything that identifies them as older or more vulnerable.

"When you think of an older adult, you think of maybe wise or kind, but explicitly and implicitly we also see older people as smelly, slow, bad drivers, stubborn or crotchety," Castel said.

Challenges of the 'sandwich generation'

The natural and normal stresses of grappling with an aging parent are made all the more difficult by competing caregiving demands.

Nearly half of adults in their 40s and 50s have a parent 65 or older and are either raising a young child or financially supporting a child 18 or older, according to the Pew Research Center. About 1 in 7 is financially supporting both an aging parent and a child.

Among all adults with at least one parent age 65 or older, 30% say their parents need some help caring for themselves. The same figure holds true for emotional support.

These adults are part of what experts call the "sandwich generation," those who are simultaneously caring for their own children as well as for aging parents. The relentless financial and emotional stress of both can take a toll and lead to what Castel calls "caregiver stress," especially when the aging parent doesn't want the care.

That feeling you can't name?:It's called emotional exhaustion.

"There's so much frustration in wanting to respect a parent, but also help," he said.

Communicate, pick battles and seek support

When a parent's health is deteriorating, good communication can make the transition easier.

"It's thinking about how to communicate things effectively without being condescending," Castel said. "Sometimes it's saying, 'I love you and I'm doing this because it can make your life better in some ways. I know it doesn't feel comfortable.'"

Castel suggests asking older parents questions such as, "Do you like it when I do this?" or "Do you know why I'm doing this?"

An older parent may say, "I hate it when you keep telling me to wear a hearing aid." But the child can reply with, "Well, I feel like I have to repeat things or you sometimes miss things. I'm happy to repeat things if it's important, but it causes me some frustration."

Children need to pick their battles. If a parent's hearing is decreasing, but they can still participate in a conversation, maybe don't push the hearing aid. If memory is declining, but no one is getting lost coming home, continuing to observe may be a good strategy.

Children can be clear with their parents that they may not be able to do as many things as they used to do, while also assuring their parents they will do their best to help them participate in activities most meaningful to them.

Children can also help navigate the transition by seeking out support, whether from siblings or from caregiver support groups.

'Accepting aging and mortality can be liberating'

Aging is normal, even if our culture suggests otherwise. Experts say it's important for people to accept the process, and to acknowledge there are things that get better with age. Older people may be more emotionally intelligent, more judicious, and more deliberate in ways that serve them well.

"The reality is that virtually all people will encounter physical problems as they age," Carstensen said. "The issue is less about avoiding the inevitable and more about living satisfying lives with limitations. Accepting aging and mortality can be liberating."

Acceptance can be the goal, though watching a parent age can be challenging not only because of what's happening to the parent but also because of what the child knows will happen to them, too.

"It scares us," Castel said. "We think, 'That could be me one day. And in fact, if everything goes well, that will be me one day.' One thing to say to yourself is, 'How do I want my child to treat me?'"

A post to the "Savage" singer's Instagram Thursday read, "Due to the demands of the Hot Girl lifestyle (Meg) has now entered a period of regeneration to prepare for what's next... In her absence; (management) will manage all social postings on behalf of Thee Hot Girl coach."

And she isn't the only star who has taken time to unplug.

Chrissy Teigen recently took a break from Twitter because the criticism on the platform took a toll on her mental health.

"It's time for me to say goodbye. This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something," Teigen, 35, wrote in a series of tweets at the time before deactivating her account.

She returned to the platform April 16.

'It's a brutal place' for women:Chrissy Teigen explains her Twitter hiatus

Some stars have taken it a step further. On Jan. 26, Pamela Anderson shared her "last post on Instagram, Twitter (and) Facebook." On Feb. 2, Elon Musk announced to his 48.3 million followers that he was going "off Twitter for a while." On Feb. 27, "Bachelorette" star Rachel Lindsay disabled her Instagram account. And on March 4, Alec Baldwin deactivated his Twitter account because it "wasn't worth" the "harshness."

Experts say we could all try taking a page out of their playbook.

While social media has its benefits – such as building networks and maintaining contact with others – too much time on these platforms is linked to depression, anxiety and stress, explains Dr. Shahla Modir, chief medical officer at All Points North Lodge, an addiction treatment center.

Modir says some people can develop an unhealthy relationship with social media platforms and start to internalize "likes" by creating a connection between online responses and their self-esteem.

In Anderson's post, she described the liberating experience of stepping away from her screen.

"I am free," she wrote. "Lets hope you find the strength and inspiration to follow your purpose and try not to be seduced by wasted time."

Digital wellness expert Mark Ostach says he encourages people to "think about the micro-levels of digital trauma that exist when you quickly check your social media in between a conversation or right before you go to bed," including digesting things like politically polarizing headlines or traumatic posts about a friend's health. "It happens in a moment’s notice, and I believe it’s causing some low levels of trauma to what we think and how we feel.”

So how do you know if it's time for you to deactivate Instagram, Twitter or Facebook? We asked experts to weigh in on what signs to look for and how to form healthier habits with social media.

Signs it's time to take a social media break

If you're comparing yourself to others online

"FOMO (the fear of missing out) can trigger feelings of anxiety," Modir explains. "The highlights people present are interpreted as their real life not their 'reel life.' If users are spending too much time online on social media sites, it can be difficult to keep perspective on what real life is."

If you're compulsively checking your phone

Modir says a warning sign is checking your "notifications and messages every hour in a way that affects your engagements, occupation or social relationships."

"'Likes' can be very addictive, causing a dopamine hit to the brain of feel-good chemicals that reinforce like-seeking behavior and compulsive checking," she says.

If your real-life interactions are suffering

Modir says this could come in the form of "decreased social interaction with friends and family in favor of social media engagement" or people in your life have "complained about your social media usage interfering with social interaction."

Ostach says another indicator is if your interactions start to rely on social media, including finding yourself “recycling news headlines in your conversations.”

“That often sounds like, ‘Today on Facebook I read,’ or ‘Today on Instagram I saw.’” he explains. “It’s almost endangering our ability to think for ourselves and just develop our own casual, organic conversations.”

If you wake up (or go to sleep) feeling off

Another sign is “when you wake up worried about what you saw on social media the night before,” according to Ostach. This is often linked to late-night “doom scrolling," which he describes as a “horrible habit that often leads to night terrors or an unrestful night’s sleep.”

Modir adds that late night social media engagement that disrupts your sleeping schedule is also a sign it may be time to set some boundaries with your device.

If you start viewing yourself negatively

Jermaine Graves, a licensed clinical professional counselor based in Washington, D.C., says it's time to take a break when social media causes someone to "view themselves in a negative light, causing feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness or depression."

If you feel increasingly anxious, depressed or lonely using social media

"Social media can trigger competitive feelings, which cause anxiety in the user, leaving them to feel like they need to keep up to meet the social expectations of the people they follow, which may be unrealistic and based in fantasy," Modir says.

Benefits of unplugging from social media

"Unplugging allows people to be more mindful and present in their actual lives leaving opportunity for new hobbies and self care," Modir says. "Disconnecting can also improve sleep and productivity since you’d be reducing distraction and exposure to blue light."

Ostach says he views social media consumption similar to food consumption, encouraging people to be mindful of the "digital calories" that they’re consuming throughout the day.

“You wouldn’t eat three donuts, a cheeseburger and drink a Coca-Cola before bed, so why are you scrolling in bed, consuming sometimes empty digital calories?” he said, adding that there are "healthy digital calories," including sending someone an encouraging message or leaving a comment that demonstrates support and compassion.

Ways to find healthy balance with social media

Be mindful of your consumption

Ostach says a good first step is to “take an inventory of the habits and rhythms of your day” and try to find "strike that balance of our physical realities and our virtual realities.”

If you've been stuck on a screen all day, Ostach advises you "make sure you include a walk outside or some exercise."

Choose a time

"A way to create boundaries can be as simple as only checking in on social media for a particular amount of time at a specific time of day (and) using the built in social media apps to monitor time spent," she says.

Graves suggests limiting your time on social media to 2 hours a day.

Say no to notifications

"Turning the notifications off so they don’t pop up and distract the user throughout the day can be helpful," Modir says.

Take a digital fast

Ostach suggests stepping away from your screens for at least 1 hour a day.

If you're looking to set a bigger boundary for yourself, Modir suggests removing "all the social media apps from one’s smartphone and keep them restricted to an outside source like an iPad that limits the access to specific times."

No sleep-time screens

“End your digital day one hour before bed,” Ostach says. Modir suggests turning your phone off two hours before bed and leaving it off all night.

Get outside

Ostach says movement is a core attribute to leading a healthy life, which isn't achieved through social media usage. “I’ve heard ‘scrolling is the new smoking’ or ‘sitting is the new smoking.’ Those are just clever ways to say, boy, we spend a lot of time sitting and scrolling. How do we go back to what our bodies need?” he says.

Make eye contact

Ostach advises to truly connect with others in conversation, “which is indicative that you’re fully present with whoever you’re with," as opposed to half-listening while scrolling through your feed.

Have a break plan in mind

Ostach says our break from social media will "quickly relapse and we’ll find ourselves back into the scrolling" if we don't have a plan in place.

He suggests replacing it with something meaningful, including a hobby, quality time with family or working out.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@We think of awe as an emotion reserved for the most extraordinary moments – summiting a mountain, the birth of a child, an exquisite live performance. But researchers who study awe say the emotion shouldn't be associated only with rare events. Daily experiences of awe, they argue, should be a regular part of the way we engage with the world.

"Big moments that people have in their lives are going to produce awe, but what a lot of recent research is showing is that even those more everyday experiences of awe – just briefly noticing the beauty of nature in our neighborhood or in our backyard – those can have a positive effect on our well-being," said Craig Anderson, a researcher at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied awe in nature.

We feel awe when we encounter something with qualities so extraordinary it seems incomprehensible. Jennifer Stellar, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto whose research focuses on how individuals and social groups thrive, said we can think about the things that produce awe as being both perceptually vast – very large, for example, or very powerful – and demanding a need for accommodation – meaning it doesn't assimilate or fit neatly into an existing category in our mind.

But we don't need the Taj Mahal to stimulate that feeling. An incredible piece of art or even a breathtaking YouTube video can also do the trick.

Researchers say awe has a range of emotional, social and physiological health benefits. Awe is shown to make us happier and contribute to greater life satisfaction, to make us care more about other people and to increase our humility.

Research has shown awe can make us think more critically, expand our perception of time and lead to less materialism. Anderson has done work showing awe can help at-risk populations, including young people from underserved communities and military veterans, cope with PTSD symptoms and stress.

Stop, pause, be present

Awe is defined by novelty and vastness, which makes children among the most likely to feel it. When adults say they love vicariously experiencing the world through their children's eyes, what they're really encountering is their children's sense of awe.

"A great little video if you haven't seen it is babies going through tunnels," Anderson said. "They're in their car seats, and when the car hits that tunnel their whole environment changes. And those expressions that they're making for the most part, those are awe expressions of, 'Wow, something crazy has just happened that has never happened to me before.'"

Adults can have daily experiences of awe, too, but it requires the right mindset. People need to slow down, to pause, to be present and observe the world around them. It can be difficult to experience awe when there are so many things competing for our attention. Stress and excessive rumination can make it more difficult to find things to marvel at.

"When we're at the Grand Canyon, it's impressive enough that it grabs our attention regardless of what else we're doing, but in our day-to-day lives, when so much of our attention is taken up by mobile devices, that does make it harder for us to notice these little awe-inspiring things in our environment," Anderson said.

Nature, art and music can all produce daily awe experiences

Stellar said often the more quotidian ways to experience awe exist in the realm of beauty. It's why nature is such an elixir.

"It might not be that way for everybody, but on occasion, not every day but also not rarely, I will stop in my tracks and appreciate a really beautiful sunset, when the clouds are in the right place and the colors are magnificent. It's not incomprehensible in a way that doesn't make any sense to you, but it is something that is extraordinary and outside of what I normally encounter, and it is a bit of a challenge to my thinking and part of why I think I stop and I stare at it and I take it in."

Stellar said awe can also be found in a stunning piece of visual art or in a new song you can't stop listening to. We can find experiences of awe in one another – in a child's first steps, in a stranger's unexpected kindness, in the camaraderie of a social movement's like-minded others.

Experts say cultivating positive emotions is as important as learning to cope with negative ones. While some positive emotions get a lot of attention – most people understand they need joy in their lives, and that gratitude has numerous benefits – awe is often thought of as a bonus, rather than something important for well-being.

"People feel like it's a luxury, because the kinds of activities that are associated with it – going for a walk in nature, going to a concert, going to a museum, traveling – they're the things that we cut first because we don't have money or we don't have time," Stellar said. "But ... if it has all these benefits, why not take 15 minutes at sunset? To go out on your ledge, your office rooftop, for a walk around your local park, to try and get a glimpse of that."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@You know the image from TV and movies – the delinquent, defiant student slumped over his desk, fast asleep in class. But some teachers today are making waves on social media for letting their students snooze in class, arguing sleeping isn't always the mark of a lazy, disrespectful student, and instead it could be an indicator of more serious mental health issues at play.

TikTok user @bcholeman garnered 7.4 million likes for a video he posted about cutting students some slack when it comes to sleep.

"Sometimes the nicest thing a teacher can do for a student is let them come in, lay their head down and go to sleep," he says. "Life can hit hard, and we all need some grace."

User @ms.old says she also lets her students sleep in class sometimes. She believes if a student takes a nap in the morning, they tend to be "more refreshed for the rest of the day ... less likely to have an attitude problem (and) more likely to be motivated to do the next activity."

Experts agree sleeping in class doesn't always stem from laziness, and instead could be a sign something more serious is going on.

"We think about children as happy human beings that are just completing their homework at school and living a happy life, but sometimes we can see that depression can be actually diagnosed or seen in children as small as 5, 6 years old," says Cynthia Catchings, a licensed clinical social worker and therapist at Talkspace.

Dr. Nicholas Kardaras, psychologist and CEO of Omega Recovery treatment center, says sleep issues are "a red flag for depression."

"People who suffer from clinical depression will have a sleep disorder (or) sleep dysregulation, so either sleeping too much or too little," he explains.

Other factors that impact sleep

Children age 6 to 12 should sleep nine to 12 hours in a 24-hour period, and teenagers should sleep eight to 10 hours, according to The American Academy of Sleep Medicine. But many don't get that much sleep.

A 2015 analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 58% of middle school students didn't get enough sleep and neither did 73% of high schoolers.

Why? Catchings says stress and anxiety may play a role since both can affect sleep.

"Just thinking about 'I didn't complete the homework,' 'I'm afraid to ask this question' and (students) cannot sleep (or are) waking up in the middle of the night worried about it," she says.

Catchings says she also encounters adjustment disorders in teens.

"Is the child going back to school after being at home? Is it that they moved? Divorce or arguments at home? That can ... create the adjustment disorders that we diagnose sometimes," she says.

On TikTok, @ms.old says she's learned from a few of her students "the only reason they're sleeping (in class) is because it's the only opportunity that they have to sleep."

"I've even had some students share with me that it's the only place they feel safe enough to sleep."

Catchings says adults should be mindful about the bigger picture when they are questioning a student's tendency to sleep in class.

"Maybe there's some domestic violence; maybe there is alcoholism or other issues at home, so that means that maybe the child is not going to be sleeping properly."

The pandemic's impact on mental health, sleep

"Kids are living in an uncertain world right now so that in itself is depressive," psychologist Kardaras says, adding that fear and anxiety surrounding the coronavirus have also caused an increase in depression rates.

On top of that, an uptick in screen time due to Zoom classes and an overall shift in typical home structures can mean even more upheaval.

"Kids were already adversely impacted by too much screen time pre-COVID," Kardaras says. "(As) Zoom learning became the preferred delivery system of education, you essentially doubled young people's screen time."

Kardaras says studies have shown an increase in screen time puts you at higher risk for depression.

"There's this sort of misconception that you can actually form meaningful connections through screens, Facebook and social media, and the research shows the opposite," he says. "Screen time essentially devastates physical activity and devastates interpersonal interaction, and those are the two main drivers of depression."

Screen time can also make kids more tired.

"The circadian sleep cycle gets really affected by the blue light of screens," he explains. "So (students are) staying up later because their sleep cycles are dysregulated."

What can teachers, parents do?

Catchings, the social worker and therapist, says the teachers who let their students sleep in class may have the right idea.

"What we see from teachers recently in allowing them to sleep (during) classes is 'Let me see what the concern is. I can let them sleep. I can always communicate with them or try to investigate what is going on and then help the child,'" she says.

She says the next important step is to involve a parent, counselor or both.

Teachers should lean on their schools resources, especially if a student's sleep issues are beginning to impact learning. Kardaras suggests reaching out to the school's medical or mental health team, who may be able to provide assistance.

Parents who want to help their kids sleep better can step in to reduce their screen time. Kardaras suggests parents aim to enforce a rule of no screen time – including television – three to four hours before bed.

And lastly, he encourages parents to talk to their kids, especially as some start to transition back to in-person classes this fall.

"Encourage your kids to talk about ... what they're feeling, what their apprehensions are, what their fears are," he says. Be sure you're "not just ignoring the issue and putting their backpack on... and sending them off to school without at least having the opportunity to dialogue about that."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Viral trends pop up on social media almost every day, but a new one has raised some red flags among health experts — the #frozenhoney challenge.

TikTokers have swarmed their feeds with videos of putting honey in an empty bottle, freezing it and then pushing the liquid-turned-jelly out of the bottle and taking a bite.

The #frozenhoney hashtag has been viewed over 855 million times on TikTok, and some users have added corn syrup, food coloring and even candy to make it more "satisfying."

But Dana Hunnes, a professor at the University of California's Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, said one of the biggest concerns is the concentrated sugar and carbohydrates found in honey.

"Depending on how much you're taking in at one time, it could make you sick because it would pull so much water into the digestive tract that you could have diarrhea," Hunnes told USA TODAY.

She said people already consume too much sugar and carbohydrates in their diet and does not recommend users following a trend that requires a lot of insulin being pumped out at one time, taxing the pancreas.

Trends on social media have caused some users to injure themselves in the past, and at other times have resulted in death.

In April, a 12-year-old boy from Oklahoma died after reports said he participated in a “blackout challenge,” a trend at the time where TikTok users choked themselves until they lost consciousness.

The level of peer presence on social media and how it affects adolescents has come into question as more trends continue to circulate online.

"These kids are being influenced at a level that's beyond their conscious awareness," Mitchell Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association said.

Over the years, Hunnes has seen trends on social media involving foods that were detrimental to their health like the cinnamon challenge, where people snorted or inhaled the spice that could have damaged their lungs and throat.

She doesn't recommend following up on food trends or participating in any eating contests, hot dogs included.

"We have so many reasons to never overconsume anything," Hunnes said.

One might consider golf a silly sport. In simple terms, golfers get up early to hit tiny balls with big-headed sticks, then chase them long distances only to hit them again. They don’t develop speed, strength or agility. Mostly, they just walk and talk.

When you put it that way, golf sounds absurd. And yet, the National Golf Foundation estimates that nearly 40 million Americans played it in 2020. The reason: Golf is a brilliant game, argues Shawn Young, a former high school science teacher in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

Young offers three reasons why. First, there’s an objective; golfers count their strokes and try to improve their score over time. Second, there’s strategy; in order to reach their target, golfers have to choose which clubs to use and in which direction to aim. Finally, there’s socialization; golfers follow a dress code and congregate in clubhouses in search of community.

“Taking a ball and putting it in a hole is a pretty meaningless activity, but there’s all this other stuff around it — rules and structures that turn it into something people actually want to get up early on a Sunday to do,” explains Young, who says school should be a lot more like golf. “Educators are designing experiences that are meaningless to kids. They’ve designed school to control students when they need to design it to motivate them.”

To do exactly that, in 2013, Young co-founded Classcraft, a technology platform that helps teachers “gamify” their classrooms. Instead of extrinsic motivators that coerce students into positive learning behaviors — for example, grades — Classcraft nurtures intrinsic motivators like those inherent in video games. “Self-determination theory is the branch of psychology that looks at why we’re intrinsically motivated to do things,” Young says. “It’s been around since the 1970s, and game makers have become masters at it.”

Now is the perfect time for educators to also master self-determination theory, argues Barry Fishman, a professor of information and education at the University of Michigan, where he has built his own gamified-learning platform, called GradeCraft.

The COVID-19 pandemic, he points out, has ushered in a new era of online learning that will likely endure in some fashion for decades to come. But online learning is a “terrible game,” Fishman says.

“The reason it’s a terrible game is that it tries to replicate the basic elements of school but fails to recognize the added elements of difficulty,” explains Fishman, who specifies things like social isolation, ambient distractions, screen fatigue and poor connectivity. “Given the rapid shift to remote learning during the pandemic, it’s understandable that teachers tried to take what they were doing face to face and translate it to online. But moving forward, we have an opportunity to do things a little bit differently.”

Online and offline, education has come to a crossroads. If you ask Fishman and Young, the time has therefore come to game the system — literally.

What is Gamification?

Although games are a favorite tool in many classrooms, “gamification” is not about games. “Gamification is applying gamelike principles to nongame situations,” explains Stein Brunvand, associate dean and professor of educational technology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. “For example, think about the rewards programs at your favorite retailers and restaurants. Their main goal is getting you to spend money, and they get you to spend money by giving you points that you can accumulate to get free stuff. It becomes a game without you even realizing it.”

Whether it’s a loyalty program at a restaurant or a math class at school, gamification at its best borrows the following principles from games in order to fuel intrinsic motivation:

Choice: Although most games have only one objective, there typically are many ways to achieve it. For example, different weapons, tactics or strategies to employ, or different challenges to pursue. What makes it fun is having the autonomy to choose how you reach the finish line. “A big part of gamification is providing choice,” Brunvand says. “Instead of giving 10 assignments that everyone must do, you can give a range of different assignments and allow students to pick and choose which ones they want to complete.”

Autonomy gives students the flexibility to select assignments that complement their learning style. “There are different ways to demonstrate mastery of knowledge,” Brunvand continues. “Some students might be inclined to do more writing-based assignments, while others may want to do something more hands-on, like creating a video animation or building a 3D model out of Legos.”

Competence: Games aren’t fun if they’re too difficult, if you don’t progress through them quickly enough or if you never win, notes Young, who says gamers and students alike are motivated by a sense of achievement — a feeling of competence.

“We’re motivated by our own progress,” he explains, adding that schools hinder progress by emphasizing grades over learning. “If I’m a C+ student, I usually get C+ grades. I’m still learning, but I never see my progress.”

In gamified classrooms, progress can be measured in points or other “additive” forms of recognition. “In traditional school, you start with 100 percent and try to maintain that,” explains Fishman, who says scoring anything less than 100 percent on assignments and exams subtracts from your total, which is punitive. “In a gameful system, you start at zero and earn points for everything you do. It focuses on what you’ve accomplished instead of where you’ve fallen short, which gives students a sense of progression.”

Community: Gamers like playing games not just because they’re fun, but also because they’re social, points out Matthew Farber, assistant professor of technology, innovation and pedagogy at the University of Northern Colorado.

“Kids want to feel like they belong,” Farber says. “If you watch TV shows like WandaVision or Bridgerton, they have huge online communities. When you’re done watching them, you can go online and read about all the Easter eggs, then share memes with your friends. That’s belongingness, and games do that really well.”

In gamified classrooms, then, learning often is a team sport. “School by design is very competitive, but we want to make it a more inclusive and collaborative experience,” Young says.

Turning Lessons into Quests

Michele Haiken, an English teacher at Rye Middle School in Rye, N.Y., has been using Classcraft to gamify her classroom since 2015.

“My entire school year is gamified. I have a storyline that drives my curriculum, and each unit the students engage in is a quest with different missions that they have to complete in order to practice their critical reading and writing skills,” explains Haiken, author of Gamify Literacy: Boost Comprehension, Collaboration and Learning.

Haiken awards points to students when they complete assignments and other activities, which they can subsequently cash in for prizes or special classroom privileges. “The more points my students earn, the stronger they become as readers and writers because of all the practice they’re getting.”

Like they would in a multiplayer video game, students work in teams, have characters and can “level up” as their learning progresses. When they master a concept, standard or skill, they can advance to new missions and earn badges that represent their progress.

“What I love about gamification in the classroom is that it creates a growth mindset,” Haiken says. “When they’re playing a video game, and their character doesn’t make it to the next level, kids don’t quit and say, ‘I’m done with it.’ They go back and try to figure out what they can do differently to get to the next level.”

Better Experiences, Better Outcomes

The benefits of gamification might be even more apparent in virtual classrooms than in physical ones.

“The problem with Zoom and many other tools we use for remote learning is that they mimic lecture-based classrooms, and lecture-based classrooms are not the best form of teaching because they make the teacher the focus instead of the student,” Farber says. “Gamification is learner-driven learning.”

What’s more, gamified classrooms can be customized to promote different learning behaviors, which can help students adapt to new learning environments like virtual school.

For example, teachers can award points to students not only for completing assignments, but also for showing up on time for video lessons, participating in online forums and discussions and communicating effectively through digital means.

“Kids don’t know how to be good distance learners, so we need to teach them what that looks like,” explains Young, who says scholars studying Classcraft have linked gamification to increases in student participation, improvements in grade point average and declines in behavioral problems.

“Whether it’s online or offline,” Young concludes, “the experience of school is core to student outcomes. If we can design that experience to be empowering and meaningful for kids, it will motivate them to do the things they need to do to be good learners. And that will lead to better academic outcomes.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@President Biden on Friday delivered remarks on a potential infrastructure deal, the coronavirus pandemic and the July jobs report.

But it was his tan suit that stole the show on social media.

The president’s fashion choice reminded many of the suit that former President Obama wore in 2014 during a press conference addressing the threat of the Islamic State and more. The suit caused an uproar in Washington, D.C., garnering a mixture of analysis, outrage and jokes on social media.

In 2019, 5 years after Obama wore the suit, the Daily Show mocked the backlash to it in a video about "The Worst Scandal in Presidential History." The video, viewed over 1 million times, included clips of Fox's Lou Dobbs asking "is this an effort to make him look warmer?" and other critical coverage.

Analytics at the time showed that there were more than 4,000 tweets shared about Obama’s wardrobe during his remarks. The following day, then-White House press secretary Josh Earnest assured reporters that "The president stands squarely behind the decision he made yesterday to wear his summer suit."

Reporters, social media users and others were quick to comment on Biden’s khaki-colored suit on Friday, drawing comparisons to Obama’s now-viral moment. Others noted that Biden donned the suit the week of Obama's 60th birthday.

And the White House tweeted a photo of Biden's "#ootd," which means "outfit of the day," while touting the July jobs report.

Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, shared that Biden discussed “subsTANtial job growth today” during his remarks.

Tara McKelvey, a BBC News correspondent, joked that, though the president was discussing issues important to Americans across the country, “it’s hard to focus, since I was so distracted by his TAN SUIT.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There's a lesser-known period product making its way into more menstruators' monthly routine: menstrual discs.

Similar to menstrual cups, which have also been gaining popularity, discs are an alternative to traditional products like pads and tampons. They're becoming more commonplace, in part thanks to people looking for a more eco-friendly solution to their periods. And there are a few key distinctions that set discs apart from the other period products on the market these days.

Dr. Jessica Shepherd, obstetrician-gynecologist and chief medical officer at Verywell Health, says discs are "absolutely" a healthy menstrual tool.

"Alternatives like cups and discs... are great ways for people to have options that are not necessarily in the pad or tampon range," she says.

How do menstrual discs works?

Unlike menstrual cups, which use suction to sit in the vaginal canal, discs use gravity to sit at the the base of the cervix, Shepherd explains.

"Discs are held by gravity because of where they're placed, they're tucked behind the pelvic bone," she says.

Most brands hold more than a tampon does, too. For example, Nixit discs hold 70mL of liquid, which is "more than 4 times what a super tampon holds," according to their website.

Discs can also be worn longer than a tampon, around 12 hours for most brands, where as the FDA recommends changing a tampon every 4 to 8 hours.

"I personally have found that it's amazing for getting in touch with your cycle and understanding your period," says Rachael Newton, who founded the menstrual disc company Nixit. "Before I used Nixit, I didn't ever really know when my heavy days were and when my light days were, it was always a bit of a guess... So I feel much more in tune with my body and my cycle."

Why people are turning to menstrual discs

While there are disposable disc brands like Softdisc and Flex Disc, re-usable disc brands are appealing to consumers looking for a more sustainable and budget-friendly option.

Newton says she started on her personal journey to menstrual discs when she was looking to reduce household plastic waste.

"It's great if you're trying to be a bit more eco-conscious," she says, explaining that tampon and pad users throw away thousands of products in a lifetime that end up in landfills.

And though a disc will cost you more than a box of tampons – Nixit, for example, retails for $42 – it'll last you much longer as it's "built to last for years" with medical grade silicone, making it an invest in a more affordable period in the long run.

More:Have we been thinking about 'sex drive' all wrong?

While Shepherd says she would never pit period products against each other since everyone has their own personal preference, she does see sustainability being a factor in why people choose discs and cups.

Another reason? Discs can be worn during sex.

"We've had lots of brides as well... (who have) been like, 'Thank you, Nixit, you saved my wedding' or 'You saved my honeymoon,'" Newton says.

While discs aren't necessary for sex during a period, Shepherd says they are a good option if it makes you more comfortable. However, she stresses one thing is important to remember: Discs do not protect against pregnancy or sexually-transmitted infections.

Q Voice News

On a recent Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles, Hot Donna’s Clubhouse turned part of Pan Pacific Park into a lesbian popup space.

About 500 people, most of them queer, lesbian, or gender non-conforming, attended the event in Los Angeles’ Fairfax District. They spent the warm summer day socializing, mingling, dancing, and playing various games including the wet T-shirt relay race, reports Q Voice News.

Lauren Richer, the 32-year-old founder of Hot Donna’s Clubhouse, hopes her plans for a brick-and-mortar version of the space will change the lesbian nightlife landscape in Los Angeles.

We “don’t have a safe space for lesbians who maybe don’t want to party, don’t want to drink, don’t want to be part of the club scene,” Richer, a West Hollywood resident, said during an interview at Pan Pacific Park. “It’s important to have a space where there are other people that miss having fun and meeting people that they love and meeting new friends.

“They don’t have that at the moment,” Richer said. “They need a space for it.”

If Richer is successful, Hot Donna’s Clubhouse would fill a void and meet a vital need in Los Angeles.

Spaces missing

The City of Angels, the second-largest city in the nation, is a desert for lesbian nightlife. The megaopolis doesn’t have any bars or clubs catering to queer women or lesbians, and hasn’t for several years.

In 2017, a Los Angeles County’s lesbian bar, the Oxwood Inn, shut it doors. The 45-year-old San Fernando Valley watering hole was well known in Los Angeles’ lesbian nightlife scene.

West Hollywod’s last lesbian bar, The Palms, closed in 2013.

According to the Lesbian Bar Project, only 21 lesbian bars exist in the U.S., with only two listed in California: Gossip Grill in San Diego and Wild Side West in San Francisco.

But, the recently re-opened bar Redz in Boyle Heights serves Latina lesbians and queer people.

Hot Donna’s Clubhouse

Richer wants to build an inclusive space that caters to queer women, trans woman, and gender non-conforming individuals. The Hot Donna’s Clubhouse team is hunting for a location in West Hollywood, Silverlake or Echo Park.

The popup at Pan Pacific Park also was a fundraiser, generating a little more than $30,000 through ticket sales, merchandise, and the after party at The Naughty Pig in West Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard.

Richer says they will need approximately $2 million to open a brick-and-mortar space, hire employees and purchase decor. While some investors have helped inch that number forward, the venture still needs a “big boost in funds,” she said. Hot Donna’s Clubhouse has activated a GoFundMe.

The size of the future space is yet to be determined, but Richer’s plan is to open a place later this year that serves two functions: room for events in the daytime (e.g. coffee pop-ups, queer art galleries and hair-cutting) and an evening space to dance, drink and let loose.

[It will be] “where all your queers are in the garage together, having a drink laughing about something that they get. And it’s a space where people can feel safe and accepted,” Richer said.

Queer Field Day

The buzz around Hot Donna’s Clubhouse picked up steam when Queer Field Day, a group that hosts unofficial LGBTQ+ meetups in Southern California, got involved.

Co-founder Lily Brown’s TikTok presence helped Queer Field Day draw large crowds and show the demand for LGBTQ+ events that aren’t men-focused.

Richer said partnering with the Queer Field Day team to promote and emcee the Pan Pacific Park meetup gave Hot Donna’s Clubhouse a boost.

Lesbian safe space

Back at the park, Katy Felkner, who moved to Los Angeles last summer for college and volunteered at the popup party, said Hot Donna’s Clubhouse would be a much needed safe space.

“As a femme presenting person, I don’t really feel very safe in straight bars, and I don’t necessarily feel or look like I belong in bars that cater to gay men,” she said. “So it would be really nice to have a bar where I feel like I’m the target clientele.”

Richer understands that pressure. Richer and Hot Donna’s Clubhouse supporters are charting a path that hasn’t always worked. Places like Cuties (a now-closed queer coffee shop in L.A.), have tried to create a similar space that’s not nightlife-focused. But it closed last August when the owners couldn’t see a way to pay their bills and continue to operate during the pandemic.

“It feels really overwhelming to be leading some kind of new movement, new space in L.A.,” Richer said, “especially since there isn’t anything in the entire Los Angeles County.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What's a three-letter word that prompts parents to pontificate and teens to plug their ears when their parents bring it up?

You guessed it: S-e-x.

Just because teens can be hesitant to talk with their parents about sex isn't a reason to give up on the conversation. Not talking about it could be dangerous or even deadly, and markedly so for LGBTQ youth.

Just 8.2% of students said they received LGBTQ-inclusive sex education, according to LGBTQ education nonprofit GLSEN's National School Climate Survey in 2019. It's not shocking when you uncover that it's only mandated in a minority of U.S. states.

Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, director of GLSEN, compares the fight for inclusive sexual education to that of critical race theory, noting people can favor long-held narratives over the truth.

"What we're having right now in our country is a debate around what responsibility we have to our children when it comes to educating them," Willingham-Jaggers says. "Queer, inclusive sex ed is not critical race theory. But what you see in both of these arguments is do we teach our children what is true in reality and history and nature? Or do we teach them what we want them to know?"

Sex education looks drastically different depending on where you live (though legislation is ongoing).

Thirty-nine states, plus Washington, D.C., require sex education and/or HIV education in schools, according to the Guttmacher Institute. But only 18 states mandate that sex and HIV education be medically accurate.

As for LGBTQ inclusivity: 11 states (and D.C.) call for "inclusive content with regard to sexual orientation."

But on the other side of the coin, five states allow negative information on homosexuality and/or a positive push for heterosexuality. If you live in a state like Florida or South Carolina, for example, your children may be taught sexual education that discourages queer sex.

What a lack of sex education means for LGBTQ youth

Dio Anthony, a 31-year-oldwriter in New York, remembers little about his high school sex education experience beyond a weeklong course on sex.

"They weren't teaching you how to apply a condom like they show you in the movies," he says.

When he first slept with a man at 16, he had no idea what was going on. Future sexual encounters were not fun. He grew uncomfortable sharing details of his sexual escapades in his 20s even though his friends hooted and hollered about theirs.

"When we exclude LGBTQ+ young people from comprehensive education, we make them more isolated, behave in more risky ways and they are further pushed out and pushed into dangerous situations where negative outcomes are more likely," Willingham-Jaggers says.

The Human Rights Campaign Foundation found that LGBTQ youth, particularly Black and Latino LGBTQ youth, rarely receive sex education at school that is relevant to them.

This pattern reveals itself through statistics: Of the 36,801 people diagnosed with HIV in 2019 in the U.S., 25,842 were Black or Latino, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's over 70%.

"It isn't an accident that HIV is still so prevalent where it's prevalent," says Justin A. Sitron, associate dean of the College of Health and Human Services at Widener University. "It's because the public health system has not responded to both the access needs, and the cultural realities that men of color especially face." Widener University's Interdisciplinary Sexuality Research Collaborative is behind the website swagtoolkit.com, aimed at providing sex education to Black gay and bisexual men.

Such websites prove crucial, considering how often people pepper their search engines with questions – particularly about taboo topics, Sitron says.

"Without LGBTQ+ inclusive sex education, queer and trans youth are left in the dark when it comes to making informed decisions about their health, understanding their body, understanding how their body relates to other bodies out in the world," Willingham-Jaggers says. "When sex education labels some topics as controversial, it hurts all students by failing to provide a full and medically accurate understanding of sexual health."

LGBTQ young people get stuck at questions like, "'So I know I'm supposed to wear a condom when I have anal sex. But, like, what is anal sex?' " Sitron says.

LGBTQ advocates change landscape of sex education

LGBTQ advocates are battling preconceived notions of sex education.

Scout Bratt, outreach and education director at Chicago Women's Health Center, directs a program of sexual health education for Chicago public schools and area universities; they work with fourth through 12th graders as well as college students. Yes, inclusivity begins as young as fourth grade: Instead of saying girls menstruate or boys produce sperm, for example, you can say people who menstruate and people who produce sperm to incorporate trans and nonbinary people.

"We are trying to infuse queer inclusivity and gender expansiveness in the curriculum across all grade levels across all subjects," Bratt says.

Sexual health educator Shafia Zaloom consults around the country with schools about sexuality, and notes that curriculums vary among different types of schools – i.e., public schools don't have the same standards as independent schools.

After receiving feedback from LGBTQ youth, Zaloom worked to create a program that went in-depth on LGBTQ issues led by queer staff.

"When we provide kids with really inclusive, comprehensive sex education, they grow up to have more bodily autonomy, more healthy perspectives on their sexuality, they tend to delay and make more responsible decisions and be far more relational and communicative in their relationships," Zaloom says.

Where to turn if your school isn't teaching LGBTQ-inclusive sex education

Get involved in advocacy work . "The states that have passed comprehensive LGBTQ inclusive sexual health education laws did not happen because one person raised their hand and said, 'We should have that.' It took time, it took advocacy, it took education," Vincent Pompei, director of the Human Rights Campaign's Youth Well-Being Program. says. "What we need to do is provide opportunities for communities and parents and educators to understand why it's essential."

Health educators, doctors and other sexual education resources and community centers abound. Talk to them, Sitron advises. Look online for resources – but verify them. Planned Parenthood, Advocates for Youth and SIECUS are all solid resources, according to Sitron. Don't underestimate YouTube channels either. "When you live in a highly stigmatized area and you have no support, online might be the only community that you might be able to find," says Carmen Mojica, a reproductive justice movement leader. "And I don't think that there should be any shame in that." See also GLSEN and HRC.

Spend some alone time with your doctor without your parents if you have any specific questions, Sitron says. Bratt adds that young people are leading this movement – so adults, make time to listen.

Above all, remember this: Sex should make you feel good – and feel good to talk about.

"It should be one of the things in our lives that makes us the most joyful," Sitron says. "And when queer people don't get to have that because their sex is problematized, we miss out on such an opportunity to be joyful and happy."

The fast-food chain's latest celebrity menu collaboration – its first with a female musician – will be available for a limited time at participating restaurants nationwide. It includes a Big Mac, four-piece Chicken McNuggets, medium fries, medium Sprite, Tangy BBQ Sauce and a renamed Sweet ‘N Sour sauce.

Since September 2020, McDonald's has launched similar limited-edition celebrity meals with Travis Scott, J Balvin and with South Korean pop band BTS, which have been popular.

"McDonald's and I run deep – from growing up back in Hayward, California, all through my college days – so I had to bring my icy gang in on my all-time favorites," Saweetie said in a statement last month when announcing the Aug. 9 launch. "Depending on the mood I'm in, there are so many ways to enjoy my order."

►Masks required:McDonald's requires masks again for customers and employees in areas with high COVID transmission

►Free Taco Bell tacos:Taco Bell is giving away free tacos for a year to 100 rewards members. Here's how to enter the contest.

The "Best Friend" rapper’s real name is Diamonté Harper and her first hit single was "Icy Grl."

McDonald’s said the meal will be served in "icy new packaging inspired by her own style."

The meal will be available to order in restaurants, the drive-thru, with McDelivery and on the McDonald’s app using contactless mobile order and pay.

McDonald’s said the meal's price will vary based on location.

Before the collaboration with Scott last fall, the chain hasn't had a celebrity meal or "McDonald's Famous Order" in nearly 30 years when it partnered with Michael Jordan in 1992 for the McJordan. Scott's meal led to shortages of key ingredients across the nation.

In October, McDonald's had the J Balvin Meal with the award-winning reggaeton artist and the BTS Meal was available globally this summer.

McDonald's is requiring masks again for customers and employees in areas with high COVID transmission.

McDonald’s ‘Saweetstakes’ contest

McDonald’s announced Monday that it is giving fans the chance to win two limited-edition handbags – one for them and one for their best friend – from Brandon Blackwood, one of Saweetie’s favorite bag designers, along with a five-day trip to Las Vegas for two to see her perform.

Through Sept. 5, order the meal in the McDonald’s app to be entered for a chance to win the prize worth $9,175. The winner will be selected randomly.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PROVIDENCE, R.I. — It's exceptionally rare to dine at a restaurant and hear someone say, "I'll have the scup," or, "I'll have the conger eel."

Salmon, cod and tuna dominate the plate in the U.S. – but why? The world's oceans are home to more than 30,000 species of fish, and most of the edible ones have never been marketed to the average consumer's taste buds.

All along New England's coastline, small boat fishermen are catching a wide array of fish for which there's barely any market – hake, dogfish, butterfish, skate and countless others. They struggle to sell these lesser-known species, and in turn, people are missing out on high-quality, delicious seafood, industry advocates contend.

Some have historically labeled them as "trash fish," but Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association, takes major exception to that.

"We don't call any other type of food 'trash' except for seafood," said Martens. "It's coming out of the ocean, it's not like we're talking about highly processed fast food. I always get very prickly at that term 'trash.' We're talking about food, and we're talking about some of the best food for your body, mind and the environment."

Rather, Martens says, these fish are "unknown" to most eaters.

There's virtually no marketing behind them, he said, and organizations like his are trying to change that – through education, distribution and community projects. They're partnering with restauranteurs, holding "meet the fishermen" events, and connecting food-insecure and multicultural populations with diverse seafood selections.

"You're taking something there's not a good market for, and you're creating a market for it," said Stephanie Sykes, program and outreach coordinator at the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen's Alliance in Massachusetts. That's exactly what her organization did this past year when it used a "less desirable" type of haddock to make chowder for distribution – a resounding success.

Seafood industry:As clam prices soar, restaurants decide whether to remove items or charge insane prices

The push to acquaint New England seafood consumers with different species is multi-pronged, according to Martens, Sykes and others. It's sustainable and can help ease overfishing of more popular species. Fishermen will get paid for their catch and therefore stay working on the water. And ultimately nutritious meals will be eaten – whether it be via a five-star restaurant or local food pantry.

Are Americans scared of seafood?

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said that Americans don't eat enough seafood to begin with, based on dietary recommendations, so there are barriers from the start to get people to try unfamiliar species.

"People aren't used to having them on their plates," said Martens, whose organization is based in Brunswick, Maine. "They go looking for what they know, so they look for salmon, cod, haddock and tuna."

According to an overview of retail seafood sales between 2017-2019 by Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, national sales are dominated by salmon and shrimp in both the fresh and frozen categories, and tuna tops the shelf-stable category at 75%. The study does note differences in regional sales patterns, including whitefish in New England where "cod is God."

The average person in the U.S. consumes about 16 pounds of seafood per year, says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, though that number varies among different cultural groups. Meanwhile, the average person eats about 93 pounds of chicken per year, according to the USDA.

Martens noted how heavily American consumption habits are influenced by marketing. Using Burger King as an example, when the fast food chain releases a new chicken sandwich, he said, commercials bombard the TV.

That's not necessarily the case for seafood.

"We don't have massive companies or even state-run marketing wings that are pushing out some of these unknown fish species to the broader consumer," said Martens.

Take white hake, for example. Most people have never heard of it, he said, yet it's a "beautiful, flaky white fish." Many fishermen say it's their favorite, but it's almost never seen in grocery stores or on restaurant menus.

"There's all these other species that exist in our ecosystem that are just as, if not more, delicious, and we're just not enjoying them," said Kate Masury, program director at Rhode Island nonprofit Eating with the Ecosystem. "I think it's really important we become more aware of what's actually in our ecosystem, all these diverse species."

In 2019, Eating with the Ecosystem launched a citizen science project where people in New England's coastal states looked each week for 52 local seafood species at seafood markets, grocery stores, farmers’ markets and fishing piers.

Forty-seven species were found less than 50% of the time, and 32 species were found 10% or less of the time. The effort clearly revealed that consumers did not have access to the wide variety of marine species living in local waters.

Connecting fishermen and multicultural communities in Rhode Island

All three organizations featured in this story are doing something similar – using lesser-known, nutrient-rich fish to feed food-insecure populations and supply much-wanted seafood to the region's multicultural communities. Simultaneously, they're paying and supporting fishermen.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, fish supply chains were decimated, and more and more people were growing hungry. Based in Warren, Rhode Island, nonprofit Eating with the Ecosystem has helped create a symbiotic relationship between the state's fishermen and multicultural communities – a model for mutual aid.

Since last August, close to 72,000 pounds of seafood have been distributed through the collaboration with the Commercial Fisheries Center of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Food Policy Council – approximately 47,900 meals.

After purchasing from local fishermen, Eating with the Ecosystem has worked to distribute the whole fish and shellfish with seven different community organizations.

People have taken home scup, whiting, hake, butterfish, mackerel, quahogs, Jonah crabs, conger eel, black sea bass and fluke. The selections change every week based on what fishermen are catching.

"When you're eating local, you're connecting with the place that produces your seafood, and you have more incentive to care about that place," said Masury. "And eating a diversity of local species in proportion to their natural abundances allows the marine food webs to function as they should."

The effort started as "a cooler of fish in the back of a car," she said, and it's since grown to more than 3,000 pounds a week.

Masury noted that many of the receiving communities come from coastal countries with rich cultural ties to the ocean. They already love seafood, but face barriers here in the U.S. to accessing it, so the demand for the program is high.

Scup, for example, also known as "porgy," is already popular among Liberian immigrants in Rhode Island, and they're used to cooking whole fish.

Cape Cod 'snapper' chowder feeds hungry, pays fisherman

The Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen's Alliance has worked for many years to introduce consumer taste buds to everything coming across the docks – not just the usual suspects.

Sykes said her organization has turned a lot of attention to marketing dogfish and skate – two species that are plentiful and frequently offloaded at the Chatham Fish Pier, which at one time was one of the top cod ports in the country. They released a cookbook this year focusing on some of the local, often underutilized fish.

When the pandemic struck and fishermen found themselves with fewer and fewer places to sell, the alliance identified an opportunity to help both struggling fishermen and hungry people, via a chowder collaboration branded as "Small Boats, Big Taste."

The chowder features a "snapper" haddock, a small breed that isn't sellable as is, yet fishermen catch it all the time, Sykes said.

"One of the challenges with this particular size haddock, it does not have a strong market," said Sykes. "They're not an appropriate size to retail, but they're still that same very high-quality, small boat New England-caught haddock, and it's great for a value-added product."

Employee shortage:Finding workers was already hard for the ag industry. Now, it's even worse, farmers say

Over the last year, 800,000 meal-sized servings – processed by a company in Boston and made into chowder in Lowell – have been distributed to the Family Pantry of Cape Cod, Greater Boston Food Bank and other various organizations across seven states, including food services at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which funded the initiative.

The Massachusetts federal delegation recently penned a letter to the USDA asking for funding to take the chowder program to the next level.

"The program has been very successful so far, and the next thing to do is to grow the number of fishermen that are supported by it, and to continue including some of those less-common species," Sykes said. "I think this is a foot in the door for those species."

She added, "I think a lot of people are very willing to try something once at least."

'Fishermen Feeding Mainers' program focuses on lesser-known species

The value of landed groundfish in Maine is down 73% from the five-year average, since supply chains collapsed due to COVID-19.

Through a pandemic-prompted "Fishermen Feeding Mainers" program, the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association buys directly from fishermen, pays local processors and then donates the seafood to local schools and other community organizations.

They've provided more than 200,000 meals, specifically focused on lesser-known species, such as white hake, monkfish and pollack.

"We're trying to find different ways to expose people to different types of seafood that's local, seasonal and sustainable, and break down some of those barriers to home consumption and picking it on the menu," Martens said. "The 'other' seafood that comes out of our ocean is something we are really passionate about in our organization."

An upcoming partnership between the association and a Maine soup-maker will produce monkfish stew, enabling those who may have difficulty cooking seafood at home to consume it in a ready-to-eat form.

Organizations such as Martens' are also getting the word out through partnerships with restaurants and chefs, many of whom have taken particular interest in sustainable fine dining menu offerings across the region.

On the menu at Oberlin in Providence, Rhode Island, for example, are fluke, black bass, and butterfish, while Mooncusser Fish House in Boston is serving smoked bluefish salad and glazed hake.

Lesser-known seafood was recently the featured delicacy at a dinner collaboration between the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association and Vessel and Vine, a Brunswick wine shop and bar. Diners paid $99 per person to be served broiled razor clams, monkfish ceviche, sweet and sour marinated mackerel and hake wrapped in basswood leaf during the specially-advertised evening.

"Seafood is such a good choice for us as humans to be eating more of," said Martens.

The poultry party kicks off Tuesday with National Chicken Tender Day, which is followed Thursday by National Chicken Wing Day.

Popeyes rolled out its new chicken nuggets nationwide Tuesday.

The New Orleans-style chain already had tenders on its menu, but says the nuggets are made with the same recipe as its chicken sandwich, which in 2019 launched the Chicken Sandwich War.

The nation's chicken wars and cravings for comfort food during the pandemic have made poultry so scarce and expensive that some restaurants are limiting or running out of chicken sandwiches, wings and tenders. Others have made changes to menus and promotions.

►McDonald's Saweetie Meal:McDonald’s next celebrity collaboration, the Saweetie Meal, launches Aug. 9 at restaurants nationwide

►Taco Bell Rewards upgrade:Taco Bell is giving away free tacos for a year to 100 rewards members. Here's how to enter the contest.

But Popeyes says it's saying goodbye to the chicken war and has what it calls a "piece" offering.

The chain said it has purchased the cash equivalent of one million nuggets from competitors McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Chick-fil-A and Burger King through The Popeyes Foundation. The nuggets will be donated to Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans & Acadiana. It’s also matching consumer donations up to $25,000 that are placed on the foundation website.

Aside from National Chicken Wing Day, July 29 also is National Lasagna Day and National Lipstick Day.

And for Wingstop's new virtual brand Thingstop, the chain's answer to the chicken wing shortage, Thursday has been rebranded as "Thighstop Thigh Day."

"National Chicken Wing Day is an important celebration for us and we would never want fans to miss out on an exciting event for any reason," Charlie Morrison from Wingstop said in a statement. "The plan is to celebrate a little differently this year by still rewarding our fans with free food while encouraging them to try our crispy, juicy thighs for the newly-created 'Thighstop Thigh Day.'"

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dust contains mostly skin cells, bits of bugs, your hair, bits of your clothing on the base level.

"Dust carries a variety of products that can cause odd infections."

Dusting with a wet mop is preferable to dry wiping dust.

Sure, you may dust, but what about the top of the ceiling fan or behind the refrigerator? How bad is a dust bunny here and there anyway?

Bad, experts say.

Dust buildup can cause serious health problems, according to Johns Hopkins Hospital lung expert Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, including serious lung infections and in rare cases, even death.

“A good inhalation of dust could be life threatening depending on someone’s asthma exacerbation,” Galiatsatos said.

Dust can enter our airways with each breath we take or dusty object we touch, but how much is too much?

Here's what you should know about dust – and how to keep it out of your home and body.

What is in dust?

Dust contains mostly skin cells, bits of bugs, your hair, bits of your clothing on the base level. Under the base level is chemicals that have escaped from household products, according to Miriam Donald, a professor at the University of Toronto.

Diamond has conducted more than 10 studies on dust and said it can accumulate chemicals and contaminants’ from inside homes.

“We're exposed to the dust when we breath and when we touch things,” Diamond said. She said small children, especially crawling babies, may be interacting with dust particles more than adults.

The chemicals inside stain repellants and lead-based-paint used in homes and apartments can be found in some dust particles which can cause more subtle physical effects.

'Doctors are still stunned':How did foreign bacteria leave a Texas girl with brain damage?

“We often don’t know the full ingredients of products and don’t know what can be toxic in them,” Diamond said.

Dust also contains allergens that can cause asthmatic symptoms.

“People who suffer from allergies need to keep a clean environment because,” Diamond said. “I can’t even imagine if someone didn’t dust for a year.”

Diamond said the dust accumulated for over a year can contain all sorts of bacteria and microbes. She also said our bodies aren't made to breathe in a lot of dusts and can be hard on your lungs.

“We know it's not good for people's health," she said.

What could happen to my health?

Galiatsatos, a physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the majority of dust doesn’t do much to humans, but smaller particles can get into the lungs and cause irritation.

“You will cough it out or sneeze them out,” Galiatsatos said.

Dust’s first interaction is with the airway and most people will breathe it back out or force it out.

“For some people, that response can become very exaggerated and could cause shortness of breath while attempting to get it out,” Galiatsatos said. “That’s on par with asthma.”

Mold can also hang out in dust, which can cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, an allergic or hypersensitive reaction to a fungus known as Aspergillus fumigatus, in rare cases.

“Dust carries a variety of products that can cause odd infections,” Galiatsatos said.

How often and what's the best way to dust?

The best way to dust is by using a wet mop, Donald said. Dry wiping dust could cause the particles to spread more and be inhaled.

How much you dust is solely based on how dusty your home is.

“New homes tend to be less dusty than old homes,” Diamond said. “Do you have dogs or cats, a whole bunch of kids?”

Galiatsatos advises for people to avoid their triggers and to be mindful of dust management because it could affect someone coming into your home. He also suggests wearing a face mask when dusting.

Diamond’s last bit of advice is to "be careful when you’re cleaning your ceiling fan so you don’t fall.”

America’s future is figuratively on the line. After a year and a half of remote and hybrid learning, children across the United States have fallen desperately behind, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co., which estimates that the average American student has lost up to nine months of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. And students of color fare even worse, it reports.

That may not sound like much, but even a few months of learning loss could have a lifetime of impacts, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international policymaking group that says education interruptions as a result of COVID-19 will have implications for students and nations alike. It estimates that students will earn nearly 10 percent less income over their lifetimes for every year of learning loss they experience.

Because less knowledge translates to fewer skills and decreased innovation, every year of learning loss likewise will cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars in gross domestic product annually through the end of the century.

Against this backdrop, school systems are expected to spend billions of dollars on accelerated and auxiliary learning programs to address learning defecits. In the rush to close academic gaps, however, there’s a risk that they might widen social-emotional gaps that also have formed.

“A lot of parents and educators right now think our No. 1 job at school is to catch kids up. But what does that look like? More homework? More instruction? More time in seats listening to lectures? What I think will ‘catch kids up’ is less of all that,” says youth development researcher Rebecca London, associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “The pandemic has been traumatic for all of us, including children, so I think our first order of business needs to be healing from that collective trauma.”

Catching students up academically is obviously still a priority, but a key place to start the healing process is the playground, according to Elizabeth Cushing, CEO of Playworks, a nonprofit organization that promotes play in schools. “Our brains can’t take on the work of learning if we don’t feel safe,” she says. “Because it makes school feel like a fun, welcoming and inclusive place to be, play can be a really powerful, efficient and easy lever to pull to help kids feel safer.”

If play is essential, so is a favorite school “subject” — recess.

The Power of Play

In 2020, London helped establish the Global Recess Alliance, an international group of scholars, educators and health professionals whose goal is making recess an important part of schools’ reopening plans.

“Decades of research indicate that rather than detracting from student learning, recess supports learning and well-being,” Alliance members wrote in a statement. “As schools reopen, recess must be included in the schoolwide planning.”

Along with helping children heal from trauma, play and recess assist in their complete growth. “Children’s development can be broken down into four domains: intellectual, social, emotional and physical. Play is really the only context in which you can attend to all four of those at once,” says London, who is also the author of Rethinking Recess: Creating Safe and Inclusive Playtime for All Children in School.

Intellectually, play activates the brain’s reward mechanisms and decreases stress, which can facilitate cognition by improving mood, focus, attention and engagement.

Physically, recess is often the only time of day that children have unstructured time for physical exercise and activity. Socially and emotionally, recess is where children become good citizens by learning skills like empathy, emotional intelligence, conflict resolution and impulse control.

“Recess is where kids learn social skills like taking turns, negotiating disagreements and being good teammates,” explains Cushing, who says play deprivation in childhood has been linked to depression, addiction and violence in adulthood. “We know from studies of play deprivation that when children don’t have opportunities for social development, terrible things can happen.”

Re-engineering Recess

Because it creates “joy, relief and a chance to connect,” every child should have access to recess, says Cushing. Unfortunately, she says, not every child does. And with many schools laser-focused on addressing learning loss, there’s real risk that play might fall by the wayside.

Parents can ensure that it doesn’t by asking educators and administrators to explain what recess will look like when most schools reopen this fall.

“Every kid in America should get to play every day. Recess promotes more learning, not less, so we encourage every school and district to take advantage of this reopening moment to establish play as a value in the school community,” Cushing says.

Specifically, Cushing and London say parents should hold schools accountable for making sure recess is:
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What will I be doing this weekend? Resting.

After a long work week and a month of not feeling my best, I'm using the weekend to get some much needed R&R.

Typically I go into the weekend with a long list of to-dos from errands to chores, but this time, I'm really trying to slow down and just relax.

Who else can relate to going into the weekend trying to get so much done that by the time the next week rolls around you're more stressed than before? I know I've done that.

So instead of setting my expectations for productivity so high, I'm trying to be realistic. Of course I'm not going to be bed ridden for two days straight, but I am going to not get caught up in that overwhelming feeling of needing to be productive.

As I learned from a story I wrote last week on how to actually feel rested after a vacation, it can be difficult to push against our world's drive for productivity. It can take some unlearning to tap into a restfulness we're not taught to seek in our society.

So for anyone else needing a bit of a break, I hope you're able to find it. Sending my best wishes to you for a wonderful, restful weekend!

Should you shower every day?

Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis became the trending topic of the day when they revealed they don't shower every day. So my colleague Rasha Ali spoke to experts to get to the bottom of the best hygiene practices.

The consensus? Yes, you should shower every day.

We spoke to Michelle Henry, MD FAAD, Breanna Brown, an esthetician at Ella Esthetics, and Corey L. Hartman, MD FAAD and founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama. They all agree that adults should be showering daily.

Younger children should be fully bathed once or twice a week, while kids ages 6 to 11 should shower twice to three times a week, Henry says.

"If you're waiting too long, then you can get a buildup of dirt, oil, debris and bacteria and those things will cause inflammation," Henry says. "If we allow too much buildup of bad bacteria that we're not washing away that can flare eczema, and that oil, dirt and debris can clog the pores and cause acne and folliculitis."

When you hit puberty, your body starts to produce a type of sweat that bacteria feeds on, which is what creates body odor and is one reason Henry says adults should bathe daily.

"If you're not sweating a lot or you're staying at home, you tend to not feel very oily. And if you feel like your particular body odor isn't that offensive, then it's a personal decision to not shower every day," Henry says.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I find myself with a lot of anger these days.

Part of it is the world. I'm angry and depressed that the pandemic is still going on, that the Delta variant is proving to be more contagious and troublesome and that we aren't doing more to stop it. I'm angry that experiences and events are threatened again. I'm angry at all the other anger I see in the world.

I have personal anger too, for all the usual reasons. I'm crabby because of some chronic hip pain, annoyed if my husband doesn't do the dishes, angry at myself for procrastinating work or home tasks.

It's not necessarily the most pleasant of states to be in. I keep picturing myself as the little red Anger emotion from Pixar's "Inside Out," voiced by comedian Lewis Black: small, red and ready to explode. And if I learned anything from that wonderful movie, I know that containing and suppressing my emotions isn't a good idea.

So I've been working on channeling my anger, allowing myself healthy outlets for the emotion. Focusing on what I can control is a big part of that, including taking my own steps to keep myself and others safe from COVID-19. I'm meditating, seeking positive distractions and trying to get enough sleep. I'm talking about it in therapy, with my friends and family who make up my support system. And most of all, I'm trying to let go of anger at myself.

It's not easy, but it is certainly more helpful than letting the top of my head blow off like a cartoon.

What experts say about kids sleeping in class

With back-to-school on the horizon, Sara Moniuszko took a look at a part of school getting a lot of attention lately: Students sleeping in class.

You know the image from TV and movies – the delinquent, defiant student slumped over his desk, fast asleep in class. But some teachers today are making waves on social media for letting their students snooze in class, arguing sleeping isn't always the mark of a lazy, disrespectful student, and instead it could be an indicator of more serious mental health issues at play.

Experts agree sleeping in class doesn't always stem from laziness, and instead could be a sign something more serious is going on.

"We think about children as happy human beings that are just completing their homework at school and living a happy life, but sometimes we can see that depression can be actually diagnosed or seen in children as small as 5, 6 years old," says Cynthia Catchings, a licensed clinical social worker and therapist at Talkspace.

Children age 6 to 12 should sleep nine to 12 hours in a 24-hour period, and teenagers should sleep eight to 10 hours, according to The American Academy of Sleep Medicine. But many don't get that much sleep.

A 2015 analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 58% of middle school students didn't get enough sleep and neither did 73% of high schoolers. Why? Catchings says stress and anxiety may play a role since both can affect sleep.

What can teachers, parents do?

Catchings says the teachers who let their students sleep in class may have the right idea.

"What we see from teachers recently in allowing them to sleep (during) classes is 'Let me see what the concern is. I can let them sleep. I can always communicate with them or try to investigate what is going on and then help the child,'" she says.

She says the next important step is to involve a parent, counselor or both.

Parents who want to help their kids sleep better can step in to reduce their screen time. Dr. Nicholas Kardaras, psychologist and CEO of Omega Recovery, suggests parents aim to enforce a rule of no screen time – including television – three to four hours before bed.

And lastly, he encourages parents to talk to their kids, especially as some start to transition back to in-person classes this fall.

"Encourage your kids to talk about ... what they're feeling, what their apprehensions are, what their fears are," he says. Be sure you're "not just ignoring the issue and putting their backpack on... and sending them off to school without at least having the opportunity to dialogue about that."

Serenade Foods' recall is for frozen, raw, breaded and pre-browned, stuffed chicken items.

Recalled products are under three brand names: Dutch Farms Chicken, Milford Valley Chicken and Kirkwood.

Serenade Foods is recalling nearly 60,000 pounds of frozen and raw chicken products for possible salmonella contamination.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the Milford, Indiana company's voluntary recall on its website late Monday.

Five products are included in the recall under three brand names: Dutch Farms Chicken, Milford Valley Chicken and Kirkwood, which is an Aldi store brand. The items were shipped to distributors nationwide, but a list of the retailers that sold the affected products was not included with the recall notice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in early June that it was investigating a multistate outbreak of salmonella illnesses, which the federal agency linked to raw, frozen, breaded, stuffed chicken products. The USDA also issued a public health alert June 2.

The CDC updated its food safety alert Wednesday and said there have been 28 illnesses in eight states: Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and New York.

Illinois has had nine illnesses, New York seven, Indiana and Minnesota four each, and the rest of the states have each had one case as of Wednesday, according to the CDC update. There have been 11 hospitalizations.

The frozen, raw, breaded and pre-browned, stuffed chicken items were produced on Feb. 24 and Feb. 25 and include the establishment number “P- 2375” inside the USDA mark of inspection.

"The products of concern may appear to be ready-to-eat but are in fact raw and need to be fully cooked according to the manufacturer cooking instructions on the package before consumption," the recall notice said. "The labels for these products identify cooking instructions for preparation in an oven. The products should not be prepared in the microwave or air fryer."

Most people who get ill from salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps six hours to six days after being exposed to the bacteria, according to the CDC. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.

In July, Tyson chicken recalled nearly 9 million pounds of frozen and cooked chicken products. Other products recalled in July include Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreen, muffins, carrots, select McCormick seasonings and dog food.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Mountain Dew is getting a boozy, non-caffeinated cousin.

Pepsi is teaming with Boston Beer Co., which makes Truly Hard Seltzer and Samuel Adams beers, on "HARD MTN DEW," a new flavored malt beverage (5% alcohol by volume) to hit the market in early 2022, the companies said Tuesday.

Coming in three flavors – original, black cherry and watermelon – the new drinks will have no caffeine or sugar and will be "marketed to adults of legal age and merchandized consistently with other alcohol beverages," the companies said. A fourth flavor will be announced soon, too.

Boston Beer will make "HARD MTN DEW" and Pepsi will create a new division to sell and deliver the beverages.

This isn't the first collaboration between breweries and soda makers. Last year, Coca-Cola teamed with Molson Coors to bring Topo Chico Hard Seltzer to market in the U.S. earlier this year.

The ready-to-drink cocktails market – including hard seltzers – is big and was the sole alcohol beverage category to grow last year, reaching $30.5 billion worldwide, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. The ready-to-drink cocktails market is expected to grow 27% in volume worldwide this year, too, IWSR estimates, and account for about 10% of the total U.S. alcohol market.

Not every hard seltzer is a winner – Molson Coors quit making its Coors Seltzer earlier this summer.

Boston Beer was an early entrant in the seltzer market, launching Truly in 2016. Earlier this year, Truly began selling a new hard seltzer variety pack with new flavors: fruit punch, berry punch, tropical punch and citrus punch.

"We know that adult drinkers' tastes are evolving, and they are looking for new and exciting flavorful beverages," said Boston Beer CEO Dave Burwick in a statement. "The combination of our experience in brewing and developing the best-tasting hard seltzers and hard teas, and MTN DEW, a one of kind multibillion dollar brand, will deliver the excitement and refreshment that drinkers know and love."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fans of Goose Island Beer Co.'s bourbon-barrel aged original Bourbon County Brand Stout and other twists on stouts have some new treats awaiting them this Black Friday.

The Chicago-based brewery, acquired by Anheuser-Busch a decade ago, releases a lineup of aged beers annually and this year's releases include some potentially sweet surprises. Of course, there's the flagship Bourbon County Stout, which weighs in at about 14% alcohol by volume, which is aged in for eight to 14 months in barrels from Heaven Hill, Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace distilleries.

Bourbon County Stout, which typically sells for $13 or more, is usually the most easily found at beer retailers nationwide upon release each November. It serves as the base for the other imperial stouts in the lineup, one of which stands out, based on its description: the Bourbon County Classic Cola Stout. Goose Island's brewers used ingredients such as lime, orange zest and orange juice, coriander, cassia bark, nutmeg, brown sugar, and vanilla to create the cola character.

“Cola is such a familiar flavor. Our biggest challenge was getting all of the ingredients to taste like cola, not nine individual things,” said Jason Krasowski, who teamed with fellow Goose Island brewer Paul Cade on the beer, in a statement.

"In the end, this BCS variant has all the depth and complexity that you might expect from blending nine ingredients into our beautiful BCS base, while, surprisingly, being as refreshing as your favorite cola brand! We hope you enjoy drinking it as much as we enjoyed making it," they said.

Also coming from Goose Island, based on brewery-provided notes:

“This year, Bourbon County Stout fans are sure to be excited by some of the more unique flavor profiles we created with innovative techniques, like Bourbon County Cherry Wood Stout," said Keith Gabbett, Goose Island's senior innovation manager, in a statement.

Beyond Goose Island's own pronouncements, there's certainly reason to be optimistic about the quality of the 2021 releases, says Josh Noel, who is also the author of "Barrel-Aged Stout and Selling Out: Goose Island, Anheuser-Busch, and How Craft Beer Became Big Business."

That's because the beers from 2020 were so good, he said in the Chicago Tribune. "A handful of last year’s Bourbon County beers had no right to work – they were meant to evoke caramel apple or were made with tea – but they did work, mostly because, like any great thing we eat or drink, they showed balance and nuance," he said.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"The Great Sleepover Debate" has raged among parents for years, and now the controversy has found a new home on TikTok.

Parents are dueling over whether sleepovers are healthy or harmful, explaining their choices, sometimes justifying their caution and often criticizing their detractors.

TikTok user @toriyav posted a video saying "My children will NOT be allowed to have sleepovers" and in another video on the topic wrote "you really never know what goes on behind closed doors." Some commenters agreed, saying "I completely understand and back your choice." Another said "u can't control everything" and one wrote "sleepovers were some of my (favorite) childhood memories."

On a video with the on-screen text "Why No Sleepovers," TikTok user @bmcpher posted a news story about child sexual abuse with the caption "some things are more important than 'fun.'" One commenter said "I don't agree with sleepovers for the same reason," while another noted, "just because that happened doesn't mean it will happen."

Parents resist sleepovers for a variety of reasons, including cultural differences and fears of abuse. But child development experts say sleepovers can be an important developmental step for children, helping them navigate independence, practice flexibility and gain exposure to different family cultures. Sleepovers may test the limits of some parents' discomfort, but they are one useful way children can exercise separation from caregivers.

Experts say parents who feel sleepovers aren't right for their family should consider alternative opportunities for their children to practice self-efficacy and adaptability.

"There's a fine line between raising kids who understand things like good touch, bad touch, when to heed their spidey sense that something isn't safe, how to call home for help, when to extricate themselves from a bad situation and ... raising kids who are afraid to go out in the world," said Phyllis Fagell, a school counselor and author of "Middle School Matters: The 10 Key Skills Kids Need to Thrive in Middle School and Beyond – and How Parents Can Help."

Fagell said U.S. parenting culture has grown increasingly over-protective. If a parent is resistant or hesitant to sleepovers, especially at the home of someone the host knows and trusts, it's important parents examine their motivations.

"As parents, I think if your decision not to have sleepovers comes from a place of fear, I would caution parents to pause and ask themselves, what is my anxiety?" she said.

Culture, abuse fears, disruption: Why some parents are ditching sleepovers

Fagell is American, has three kids, and all her children had sleepovers growing up.

"It's something I'm familiar and comfortable with," she said. "As a counselor who works in a K-8 school, I think it's far more nuanced."

Fagell said some parents come from cultures where sleepovers are not customary, so they feel unfamiliar and unnecessary. Some parents find sleepovers contribute to behavioral problems or family disruptions and simply aren't worth the recovery time. Others worry their kids may be abused or exposed to abuse while sleeping at someone else's home, a fear especially potent among parents who are survivors themselves. Parents of teens worry their children will make unhealthy or unsafe decisions.

The range of resistance shows parents are confronting a number of different anxieties when weighing whether to allow their child to sleep somewhere else. While some parental concerns are legitimate, experts say others may be a form of catastrophizing. Accommodating anxieties is not a healthy way to cope them and can trickle down to children in ways that may stunt their ability to tolerate discomfort themselves.

Mary Alvord, a psychologist and author of the "Resilience Builder Program for Children and Adolescents," views sleepovers as a "rite of passage."

"Sleepovers are helping kids work toward independence," she said. "Developmentally that is crucial."

Alvord said children who aren't given opportunities to practice independence can develop separation anxiety, fears and even phobias when leaving their caregivers and entering new spaces.

Sleepovers are one way to teach cognitive mental flexibility, as children will inevitably experience things at a friend's home that are different from their experiences in their own. A child who has cereal every morning may find at another kitchen table pancakes are standard fare.

Teach safety, minimize risk

It's neither possible nor healthy for parents to try and eliminate all risks when it comes to the safety and well-being of their children.

"There's not a world where there is 0% risk," Alvord said. "So you minimize it. That, I think, is the job as parents."

When approaching sleepovers, parents and children can start small – staying with a trusted grandparent and working their way up to a friend. Parents should know the family whose home their child is sleeping in, but children and their parents must also be able to tolerate some degree of uncertainty.

"Social risks are one type of risk," Fagell said. "You want to make sure kids are alert, aware of their environment, that they're heeding the signs inside their body, that they're able to make good, safe, healthy decisions for themselves, but that they're not afraid to put themselves out there to meet new people, to take risks, to try new things."

Minimizing risk, experts say, means teaching kids their bodies are their own and that anxiety is the body's way of communicating. A child can experience it when a friend's older sibling starts watching something inappropriate on TV or when their peers start mixing juice boxes and vodka. It's important to teach children that anxiety isn't something to fear, but something to listen to.

Perhaps most importantly, Alvord said, is that children feel safe enough to disclose when something makes them uncomfortable.

"It's about making sure kids know they can tell their parents anything," she said.

A lesson in empathy and acceptance

Experts say parents who decide they are drawing a hard line with sleepovers need to validate their children's feelings. Those children may feel excluded, frustrated or resentful.

"Validating doesn't mean that you agree that they should get their way," Fagell said. "It just means that you understand, and you empathize."

Parents can engage in conversations about alternative ways to meet their child's need, which can include things like a "sleepunder," where a child stays at a friend's late but eventually goes home to sleep, or a family camping trip with a family they know.

Fagellsaid children whose friends are not allowed to participate in sleepovers should be encouraged to practice acceptance and empathy.

"One way that parents can teach their kids to embrace differences and to be a good friend is to help their child understand that not everyone has the same cultural experience. Not everybody views sleepovers the same way. That doesn't make that peer less than." she said. "It's an opportunity to really look for ways that you can include them, to keep them a part of the group, to not have them feeling left out."

So while the Phoenix financial adviser doesn’t usually go for rule-breaking, she recently decided to slip into a local pharmacy and get her younger daughter a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, which is approved only for those 12 and older.

Allen told her immunocompromised daughter the plan, fibbed about her child’s age at the counter, and walked out relieved.

“I’m a mother who needs to keep her children safe, and if the governor here had mandated masks in school I might have thought differently,” said Allen, 55, who declined to give her daughters’ names out of concern for any backlash. “I’m an ethical person. But after my daughters, my concern is me. If they get it and pass it on and I’m hospitalized or dead, my kids are in trouble.”

Allen’s quandary is shared by millions of Americans who, as schools go back in session, ponder the best way to keep their vaccine-ineligible young ones safe as the delta variant continues its rampage and some state leaders resist in-school mask mandates.

Having a child under 12 receive the vaccine raises medical and ethical questions and can bring justifications that can range from understandable to specious. Among the former: Children with underlying conditions deserve a shot considering the alternative. The latter: With many people declining the vaccine one might as well use a dose, although doses are still needed for at-risk adult holdouts.

When asked their opinion, doctors and ethicists gave USA TODAY a unanimous verdict: Though the temptation is understandable, getting a child the COVID-19 vaccine introduces risks that may outweigh the benefits.

“I know there’s a lot of anxiety out there, but it really doesn’t justify going outside the lines,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious diseases specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora. “The No. 1 issue with any vaccine is safety for the patient.”

O’Leary is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose CEO recently sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration urging the agency to speed approval of vaccines for those under 12, leveraging data that is being compiled from ongoing trials.

Most experts predict such an approval could come as early as this fall but as late as early winter.

The FDA is in a race against the clock on a few fronts. When it comes to adults, some Americans have said they will get a shot only when the agency gives full, versus just emergency, approval of the vaccines. The Biden administration has said that may happen next month.

And for kids, delaying even emergency approval – which could happen if the FDA decides to add children to its current trial – raises the stakes as hospitals increasingly see younger unvaccinated patients.

Last week saw the largest leap since the pandemic began of pediatric COVID-19 cases, about 72,000 from 39,000 the previous week, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Doctors in hard-hit states such as Kentucky and Texas report that some children are being put on ventilators.

Given those concerning trends, there’s little surprise some parents are mulling taking matters into their own hands.

The temptation to jump the line is often fueled by news that many Americans are not choosing to get vaccinated, by the assumption that 12-and-over eligibility can feel like an arbitrary cutoff, and by the simple physiological fact that some 11-year-olds appear developed beyond their years.

Dr. Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston has “sympathy for parents just trying to make the best decisions they can based on many government leaders who are unwilling to protect them.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has banned mask mandates, a decision that is being challenged in court and defied by a number of county school districts.

But Hotez believes the answer isn’t to sneak younger kids in for a shot. Rather, he urges parents to put their anger and frustration into fighting for mask mandates while the FDA continues its research into the efficacy, side effects and even appropriate dose level for those under 12.

“The FDA is working as expeditiously as possible, but the reason we’re conservative with kids is because if you get things wrong, the stakes are higher,” said Hotez, who also is co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston.

Hotez notes that “not all 11-year-olds are created equal,” and the vaccine’s effect on children may prove different from the effect on adults. There is also the possibility that researchers may determine that those under 12 should receive half an adult vaccine dose. Lastly, he points out that the FDA has never approved a vaccine for younger kids on an emergency use basis. “It’s a murky and complicated road map,” he said.

Dr. Stuart Finder, director of the Center for Healthcare Ethics at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles, seconds that note of caution.

As a father of three, he said he understands the heightened sense of concern many parents are experiencing, but that shouldn’t mean abandoning a sense of trust in the science that produced the vaccines themselves.

“Time is a weird thing,” he said, noting that only eight months have passed since the FDA granted emergency approval for the vaccines for adults, a millisecond in scientific research terms. By comparison, it took about 50 years of development for a polio vaccine to finally be approved in 1952, ending a scourge of its day.

Asked what he would tell parents, Finder offers advice that may prove difficult to act on in these fraught political times. Given that medical experts agree that masks help cut the risk of getting COVID-19, he encourages parents have kids wear masks while they themselves engage in discussions with friends and relatives about what is important to them. "We have to find some mutual understanding," he said.

Another bit of advice comes from Nancy Berlinger, research scholar at The Hastings Center, an independent bioethics institute in Garrison, New York. Put simply: “Before you lie to a pharmacist about your kid’s age, call or video chat your physician and get some information about why this vaccine is not yet approved for kids.”

Berlinger has an 11-year-old niece and would love to know she’s protected from COVID-19. But she doesn’t hesitate when asked if there are any circumstances in which slipping her niece into the vaccine queue would be OK.

“Well, lying is wrong. We tell children not to do that,” she said. “Involving your child in this lie seems hard to justify. It doesn’t seem worth it, as a parent, to be forced into a lie, falsify a medical record and perhaps get false benefits from the vaccine, all when the FDA may well fast-track this for kids soon.”

When Arizona mom Allen decided her youngest needed the vaccine despite it not being approved for her age group, she told her daughter the plan. Once they agreed, they set off together and have not looked back.

“I don’t feel unethical at all, especially when many adults are refusing the shot and it’s available,” Allen said. “My kid is compromised in terms of her health. I’ve had clients, friends and family members die from COVID-19. It’s real. It worries me. I’m teaching my 14-year-old how to pay the mortgage, because you just really don’t know what’s going to happen if you get this.”

After getting her youngest vaccinated, Allen decided to announce the news to those who follow her on Facebook. “My point was just trying to get her friends to consider getting vaccinated,” she said.

Some of Allen’s family and friends are vocal about being anti-vaccine, she said, and they simply didn’t comment on her post.

“I’m not saying everyone should take the same action. It’s different for everyone,” Allen said. But, she said, a few friends direct-messaged her after the post "asking me how I got this done. In one family I know, the mother had a breakthrough case, and then the daughter got COVID-19. She wrote, ‘I wish I’d done what you did.’”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dunkin' is releasing a new Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew along with the returning seasonal items.

When does Starbucks release its Pumpkin Spice Latte in 2021? The coffee giant hasn't announced a date.

Pumpkin spice cup noodles will be released in late October at select Walmart stores.

Pumpkin spice season is returning to Dunkin' earlier than ever before.

The fall menu will be available at participating Dunkin’ restaurants nationwide by Aug. 18, the chain announced Wednesday. It features the new Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and returning Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte, pumpkin-flavored coffee, donuts, muffins and Munchkins donut holes.

Dunkin's seasonal menu also features the Apple Cider Donut and two new drinks: Apple Cranberry Dunkin’ Refresher and Apple Cranberry Dunkin’ Coconut Refresher.

Introducing the official flavor of fall earlier and earlier has been a trend for coffee chains. Last year, pumpkin pandemonium returned to Dunkin’ Aug. 19, two days earlier than in 2019. In 2020, pumpkin came back to Starbucks on Aug. 25.

►McDonald's celebrity meal:Saweetie Meal arrives at McDonald's Monday for a limited time with a new ‘Saweetstakes’ contest

For a limited time, the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte in medium will be available for $3, Anh-Dao Kefor, Dunkin’ director of integrated marketing, said in a statement to USA TODAY.

Starbucks has not yet confirmed when its Pumpkin Spice Latte – the drink that started the pumpkin craze 18 years ago – will be released.

According to a survey of 2,000 consumers 18 and older by Nissin Foods, more than 50% of Gen Z respondents are obsessed with pumpkin spice. The ramen noodle company is releasing a limited-edition Cup Noodles Pumpkin Spice flavor at select Walmart stores in late October.

Starbucks PSL, Dairy Queen and more

While a firm date isn't known for the return of Starbucks PSL, the coffee giant said earlier this month that seasonal products were returning to grocery store shelves in August along with some new additions, including Pumpkin Spice Flavored Non-Dairy Creamer and Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew Concentrate.

Cracker Barrel kicked off fall Tuesday with the limited launch of its Pumpkin Pie Latte, which is available iced or hot until Nov. 29.

Tim Hortons' pumpkin spice drinks and baked goods launch Aug. 25. Dairy Queen is bringing back its Pumpkin Pie Blizzard Treat and Pumpkin Cookie Butter Shake on Aug. 30 for a limited time.

More pumpkin announcements are expected soon with products hitting store shelves and restaurant menus in the coming weeks.

Jamie Spears, the father of pop star Britney Spears, said in court filing Thursday that he will step down as his daughter's conservator.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@COVID numbers are rising at alarming rates, sexual harassment is back in the headlines and the latest UN report on climate change warned of a "code red for humanity."

For lack of a more eloquent way to put it: Things feel bad.

I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling my personal stress with life, work and relationships compiled with feelings of fear and worry with so much happening in the world right now.

Parents are worried about children contracting COVID-19 while children are worried about not having a planet to live on in the future.

But, there's a way to make things at least feel a bit better.

While reporting on climate anxiety this week, I spoke to mental health professionals whose advice on combatting anxiety stuck with me: Focus on what you can control.

While you can't control what's going on in other parts of the country or world, you can control what goes on in your own home and the choices you make.

"Somebody who's stressed out in general will benefit from saying, 'OK, here are the three things I can control today, here's what I want to focus on,'" Amy Morin, psychotherapist and editor-in-chief at VeryWell Mind, told me.

So when you're overwhelmed with emotion, try focusing on what you can do to make yourself feel better.

For me, that often means getting organized with to-do lists and schedules so I can feel more in control.

Whatever you decide to do, it's important to find ways to stay calm and cope.

The painful truth about toxic mother-in-laws

On the social media platform TikTok, the hashtag #toxicmotherinlaw has more than 130 million views. My colleague Alia E. Dastagir spoke to experts to find out why so many women have agonizing and absurd experiences with the women their husbands call "mom."

Psychologists say toxic mothers-in-law are not caricatures. They are women typically living with mental illness, many afflicted with one or more personality disorders that make it difficult for them to empathize with others or ever clearly see themselves. They appear most combative with female partners of heterosexual sons.

"She's narcissistic and/or borderline dependent, antisocial or histrionic, or a gamut of all," said Sherrie Campbell, a clinical psychologist and author of "But It’s Your Family…: Cutting Ties with Toxic Family Members and Loving Yourself in the Aftermath." "They don't want love, they don't want connection. They want power."

Psychologists say mothers with these toxic tendencies are self-absorbed and self-referential. As their children age, they refuse to allow the relationship to evolve, becoming increasingly needy, intrusive and controlling. They desire consistent access to their sons regardless of age or development. When their sons enter a relationship or marry, their feeling becomes, "This is my little boy, and no one's taking him." In response, they manipulate, lie and act as though they are the victim.
