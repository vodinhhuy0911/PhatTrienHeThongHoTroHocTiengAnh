Come 2034, incoming revenues will be enough to pay about 76% of scheduled Social Security benefits, a 2020 Social Security Administration trustees report predicts.

Given that, how might different generations plan for this? Should they plan for a 24% decline in their scheduled benefit? Should they not factor Social Security benefits into their retirement income plan at all? Or might they do something else.

“Though I think it far more likely that some combination of reforms will eliminate the need for cuts of the magnitude the trustees report suggests, people should be aware of the impact a cut would have on their overall financial situation,” says Joe Elsasser, a certified financial planner and president of Covisum.

►Where to keep your emergency fund:Is it better off in a Roth IRA or savings account?

What are some of those reforms? Tax increases, benefit cuts or a combination of both are the oft-mentioned reforms. But to date, there seems little to no interest on the part of lawmakers to tackle the coming shortfall between incoming revenue and scheduled benefits.

What to do then? “The implications with Social Security’s solvency tend to fall on generational lines,” explains Marcia Mantell, a principal with Mantell Retirement Consulting.

She agrees with Elsasser that Social Security beneficiaries and would-be beneficiaries ought to consider the following actions:

Baby boomers: On target

Social Security benefit estimates for those born 1946 through 1964 should be on target and will be unlikely to be reduced if Congress fails to put a solution in place to shore up the reserve account within the overall trust fund, or fails to increase payroll taxes to support the commitments made to these retirees, says Mantell.

Elsasser agrees but suggest taking some precautionary measures. “Baby boomers should plan for benefits as they are projected, but stress test for a benefit cut,” he says. “Historically benefit cuts have been phased in over time.”

For instance, the last solvency crisis of this magnitude occurred in 1983. “And some of the reforms that were put in place are still being phased in today, such as the increase in full retirement age from 65 to 67,” Elsasser notes.

According to Elsasser, stress testing allows you to practice what you would change in your plan if the full cut materializes. “If the cuts to your plan are too painful to bear if they do materialize, then make smaller changes now and monitor the situation,” he says. “Smaller cuts to your lifestyle sooner will hurt less than larger ones later.”

Covisum has a benefit cut calculator that allows consumers to identify how benefit cuts would impact their break-even ages.

Gen X: Plan on a 10% reduction

If you were born 1965 through 1980, planning for your retirement income becomes more important than ever, warns Mantell.

Elsasser recommends planning on a 10% reduction in your Social Security benefits and doing retirement projection that includes a reduced Social Security amount to balance your lifestyle today with the lifestyle you’d like to live in retirement.

The good news about this bad news? “For the 65 million of you who are between the ages of 41 and 56, you are in your peak earnings years,” says Mantell. And that means you can and will need to ramp up your personal savings.

“You’ll be well-served to rethink, rebudget and redesign your spending and your savings strategy in case Social Security delivers less in income than currently projected,” she cautions. “You have time on your side, and every $1,000 or $2,000 or $5,000 you can sock away now will increase your income for retirement and balance out the trade-offs that you may have to make.”

And what’s the worst-scenario if you ramp up your savings and there’s cut in Social Security benefits? “You end up with more than you need,” says Elsasser.

Gen Z and millennials: Too early to tell – or worry

Experts say it’s too early for millennials and Gen Zers to worry about Social Security cutting benefits.

“You are too young to confidently guess how Social Security will pay benefits,” notes Mantell. “Half of you don’t even yet have your 40 credits for eligibility. So, your focus will be well-served to be on you.”

Elsasser shares that point of view: “Though it’s important for everyone, particularly if you are under 40, your focus should continue to be on improving your skills, education and training in order to maximize your earnings potential through your peak earnings years,” he advises. “Saving consistently in vehicles you won’t touch until retirement is important as well. At minimum, be sure to take advantage of any company matches or incentives.”

The best-case scenario

All this planning for a potential cut in benefits might be much ado about nothing, according to Michael Finke, a professor at the American College of Financial Services.

“I don’t know any expert in Social Security who believes that Congress will allow a significant cut to beneficiaries,” he says. “Politicians face a no-win situation where making changes today to shore up Social Security is painful, because it will either mean higher taxes or lower benefits, but the alternative to making no changes is worse – having a big block of voters see a cut in their retirement income.”

And this, he predicts, will motivate Congress to increase payroll taxes, increase the claiming age or change the inflation adjustment.

In the wake of George Floyd's murder, corporate America pledged to do better, saying it would diversify its leadership, encourage equity and take concrete actions to root out systemic racism.

But a USA TODAY analysis of previously undisclosed hiring records from dozens of top firms found that more than a year later, executive roles remain overwhelmingly white and male. Black and Hispanic workers, particularly women, tend to be concentrated in the lowest ranks, and some of the nation's most powerful brands still refuse to disclose data on the gender, ethnic and racial makeup of their workforce.

The eight-part series combed the records of the Standard & Poor’s 100, some of the most highly valued companies in the stock market.

Building pipelines for diversity success Anthony D. Wilbon, dean of the Howard School of Business, and Charlotte Newman, senior manager at Amazon, talk growth strategies for diversity and equity Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY

They revealed that while Black and Hispanic employees are often overrepresented as compared to U.S. census data on the nation's workforce among the technicians, administrative assistants and laborers who form the backbone of many organizations, they are less likely to be found at the company's senior levels, or in other professional positions.

The lack of diversity in corporate roles that pay the highest salaries, offer the best benefits and provide a path to promotions, influence and leadership, hardens the racial and gender wealth gap that's resulted in the typical white family having eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic household.

Companies are more transparent, but not all

Companies have become more transparent in the 14 months since Floyd's killing when protests condemning systemic bias and calling for social justice swept the nation.

Among the S&P 100, a record 54 companies, including Merck, Ford Motor Co, Bank of America and Target, gave USA TODAY their EEO-1 forms, documents detailing the gender, race and ethnic breakdown of their workforces that businesses are required to provide each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Another 23 corporations, including Home Depot, Walmart and Boeing said they would publicly disclose that information this year or in 2022.

Altria, Abbott Laboratories, AT&T, General Dynamics and UnitedHealth Group were among the companies that provided their EEO-1 reports after publication deadline.

But some of the nation’s most well-known brands, such as Exxon, T-Mobile and FedEx, rejected USA TODAY’s requests and gave no future date when they might provide such information to the public. Amazon, which last released its EEO-1 report in 2016, also would not provide the most recent demographic data of its workforce but said it would release its 2020 data in the coming months.

Federal officials will not release these demographic records to the public without companies’ permission, citing privacy protections in the Civil Rights Act. A civil suit filed by Reveal, a nonprofit investigative journalism outlet, challenges the legality of hiding these records from the public.

Boards are largely white and male

Black and Hispanic talent is missing at the top and concentrated at the bottom of the top U.S. companies. Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies often point to the diversity of their boards of directors to distract from the concentration of white men in their corporate suites. But board membership at the 54 companies examined by USA TODAY also did not reflect the racial makeup of their business's workforces, let alone the nation's overall population.

While white men make up about a third of U.S. workers, they held half or more of board seats at 33 of the 54 companies.

Amgen, a biopharmaceutical company, had the highest percentage of white men on its board – eight people, or 73% – even though only 30% of the company's workers are white males. White women held two of the remaining three board seats, which is almost half of their rate in the company's workforce.

Compared to their company workforces, white, non-Hispanic men were only underrepresented on 12 company boards, almost always by just a handful of percentage points. Among the remaining corporations reviewed, the share of white, male board directors often was two or three times higher than their business' workforce.

The companies also appointed white women to their boards at higher rates than people of color.

White, non-Hispanic women held a disproportionately large share of board memberships at about two-thirds of companies.

White women had no seats on the board of Coca-Cola despite holding 23% of all jobs. At Starbucks, they held just 9% of seats while accounting for 38% of the company's workers.

About a third of companies had boards where the percentage of men of color matched or exceeded their representation in the business's workforce. Six companies did not have any men of color on their boards.

Another 19 companies did not have any directors who were women of color. They were equitably represented or overrepresented on the boards of just 10 companies. But those figures are based on counting all non-white women together, obscuring the lack of Black and Hispanic women board members in particular.

“We have to move from tokenism to transformation,'' says Darren Walker, who is head of the philanthropic Ford Foundation and a diversity advocate. "Having one Black on the board or the chief diversity officer three levels down from the CEO will not result in a successful strategy. There has to be genuine authenticity.”

At about half of the companies reviewed, the board membership had more representation for people of color than among the business's executives, although men of color were much more likely to hold those seats than women.

For instance, 44% of board seats at Gilead Sciences Inc., a pharmaceutical company, are filled by four men of color but no women of color. Two white men and three white women hold the rest. Yet, men of color account for 20% of the company's executives and 26% of its workforce.

Women of color account for a larger share of McDonald's workforce than any of the 54 companies reviewed: 44%. None sit on the company's 13-member board.

Again, these tallies lump together ethnic and racial groups that face different challenges with workplace discrimination and gaining the kind of career recognition that leads to invites for board seats. Closing the gaps will take targeted strategies, experts say.

Diversity strengthens the bottom line

A diverse board appeared to help some S&P 500 companies weather the economic downturn sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic better than businesses whose boardrooms were less inclusive, according to a new report.

S&P 500 businesses whose boards were more than 30% people of color experienced a 4% bump in revenue as compared to the previous year, while their peers whose boards were less than 20% people of color saw their revenue dip 2.8%, according to BoardReady, a nonprofit focused on making boards more inclusive.

Race, inequity in corporate US

And companies, where women made up more than 30% of the directors, outperformed those whose boards had fewer women in 11 of the top 15 S&P 500 sectors last year.

“It’s striking that so many aspects of diversity correlated with better performance,” the report’s lead researcher, Rajalakshmi Subramanian, said in a statement announcing the findings. “No matter whether you’re looking at racial diversity, gender diversity, or diversity in age, companies with a broader range of perspectives at the board table did better.”

The gains that have been made in some board rooms have been hard-won, and companies can easily backtrack if advocates aren't vigilant, says Ursula Burns, the former CEO of Xerox and the first Black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. She's been leading the charge to diversify the boards of major corporations.

“The board level in many publicly traded companies is better than the C-suite data and it’s better than the employment levels,” Burns told USA TODAY in an interview. “Basically, if you beat the (crap) out of them about something – I’m sorry to say it this way – they will pay a little bit of attention to it, with the hope that we will forget about it after a while, and they then can take their foot off the pedal.”

Mondelēz International, which produces snacks like Oreos and Ritz crackers, has no women of color and only one man of color on its 12-person board. Nearly 40% of the company's workers are people of color.

In an emailed statement, the company said that last year, it signed on to the Board Diversity Action Alliance, which aims to make boards more inclusive.

"We value diversity within our board of director members, as we do throughout our organization,'' the company said. "We know we can and will continue to improve in this space."

USA TODAY's series puts a spotlight on several industries including:

Tech

People of color are far less likely than white employees to hold management or professional roles at the nation’s top tech companies, USA TODAY found. Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

While white employees across all U.S. industries are three times as likely as their Black or Hispanic peers to get top jobs, the gap is even starker among the nation's largest tech firms.

White employees at Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are five times as likely to be executives as their Hispanic colleagues and seven times as likely as their Black co-workers, USA TODAY found.

And while women are underrepresented among managers and executives throughout corporate America – a pattern that continues in the tech world – the disparity among Black tech employees is particularly striking. In that sector, Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have leadership roles.

Black and Hispanic workers have a disproportionate share of lower-level jobs in big tech. At tech companies analyzed by USA TODAY, nearly half of white employees had professional positions as compared to 1 in 5 Hispanic workers and 1 in 9 Black workers. The professional gap between white and Black employees in tech was three times greater than what is seen in the overall labor force.

Banking

Leadership of the nation's major banks has traditionally been – and continues to be – predominantly white.

White people fill 73% to 87% of all executive positions at US Bancorp, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.

Wells Fargo says that it will release its EEO-1s for 2019 and 2020 later this summer, roughly a year after its CEO Charles Scharf, a white man, drew criticism for saying the San Francisco-based company missed its diversity benchmarks because there was a limited pool of Black executives to draw from.

Food Retail

USA TODAY finds executive positions at Coke, Costco, Pepsi and Starbucks largely white. Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

At some of the nation's largest or best-known food companies and chains, the diversity in top jobs is vastly out of sync with the broader population.

White workers are 64% of the nation's workforce, while Hispanic workers are 16.8% and Black workers are 11.2%, according to U.S. Census data.

But 87% of executive positions at Costco are occupied by white people. Meanwhile, 77% of executives at Pepsi and 74% at Coca-Cola are white, according to records obtained by USA TODAY. McDonald's was the most reflective of the U.S.'s racial demographics with white people filling two-thirds of executive roles. Although the company's leadership was the closest to matching the overall American workforce, McDonald's still had disproportionately high rates of Black and Hispanic people, particularly women, in lower-paying and lower-ranking jobs.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'd never, ever call my 2004 Pacifica a clunker. But it has played one in print more than once when I've written about how old vehicles are bringing home some serious cash.

Back in 2010, used vehicles were in hot demand and short supply after a Great Recession strategy took many older models off the road as a way to push new metal off the lot.

Cash-for-clunkers, which ran in July and August 2009, took nearly 700,000 used vehicles out of circulation. The federal program offered up to $4,500 for a clunker. Yet program rules required that clunkers be crushed or shredded.

So in late July 2010, I took my 2004 white Chrysler Pacifica out for a test. The vehicle had 77,000 miles on it. It had plenty of bells and whistles, including heated leather seats and backseat DVD player, something I can't imagine anyone would need today. It was the vehicle I loved to drive to chauffer my son through most of grade school and, later, even the start of high school.

Two dealers looked it over. One saw a dent in the back bumper, as well as a smaller ding on a front fender. One dealer said about 90,000 would be average for a 6-year-old vehicle, so the lower mileage on my vehicle was attractive.

One dealer offered $4,500 and another $6,800 in summer 2010.

And now 11 years later, what's that Pacifica worth as we're hearing about a surge in 2021 on prices for older cars? I suppose the real shocker is that I still own what is now a 17-year-old vehicle. But we'll get to more on that later.

What's driving a surge in used car prices?

The hot summer car used to be a convertible but now, who knew, it's the clunker.

Now, high-mileage, older cars and trucks – which can be the most affordable to buy – are increasingly tough to find on dealer lots, according to Cox Automotive.

The number of high-mileage vehicles available on retail lots dropped to around 11,700 in early June, according to a Cox Automotive report. The average miles: 121,000.

That's down about 40% from a year ago.

"The Great Recession left us with far fewer 2009-2011 vehicles than the ages on either side," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox Automotive.

The country is likely to face a similar issue in a few years, he predicted, when we'll see far fewer 2020 and 2021 vehicles on the roads.

New vehicle sales were constrained in 2009-2011, as the auto industry and the U.S. economy struggled to recover from the severe recession.

Now, new vehicle sales are stalling as many consumers can't afford the high sticker prices. On top of that, the semiconductor chip shortage is slashing the supply of new cars and big trucks on dealer lots.

Some people got plenty of stimulus dough and spent that money on cars, too, depleting some inventories, as well.

►Know before you buy:What's a key step before buying a used car? Getting a pre-purchase inspection

While you will lose older vehicles to scrappage over time, drivers can try to keep an old car running when recessions hit, their pocketbooks feel a pinch or they can't afford or find the new car or truck that they really want.

Smoke expects the used vehicle market to face limited supplies at least through 2024. Even so, he said used vehicle prices at the retail level appear to have peaked around the week of July 5.

Prices amaze buyers and sellers

Consumers could be shocked by how much they're paying for used cars – and how much they could get on a trade-in if they're trying to unload a vehicle.

Prices on used vehicles rose so sharply in June that roughly one-third of the seasonally adjusted inflation surge in June was blamed on rising prices for used cars.

The prices of used cars and trucks rose 45% over the past year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

So, it's getting harder for car buyers to find a bargain.

"Used vehicles in the 'under $15,000' price range are all but nonexistent now in retail, whereas last year they accounted for more than 18% of the market," according to Cox Automotive.

On average, 5-year-old cars sold for roughly $24,000 in June – up 36.3% from an average of $17,636 a year ago, according to research from Edmunds.com.

On a 7-year-old car? We're looking at average transaction prices of around $18,000 – up 44.5%.

In some cases, popular vehicles are selling for a higher price used than they did just a year ago when new.

A 2020 Ford F-250 Super Duty truck sold for $60,785 last year. But the inventory squeeze a year later drove up the used vehicle sale price to $70,943 in July, according to Edmunds.com. A 2020 Subaru Crosstrek sold for $26,804 new but the used car crunch drove up its used price a year later to $30,082 in July, according to Edmunds.com.

What's perhaps even more shocking is that drivers are spending more on cars and trucks with mileage around 100,000.

The old adage that a vehicle's value tumbles dramatically once it crosses the 100,000 mark is being proven wrong, according to Ivan Drury, senior manager of insights at Edmunds.

Consumers, in general, are more willing to buy higher mileage vehicles, as quality has improved and the cost of new vehicles has risen significantly.

►Job growth:Economy adds 943,000 jobs in July despite COVID surge, worker shortages as unemployment falls to 5.4%

►Profit gains:Gannett reports first profit since 2019 merger with New Media Investment Group: Revenue, digital subscriptions rise

We're looking at an average transaction price of $16,489 in June – up from $12,626 last year – for cars and trucks with 100,000 to 109,999 miles that were sold at dealerships. That's up 31% and the highest average transaction price that Edmunds has on record for those vehicles.

Granted, some of that push can be attributed to the demand for expensive used trucks if consumers find very limited supplies of new ones. Demand for used trucks is being driven by the chip shortage that is cutting into new truck production.

Trade-in values have gone up significantly, as well.

Take some 6-year-old vehicles. The average trade-in value for a 2015 Chevrolet Equinox, for example, was nearly $10,500 in June, according to Edmunds. That's up 43% from the trade-in for 2014 Equinox a year ago. The average mileage is nearly 86,000.

The average trade-in value for a 2015 Ford F-150 was a bit above $27,000 in June, up 66% from a trade-in for a 2014 truck a year ago.

"If you have a truck, you're good," Drury said.

Even some 7- to 8-year-old vehicles with more than 100,000 miles are commanding prices today, he said, that are more like the cost of 5-year-old vehicles with 60,000-80,000 miles a year ago.

What's key to remember? You might not want to rush to sell your old car if you can't find the new car that you really want to buy or even lease. If you can't find a decent deal for your next car, it may not be worth it to sell the old car now.

And you still don't want to just jump at the first offer you might get for buying your car. Local dealers know their customers so one dealer might be more interested in your car than another. Compare prices online and talk to a few dealers.

What about my Pacifica?

As for my 17-year-old Pacifica? It had 155,581 miles on it in mid-July – a bit more than twice the miles it had on it 11 years ago.

My vehicle was one of the original crossover wagons, and not like the current Pacifica minivan. More of a big, bulky SUV of sorts.

Why did I keep it this long? Well, this is working-class Detroit and sometimes you like to keep a vehicle that's kept running. (Yes, this vehicle suffered from engine cradle rot later in its life and I sprung for a very steep repair bill. But otherwise, it's a good vehicle with a good engine.)

My son, now an accountant, began driving it in his senior year in high school, and it's still serving him well some six years later.

So could I make a bundle selling this one? How do you define a bundle?

I'm not seeing any way that I'd get $5,000 for it – which I believe would be roughly 20% of what I paid for a high-content vehicle that ended up loaded with incentives and rebates after DaimlerChrysler's deeply disappointing launch of what was dubbed a luxury crossover.

Getting a potential price to sell the Pacifica, though, proved to be far easier than I remember back in 2010. Now, you can get an instant offer online.

After plugging in some numbers, including my Vehicle Identification Number, and answering some questions about the Pacifica, I got an immediate offer from CarMax for $600 through the Edmunds.com site.

And I received an Instant Cash Offer via Kelley Blue Book online for $730.

The Kelley Blue Book trade-in range listed online went from $703 to $1,444.

Why so low? Well, if you think about it, it wasn't that long ago when no one would dream of getting $700 on the spot for an everyday car that's nearly two decades old.

And as much as some dealers might need used vehicles to fill up their lots, many aren't exactly paying big bucks to find what I prefer to call a 17-year-old gem.

"For the most part, they're trying to keep their showrooms looking fresh," Drury said.

Businesses large and small, from McDonald's and Home Depot to local yoga studios, are reinstituting mask mandates as coronavirus cases rise. Bars, gyms and restaurants across the country are requiring vaccines to get inside.

After a largely mask-free summer, it's a reversal no one wanted to see, brought on by the fast-spreading delta variant and new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But business owners and workers say they will do what they can to keep their doors open and not slow the economic gains of the past few months.

"We've already been through the worst of the challenges when we shut down the indoors last year," said Brack May, the chef and owner of Cowbell, a New Orleans burger joint. "Let's just get ahead of the curve here."

May recently began requiring customers to show their vaccine cards for indoor dining. He said he wants to protect his workers, who are required to be vaccinated but have children at home, as well as his neighborhood, where some musicians recently contracted the coronavirus.

►Mask requirement:McDonald's requires masks again for customers and employees in areas with high COVID transmission

►Gallery:These companies are requiring employees to be fully vaccinated

May expects that eventually vaccine rules like his will be commonplace. Next month, New York City will start requiring vaccinations to enter restaurants, gyms and theaters.

But for now, customers are far more likely to encounter mask mandates. After lifting mask recommendations for fully vaccinated people in May, the CDC reversed course in late July, recommending masks for vaccinated and unvaccinated people in areas of higher transmission.

Confusing requirements

The shifting guidance has caused confusion over which rules to enforce and how. Walmart and Target, for instance, recently began requiring masks for employees – but not customers – in areas where virus transmission rates are high. McDonald's is requiring masks for both employees and customers. Home Depot's mask mandate is nationwide.

A handful of places, like Louisiana, the San Francisco Bay Area and Las Vegas, are requiring masks indoors.

Many business owners didn't wait for the CDC or their local governments before acting. In mid-July, Tamra Patterson reinstituted a mask mandate and reduced seating capacity from 200 to 65 at Chef Tam's Underground Cafe, the restaurant she owns in Memphis, Tennessee.

"I need every dollar and dime and penny I can get, but if I don't have employees healthy, I don't have a business. If customers are sick, I have nothing," Patterson said.

Customers are generally receptive to the mask mandate, Patterson said. Only one has walked out.

PanTerra Gallery, a women's clothing store in Bisbee, Arizona, reinstated a mask mandate for customers a few weeks ago after watching cases climb nationwide.

"We're a tourist town, so it was just a matter of time before it reached us again," said Lisa Wines, a PanTerra employee. Most people are fine with the new mandate, she said, but some turn around and stomp out of the store.

Not every business supports the mandates. Basilico's Pasta e Vino, a restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, has railed against masks on social media. A sign on its door requires patrons to prove that they're unvaccinated.

Some workers also don't want to see masks return.

Dru W., a grocery employee in Houston who asked not to use his full name for fear of reprisals at work, said he was fully vaccinated months ago and enjoys the freedom it gives him to go without a mask. Few stores around him are enforcing the new CDC guidelines, he said, and he won't, either.

"I didn't get both my doses and deal with the rather gnarly side effects only to be told to go back to the way things were during the pandemic," he said.

But other retail workers see masks as an important way to end the pandemic. Austin Ray Shanks, who works at a Walmart in Monroe, Washington, said he finds masks uncomfortable but necessary. He's disappointed that many customers at his store refuse to wear them.

Marshall Crawley said his gym in Morrisville, North Carolina, recently announced that it would require masks for vaccinated and unvaccinated patrons. But the rule isn't being enforced, he said.

"It doesn't really feel like it is doing much good wearing a mask when everyone around me is not," said Crawley, a client manager for J&J Editorial, a managed services company for scholarly publishing.

Crawley believes the CDC went too far when it told vaccinated people they could remove their masks this spring. Now, he said, it will be too hard to persuade people to put them back on.

Jose Backer, who works in customer service at a food packaging manufacturer in Los Angeles County, said his company began letting vaccinated workers remove their masks earlier this year. But soon everyone stopped wearing them. That angered Backer, who doesn't want a repeat of a COVID-19 outbreak that sickened him and others at his workplace last year. He's relieved that his county is requiring masks for everyone again.

The new wave of mandates give some comfort to companies that never gave up on masks, even when U.S. cases ebbed earlier this summer.

Liz Manasek, co-owner of Warner Bodies, a custom truck manufacturer in Elwood, Indiana, kept a mask policy in place after watching other companies struggle with different rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated workers.

About 60% of the company's 105 employees are now vaccinated, she said. She has told employees she won't consider removing the mandate until that level reaches 80%.

Manasek has gotten some pushback from workers, but she reminds them that the policy has been effective. Only one or two employees have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began, she said.

"We've just got to hold out and keep on the basics," she said.

Associated Press

With the price of chicken soaring, the third-largest poultry producer in the U.S. is being bought for $4.53 billion.

Cargill and Continental Grain have formed a joint venture to acquire Sanderson Farms, paying $203 per share in cash for a company that last year processed more than 4.8 billion pounds of meat.

The companies plan to combine Sanderson Farms with Wayne Farms, a Continental Grain subsidiary, to form a new, privately held poultry business. Operations will include poultry processing plants and prepared foods plants across Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Texas.

Wayne Farms has more than 9,000 employees. It makes products under brand names including Wayne Farms fresh and prepared chicken; Platinum Harvest premium fresh chicken; Chef's Craft gourmet chicken; Naked Truth premium chicken and Ladybirdy premium chicken.

Laurel, Mississippi-based Sanderson Farms has 17,000 employees and 12 plants. It processes 13.6 million chickens per week.

The deal comes as chicken prices are surging. Wholesale chicken breast prices have been at or above $1.80 per pound since mid-April, a seven-year high, according to the Livestock Marketing Information Center. Last year at this time, they were $1.13 per pound.

Pandemic-related plant shutdowns last year and winter storms across the South earlier this year have impacted supplies.

The price increases have been compounded by demand from major restaurant chains. McDonald's Corp., Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc., Wendy's Co. and Burger King have all recently introduced new variations of chicken sandwiches. McDonald's cited chicken sandwiches, as well as a chicken McNugget meal promotion with the boy band BTS, for its better-than-expected second-quarter sales.

Wholesale chicken wing prices have been above $3 per pound since April, well above the five-year average of $1.75 per pound. Some dine-in chains like Applebee's and Chilis, which were forced to close dining rooms during the pandemic, have launched delivery-only chicken wing brands.

In a conference call with investors last week, WingStop, the chicken wing chain, said the price for wings on the spot market are up 125%, and it expects more of the same for the rest of the year.

Sales at Sanderson Farms soared more than 34% during the second quarter compared with the same three-month period last year.

"Expanding our poultry offerings to the U.S. is a key enabler of our ability to meet customer and consumer demands," Cargill Chairman and CEO David MacLennan said in a prepared statement Monday.

Both Cargill, which is based outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Continental Grain Co., which is based in New York, are private companies.

Cargill is one of the world's largest food companies, with more than 155,000 employees in 70 countries. It produces meat and animal feed and makes agricultural commodities like vegetable oil, among other businesses. Continental Grain invests in food companies and operates food production companies in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere.

Wayne Farms CEO Clint Rivers will lead the combined company.

The U.S. poultry industry has been operating under a cloud in recent years. Restaurant chains, food producers and grocers, including Walmart, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, sued Sanderson Farms, Wayne Farms and other poultry producers in 2016 alleging that the companies conspired to fix poultry prices over an eight-year period.

The U.S. Department of Justice intervened in the case and has charged at least 10 people with antitrust violations, including current and former employees at Pilgrim's Pride, Claxton Poultry Farms, Perdue Farms and Koch Foods. Sanderson Farms and Wayne Farms have not been charged. Sanderson received a subpoena in the case in 2019 and has said it is cooperating.

Sanderson Farms will become a private company and its shares will no longer be traded on Nasdaq. Its shares jumped 7.5% to $196.01 in afternoon trading.

The deal is expected to close by the end of this year or early next year. It still needs approval from Sanderson Farms stockholders.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The claim: Employees who are fired for refusing a vaccine are eligible for unemployment benefits

The highly transmissible delta coronavirus variant has caused a nationwide spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. As a result, an increasing number of workplaces are requiring employees to provide proof of vaccination.

In some states, company vaccine mandates have been met with opposition, with some employees resigning and filing lawsuits. A Morning Consult survey in June found that 18% of employees said they would quit if faced with pandemic-related mandates at work.

But some social media users say workers should avoid quitting their jobs if they want to collect unemployment benefits.

“If your employer is mandating any pokes, DO NOT QUIT,” reads an Aug. 4 Facebook post, which accumulated more than 5,000 shares within two days. “Make them fire you. That way, you get unemployment benefits and can pursue legal action.”

But that's not accurate, according to a dozen employment and labor experts who spoke with USA TODAY.

A worker who does not comply with a company's policy to get vaccinated is generally ineligible for unemployment benefits, experts say. But there are some exceptions – and unemployment qualification is not the same in every state.

Fact check: CDC didn't say COVID-19 vaccinated are 'superspreaders', vaccines failing

"Employees should not refuse vaccination relying on the assumption that they will be able to collect unemployment," Natalie Sanders, an employment law attorney with Brooks Pierce, said in an email.

The Facebook user who shared the post did not return a request for comment.

Companies can impose vaccine mandates

Private companies are free to set conditions of employment as long as they do not violate existing state and federal laws, legal experts say. And there is no federal law prohibiting companies from requiring vaccines.

Guidance from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says employers are not prohibited from requiring employees who are physically at the workplace to get vaccinated, as long as the requirements comply with other workplace laws. For example, the requirements must provide reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities and religious exemptions. Similarly, the U.S. Justice Department wrote in a legal opinion that businesses may lawfully require employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Jeffrey Hirsch, a University of North Carolina law professor, said workplace vaccine mandates are comparable to uniform requirements.

"American employment law is very deferential to employers, which are able to exert a lot of control over workers," Hirsch said via email. "The COVID vaccine is just one example of this ability. While it’s obviously a politically charged one, it’s really no different in substance from a large number of others that have existed for a very long time."

Several legal experts emphasized that because COVID-19 vaccines are still new, it's likely vaccine mandates by private companies will be challenged in the courts, and rules could change.

More:Vaccine mandates are gaining momentum: Here's what your employer is allowed to ask of you

"The environment is highly dynamic and changing every week," Richard Tarpey, assistant professor of management at Middle Tennessee State University, said in an email. "The intense emotions and deep polarizations involved in the vaccination issue make it extremely difficult to predict."

Unemployment eligibility depends on state guidelines

It depends on the state, but in general an employee who is fired for refusing to comply with a company's vaccination requirements is not eligible to collect unemployment, legal experts say.

Jennifer Shinall, a professor of law at Vanderbilt University, said employees are usually barred from getting unemployment benefits if they quit or if the employer had cause for termination.

"But every state defines what ‘cause’ is a little bit differently," Shinall said. "Some states have more guidance than others, and the COVID vaccine itself is relatively new, so certainly these employer mandates are very new.”

Labor and employment attorney Charles Krugel said there are some common standards that undergird unemployment eligibility throughout the country.

If employees are fired for violating a known workplace policy and were treated the same as their peers, they are unlikely to receive unemployment benefits. For example, if an employee refused to follow a company's dress code and got fired, they would not be eligible for unemployment, Hisaid.

But employees who can prove a medical or religious exemption may have a claim, experts say.

“There is no one-size-fits-all answer,” Michael Elkins, founder and partner of the labor and employment firm MLE Law, said in an email. “If an employee was fired for refusing a company-wide policy that applied to everyone, like getting vaccinated, that could be considered misconduct, and they could lose out on unemployment as a result.”

Fact check: 6 of the most persistent misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccines

Tarpey said that in most situations unemployment will be denied to those who don’t comply with a company vaccine mandate, but there are some "emerging outliers."

For example, he said, a pending Tennessee bill includes a provision that prohibits denying unemployment benefits if an employee quits because of a vaccine requirement. Similar legislation, including bills that protect the unemployment benefits of terminated employees, has been proposed in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana and Michigan, among other states.

“If a state has a law prohibiting termination of employees for refusal of vaccination, we can expect individuals to have solid claims for unemployment benefits and other forms of relief if they are terminated for refusing the vaccination,” Tarpey said.

Our rating: Partly false

Based on our research, we rate PARTLY FALSE the claim that employees who refuse a vaccine are eligible for unemployment benefits. Legal experts say employees who violate company policy by refusing to get vaccinated can be terminated for misconduct, which usually disqualifies an employee from unemployment benefits. States interpret misconduct differently, however, and they have different guidelines for unemployment benefits. Workers with proof of a medical or religious exemption may still be eligible to collect unemployment if they refuse the vaccine.

Secured credit cards are an important credit-building tool.

Secured cards are a special type of credit card that requires you to make a deposit. The card issuer then gives you a credit line equal to that deposit. For example, you might have a secured card with a $500 credit limit and you'd deposit $500 into a special bank account the creditor could access if you didn't pay your bills.

Since creditors don't take any risk of nonpayment when issuing a secured card, virtually everyone can get one – even people without a credit history or with a recent bankruptcy or foreclosure. And they can help you improve your credit score as you make payments and use them responsibly.

But there are a lot of cards out there. It's crucial that you pick the best secured credit card for you to make sure you're getting all of the benefits this card type has to offer while limiting any potential downsides. To help you find the right card, make sure you look for these four features.

1. Reporting to credit agencies

The single most important thing to look for in a secured credit card is a promise to report your borrowing behavior to each of the three major credit bureaus. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion collect information from creditors, and this data is used to determine your credit score. But not every secured card issuer reports to them.

If your card doesn't report to the credit reporting agencies, it won't end up having any credit-building effect at all. You won't benefit from your track record of responsible borrowing behavior so you'll just be tying up your money to get a secured card for no reason – and delaying the time when your credit gets good enough to get another card type.

2. Opportunities for regular review

Many secured card companies provide the opportunity to eventually transition to an unsecured card once you've shown you can be responsible. For example, some companies review your borrowing behavior every six months to determine if you're eligible for more credit (without an additional deposit) or for a return of your original deposit.

Automatic review of your borrowing behavior can help you transition more quickly to having an unsecured card without having to close your current card or apply for a new one. That's a huge benefit, since you want to get your deposit back but still be able to continue using your card to build credit.

► I keep getting rejected for credit cards: How do I fix that?

► Credit card spending limits: Should you ask for an increase even if you don't need it?

3. No fees/low fees

There are some very expensive secured credit cards out there, which market themselves to borrowers who want to build credit fast. There are also free secured cards that don't impose this type of burden on people who are trying to improve their financial lives.

There's very little reason to pay a high fee for a secured card when there are other creditors who want to do business with you without charging you for the privilege. Avoid cards that abuse your desire to build your score.

4. Rewards

Finally, some secured cards let you earn rewards. While the rewards you get won't be as competitive as those offered by cards exclusively available to people with great credit, they can still be a nice bonus. After all, why not get rewarded for spending you're doing anyway?

Rewards aren't the most important thing to look for – a lack of fees and reporting to the credit agencies are far more essential. But all things created equal, if there are cards that check these other boxes and give you cash back or the chance to earn points or miles, don't pass up this great perk.

If you would like to refinance your current home loan but lack the credit score to snag a low rate, this article is for you. Here, we'll suggest ways you can improve your current interest rate, even if your credit is less than perfect.

Can you refinance your mortgage with bad credit?

The short answer is maybe. It's certainly not out of the question. If you're looking for a conventional refinance, you'll likely need a credit score of 620 or higher. Don't let that discourage you if you're not quite there, though. A mortgage lender will also consider factors like how much you earn and your cash reserves (to determine whether you can cover financial emergencies). Even if your credit score is low, a lender may be willing to take the risk as long as other aspects of your application are strong.

But first, you need to know where to start.

Speak with your current lender

Let your current lender know that you'd like to refinance and find out if it offers options that will work for you. The best thing about working with your current lender is that it knows your mortgage file and can quickly determine whether you'd qualify for any of their refinance programs, even with bad credit.

Your current lender may help by changing your loan terms. For example, it may be willing to refinance your loan to a longer term. You'd end up paying more in total interest over the life of the loan if you extend it, but it will lower your payments and, hopefully, give your budget a little breathing room.

Also, if you're still carrying private mortgage insurance (PMI) on your loan because you put less than 20% down when you purchased the property, find out how close you are to hitting the 20% equity mark. Once you have 20% equity in the property, your mortgage lender will drop PMI. Here's how that works:

Get your home appraised. A home appraisal typically runs between $300 and $450. You have to pay for the appraisal, but it could take as little as two months to recoup the cost once PMI is dropped.

A home appraisal typically runs between $300 and $450. You have to pay for the appraisal, but it could take as little as two months to recoup the cost once PMI is dropped. Figure out how much you still owe. Let's say the appraisal comes in at $325,000, and you currently owe $250,000. That means you owe less than 80% of what the home is worth (giving you more than 20% equity) and are eligible to drop PMI. ($250,000 ÷ $325,000 = 0.769, or just shy of 77%).

Let's say the appraisal comes in at $325,000, and you currently owe $250,000. That means you owe less than 80% of what the home is worth (giving you more than 20% equity) and are eligible to drop PMI. ($250,000 ÷ $325,000 = 0.769, or just shy of 77%). Ask your lender to drop PMI. Provide your mortgage company with the appraisal and a written request to drop your PMI payments.

Seek a government-backed loan

Government-backed loans -- like FHA, VA, and USDA mortgages -- are designed for everyday people who may not have much cash to get into a home. Though regular mortgage lenders distribute them, these loans are backed by the U.S. government. Lenders know that if you default on the loan, the government will make them whole. Simply put, if you want to refinance but your credit score is nothing to write home about, a government-backed loan may be your best option. While these loans do have minimum credit qualifications, they are typically lower than a traditional mortgage.

FHA

If you currently have an FHA mortgage, the FHA streamline option allows you to refinance without a credit check or income verification. The catch is that your mortgage must be current. If you're hoping to switch from a conventional loan to FHA, you'll need to undergo the typical credit check.

VA

Loans backed by the Veterans Administration are for active and former military members and their families. Although you will likely need a credit score of at least 620 to qualify (depending on the lender), a VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (VA IRRRL) allows you to refinance an existing VA loan as long as you've made at least the last 12 payments on time. (This requirement varies by lender.) Lenders may also have guidelines regarding how long you've held your current mortgage. Unfortunately, there is no cash-out option available with a VA IRRRL.

USDA

Home buyers with an income of up to 115% of the median income for the area where they hope to buy (or refinance) a property may be eligible for a USDA loan. The home in question must be located in an area designated as USDA eligible.

If you have a current USDA loan, their streamlined assist program lets you refinance without a credit check. You qualify as long as you've made the last 12 months' worth of payments.

Add a cosigner

Though we're putting this option out there for your consideration, convincing a cosigner to refinance a mortgage is not as simple as it sounds. Not only do you have to talk someone into taking responsibility for your mortgage if you miss payments, but some lenders want the cosigner to be on the title of the home. In addition, if your credit score is very low, a cosigner may not help. That's because mortgage lenders use the lowest median credit score between you. No matter how high your cosigner's credit scores are from the big three credit reporting agencies, the lender will be more interested in your median score. Let's say your three scores are 600, 590, and 580. It's that middle score (590) they'll use to make a credit decision.

That said, if your median score is right on the cusp of the lender's minimum required score, having a cosigner with excellent credit may be enough to inspire the lender to refinance your mortgage. For example, if the minimum required score is 660, and your median score is 650, you may have a shot.

There's no credit score so low that it can't be rehabilitated. So as you work through your refinancing options, take steps to raise your credit score. You might not be able to do it overnight, but you can do it.In the meantime, if you're not sure where to get started, look at the best mortgage lenders for bad credit. They can point you in the right direction.

A historic opportunity to potentially save thousands on your mortgage

Offer from the Motley Fool: Chances are, interest rates won't stay put at multi-decade lows for much longer. That's why taking action today is crucial, whether you're wanting to refinance and cut your mortgage payment or you're ready to pull the trigger on a new home purchase.

Money may not buy happiness, but it will buy your food, pay your mortgage, and finance your vacation – things that can help you find your own happiness. It's been proven time and again that when your personal finances are in good shape, your overall stress levels decrease.

In most of the United States, an income around $100,000 is more than enough to give you (and your family) financial peace of mind.

Although many high-paying jobs require significant investment in education and many years of experience, you don't always need to spend a decade working your way up to reach that six-figure milestone. Here's a look at seven jobs you could be doing in just a few years that can provide you with a six-figure income.

1. Computer programmer

This is a huge category of career options that covers a variety of skills and roles, such as software developer, database manager, or web developer. The type of programming you do – or, more specifically, the programming languages you master – will impact how much money you can make. That said, it's common to find skilled programmers earning six figures or more.

►Fewer jabs mean fewer jobs:States with lower vaccination, higher COVID-19 infection rates are behind in growth this summer

Some employers might prefer programmers with bachelor's degrees in computer science, but skilled developers can often bypass that requirement. Resources for learning various types of programming are plentiful. Online courses and programming "boot camps" can give you marketable skills in mere months.

2. Air traffic controller

Air traffic controllers are responsible for helping pilots (and their planes) safely take off and land at airports, so this role is vital to the operation of any airport. Luckily, the pay is commensurate with that importance: According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the median salary for an air traffic control specialist is over $125,000.

You'll need to be 30 or younger to get a job as an air traffic controller with the FAA. You'll also need to have one of the following:

Three years of progressive work experience

A bachelor's degree

A combination of post-secondary education and work experience equaling three years

The FAA gives preferential consideration to applicants with aviation degrees from a Collegiate Training Initiative school.

3. Commercial truck driver

Truck drivers are the blood cells of commerce, funneling needed supplies all over the country (and the world). A good salary for a commercial truck driver is around $65,000, but some industries and areas may pay more. If you want to hit the six-figure range, you'll likely need to purchase your own truck and become an owner-operator.

►Racial justice in the workplace: :In-depth look at diversity’s struggle to crack corporate boardrooms

Becoming a commercial truck driver requires a high school degree (or GED), and a commercial driver's license (CDL). If you're going to specialize, you may need additional training or certification. While you'll definitely want some training before trying to get your CDL – driving a 26,000-pound vehicle on city streets isn't a simple skill – training can be completed in as little as a few months.

4. Digital marketer

If you live and breathe the internet, then digital marketing could be a no-brainer. The top-end digital marketers easily bring in more than $100,000 a year, and you can do the job either working for a large company or by starting your own.

The type of training you need depends on the type of digital marketing you want to do, but moderate to expert level skills in social media and search engine optimization can go a long way. You can take numerous online courses to get certifications for several useful skills. Plus, many of these classes are free or inexpensive, and they can often be completed in weeks or a few months.

5. Construction manager

As the bosses of construction sites, construction managers are responsible for keeping projects on track and on budget. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary for a construction manager is $107,260, but salaries tend to range from around $97,000 to $130,000 or more, depending on the type of construction (commercial vs. residential, for example) and your experience.

►'I quit':Workers change jobs at a record pace amid burnout, new openings with higher pay

You'll definitely need some education for these jobs, but it doesn't necessarily need to be a four-year degree. Many community colleges and vocational schools offer two-year programs in construction management that you can pair with some on-site experience.

6. Transportation inspector

If it flies, drives, or floats, chances are good someone has to inspect it before it can head out. And, in many industries, those vehicles will be inspected regularly while in use. The median salary for a transportation inspector is around $81,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and you might make it into the six figures with a little time and experience.

The amount and type of training you need varies based on the specific role and industry, but you'll typically need a two-year degree or advanced certification to work as a transportation inspector. Alternatively, you could start out in a lower-level job, such as mechanic, and work your way up.

7. Sales manager

Like it or not, the wheels of capitalism are turned by sales. And a quality sales manager is worth their weight in rhodium (which currently sells for roughly 10 times as much as gold). Most folks in sales roles earn the bulk of their income through commissions, so it may not always be the steadiest or most reliable job – but the potential for six figures is huge in many areas.

Most industries need sales managers, so you could work in almost any field that piques your interest. The majority of your sales training will likely come from on-the-job experience, though you might pick up some of the basics through an online course or training seminar.

Train your way to financial security

There are many paths to success. Sometimes, those paths include a decade of education and a PhD. But you can also find six-figure financial security with other types of training that won't take nearly that long. Use this list as a jumping-off point to explore ways to take your income potential to new heights.

Even after showings signs of a recovery in recent weeks, the price of two leading digital coins, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), have fallen almost 30% since May. Meanwhile, trading volume for all cryptocurrencies plunged more than 40% in June, and it hit year-to-date lows last month.

But be warned, even as cryptocurrencies seem to be building positive momentum again, the fundamentals still look troubling, and it could get worse in the near future. As a result, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies all face mounting risks looking ahead.

The end of the line for cryptocurrencies in China

For years, Chinese investors had been some of the biggest drivers of the cryptocurrency bull market. This is because of stringent capital outflow controls enforced by the central government. In fact, citizens are only allowed to purchase $50,000 worth of foreign currencies every year, so shifting hard-earned money abroad through cryptocurrencies became a no-brainer.

This has inflated the value of some coins due to limited supply. For example, let's say Chinese tech billionaire Chen wishes to transfer $48 million to the Cayman Islands via a cryptocurrency known as the send-me-now (SMN) coin. However, there are only 100 SMN coins available, so Chen must first bid up the price of each coin to $480,000 to make it a one-time transaction. One can see how the price of cryptocurrencies could go up frequently and suddenly this way.

►Crypto credit card rewards are on the horizon: :What can you do with them?

►'We need to continue to innovate':How charities are using NFTs as a way to fundraise

But the Chinese government doesn't seem to like this loophole. Recently, the ruling Communist Party barred financial institutions and corporate entities from doing business with cryptocurrency investors. In addition, provinces are beginning to outlaw cryptocurrency mining operations, citing environmental concerns (which we'll get to later). It's hard for any asset to rebound in price when its major buyers have been barred from the market, and the recent volatility for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has only added fuel to the flames.

NFTs are not what they seem

The logic behind the NFT hype is simple: authentic, physical art is expensive. NFTs are authentic, digital art. Therefore, NFTs should be expensive as well (corollary: NFT coins go to the moon). Unfortunately, that is far from the case. Physical artwork isn't just expensive, because people who buy it are connoisseurs who like drinking red wine while viewing their collections. Much of the demand in that world is also driven by tax avoidance (that is, the reduction of taxes through legal means).

The setup works like this. Let's say a high-net-worth individual (HNWI) named Sarah purchases a $5 million piece of artwork from an auction and ships it directly to a free port -- a designated economic zone where customs duties and taxes do not apply until an asset leaves the zone -- to legally avoid the sales tax. Five years later, the artwork appreciates to $25 million. Sarah then hires an appraiser, who usually has a financial incentive to inflate the piece's value, to certify the painting. She then donates it to a non-profit and can claim the full market value of the piece at certification ($25 million) as a deduction against her income, usually over a few years. Because HNWIs do this, the value of artwork can also become grossly inflated.

Story continues below.

But the demand is not replicable when it comes to NFTs. First of all, most non-profits don't even accept cryptocurrency. What's more, there is a lot of confusion as to NFTs' classification. Suppose the Internal Revenue Service determines Sarah's NFT was acollectible instead of an intangible capital asset, then tough luck. In that case, she could only deduct her cost basis ($5 million) for her donation – resulting in a redundant transaction. Until there is greater clarity about how they are classified under the tax code, there is little inherent value to NFTs based on the Ethereum blockchain. On a side note, it's probably in the best interest of Uncle Sam that it stays this way.

Meanwhile, their utility for digital art collectors is very controversial. Buyers are getting exclusive rights to an item but often at a very high price for something that one can find all over the internet (i.e., a video from a professional basketball player). As a result, it's unlikely the market could attract significant capital from investors long term. Regulations haven't caught up with other possible uses like in real estate, so while NFTs are an innovative way to store something like a land deed, the practice needs greater industry and regulatory approval before taking off.

Staggering environmental concerns

Moving back to Bitcoin, the energy cost of mining it has gotten out of hand. Because Bitcoin's reward keeps on halving, miners need to keep upgrading their equipment to stay profitable. For example, the latest Bitcoin mining machine, the Antminer S19, has a power consumption of 3,250 watts, equivalent to a central air conditioning system. At current coin and energy prices, miners typically spend close to $2,000 on their electricity bills per year, per machine. Bitcoin mining now consumes 0.55% of global electricity production, and it's simply not sustainable. To put it into perspective, one Bitcoin transaction consumes about the same amount of energy as 1.2 million Visa card transactions.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the biggest flag-bearers for the overall cryptocurrency market, and as of this writing, they have severe utility and network issues that are unaddressed. Investors should understand that prices will continue to be extremely volatile as well. For those reasons, I believe the cryptocurrency bear market is far from over.

In an ideal world, you'd start funding a retirement savings plan from an early age and keep making steady contributions throughout your career. Many people miss that initial boat, though, and don't begin setting funds aside for retirement until they're midway through their careers. Some even wait until late in their careers to sign up for a 401(k) or open an IRA.

The good news is that older workers who wind up behind on their savings are entitled to make catch-up contributions to their retirement plans once they turn 50. Currently, IRAs max out at $6,000 per year for workers under 50, while 401(k)s max out at $19,500.

Thanks to catch-up contributions, workers 50 and older can sock away up to $7,000 per year in an IRA and up to $26,000 in a 401(k). And now, there are proposals in the works that seek to raise these catch-up figures even more.

Throwing older workers a lifeline

It's possible to save for retirement beyond the limits that apply to IRAs and 401(k)s. You can always open a regular brokerage account and earmark those investments for your senior years.

The problem, though, is that you won't get a tax break for going that route. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s offer the benefit of tax-free contributions and tax-deferred investment gains. Roth IRAs and 401(k)s, meanwhile, offer the benefit of tax-free gains and tax-free withdrawals during retirement. While saving outside of one of these accounts is certainly possible, it's not as cost-effective.

There are two separate bills pending in Congress that aim to raise the current limits for catch-up contributions. First, there's a House bill that would allow savers aged 62, 63, or 64 to make catch-up contributions totaling up to $10,000 for a 401(k), up from $6,500.

That said, that bill would also eliminate the pre-tax aspect of those contributions, effectively bumping them into the Roth category. That's not a bad thing, though, because that money would still benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals.

► Retirement: 5 things you need to know about Social Security spousal benefits

► Plan ahead: How much of a cut to Social Security benefits can you expect based on your age?

The Senate bill, meanwhile, would allow for $10,000 catch-ups to 401(k) plans for savers 60 and older. Those contributions would also be eligible to go in tax-free so savers can reap an immediate tax break.

If either proposal goes through, a lot of people who are behind on retirement savings could have an easier time boosting their personal cash reserves. This especially applies to savers with above-average incomes. Among workers earning $150,000 or more, 58% make catch-up contributions in their retirement plans, reports Vanguard.

It's too soon to know which of these proposals will gain the most traction, and to be clear, neither is guaranteed to become law. But the fact that lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum seem to support the idea of higher retirement plan catch-ups is encouraging.

Many people get a late start to retirement savings because they graduate college saddled with debt and need time to work their way out of it. Allowing for more generous catch-up contributions could be the ticket to helping many Americans retire in a more financially secure place.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Anna Pierce first heard the Canadian border would be reopening to fully vaccinated U.S. travelers, she was nearly brought to happy tears.

The vice president and general manager of Niagara Helicopters, an Ontario-based company that offers helicopter tours, described operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic as a “terrible roller coaster,” with travel restrictions for both domestic and international travelers curbing business dramatically.

"On a typical day (before the pandemic), we would do upwards of 80 flights with six passengers in each flight," she said. "It went down to as low as four flights a day last summer."

Pierce hopes Monday's border reopening date will allow Niagara Helicopters to salvage reservations in September and October, a popular time because the company can offer an aerial view of Niagara Falls' changing leaves, but the company is lacking one key component: staffing.

How much will a trip cost? Canada is reopening to vaccinated American travelers

The company has 18 employees, less than half of what it normally has this time of year. Pierce said the company needs at least 24, but employees are so in-demand that she gets a handful of no-shows every time she sets up interviews.

“People are just being snapped up left, right and center. I’ve never seen anything like that,” Pierce said. “We’re not expecting business to surge to 2019 levels, but we’re hoping for the best (when travel restrictions ease) and we hope we have enough employees to service them.”

Canadian businesses near the border have spent weeks preparing for Monday, when Canada will start allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents to cross the border. But the expected uptick in travel comes as businesses across North America face staffing shortages and supply chain issues.

That could mean travelers to Canada will have a harder time getting certain reservations or face longer wait times, according to some business owners.

How busy will Canada businesses be?

Monday’s easing of travel restrictions is expected to boost traffic to Canada, but businesses and local leaders say it will take time before tourism rates are comparable to 2019 levels.

Denis Vinette, vice president of the Canada Border Services Agency’s travelers branch, told USA TODAY the agency predicts a 10% to 25% increase in traffic toward Canada on Aug. 9 – a significant increase, but still just about 20% of historical volumes.

But even a small boost is good news for cities like Toronto, where Americans make up the majority of the nearly 30 million annual tourists it gets in a typical year. A 2020 report from Destination Toronto, the marketing organization for Toronto's tourism industry, found the city lost about $8.4 billion in economic activity after one year of the pandemic.

"It’s been devastating," said Toronto Mayor John Tory. "If you look at a lot of the major tourist destinations downtown … they’ve been vacant."

Niagara Falls, Ontario Mayor Jim Diodati said he doesn’t expect a “massive rush” come Monday, especially knowing travelers trying to cross the land border will face longer wait times thanks to enhanced public health measures such as a requirement to show proof of vaccination.

“I think the first to come across won’t be your typical tourists,” Diodati said, adding that he expects to see more Americans crossing to visit family or property.

He doesn’t anticipate international travel to pick up until next year, a long wait for a city that gets roughly half its tourism revenue from American visitors.

“The American tourists matter,” Diodati said. “(Local businesses) are already planning for next (travel) season.”

Even if travel’s resurgence will take time, businesses have already started to see an uptick in demand.

Ann Marie Nitso, owner of the Old Stone Inn Boutique Hotel in Niagara Falls, said the hotel doubled its bookings shortly after the Canadian government announced the border reopening date. She estimates about 65% of the hotel’s business comes from American visitors.

“There’s been a lot of pent-up demand,” Nitso said. “I've been receiving reservations for the Christmas period. So people are definitely more confident now that the borders have reopened.”

Canada is easing travel restrictions for vaccinated Americans: Here are 10 things to know before a trip

Don Cleary, president of Marriott Hotels of Canada, said he has started to see “positive momentum” that he expects will continue through the remainder of the summer.

“With the announcement of the border reopening, we saw a much more significant increase (in international bookings),” Cleary said. “We are starting to see a future mix closer to 2019 levels … (and) we are seeing booking windows slowly lengthen into August, September, and October.”

Staffing shortages and supply chain issues

Dan Lehmann, owner of the Duck Bay Lodge near the Lake of the Woods, said his limited staff is rushing to get the fishing resort ready for business after sitting empty two years.

“The tough part is ... the fact that the supply chain is really interrupted,” he said. “Something as simple as getting some 2-inch nails at the hardware store, it’s not available. ... All the different little parts we use with boats and motors and running the lodge aren’t necessarily available like they used to be.”

Crossing the border:Canada Border Services Agency worker strike ends, promising a smoother flow to border traffic

Staffing is also a major issues for businesses. Nitso of the Old Stone Inn said her hotel has had to outsource housekeeping jobs for the first time due to a lack of workers.

“It’s something we never thought we’d have to do,” she said.

Hanif Harji, CEO of Scale Hospitality, which owns a number of restaurants in Toronto, said the company is already struggling to keep up with demand with its current staff size. Certain restaurants have had to close for lunches or one full day each week to make sure employees get time off.

“All (the lifting of restrictions) is going to do is add to the demand, but demand is outpacing supply today,” Harji said. “The tourism business is going to be great, but it’s also going to be very challenging for people to find reservations. Restaurants are being booked up two, three, four weeks in advance right now.”

Harji said he’s trying to increase staffing levels 30% to meet current demand levels.

“Even though the border may be opening Aug. 9, I think it’s going to take a couple of weeks to staffed up and ready to manage that kind of volume,” Harji said. But “in the long term, I think (the border reopening) is going to be great for business.”

The effects are seen in Quebec as well, where Michelle Doré runs three hotels: Hôtel Champlain, Hôtel Jardin SteAnne and Auberge Place d’Armes. She estimated the business is short-staffed by about 20% after many of her former staff members left the hospitality industry.

“We will have the pleasure of having (American tourists), but it’ll be ... challenging to give the best service that we give,” she said. “Maybe we’ll ask them when they come, can you be just a little patient or give us a little break? … The service will be there, but maybe a little bit longer.”

Home prices hit record highs in May, and the market is showing no immediate signs of slowing. With prices skyrocketing, retirees may be considering selling their homes to cash in.

But before you call a real estate agent and list your house on the market, it's important to consider whether that's really the right move.

Would retirees be smart to sell?

For many people, retirement is a great time to sell a home. Seniors may be ready to downsize, especially if their kids have left the nest and they are tired of the upkeep of a larger family home. Freedom from work also provides the opportunity to relocate, perhaps to a place that's more walkable or that has a lower cost of living or better tax rules for retirees.

Selling a home can also free up cash for seniors who might have too little retirement savings. If you have lots of equity in a house, you could cash that in and use it to fatten your retirement savings account – especially if you buy a less expensive new place. If you still have a mortgage, selling could also help you lower your housing costs.

If you're thinking about selling for any reason, this red-hot housing market presents a great opportunity. If you can sell now when home prices are up, you should hopefully be able to get a lot of money for your house. This would mean you could pad your investment accounts even more and potentially be left with a lot of extra money after paying off any remaining mortgage balance.

But while it is undoubtedly a good time to be a seller, it's important to remember that it may not be a good time to buy a home. So, if you are going to sell your home, you need to think about what will happen next.

If you sell at a great price and make a handsome profit but end up overpaying for a new house and have to take out a large mortgage loan, then are you really better off? This could be a big issue if you are relocating to a place where the housing market is especially crazy right now.

► 'The builder had sold 130 homes the first day': Foreign buyers may add to housing woes, prices

► Wall Street is buying neighborhoods: Is that bad?

There's also a relatively low inventory of homes for sale at this time. If you are looking for a specific type of property, such as one where you can age in place, then you may not be able to find it. And with lumber prices and the costs of other materials driving up the cost of brand new homes, you may not be able to build an affordable one either.

Of course, you don't necessarily have to buy a new home after selling your old one. You could rent for a while and wait for the market to cool off (or even rent indefinitely). But, again, you need to research the rental market and see if you can pay an affordable price for a property you're interested in. And if you're hoping for a market crash before you buy in again, you could end up waiting years – and spending much of your retirement living in limbo.

So before you decide to jump into selling because you're enticed by high home prices, think carefully about your next steps. If you can sell and find a place to live at a good price that you're comfortable with, then go ahead. But if you aren't confident of where you'll go after selling your home, then you may end up really regretting your choice.

NEW YORK – Starting Monday, Amazon will be requiring all of its 900,000 U.S. warehouse workers to wear masks indoors, regardless of their vaccination status.

The move follows steps by a slew of other retailers, including Walmart and Target, to require masks for their workers. In many of those cases the mandates apply to workers in locations of substantial COVID-19 transmission.

Amazon said Friday that its call for a nationwide mask mandate for its warehouse workers was in response to the spread of COVID-19 variants in the U.S., and guidance from public health authorities and its own medical experts. Amazon has been requiring only warehouse workers not vaccinated against COVID-19 wear masks.

Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said last week that rising coronavirus infections linked to the delta variant are pushing the company to get more workers vaccinated. It’s also working with local authorities on safety measures.

So far, Seattle-based Amazon has not required its employees to be vaccinated. But Disney and Walmart announced vaccine mandates for white-collar workers, and Microsoft, Google and Facebook said they will require proof of vaccination for employees and visitors to their U.S. offices.

Earlier this week, Tyson Foods announced it will require all U.S. employees to get vaccinated by November, becoming one of the first major employers of front-line workers to do so amid surging cases of the virus.

The U.S. economy is still down millions of jobs compared to the number that were available before the pandemic began. In spite of that, businesses across the country are now grappling with labor shortages.

In some industries, the problem is worse than others. Take hospitality, for instance. After being forced to shutter completely and then limit capacity, restaurants are finally getting the green light to fully reopen. Only many can't reopen in full because they don't have the staff needed to handle their usual volume.

For months, lawmakers have been pointing a finger at boosted unemployment as the reason behind these labor shortages. In March, jobless workers began receiving an extra $300 a week in their unemployment benefits. That provision came in conjunction with the $1,400 stimulus checks that have been hitting Americans' bank accounts for months.

Over the past weeks, many states have sought to end boosted benefits ahead of their early September expiration date. The logic was that pulling the plug on that extra financial incentive would motivate more people to go out and get jobs rather than fall back on a more generous unemployment check.

Given that a lot of people – particularly minimum wage workers – are collecting more money from unemployment than they would at a job, it's easy to see why many states have attempted to end that boost early.

But those extra benefits aren't the only thing keeping people from getting jobs. For low-income workers, child care costs can be a huge barrier to employment, eating up such a large chunk of their earnings that holding down a job isn't worth it.

Given the current labor shortages, companies are looking at creative ways to lure job applicants in. And that means some are offering up child care incentives to sweeten the deal.

► Child care amid coronavirus: When schools closed, women left the workforce

Throwing working parents a bone

Companies are already raising wages in an effort to attract more workers. But that alone may not be enough to overcome the child care barrier. As such, some companies are offering direct help with child care in the hopes that it will enable more people to join their ranks.

U.S. McDonald's restaurants, for example, are rolling out an emergency child care program. Other companies are offering parents a monthly stipend toward their child care bills.

In conjunction with child care benefits, some companies are also offering workers more flexibility in their schedules. The idea is not only to give working parents a better work-life balance, but to potentially shave down their child care costs by letting them work remotely or at hours that better align with their families' needs.

These incentives, along with the reopening of schools for the 2021-2022 academic year, may be enough to get a large number of parents back into the labor force with more balanced personal finances. And that would be a good thing for the economy. If businesses can't fully reopen, our economic progress will be limited at best. And at a time when we all want to move on from the pandemic, that just isn't ideal.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Give yourself a big pat on the back if you have built up a nice retirement nest egg after years of scrimping and saving.

Congratulations, you're halfway there.

Many investors are so focused on accumulating wealth that they neglect the second part of the equation – pulling out money so that you don't deplete it unnecessarily from poor tax decisions.

"We spend years or decades trying to put money into retirement plans," said Michael Kitces, a financial adviser at Kitces.com. "But how do you get the dollars out and do it in a tax-efficient manner?"

Social Security:5 things you need to know about Social Security spousal benefits

More:15% of workers are delaying retirement because of COVID-19. Should you follow suit?

That was the gist of a recent talk he gave to members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Here are some highlights:

Realize you're not as rich as you think

Millions of Americans have watched their retirement accounts balloon in value in recent years. But if a good chunk of your assets are held in traditional Individual Retirement Accounts or workplace 401(k)-style plans, you eventually will have to pay taxes on the balances. Hence, you're not as wealthy as you might assume.

Kitces provided this simple example: Suppose you hold $750,000 in unsheltered brokerage accounts and $750,000 in a traditional IRA. When you withdraw money from the IRA, you will pay ordinary income tax on it. If you figure a middle-range 24% federal tax rate, you really have $570,000 in the IRA and $180,000 in deferred tax liabilities, he said. Corporations have to account for this on their balance sheets, but individuals typically don't think about it in this manner.

"Really, you wouldn't have a $1.5 million portfolio," he said.

In fact, assets in the brokerage account likely would incur taxes, too. Even a relatively low capital-gain rate of 15% on withdrawals would put a further dent in your wealth.

Plan withdrawals while you have time

You might be tempted to stash away cash in retirement plans and forget about it until you must take Required Minimum Distributions in your early 70s. That would give your account even more time to grow, after all.

But this might not be the best way to go. If your account gets too big, you could trigger some nasty RMDs. You also would collect Social Security by then, and large retirement distributions could make some of your Social Security taxable.

Kitces said he often hears from upscale individuals that they're getting killed by RMD taxes in their 70s. "There's not much you can do about it now," he said he tells them. "But 10 years ago, we could have helped you."

Story continues below:

People in their 60s have a golden opportunity to start drawing down retirement money while limiting the tax bite. This opportunity is enhanced if you're not earning much job income and haven't claimed Social Security yet. People in this age group also don't need to worry about the 10% penalty that typically applies on retirement withdrawals made before age 59½.

"The goal is to have smaller IRAs by your 70s by whittling them down in your 60s," Kitces said.

Think in terms of tax-bracket 'buckets'

If you have money in traditional IRAs or 401(k) plans, you will pay taxes eventually. The goal is to pay those taxes at the lowest rates possible.

Americans currently pay federal income tax in seven brackets, where rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% apply. As you earn more, you're pushed into higher brackets. Along with job income and Social Security, retirement withdrawals can propel you up the scale. But you might have some spare capacity each year at relatively low rates.

For example, the 12% bracket ends at $40,525 in taxable income (after deductions and so on) for singles and $81,050 for married couples. Ideally, you'd want to take retirement withdrawals up to the point where you stay in the 12% bracket. Or, if you're wealthier, you'd want to withdraw as long as you stay in the 24% bracket. The next rate, 32%, starts at $164,926 in taxable income for singles and $329,851 for joint filers.

"The goal is to fill the lower-bracket buckets," without going over, Kitces said.

Kitces describes this strategy as an annual "use it or lose it opportunity" – and one that most people probably don't think about much. It's especially important not to jump from the 12% bracket to 22% or from 24% to 32%, as those are big increases, he noted.

State income taxes also can affect your withdrawal decisions, but federal taxes are the main concern.

Consider other tax strategies, too

In addition to timing withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans – an option most appropriate for people in their 60s – other tax-shaving strategies are worth knowing. For example, younger adults should consider investing in Roth IRAs and Roth-401(k)s. With these plans, withdrawals typically would come out tax-free, with no RMDs. The downside is that you can't deduct the money you contribute.

Another strategy, useful in taxable accounts, is to harvest losses and perhaps even gains. Harvesting refers to realizing losses or gains earlier than you might otherwise to minimize taxes. For example, you can harvest losses to help offset any gains incurred in the same year. If your losses exceed your gains, you can deduct the excess up to $3,000 annually, carrying forward unused amounts to future years.

You also might want to convert money from traditional IRAs to a Roth. You'd need to pay taxes now on the amount converted, but future withdrawals would come out tax-free. Again, you'd want to manage this so that the increase in taxable income doesn't push you into a noticeably higher bracket.

"Should you convert everything to a Roth now? No," Kitces said. "You'd blast yourself to the top bracket."

Hold investments accordingly

It's worth noting that some assets are best held in certain types of accounts.

For example, Kitces said, investments with high growth potential that throw off little in the way of ongoing taxable distributions, such as index funds pegged to the Standard & Poors' 500 or non-dividend growth stocks, often work best in unsheltered brokerage accounts. With these, it's possible the only taxes that might apply would be on long-term capital gains.

Conversely, investments that are less tax-efficient often are best held in traditional IRAs. These might include high-yield bond funds or emerging-market stock funds that do a lot of internal trading (spinning off taxable gains or dividends along the way).

As for bonds, bond funds and money-market funds, Kitces argued that these can be held pretty much anywhere. This wasn't always the case, as most fixed-income investments are tax-inefficient, traditionally making them suitable for sheltered accounts.

But after the decades-long slump in interest rates, fixed-income yields aren't high enough to compound significantly. "It doesn't matter much what account you put them in," he said.

McDonald’s said the meal will be served in "icy new packaging inspired by her own style."

The meal will be available to order in restaurants, the drive-thru, with McDelivery and on the McDonald’s app using contactless mobile order and pay.

McDonald’s said the meal's price will vary based on location.

Before the collaboration with Scott last fall, the chain hasn't had a celebrity meal or "McDonald's Famous Order" in nearly 30 years when it partnered with Michael Jordan in 1992 for the McJordan. Scott's meal led to shortages of key ingredients across the nation.

In October, McDonald's had the J Balvin Meal with the award-winning reggaeton artist and the BTS Meal was available globally this summer.

McDonald's is requiring masks again for customers and employees in areas with high COVID transmission.

McDonald’s ‘Saweetstakes’ contest

McDonald’s announced Monday that it is giving fans the chance to win two limited-edition handbags – one for them and one for their best friend – from Brandon Blackwood, one of Saweetie’s favorite bag designers, along with a five-day trip to Las Vegas for two to see her perform.

Through Sept. 5, order the meal in the McDonald’s app to be entered for a chance to win the prize worth $9,175. The winner will be selected randomly.

Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) is a global facilitator of travel. Therefore, it was no surprise that its business was devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, partly because of restrictions on cross-border travel, and partly because people were hesitant to get on planes or trains.

Fortunately, several effective vaccines have been developed against COVID-19, and that's leading governments and countries to ease business and travel restrictions. However, the spread of the highly contagious delta variant is giving people pause in the midst of reopening. And the Biden administration has announced it is keeping foreign travel restrictions in place for the time being.

Cross-border travel was a big part of the business

The extension of travel restrictions is concerning for Airbnb because nearly half the nights booked on its platform before the pandemic were for cross-border, or international, travel. Company management has been hoping for a recovery in the segment as the world gets vaccinated, but it seems it will have to wait a little while longer.

Specifically, restrictions on travel to and from the U.S. are likely to affect Airbnb more than any other country's restrictions. Travelers in the U.S. collectively spend more on their trips than travelers in other countries. And stays in the U.S. cost more per day than stays in many other countries.

Moreover, when full-scale travel returns, it's going to look very different. According to CEO Brian Chesky, people will travel more broadly, stay longer than they used to, and are generally more flexible than before the pandemic. Those are all areas Airbnb is focusing on and intends to excel in as consumers prepare to take long-delayed trips.

In the meantime, travel between cities is picking up the slack from cross-border travel. People prefer to get in their cars and travel someplace close for a little rest and relaxation. Undoubtedly, that was a factor in pushing Airbnb's revenue back up above its levels before the pandemic.

Eventually, cross-border restrictions will be lifted, and that will be a boon for Airbnb. Chesky said as much: "So I think that as restrictions lift in countries, as vaccinations rise, we think this is a significant tailwind to both urban travel and cross-border travel."

What this could mean for investors

The company is preparing for an epic rebound in travel worldwide. There is likely pent-up demand for travel in areas that have had been restricted to travelers both inbound and outbound. After all, the pandemic forced cancellations of all kinds of travel, and not just vacations.

Airbnb is investing in a campaign to bring more hosts to the platform, make listing properties easier, and add features that will persuade travelers to be flexible in their destination and date requirements. It all should lead to a more robust offering from Airbnb for guests and hosts as the rebound in travel progresses.

Folks were already looking to Airbnb over hotels on some occasions because it offers greater convenience and variety. Airbnb is enhancing its businesses to capitalize on those advantages even further. The extension on travel restrictions could be an opportunity for long-term investors to get in on the stock before the recovery in travel accelerates.

Serenade Foods is recalling nearly 60,000 pounds of frozen and raw chicken products for possible salmonella contamination.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the Milford, Indiana company's voluntary recall on its website late Monday.

Five products are included in the recall under three brand names: Dutch Farms Chicken, Milford Valley Chicken and Kirkwood, which is an Aldi store brand. The items were shipped to distributors nationwide, but a list of the retailers that sold the affected products was not included with the recall notice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in early June that it was investigating a multistate outbreak of salmonella illnesses, which the federal agency linked to raw, frozen, breaded, stuffed chicken products. The USDA also issued a public health alert June 2.

The CDC updated its food safety alert Wednesday and said there have been 28 illnesses in eight states: Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and New York.

Illinois has had nine illnesses, New York seven, Indiana and Minnesota four each, and the rest of the states have each had one case as of Wednesday, according to the CDC update. There have been 11 hospitalizations.

The frozen, raw, breaded and pre-browned, stuffed chicken items were produced on Feb. 24 and Feb. 25 and include the establishment number “P- 2375” inside the USDA mark of inspection.

"The products of concern may appear to be ready-to-eat but are in fact raw and need to be fully cooked according to the manufacturer cooking instructions on the package before consumption," the recall notice said. "The labels for these products identify cooking instructions for preparation in an oven. The products should not be prepared in the microwave or air fryer."

Most people who get ill from salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps six hours to six days after being exposed to the bacteria, according to the CDC. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.

In July, Tyson chicken recalled nearly 9 million pounds of frozen and cooked chicken products. Other products recalled in July include Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreen, muffins, carrots, select McCormick seasonings and dog food.

Pepsi is teaming with Boston Beer Co., which makes Truly Hard Seltzer and Samuel Adams beers, on "HARD MTN DEW," a new flavored malt beverage (5% alcohol by volume) to hit the market in early 2022, the companies said Tuesday.

Coming in three flavors – original, black cherry and watermelon – the new drinks will have no caffeine or sugar and will be "marketed to adults of legal age and merchandized consistently with other alcohol beverages," the companies said. A fourth flavor will be announced soon, too.

Boston Beer will make "HARD MTN DEW" and Pepsi will create a new division to sell and deliver the beverages.

This isn't the first collaboration between breweries and soda makers. Last year, Coca-Cola teamed with Molson Coors to bring Topo Chico Hard Seltzer to market in the U.S. earlier this year.

The ready-to-drink cocktails market – including hard seltzers – is big and was the sole alcohol beverage category to grow last year, reaching $30.5 billion worldwide, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. The ready-to-drink cocktails market is expected to grow 27% in volume worldwide this year, too, IWSR estimates, and account for about 10% of the total U.S. alcohol market.

Not every hard seltzer is a winner – Molson Coors quit making its Coors Seltzer earlier this summer.

Boston Beer was an early entrant in the seltzer market, launching Truly in 2016. Earlier this year, Truly began selling a new hard seltzer variety pack with new flavors: fruit punch, berry punch, tropical punch and citrus punch.

"We know that adult drinkers' tastes are evolving, and they are looking for new and exciting flavorful beverages," said Boston Beer CEO Dave Burwick in a statement. "The combination of our experience in brewing and developing the best-tasting hard seltzers and hard teas, and MTN DEW, a one of kind multibillion dollar brand, will deliver the excitement and refreshment that drinkers know and love."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fans of Goose Island Beer Co.'s bourbon-barrel aged original Bourbon County Brand Stout and other twists on stouts have some new treats awaiting them this Black Friday.

The Chicago-based brewery, acquired by Anheuser-Busch a decade ago, releases a lineup of aged beers annually and this year's releases include some potentially sweet surprises. Of course, there's the flagship Bourbon County Stout, which weighs in at about 14% alcohol by volume, which is aged in for eight to 14 months in barrels from Heaven Hill, Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace distilleries.

Bourbon County Stout, which typically sells for $13 or more, is usually the most easily found at beer retailers nationwide upon release each November. It serves as the base for the other imperial stouts in the lineup, one of which stands out, based on its description: the Bourbon County Classic Cola Stout. Goose Island's brewers used ingredients such as lime, orange zest and orange juice, coriander, cassia bark, nutmeg, brown sugar, and vanilla to create the cola character.

“Cola is such a familiar flavor. Our biggest challenge was getting all of the ingredients to taste like cola, not nine individual things,” said Jason Krasowski, who teamed with fellow Goose Island brewer Paul Cade on the beer, in a statement.

"In the end, this BCS variant has all the depth and complexity that you might expect from blending nine ingredients into our beautiful BCS base, while, surprisingly, being as refreshing as your favorite cola brand! We hope you enjoy drinking it as much as we enjoyed making it," they said.

“This year, Bourbon County Stout fans are sure to be excited by some of the more unique flavor profiles we created with innovative techniques, like Bourbon County Cherry Wood Stout," said Keith Gabbett, Goose Island's senior innovation manager, in a statement.

Beyond Goose Island's own pronouncements, there's certainly reason to be optimistic about the quality of the 2021 releases, says Josh Noel, who is also the author of "Barrel-Aged Stout and Selling Out: Goose Island, Anheuser-Busch, and How Craft Beer Became Big Business."

That's because the beers from 2020 were so good, he said in the Chicago Tribune. "A handful of last year’s Bourbon County beers had no right to work – they were meant to evoke caramel apple or were made with tea – but they did work, mostly because, like any great thing we eat or drink, they showed balance and nuance," he said.

Its a situation many of us have landed in. You're reviewing your monthly credit card statement when you spot a charge you don't recognize. Your first instinct may be to contact your credit card company and initiate a dispute right away. But before you do, there may be a better solution.

Contact the merchant

When you dispute a credit card charge, you're not required to pay for the item or service in question while your credit card company conducts its investigation. If the dispute resolves in your favor, the matter is done with -- the charge will get removed from your account completely and you can move on.

If your dispute is denied, then the charge in question will be added back to your credit card balance, and you'll be required to pay it. However, before that happens, you'll be given an opportunity to get an explanation from your credit card company as to why your dispute was denied, and you'll also have a chance to appeal that decision. If your appeal doesn't work out, though, then you may get stuck having to pay for the item or service in question.

Credit card disputes can take time to resolve, during which you may be worried and on edge. Now the good news is that a disputed charge won't have a negative impact on your credit score in any way. But still, it can be frustrating having to wait weeks for an answer on whether you'll be on the hook for a disputed charge or not.

► Credit card spending limits: Should you ask for an increase if you don't need it?

That's why it generally pays to contact the merchant the disputed charge has stemmed from before involving your credit card issuer. The merchant may be willing to investigate the matter directly or even, in some cases, remove the charge right off the bat, thereby resolving the issue quickly.

Say you see a charge on your credit card for a $100 sweater you never bought. If you contact the merchant and explain that you believe your credit card number was stolen, the merchant may just reverse the charge and deal with that fraudulent matter on its end without involving you.

Similarly, it may be the case that your credit card was charged for a recurring service or subscription you cancelled long ago. In that case, contacting the merchant in question could lead to a quick resolution. The merchant might look up your account details, note the cancellation, and get rid of the charge, which may have been automatically generated by mistake to begin with.

Remember, credit card disputes can be a hassle for merchants, too, so it's often in their best interest to resolve them easily. The next time you see a charge on your credit card statement that looks downright wrong, don't get worked up about it. But also, don't rush to dispute it without contacting the merchant first. A firm but friendly phone call on your part could nip the matter in the bud. That way, you don't have to worry about an erroneous or fraudulent charge hanging over your head.

Special to USA TODAY

Johnny C. Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, is tackling your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.

The questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers below have been edited for length and clarity.

Have a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you’d like me to answer? Submit it here.

Question: Should I disclose my depression struggles when an interviewer asked about my gaps in employment?

I have a significant gap in employment based on my struggles with depression. Recruiters seem to pass me over when I reveal this. Over the past few years, I struggled to find consistent work in my career field. Should I consider not sharing this truth about my employment gaps? – Sophie

Johnny C. Taylor Jr.: While it may be beyond frustrating, you are certainly not alone. According to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America, depression affects more than 16 million Americans. With the pandemic languishing, many employers are becoming increasingly aware and empathetic to mental health issues. Though, I understand how difficult it can be to secure a job when you have employment gaps on your résumé.

You aren’t obligated to disclose your struggles with depression in an interview. In fact, I would recommend against it. Instead, focus on the job, why you are a good fit for the position and your value to the organization.

When you’re interviewing, honesty is always the best policy. However, you can explain any gaps in employment, without going into detail about your depression. For example, you could explain that you were dealing with an illness and had to take time off temporarily, and now you’re reinvigorated and primed to reenter the workforce. Play up your relevant strengths and demonstrate how you positively impacted your previous employers.

I’ll add: Until you reestablish your career footing, perhaps embrace taking a temporary assignment as a trial employment. It would give you an opportunity to assert your value and to evaluate your fit within the company.

Finally, when talking to recruiters consider putting a positive spin on the gaps in employment. Share what you did during employment gaps to gain knowledge or experience in your career field. Were you able to volunteer during your breaks in employment? Or did you complete any coursework or training related to your career field during that time? Sharing these activities will show that you were still working, even if it wasn’t in a traditional sense of the word.

Best wishes in your career search.

Child care:Should I ask my employer for help if I can't find a facility? Ask HR

Back to the office:Will dress codes relax when we return? Ask HR

Q: During the pandemic initially, I lost my job, and my car broke down. I sold it because I couldn’t afford the repairs and insurance. I eventually got hired for remote work, but now the company is returning to the office. I don't make enough to buy a reliable car yet. Since I have never worked in the office for this employer, can I ask my employer for a cost of living raise to return to the office? Or an extension of remote work authorization? – Earl

Taylor: You’re probably not the only one facing this type of dilemma. So, thanks for asking it. However, there are several alternatives to consider before approaching your employer for a cost of living raise or an extension of remote work.

I would start by exploring other commuting options such as public transportation or carpooling. Depending on where you live there may be feasible van pools or options. Additionally, your employer may offer commuter benefits toward public transportation costs. Going further, some employers offer an internal company program where employees can connect regarding ride-sharing arrangements.

If you can’t nail down a viable transportation solution, then reach out to your employer. Be forthright about your situation. Many employers have become more flexible, in response to the pandemic, as it relates to aiding their employees. Ask your employer if they have an emergency loan assistance program, or if there is an option to get an advance on your pay.

If your position continues to be one that may be performed successfully remotely, your employer may also be opened to continuing remote work. Remain open-minded and flexible as you search for a commuting solution.

I’ll say this: While cost of living increases have been provided by employers in the past, it has become less common. Many employers strive to make their pay competitive, and this type of increase is not typically associated with transportation assistance. So, you must be extremely careful about how you approach this conversation with your manager. As a relatively new employee, your manager could perceive your request to be a sign that you are going to be a “high-maintenance” employee and could sour on you quickly.

Proceed cautiously. Good luck!

Though the eviction ban is back on, it doesn't apply to everyone: just those in areas with the highest risk for COVID transmission. In other parts of the country, landlords are free to evict nonpaying tenants as usual. Still, it's not the only option landlords have.

Are you dealing with nonpaying tenants on your rental property? There are other choices – and many could mean recouping some (or even all) of that back rent. So, consider one of these six alternatives instead before you move to evict a tenant for failing to pay rent.

► The latest: Biden administration issues targeted moratorium on evictions for areas hit hardest by COVID-19

1. File for rental assistance

The government has devoted billions to the Emergency Rental Assistance program, which offers funds to struggling tenants across the country. Funds can be used toward back rent, future rent and overdue utilities. Both tenants and landlords can apply.

2. Work out a payment plan

Give your tenant the chance to pay up – in a manageable way – by proposing some sort of payment plan. Just total up the rent they owe, divide it into biweekly installments for the next two to three months, and ask them to set up automatic payments to your account. (Biweekly is best, as that's when most people get paid).

3. Offer credit card payments

Letting your tenants pay their back rent via credit card is another potential solution. It's not the ideal way for most tenants to pay, as it racks up serious interest, but for some people, it might be worth it if they can stay in their house.

4. Negotiate a reduced rent

Clearly, accepting less than you're actually owed isn't fun, but if it means the difference between collecting zero rent and having at least a few hundred in the bank. It might be worth it – especially when faced with the legal costs of eviction. It's a particularly smart choice if you know the tenant's lease is ending soon anyway.

5. Bring in a mediator

Getting a professional mediator involved is another option to consider. In this scenario, you'd both sit down with an independent, third-party mediator to discuss both the situation and some potential solutions. They may propose a payment plan, some sort of move-out timeline, or another option that's more desirable than eviction – for both of you.

6. Offer cash for keys

If you know you can re-rent the property quickly and want that tenant gone fast, you might consider the cash-for-keys approach. With this one, you offer the tenant a sum of money to hand over their keys and leave the property.

It sounds crazy (paying the tenant when they haven't even paid you!), but considering how time-consuming and expensive eviction can get, it's often the most efficient solution.

The Millionacres bottom line

Evictions may be allowed in some areas, but they're not always the best -- or the most affordable -- option for a landlord. Make sure you consider alternatives before filing for eviction, and always talk with a local real estate attorney, too. They can give you an idea of how long evictions take in your area and what they may cost to execute.

Unfair Advantages: How Real Estate Became a Billionaire Factory

Offer from the Motley Fool: You probably know that real estate has long been the playground for the rich and well connected, and that according to recently published data it's also been the best performing investment in modern history. And with a set of unfair advantages that are completely unheard of with other investments, it's no surprise why.

But those barriers have come crashing down – and now it's possible to build REAL wealth through real estate at a fraction of what it used to cost, meaning the unfair advantages are now available to individuals like you.

If you've been keeping tabs on the housing market at all, you may be aware that right now, there's a major shortage of available homes for sale. Throw in the fact that mortgage rates are very competitive, and it's not surprising that bidding wars have become extremely commonplace among buyers.

In a bidding war, two or more prospective home buyers keep outbidding each other on the same property in the hopes of getting its seller to accept their respective offers. Bidding wars can be extremely frustrating for everyone involved – even more so when you lose one – so it pays to enter them strategically. Here are a few signs that getting involved in a bidding war makes sense.

1. The sale price is competitive to begin with

In today's red-hot real estate market, a lot of homes are being listed at sky-high prices. But if you find a home you like with a reasonable listing price, then it may be worth entering a bidding war, especially if the asking price in question is well below the top end of your price range.

Imagine you're able to spend up to $500,000 on a home and you see a great property listed at $475,000. At that point, even if you enter a bidding war and wind up having to pay an extra $20,000 in the process, you're within your financial comfort zone as far as cost goes.

► Foreign buyers are snapping up U.S. homes again: Here's why that could mean trouble for all buyers

2. The home checks off all the right boxes

If you find a home that you can take or leave, then it's not worth putting yourself through a bidding war in the hopes of calling it your own. On the other hand, if you manage to find a home that's really perfect for you – it has the right layout, number of bedrooms, and features you want – then that may be a home worth fighting for.

This especially holds true in today's market. Since inventory is so limited, you might really struggle to find a home that meets your requirements – so a home that does is one you shouldn't give up on so easily.

3. There's only one other potential buyer as far as you know

Entering a bidding war with multiple buyers could be a harrowing process, and one you may want to avoid. But if it's only you and one other buyer, that's a different story. At that point, the process of bidding on the same home may not be all that prolonged, so it could pay to go up against that buyer and see if you can get that person to back down.

Bidding wars have become very common in today's housing market, but there's no rule stating that you have to enter one. That said, if you are going to enter a bidding war on a home, do so strategically and heed the advice of your real estate agent. The last thing you want to do is get stuck paying too much for a home, so be careful when doing your bidding and know when to walk.

When my husband and I set out to sell our old home a little over a decade ago, we met with a series of real estate agents before settling on the person who eventually helped us through the process. We knew that choosing the right agent could spell the difference between a higher profit on our home and a lower one, and also the difference between a smooth process and a rocky one.

If you're looking to sell your home, it's important to find the right agent for the job. Here are some questions that can help you make the best call.

1. How well do you know this area?

In the course of hiring a real estate agent, many people tend to focus on years of experience on the job. But while having experience is important, what's even more essential is experience selling homes in your specific neighborhood. It's a good idea to work with someone who knows the ins and outs of the local market and can help you pinpoint the right listing price.

2. How many clients are you working with now?

If a real estate agent barely has a handful of clients, that could be a red flag. On the other hand, you don't want to hire a real estate agent with too many clients, because if that person is juggling several dozen people at once, it means you may not get the personal attention you want when you're selling a home. There's no specific sweet spot to aim for, though, and you may find an agent who has a hefty client load, but also a robust support staff to manage it. That, too, can and should play a role in your decision.

3. How long of a contract must I sign?

In today's housing market, homes are selling fairly quickly. But that doesn't mean your listing won't sit out there for a while. And if that happens due to poor marketing on the part of your real estate agent, you'll want an out. Before you sign a contract, ask your agent how much time you're required to give them to sell your home. You may be told that you need to give your agent a good three months before being able to switch to someone else.

4. What commission do you charge?

Real estate agents work on commission, but their fees can vary. As a general rule, you should expect your agent's commission to be somewhere in the ballpark of 4% to 6% of your home's sale price. This means that if your home sells for $400,000, you'll pay your agent $16,000 to $24,000. If an agent quotes you a higher fee, you may want to look elsewhere, though you can always ask if that agent is willing to negotiate. The lower your fee, the more money you'll have to put toward your next home – which could, in turn, leave you with a lower mortgage to take out.

Selling a home is a major undertaking, and one that will have a huge impact on your finances. Run through these questions before hiring a real estate agent so you wind up happy with your decision.

Workers with longer commutes were reported to receive the highest pay cuts. Reuters found that an employee living in Stamford, Connecticut, an hour from Google's New York office, would be paid 15% less working from home, but a colleague living in New York would see no cut.

Another Google employee chose to make a two-hour commute to the Seattle office instead of a 10% pay cut for working from home full-time.

An employee working in the New York City office will be paid just as much as someone working remotely in the same area, a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

"Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from," a Google spokesperson told Reuters.

Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecuiter, said companies cutting wages for remote workers may see a decrease in employee retention.

"Culturally, we're seeing a rise in pay transparency, and people feel very strongly that it's not fair to be paid different amounts for the same work and for the same quality output of work," Pollak told USA TODAY.

Pollak noted reports indicating remote work is here to stay and employees are willing to quit and find work elsewhere if it's taken away. She said changing the salary for an employee is difficult to do regardless of location.

Although remote work comes with fewer costs, such as gas for commutes, employees will argue the quality of their work hasn't changed, so their pay shouldn't either, Pollak said. She said the rise in remote working changed economics: Companies pay employees based on the value of their work, not their location.

"The companies that say that they will pay people the same, regardless of the personal choices they make about whether to live out of their cars or out of mansions, will have the upper hand," Pollak said. "Pay cuts for remote work will not be received well."

Google did not answer a request for comment by USA TODAY.

One of the great promises of the internet for small businesses was that it was going to eliminate the “middle man” – intermediaries between sellers and customers. Manufacturers could sell directly to end users instead of stores; retailers could stay in touch with customers frequently.

All that is true – but what is also true is that the internet created a new kind of intermediary: platforms.

You almost certainly already use platforms – at least as a customer. There’s Amazon for goods, Doordash or Postmates for food deliveries, Uber or Lyft for rides, Upwork or TaskRabbit for small jobs. The list goes on and on.

Platforms offer many positives for small businesses. A freelancer who develops WordPress websites, for example, might have had a terrible time getting clients in their small Midwest town, can now reach clients all over the world through a platform such as Upwork, Guru, or Fiverr.

► Starting a business? Check whether you signed a noncompete agreement at your old job

Platforms, at their best, deliver:

New customers: They reach people who’d never know about you

They reach people who’d never know about you More customers: They reach customers far away from you

They reach customers far away from you Infrastructure and support: They help you figure out how to bill customers and get your products and services to them

They help you figure out how to bill customers and get your products and services to them Guarantees: in a few cases, they take the risk of the customer not paying, being dissatisfied, or provide insurance

But platforms are also a trap for small businesses. They typically:

Own the customer

Take a high percent of the sales price

Require you to follow their rules, which can be costly

Require you to assume all costs other than marketing

Allow your competitors to advertise to your customers

Compete against you

Here’s a typical scenario: a customer goes on a platform – let’s say Amazon. They’re looking for your product and put your company’s name and product in Amazon’s search bar. Do your company and product come up first in the customer’s search? No, not unless you pay an advertising fee.

Instead, there will be an ad for competitors above your result, and in some cases, a product made by Amazon and sold for less money instead. Even if the customer buys your product, Amazon takes a big chunk of the sale and ‘owns’ the customer – you may never get their name and contact info.

So here's how to survive Amazon and other platforms, whether you use them or they’re just your biggest competitor:

Avoid them. If you can be successful without using one of these platforms to reach enough customers, don’t use them. You’ll be far more profitable without a platform. Many large, well-known brands no longer sell on Amazon.

Capture your customers' names and contact. Do EVERYTHING – and I mean everything – you can to actually get your customers' names and contact info so that you can market to them directly. For example, if your restaurant delivers meals through a platform such as DoorDash, include slips of paper with discounts if customers join your mailing list and order directly from you.

Get off those platforms as fast as you can. If you started on a platform but have built a loyal customer base, see how you can start transitioning to dealing directly with customers. If, for instance, you found new customers for your dog-walking service on Rover.com, see if you can get those customers to refer their friends to you directly.

Retain your best – and most profitable – stuff or services to sell directly rather than through platforms. If you’re a manufacturer, you may have two or three lines of products. Keep your best products off Amazon and other platforms and sell through more profitable channels or directly to customers.

Market so customers can find you directly. Use social media and good old search engines to help customers find – and buy – directly from you rather than through platforms.

Find a niche. If you have a specialty, you’ll be easier to find and you’ll develop more loyal customers.

Become a destination. If you have a brick-and-mortar location, find ways to offer some kind of “entertainment” value. Hold lessons, parties, speakers – anything to draw customers in.

Have a social mission. And let customers know they’re helping that mission by buying directly from you. No one feels a sense of pride in doing business with Amazon. Give customers a reason to feel good about doing business with you and make it part of your company story.

Work together. The independent store across the street is not your big competitor, so work with them on local events and discounts and other activities to remind customers that you are a vital part of the fabric of your community.

Finally, help spread the word to “shop small, shop local.” Because it’s “buy local” or “bye-bye local.” Every one of us has to be an ambassador for buying from small and local businesses – even if you sometimes buy online.

Spread the message: Amazon and other platforms should be your last resort, not your first choice.

Let's talk exit strategies. Thinking about leaving one of those platforms mentioned above? Rhonda Abrams is hosting a free webinar on how to do it on Tuesday at 11 a.m. EDT. Join the conversation and get advice about your situation.

When does Starbucks release its Pumpkin Spice Latte in 2021? The coffee giant hasn't announced a date.

Pumpkin spice cup noodles will be released in late October at select Walmart stores.

Pumpkin spice season is returning to Dunkin' earlier than ever before.

The fall menu will be available at participating Dunkin’ restaurants nationwide by Aug. 18, the chain announced Wednesday. It features the new Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and returning Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte, pumpkin-flavored coffee, donuts, muffins and Munchkins donut holes.

Dunkin's seasonal menu also features the Apple Cider Donut and two new drinks: Apple Cranberry Dunkin’ Refresher and Apple Cranberry Dunkin’ Coconut Refresher.

Donald Olhausen Jr., a 34-year-old real estate flipper in San Diego, did a major home remodeling project on his 2,200-square-foot Mediterranean-style home in 2018.

“We completely renovated the kitchen and bathrooms, replaced carpet, upgraded electrical and plumbing fixtures, and did carpentry work on the interior and exterior of the house,” says Olhausen. “We also added sod and new fencing to the front yard to help with curb appeal.”

The project was quite an undertaking, but more than worth it for Olhausen and his wife, Gabrielle, 25. To pay for the renovation, Olhausen, who was sole owner of the home at the time, borrowed $25,000 from his future father-in-law.

“It was risky because I had only known him less than a year, and he was going out on a limb for me,” he says. “It was definitely worth it because the house looks beautiful.” Olhausen has since repaid his father-in-law in full.

►Home project guide? What projects should you tackle first?

►Buying a home? Use tools like Google Earth, LinkedIn and mortgage calculators

The professional house flipper opted not to refinance his home mortgage or get a home equity line of credit (HELOC) because he wanted to save on interest and avoid paying a higher monthly mortgage payment. He also didn’t want the loan on his credit report.

“Even if you don’t use all of the money from a HELOC, you have access to it,” says Olhausen. “Therefore, credit bureaus will show you have borrowed that money, affecting your debt-to-income ratio.”

In its 2021 U.S. Houzz & Home Study, Houzz found that home renovation has grown 15% to a median of $15,000 over the past year, with kitchens, outdoor spaces, and home offices receiving the most attention.

Before you get caught up in the excitement of choosing fixtures and picking paint colors, take the time to figure out your financing options. Here are five of the most common ways to pay for home improvements.

Cash

Paying in cash means you can afford the purchases you’re making without having to fret over paying back high-interest debt. If you have a large sum of cash in a savings account gaining little interest, consider putting it to better use. “Because of inflation and the rising cost of goods, the purchasing power of a banked stockpile of cash continues to decrease over time,” says Samuel Eberts, a junior partner and financial advisor with Dugan Brown, a firm specializing in federal retirements, in Dublin, Ohio. He recommends saving at least six months’ of expenses for emergencies. “Beyond that, the money could be used for home renovations, rather than sitting idly in the bank,” says Eberts.

►Just bought a home? What projects should you tackle first?

►Buying a home? Use tools like Google Earth, LinkedIn and mortgage calculators

Credit cards

Homeowner Olhausen also placed $5,000 of his renovation expenses on a credit card.

“That was my only option,” Olhausen says. “I would normally advise not to do so because interest rates will eat you alive.” Financing a home renovation project on a credit card is a bit of a double-edged sword, says Eberts. While many cards offer zero interest for a certain period of time, Eberts advises paying off the debt before that introductory period ends. Otherwise, you will be charged the regular annual percentage rate on the unpaid balance.

Home equity loans

A home equity loan, which is a type of loan that allows you to borrow against the equity in your home, may be a wise move given the low interest rates on the market. As of early August 2021, the average home equity loan rate was 5.35% APR, according to Bankrate.com.

“Mortgage rates are at record lows, so for a homeowner sitting on a pile of equity, a cash-out refinance is likely your lowest cost of borrowing,” says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “Many homeowners stand to benefit by refinancing anyway, and pulling cash out at that time could be the ticket to paying for large repairs or renovations.”

You typically need to have 15% to 20% equity in your home to qualify for this type of loan, according to Bankrate.com. Keep in mind with a home equity loan, you’ll be taking on more debt and using your home as collateral. Adds Eberts: “Essentially, your home is on the line if you cannot afford the monthly payments.” Plus, you’ll have to pay closing costs and fees, therefore, make sure you understand all of the requirements of the loan.

►Mortgage rates:Despite low-interest rates, not all homeowners are refinancing. Should you refinance now?

HELOCs

A HELOC is a line of credit secured by your home that gives you a revolving credit line to use for large remodeling projects. The HELOC offers a great deal of flexibility related to how you borrow and repay the money, says McBride. If a project needs to be completed in phases, you can borrow the money as needed, “and make minimum, interest-only payments when money is tight,” he says.

But consumers should also be aware of the risks associated with this financial product.

Because HELOCS use your property as collateral, you could find yourself in danger of foreclosure if you fall behind on payments. In addition, these loans act as second mortgage payments; therefore, you’ll be making two mortgage payments each month. What’s more, the interest on these loans is variable."

“A cash-out refinance offers the certainty of a fixed-interest rate and monthly payment,” says McBride. “But a HELOC carries a variable interest rate that would rise along with interest rates, and, after 10 years, convert to a repayment phase with higher monthly payments.”

HUD Title I loans

Title I loans are a good option for homeowners with a modest income level. On a single home, the maximum loan amount is $25,000 and varies for other types of homes, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development requirements. “They are not intended to make luxurious or fancy upgrades such as installing a pool,” says Eberts. “HUD I Title loans are to be used to make a home more liveable.”

For example, some homeowners apply for these loans to improve the accessibility of a home for people with disabilities, which may include adding a ramp or widening doorways, Eberts explains.

These loans are issued by private lenders but backed by the government. Most lenders require the borrower to use their home as collateral for loans amounts above $7,500. For more info, visit Hud.gov.

Using credit cards wisely can be a great thing. Smart credit card use can help you to improve your credit score, which makes future borrowing easier and cheaper. Many cards also offer generous rewards, so you can actually earn free trips or even cash back just for your routine everyday spending.

The key, however, is that cards are a good thing if they are used wisely. Unfortunately, they can also be detrimental to your personal finances if you make mistakes when using them. In particular, there are three big errors to watch out for.

1. Maxing out your credit cards

Maxing out your cards means charging up to the limit that the cardholder set for you. For example, if you have a $5,000 line of credit and you charge $4,999 on your card, you've maxed out your cards.

There are a few reasons why maxing out your credit cards could be a big mistake. You could find yourself with a balance that is really difficult to repay, for one thing. But a maxed out card can also do serious damage to your credit score.

In fact, using more than 30% of the credit available to you can actually reduce your score. That's because credit utilization ratio is one of the most important factors that credit reporting agencies and lenders look at.

Maxing out your card also puts you at risk of over-the-limit fees if you happen to exceed the amount you're permitted to spend. And you won't have available credit in case you need it.

To avoid this mistake: Cap the amount you spend on your cards and stay well below that all-important 30% threshold.

2. Paying only the minimum due

Credit card companies set really low minimum payments. They benefit when you pay only the minimum required because your payment will generally just barely cover the interest costs. You'll end up paying on your balance for years and years, making little progress in paying down your credit card debt -- despite diligently sending in a check every single month. Over time, you can end up paying tens of thousands of dollars in unnecessary interest charges.

To avoid this mistake: Pay more than the minimum every month. Ideally, the best thing to do is to pay off your entire balance in full when you get your statement so you never end up owing any interest at all. If that's not possible, send in as much as you can with each payment so you can bring your balance down quickly and avoid getting stuck in a debt trap where your hard-earned cash is sucked away due to interest charges.

3. Missing payments

When you miss making credit card payments you get hit with fees in most cases. But you will also damage your credit score. Once a payment is at least 30 days late, credit card companies will report it to the major credit bureaus. Even one missed payment could reduce your score dramatically and a history of missed payments could make it very difficult and expensive to get any type of loan.

To avoid this mistake: Set up autopay if you can. Or, if you are worried you'll overdraft your bank account, set a calendar reminder instead to make sure you pay your bill before the deadline.

If you can avoid missed payments, falling into the minimum payment trap, or maxing out your cards, you are well on your way to using credit cards successfully to help improve your financial situation.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New to the stock market? Here’s what you need to know to make money from your investment

Before jumping into the market, here’s what first-time investors should know about stocks, capital gains and mistakes to avoid.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Time to check those bank accounts. More money was scheduled to be heading to families Friday for the August payment of the advance child tax credit.

Millions of households woke up Friday to see the money in their accounts — just like they did on July 15.

But others hit social media Friday morning in shock and wondering: What happened? Where's my money? Where's that extra $250 or $300 for each child for August?

For some, it could seem that the IRS's Friday drop date is looking like the release date for Kanye West's upcoming "Donda" album, which is facing more delays in August. You just never know when this one is hitting for some families. Maybe the money will get there before the album.

Troubled taxpayers on social media Friday couldn't understand why they were looking at a longer wait than expected to receive their cash.

"Got last month's DD no problem," one said. "This month's says it will be mailed. Ugh."

After checking IRS.gov website to review their status, some taxpayers learned that their advance child tax credit would be mailed this time — even though they received the advance child tax credit via direct deposit last month.

One said: "Nothing here yet. I use NetSpend," which is a prepaid debit card.

►Cryptocurrency:Black, Latino, LGBTQ investors see crypto investments like bitcoin as 'a new path' to wealth and equity

If you're going to end up receiving the child tax credit by paper check, you might need to prepare for delays. The IRS noted Friday afternoon: "Be sure to allow extra time for delivery by mail through the end of August."

The U.S. Treasury issued a statement Friday before noon that stated: "Due to a technical issue expected to be resolved by the September payments, a small percentage of recipients — less than 15% — who received payments by direct deposit in July will be mailed paper checks for the August payment."

Yet we could be talking about roughly 4 million or so people who fall into this category of expecting direct deposit in August but getting a check.

The IRS said Friday that those affected do not need to take any action for the September payment to be issued by direct deposit.

Tax experts say this unexpected shift from direct deposit to paper checks for some is expected to be a one-time issue.

If you're in this situation, Treasury recommends visiting the Child Tax Credit Update Portal at IRS.gov to see if you're receiving a direct deposit or paper check this month.

You also can go to the IRS site for a special page of information on the Advance Child Tax Credit at IRS.gov/childtaxcredit2021.

And another update: The IRS said that families who did not get a July payment and are getting their first monthly payment in August will receive a bigger check as the total payment will spread over five months, not six.

For these families that didn't get money in July but did in August, each payment is up to $360 per month for each child age 5 and younger and up to $300 per month for each child ages 6 through 17, according to the IRS.

What was that timeline?

The six monthly rounds of advance payments are set to arrive around the 15th of the month this year. The first July advance payment hit July 15. The next payments are scheduled for Sept. 15, Oct. 15, Nov. 15 and Dec. 15.

The second child tax credit monthly advance payment for August was scheduled for Aug. 13. That's because Aug.15 is a Sunday. The way direct deposit usually works, you're getting a "pending" notice in your account before the money shows up.

We are looking at a mixed message. For some, things will work out the same as last month. But others who got their money via direct deposit in July now could need to check their mailboxes for this second round of monthly payments for August — if they're not seeing the money via direct deposit.

Nothing is really simple, is it.

The Internal Revenue Service noted in July that about 86% of the payments for July were sent by direct deposit.

The first batch of advance monthly payments were worth roughly $15 billion and were sent to about 35 million families across the country.

►Child tax credit:Payments 'help alleviate the pressure,' used for rent, food and debts

Who's getting what?

Nationwide, about 36 million advance payments will be issued for August, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury's data. The payments cover nearly 61 million children across the country and totaled about $15.4 billion. The average monthly payment was $428.

The Treasury said the number of payments for August increased, compared with July, and cover an additional 1.6 million children.

The August payout numbers reflect advance child tax credit payments disbursed to eligible recipients based on taxpayer information that the IRS is using, the Treasury noted, and do not account for reversed payments or those that end up being undeliverable.

An effort is ongoing to get those who typically aren't required to file a tax return, based on a low income, to sign up to receive the advance credit money. The Treasury announced Friday that a new, mobile-friendly, bilingual sign-up tool created by Code for America — a civic technology nonprofit — will be available in the coming weeks.

It is not too late for low-income families to sign up for advance child tax credit advance payments and you'd use tools at IRS.gov to do so. People can get these benefits, even if they don’t work and even if they receive no income.

►Child tax credit uses:Families pay for rent, food

Money pays down debt, buys food

The advance child tax credit is an influx of cash just in time for back-to-school purchases and other expenses.

Many families used the money they received in July to pay off debt, and buy groceries, clothing and to pay for child care, according to the latest U.S. Census household pulse survey.

For some families, we're talking about money that's as big as a monthly car payment — or more.

Millions of eligible families are receiving up to $300 per month from July through December for each qualifying child ages 5 and younger and $250 per month for children ages 6 to 17.

A family with three toddlers could be looking at a monthly payment of up to $900.

The expanded credit is so new that some families didn't even realize that the advance payments are coming every month from July through December this year only.

The child tax credit was expanded as part of pandemic-related relief. The IRS will pay half the total credit amount — up to $3,600 for each child for those with young children — in advance monthly payments over the six months. The other half is to be claimed on the 2021 income tax return.

If your child ages out of the credit in 2021, the IRS is expected to make some adjustments on its own. The IRS won't include a child who turns 18 in 2021 in your advance monthly payments. And the IRS is expected to adjust the payment to $250 instead of $300 a month for a child who turns 6 this year.

The monthly advance payments are a new program that was authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act, enacted in March. Right now, the monthly payouts are happening this year only, but President Joe Biden and other Democrats want to try to extend this relief into future years.

Many families don't need to do anything to get this money. The IRS is basing monthly payments on the most recently processed tax return, either the 2019 federal return or the 2020 return.

The IRS said that the August payments reflect information on tax returns that had been processed by Aug. 2, including people who don’t typically file a return but during 2020 successfully registered for Economic Impact Payments using the IRS Non-Filers tool on IRS.gov. And this group also includes those who this year successfully used the Non-filer Sign-up Tool for advance child tax credit at IRS.gov.

The new maximum credit is available to taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for singles; $112,500 or less for heads of household; and $150,000 or less for married couples filing a joint return and qualified widows and widowers.

The new delivery-only kitchens will be located in big cities in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Wendy's is getting into the delivery business.

The Dublin, Ohio-based fast food chain plans to open 700 ghost kitchens in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom over the next five years.

Wendy's would not say where the kitchens will be located, but on an earnings call Wednesday morning, Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor said the move is intended to build a foothold in urban areas where Wendy's has little market share.

Ghost kitchens only prepare food for delivery orders, and don't have a storefront or a dining room. Some ghost kitchens use their own delivery service, whereas others rely on third-party delivery services like DoorDash and UberEats.

The fast-food chain said the Wendy's ghost kitchens likely will use a third-party service.

The expansion follows the success of an experimental ghost kitchen in Canada, Penegor said.

Cars take the exit:Parts shortages force automakers to end Mazda 6, Toyota Avalon in favor of SUVs

Wendy's is partnering with restaurant operator REEF, which plans to open 50 ghost kitchens this year, according to a news release.

"We view non-traditional restaurant locations to be a key part of our strategy moving forward, as it allows us to get into trade areas where we are currently underpenetrated," Wendy's said in an emailed statement.

As demand for delivery and carryout skyrocketed during the height of the COVID pandemic, restaurants found that some foods don't travel well, forcing them to adjust their offerings.

But Wendy's doesn't plan on making major menu changes at its ghost kitchens, the company said.

Since the start of 2021, there's been a fair amount of pandemic-related relief to go around. Not only was there a round of $1,400 stimulus checks that started going out in March, but parents have been seeing payments hit their bank accounts thanks to the newly expanded Child Tax Credit. And now, lawmakers are looking to give families with children even more relief.

The Senate Budget Committee recently released its $3.5 trillion budget that calls for Senate committees to invest in helping families reach financial security. Some of the benefits included in that proposal are:

A continuation of the expanded Child Tax Credit

Free pre-K programs for three- and four-year-olds

Expanded paid family and medical leave

Continuing the expanded Child Tax Credit would be huge for families. Right now, the enhanced credit is only set to apply to the current year, though lawmakers have been fighting to extend it.

The former version of the credit saw families collecting up to $2,000 per child under the age of 17, of which $1,400 was refundable. That credit was also payable as a single lump sum in the form of a tax refund.

This year, the credit looks very different in that it:

Is worth up to $3,600 for children under age 6

Is worth up to $3,000 for children aged 6 through 17

Is worth up to $500 for children aged 18, as well as full-time students aged 19 to 24 who are claimed as dependents

Is fully refundable so that families with no tax liability get all of that money paid to them

Is being partially paid in installments as well as a lump sum

That last part is significant. Families who collect the Child Tax Credit in tax refund form often find themselves squeezed for cash during the year. Now, eligible families are getting half of the expanded Child Tax Credit in monthly payments from July through December, and they'll only need to wait until 2022 to get half of the money they're owed under it.

Keeping the boosted Child Tax Credit in place could work wonders for low-income families in particular. Researchers at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy said earlier this year that the expanded credit could reduce the child poverty rate in the country by 45%, taking it from around 14% down to 7.5%.

Meanwhile, free universal pre-K could be a huge boon to families that struggle to cover the cost of childcare. In 2020, the cost of putting a young child into a childcare center averaged $340 a week, according to Care.com. For minimum-wage earners working 40 hours a week, that expense alone would wipe out their earnings. Offering up universal pre-K could alleviate that burden the same way public schools serve as childcare for older children who are kindergarten aged or older.

All told, families could be in line for a world of financial relief if the aforementioned proposal goes through. And while the proposal, in its current form, is only a blueprint for Senate committees to follow, it's loaded with a host of promising provisions that could serve a lot of American families very well.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The battle over the word "cruise" got uglier between two Detroit automakers.

Less than a month after General Motors sued Ford Motor for alleged trademark infringement over the name of Ford's new hands-free driving technology called BlueCruise, Ford wants GM's trademark rights to "Cruise" and "Super Cruise" rescinded, Ford spokesman Mike Levine said.

Cruise is the name of GM's subsidiary developing autonomous cars. Super Cruise is GM's hands-free technology.

Friday evening, Ford was to file a request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office asking it to rescind both of GM’s “Cruise” and “Super Cruise” trademark registrations.

Levine said Ford argues the terms should have never been registered, so it wants the trademarks rescinded to ensure "that it and the industry as a whole can freely use the word 'cruise' to safely describe their driver assist technologies."

GM reiterated much of what it said when it filed the lawsuit.

"As the industry’s first true hands-free driver assistance system on the market, GM’s Super Cruise was first announced in 2012 and has had a well established commercial presence since 2017 with approximately 10M miles driven using the technology to date," Darryll Harrison, GM spokesman, said in a statement. "GM remains committed to vigorously defending our brands and protecting the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market and that won’t change. At this time, we have no further comment."

GM sues Ford:Company claims hands-free technology name is a trademark infringement

Ford maintains that GM's trademark infringement lawsuit against it is "meritless and frivolous," Levine said, leaving Ford no other choice but to file the request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

"Drivers for decades have understood what cruise control is, every automaker offers it, and 'cruise' is common shorthand for the capability," Levine said. "Any number of companies use the word 'cruise' in connection with driver assist technology."

Ford chose BlueCruise in relation to the Blue Oval's next evolution of Ford’s Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control, which incorporates hands-free "Blue Zones" and other advanced cruise control features, he said.

GM filed the trademark infringement lawsuit against Ford July 24 in U.S. District Court in Northern California after several weeks of mediated discussions with Ford trying to reach an agreement on the use of the word "cruise."

GM's majority-owned self-driving subsidiary Cruise has been in business since 2013.

GM seeks monetary damages and filed a preliminary injunction asking that Ford be ordered to stop using the name.

Ford's response to GM's preliminary injunction late Friday argues "cruise" is a common term used across the industry, Levine said, noting that GM has no issue with Predictive Cruise used by Mack Trucks, Robocruise used as RoboCars' trademark, Hyundai's Smart Cruise Control and BMW's Active Cruise Control.

Cars take the exit:Parts shortages force automakers to end Mazda 6, Toyota Avalon in favor of SUVs

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Every customer and dealer who has taken possession of a 2021 Ford Bronco with a hardtop will get the tops replaced at no cost because they are beneath company standards for the popular SUV that began shipping in June.

The automaker notified dealers Thursday . While Ford reported selling 4,078 vehicles in June and July that include both hardtop and soft top, this action affects "a few thousand vehicles" that have been sold to customers, shipped to dealers, or remain on hold by the company near the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, the company told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY network.

Ford began production with more than 125,000 customer orders on hand.

In early July, the Free Press first reported that the Webasto hardtop problems were disrupting production and delivery.

"As part of our extensive pre-delivery quality inspections, we discovered molded-in color roofs made by our supplier partner Webasto did not meet our quality standards. The issue does not impact the functionality of the roof but can cause unsatisfactory appearance when exposed to extreme water and humidity," Ford spokesman Said Deep told the Free Press.

"As a result, we’ve made the decision to replace all molded-in color hardtop roofs on all two-door and four-door Bronco vehicles produced through August. This includes Broncos that have been delivered, are in transit, and units which have been built and are awaiting final quality release at Michigan Assembly Plant," he said.

"Our customers who already have a Bronco with a hardtop can keep driving them in the wild and we’ll get them a new hardtop roof at no cost as soon as we can. Unfortunately, for some customers who have ordered two-door and four-door Broncos with a hardtop roof, they will need to wait a bit longer."

The Broncos built with soft-top roofs are being built and shipped.

New plant just confirmed

The German supplier Webasto confirmed to the Free Press that it plans to open an additional plant in Michigan within the first three months of 2022.

It currently builds the tops at a plant in Plymouth, Michigan.

"To meet the high demand and increase roof production capacity, we will build another new production location in southeastern Michigan," said Susanne Killian, head of global internal and external communications for Webasto.

Ford is "looking at even more opportunities to expand hardtop roof capacity," Deep told the Free Press.

Webasto declined to comment on the ongoing quality problems involving the tops or respond to concerns that the supplier's manufacturing problems have damaged the multibillion dollar launch for Ford. The automaker declined to comment, too.

"We don't talk about supplier agreements," Deep said. "We're taking care of the customer. Other matters will sort themselves out."

Ford would not discuss who would pay the costs associated with this replacement, only to say that it would not be the customer.

Prices for the 2021 Bronco start at $28,500 for a two-door model. The base four-door starts at $33,200. It competes primarily with the Jeep Wrangler and Toyota 4Runner, with the removable tops Jeep owners love to flaunt.

The appetite for the new Bronco is so insatiable that some people are obtaining the vehicle and reselling it almost immediately. A Friday morning review of the eBay auction site online showed an all-new First Edition Bronco listed for $125,000 while other Broncos were listed for $103,000, $88,000, $88,100 and $75,000.

Mark Grueber, Bronco marketing manager, has worked to bring the vehicle back to the market almost since the day it went out of production on June 12, 1996. He pitched the strategy and proposal to the Ford leadership team.

This production glitch makes him ill.

“It’s all hands on deck to try to take care of the customer and get this resolved as soon as possible," Grueber told the Free Press on Thursday. "I got, like, two hours of sleep last night. We understand what the customer is going through. We've disappointed the customer on this. It’s the last thing we want to do."

He continued, "We’ve got a fantastic product. The customer and the media and the world love the product. ... We've disappointed them and we want to make it right. We are doing everything we possibly can to take care of these customers."

Deep told the Free Press:

"While it’s no consolation for our Bronco customers, we will continue to offer exclusive Bronco gifts and experiences for those waiting. For example, in July we mailed an exclusive Bronco design poster. Earlier, we offered ride and drive experiences with professional drivers to experience firsthand Bronco in the wild.

"For customers who have their Bronco, we will notify them that their hardtop roof will be replaced free of charge. To make it as easy as possible, their dealer will reach out to them to schedule an appointment. Many of our dealers have the ability to offer free pickup and delivery.

"For customers with a Bronco that is built and at Michigan Assembly Plant awaiting shipment, Ford will email these customers with an estimated delivery date for their new Bronco. While they wait, we will continue to offer them exclusive Bronco gifts, such as the design poster they received in July, and other exclusive Bronco experiences.

"For customers who have an order for a Bronco and unfortunately have experienced multiple production schedule date delays, Ford will be contacting them explaining how their new build date will be impacted as Webasto ramps up new hardtop roof production. Ford will notify them with a new date for when their Bronco will be built. We will continue to offer these Bronco order holders exclusive Bronco gifts and experiences while they wait.

"For customers who placed an order for a Bronco but do not have a scheduled production date, Ford will inform them that their vehicle will now be a 22MY (model year) Bronco. With new colors and options for the 22MY, these customers will have the option to change their order. This group of Bronco customers also will have the option to switch their hardtop order to a soft top and potentially receive a 21MY Bronco later this year. Ford will install a free prep kit for customers who switch to a soft top roof, which would allow customers the ability to purchase and install a hardtop roof at a later date. We will request our dealers reach out to these customers to determine any other unique assistance they might need. We will continue to provide these customers exclusive Bronco gifts and merchandise."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Another COVID-19 shortage is looming as the delta variant continues to surge.

While experts have predicted some school supplies could sell out, face masks are becoming harder to find across the country, including in some COVID hot spots.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance July 27 to recommend that people vaccinated for the coronavirus start wearing masks indoors again in areas with substantial or high transmission. As of Thursday, over 90% of counties in the U.S. are experiencing high or substantial transmission.

The week the CDC updated guidelines, mask sales increased 24% over the following week, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. The next week, online mask sales spiked up 51% and were up 40% for the week that ended Aug. 10.

►Back-to-school shopping:What's different amid COVID-19; how to avoid school supply shortages

►Mask mandates:Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Kohl's, Publix update mask policies for employees; encourage customers to wear masks

The CDC also is calling for mask-wearing in schools among students, staff and teachers to protect children who aren't eligible for vaccines.

“While the growth in mask sales is not as high as last year, in part because people likely have leftover inventory, the double-digit growth in the last three weeks has been striking,” Vivek Pandya, Adobe Digital Insights lead analyst, told USA TODAY. “It has also moved in the same direction as the news uptick around the delta variant.”

The scenario marks a shift from the past two months when masks were heavily discounted and pushed to the side on the sales floor after the CDC relaxed guidance in May. Even before then, data from NielsenIQ showed that mask sales consistently declined weekly since early April, going from $101 million worth of masks to roughly $37 million for the week ended July 3.

Will face masks sell out?

USA TODAY visited Target and Walmart stores across the nation and found the selection of masks available to be lower than a few months ago and varied by location. Options were also limited on the retailers' websites as to availability for online pickup orders.

At a Walmart in South Florida, a COVID-19 hot spot, masks for children were not available but there were several "personal protection kits" that included two masks selling for $4.

A Gap Inc. spokesperson told USA TODAY that searches for masks started increasing again about a month ago and have "significantly" accelerated this week at the company's brands that include Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta. The company has non-medical, reusable masks in stock online and in stores where available, the spokesperson said.

Masks are still more widely available than in the early days of the pandemic when many Americans turned to homemade and DIY face coverings. A search for masks on Amazon brought up more than 90,000 results with 70,000 items available through Prime.

Dr. Robert Lahita, director of the Institute for Autoimmune and Rheumatic Disease at St. Joseph’s Health in Paterson, New Jersey, told USA TODAY that more people are wearing masks due to fear of the highly transmissible delta variant.

“The people I am seeing who are the most afraid of contracting this variant are actually those who have already gotten vaccinated. They are very conscious of the danger,” said Lahita, whose new book, Immunity Strong, is coming out this October. “However, the ones who aren't vaccinated seem to be more oblivious to the present dangers.”

Lahita thinks it is possible there will be a mask shortage if people buy masks in bulk and hoard them.

“The average person needs a box of disposable ones if they can get them, but if not, then cloth can be used,” he said. "It's important that we have supplies available for everyone as we enter the fall and winter months."

My biggest house-flipping mistake was thinking I could do it. Let me explain. I'd been a landlord for several years and experienced some success, much like the tortoise in the tortoise-and-hare race. So who could blame me for wanting to try the hare approach? Instead of only practicing the buy-and-hold method and making a steady cash flow through collecting rent (the tortoise), I decided to try a fix-and-flip transaction to make some fast cash (the hare).

Whether it was ego, greed, excitement, or a combination of the three, I jumped on an opportunity to get a "deal" on a house without fully understanding the scope and cost of the work that needed to be done. Although I bought the property for significantly less than its market value, I effectively ended up paying market price once all the repairs were complete.

That's fine for a buy-and-hold strategy, but not for a fix-and-flip, as there would then be no profit to be made. Keep in mind this happened to me several years ago when America wasn't in this frenetic seller's market. We were in a balanced market at the time (a market that favors neither buyers nor sellers).

In other words, I couldn't just buy a house and then turn around and sell it for a profit without first fixing it up. To sell for top dollar, the house needed to be move-in ready, and like most flips, the house I bought was not.

► Slow down: Don't overlook these hidden costs when rushing to buy a home in a hot market

► Thinking about doing a home renovation project? Here are five ways to pay for it

The importance of running the numbers

The lesson I learned from my house-flipping mistake is to never do a real estate deal without first doing the math – and doing it correctly. Flippers need to plug in the correct numbers (or as close as possible) to evaluate a deal properly.

How to plug in the correct numbers

As a house flipper, you need to understand what you can likely sell the house for; in other words, what is the house worth in the current real estate market? You do this by looking at what comparable properties have recently sold for.

You then need to assess the repairs needed to bring the house up to market value. For investors who aren't experts, it pays to hire one. Getting the house inspected by a professional is a good idea.

As a house flipper, you should also either have a team you can count on to make the needed repairs or know how to get recommendations. For example, if you don't know a good contractor, plumber, or electrician personally, get with a group of people who can help you. I'm a licensed real estate agent, and as such, I can ask the other Realtors in my brokerage for recommendations. Other investors might network by joining a real estate investor group. (Note: Being a real estate agent also helps me save money acquiring properties since I can waive my commission to bring down the cost of the home.)

Now, you can plug in the numbers. Many flippers use the 70% rule: Don't pay more than 70% of the after repair value (ARV) minus repairs for a property. Let's say a home's ARV is $300,000 and it needs $50,000 worth of repairs. Here's the math: $300,000 times 0.70 equals $210,000, minus $50,000 equals $160,000. If that's impossible to achieve, see whether you can shave off some of the repair costs (If you happen to be a contractor yourself, you can do this.); if not, be willing to take less profit.

The Millionacres bottom line

For me, getting one of the cheaper homes in an expensive, desirable neighborhood was all I needed to know to pull the trigger. And because it's generally correct to get the least expensive house in the best neighborhood you can afford, I didn't lose money on the deal.

But what was supposed to be my fast-cash, hare-like transaction turned into another tortoise house, a slow and steady cash flow rental property to add to my portfolio.

Investors who want to get into the flipping business first need to understand the numbers and the likelihood of making money. Don't make my mistake, which was underestimating the cost of fixing the flip.

Popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) has seen its value shoot higher over the past week. As of Saturday, the price per token had gone up 26% in a week. And it's up roughly 50% over the last couple of weeks. That's a big return in a short period of time for anyone holding it.

So what

It's hard to point to anything specific with Dogecoin that would explain its outsize move higher. But there's an important general trend to note. It turns out that retail investors are still trading crypto, a lot! Coinbase Global, which enables the trading of cryptocurrencies, reported quarterly financial results earlier this week. The company said that monthly transacting users (MTUs) on its platform increased a whopping 44% just from the previous quarter. Moreover, trading volume increased 38% during this time.

►Investing FOMO?:Millennials are quitting jobs to become crypto day traders. Here's the risk, reward.

►Young investors:Black, Latino, LGBTQ investors see crypto investments like bitcoin as 'a new path' to wealth and equity

According to the website CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin is the world's seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Therefore, as more people start trading crypto, Dogecoin is likely high on their list of coins to buy. Previously, investors couldn't trade Dogecoin on Coinbase, but the company began supporting the cryptocurrency on June 3, opening the door for Coinbase's nearly 9 million MTUs. And like everything in economics, as demand for dogecoins outpaces supply, prices will go up, as they have over the past week.

Now what

Cryptocurrency investors are really wondering where Dogecoin is going from here. But the answer is hotly debated. A company named Finder polled 42 cryptocurrency experts to get their take. The survey found that 80% believe Dogecoin is a bubble. But some of those experts believe the price will continue to head higher this year before the bubble pops next year. Some even believe $1 per dogecoin is possible this year.

A closer look at Finder's survey results reveals a wide range of opinions, including Dogecoin being almost worthless by the end of the year. In short, the so-called experts are extremely divided. But here's the thing: They're divided because no one (including you and me) really knows with any reliability what the future holds for Dogecoin. The experts are all just guessing.

More:5 reasons cryptocurrency will see further growth in the future

In contrast to stocks, it's hard to develop a strong conviction in a Dogecoin investment. You can develop strong convictions with stocks because they represent ownership stakes in a real-world business. It's far easier to predict the future cash flows of a business that has a lot of recurring revenue. In that case, investors can construct a bullish thesis and invest a meaningful part of their portfolios in attractive opportunities. That's not the case with cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin.

That doesn't mean Dogecoin can't go higher – it can. And it certainly doesn't mean don't buy cryptocurrencies. It simply means to ground your level of conviction in reality and invest accordingly.

Although you still hear headlines referring to millennials as youngsters and college kids, the average member of the now-largest generation is actually in their 30s. Though the youngest may be recent college grads, most millennials are career-oriented professionals, many with young families in tow.

So, when looking for a new town to call home, millennials are starting to worry more about school districts rather than nightclubs – though a happening food scene is still high on the list, as eating out is a popular activity amongst millennials of all ages.

With that in mind, our list features metro-adjacent cities with strong economies, lots of activities, and plenty to do for young families. In no particular order, here are four cities with a ton of millennial appeal.

1. Grand Rapids, Michigan

The second-largest city in Michigan, Grand Rapids is a mid-sized city with a big-city feel. Of the nearly 200,000 people, more than two-thirds are below the age of 45, and the median age is just over 31 years.

Mortgage rates in Michigan are reasonable, and with median home prices in Grand Rapids around $143,000, more than half of residents own their own home. Also, unemployment is below the national average at just 4.4%. Grand Rapids is a rare bastion for the manufacturing industry, though the health, retail, and education industries are also big sources of employment.

►Move here, get paid:Small towns offer up to $20K just to get you to live there, work remotely

►Luring workers:From cold, hard cash to free sandwiches, here are some incentives for remote workers to move to other communities

There's plenty to do in Grand Rapids as you enjoy the culture and cuisine. You can find a number of interesting museums, several live event venues, and a happening brewery scene. You're also a short drive from Lake Michigan where watersports abound.

2. Boulder, Colorado

Less than 45 minutes from Denver, Boulder is a mid-sized city that's close enough to the capital city to enjoy the amenities it provides. The town is youthful and lively; the median age is below 30, and nearly three-quarters of the population is below 45 years old, making it great for young families.

Housing prices are quite high in Boulder – the median price is around $700,000 – so buying a house will likely mean taking on a major mortgage. However, rent can be reasonable, depending on where you live, and household incomes are also above average, with a median around $70,000. Education and tech jobs are abundant.

You shouldn't run out of activities in Boulder. You'll enjoy all of the perks of nearby Denver, including its sports teams and event venues. Plus, the mountains all around offer copious opportunities for outdoor adventures.

3. Durham, North Carolina

Located just outside of Raleigh, Durham is a mid-sized city with a lot of Southern charm. Durham has a slightly older population than other locations on this list with a median age of 34.5, but it still has a young feel as more than half the population is under the age of 45.

The median home value around $250,000 will come with a decent-sized mortgage, but the median household income over $65,000 can make it more attainable. Plus, as part of the Research Triangle – the tri-city area of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill have several major research universities – high-paying education and tech jobs are relatively easy to find.

Durham itself has a lot to do, offering plenty of entertainment venues, museums, and other cultural activities. You can also head into nearby Raleigh for even more options. If you're more into the outdoors, head a little out of town to enjoy a weekend in the Appalachians.

4. Bellevue, Washington

A suburb of Seattle, Bellevue has all the perks of the big city – with a bit less of the traffic and crowding. Bellevue is a good place for older millennials, since the median age is 37.7, and just over a third of the 144,000 residents are under the age of 45.

Mortgage rates in Washington are low, but because Bellevue is so close to Seattle, housing prices are roughly the same as in the city. That means you should be prepared for a big mortgage loan. But career-minded professionals should have a fair go at it, as the median household income is a whopping $120,000. Science and technology is the major industry in the area, making up more than a quarter of jobs, with education and healthcare also contributing quite a bit to the local economy.

It's hard to beat the location for things to do with all Seattle has to offer practically at your doorstep. This provides you with sporting events, major concerts, and tons of culture. Head a little east to enjoy what the Rocky Mountains have to offer, or a little west for an ocean adventure in the Pacifc.

Build your career and your family

Modern millennials aren't the college-age troublemakers of headlines past. These days, they're career professionals with budding families looking for vibrant cities to call home. The options on our list balance both professional and personal needs while offering a small-town feel with big-city neighbors for the best of both worlds.

It’s obviously a key issue for those heading into retirement but it also affects a lot of younger people who voluntarily leave for various reasons. They, too, face 401(k) rollover decisions.

Reflecting the magnitude of this decision, the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees many types of retirement plans, has issued new rules that affect financial advisers and their clients. The regulations are complex and largely beyond the scope of this column. But they focus on potential conflicts of interest and what obligations your adviser owes you to help make a wise choice.

"The decision to roll over assets from a plan to an IRA is often the single most important financial decision a plan participant makes, involving a lifetime of retirement savings," the department said in a lengthy explanation of the new guidelines. The intent of the rules is to "promote investment advice that is in the best interest of retirement investors."

Even if you don't work with a financial adviser, the issues raised can help guide you in pursuing a better rollover outcome.

Tax deferment and more options

Rollovers are movements of money from one tax-sheltered plan into another, especially switches from 401(k)-style accounts into IRAs. There's no requirement to roll or transfer money from a workplace plan into an IRA held at a brokerage or other custodial firm when leaving a job, but it's often the best option as you can continue deferring taxes.

Also, with a brokerage IRA, you often have a wider choice of investments compared to what's offered in your workplace plan. Other common reasons to make the switch include not wanting to leave assets behind at a former employer and wanting to consolidate assets.

American households as of mid-2020 held $10.8 trillion in IRAs, representing 34% of all retirement assets, according to a recent report from the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group. However, only about 12% of households contribute new money to traditional or Roth IRAs, the report added, meaning rollovers and investment gains account for most of the increases in these accounts.

"Rollovers from employer-sponsored retirement plans have fueled the growth in IRAs," the institute said.

Story continues below.

Targeting advisers' conflicts of interest

The new Department of Labor regulations, which took effect in February and likely will be enforced starting in December, seek to prohibit advisers from receiving payments from third-party investment companies that create conflicts of interest when dispensing rollover guidance.

In other words, not all advisers are fiduciaries who put their clients' best interests first.

"That's what this rule is trying to make clear," said Alan Norris, an Arizona-certified financial planner and a fiduciary for 401(k) plans. As of December, advisers handling IRA rollovers will have to assert in writing that they are indeed fiduciaries, he added.

When advisers act as fiduciaries they must, among other things, disclose conflicts of interest, offer prudent advice, charge reasonable fees, disclose why rolling money into an IRA is in your best interest and act with undivided loyalty (meaning an adviser can’t put his or her interests ahead of yours). For "prudent" advice, advisers are supposed to provide guidance and exercise judgment as other knowledgeable, impartial professionals would.

When the new rules are enforced, some advisers might stop handling IRA rollovers because they won't be able to meet the higher standards of a fiduciary, Norris said.

Fees can be another source of conflict

Fees and expenses are a key potential source of conflict.

“Financial institutions must be careful not to use quotas, bonuses, prizes or performance standards as incentives that ... are likely to encourage investment professionals to make recommendations that are not in retirement investors’ best interest,” the department said. Investment companies including brokerages, banks and insurers "should aim to eliminate such conflicts to the extent possible, not create them.”

As an example provided by the department, suppose you want to roll $100,000 from your 401(k) into an IRA, and suppose that an investment company affiliated with your adviser pays him or her 1% annually to steer you into its investments. Assume, further, that this fee difference cuts your average return to 5% annually from what would have been 6% otherwise. Over 10 years, at 5%, your initial $100,000 balance would grow to $163,000, compared to the $179,000 it would have risen to if earning the full 6%.

“In other words, that extra percentage point in fees would cost you $16,000, and as more time passes, that 1% difference in fees gets magnified,” the department said. “During the next 10 years, your IRA would lose out on another $39,000.”

The new guidelines still allow 12b-1 fees, commissions and other costly means of compensation, but advisers acting as fiduciaries will need to demonstrate how their rollover recommendations are still in a client's best interest, Norris said.

How to avoid taxes on rollovers

Whether or not you're working with an adviser on a rollover, it's important to have a basic understanding of how to move money from a 401(k)-style plan into an IRA.

One option involves a direct shift of assets from your employer plan to your new IRA custodian, where you don't take possession of any funds in the process. Rather, the funds are transferred directly from your 401(k) plan to your new brokerage. This is a clean, simple way to get the job done, and you won't trigger taxes in the process.

Alternatively, you can have the money paid to you first, then reinvest it into an IRA later. Because you take possession of the money, you can use this as a short-term loan, provided you repay it in a timely manner by reinvesting in an IRA.

However, you must complete this type of rollover within a 60-day window. If you don't, any money not reinvested is treated as a permanent distribution, triggering ordinary tax and a 10% penalty if you're under age 59 and a half.

Be aware, also, that employers must withhold 20% of the potentially taxable amount that you received. To avoid taxes and a possible penalty, you would need to come up with that 20% from somewhere else within the 60-day window.

Rollovers aren't especially complicated, but it's important to do them right. That's why the department is taking a closer look a how financial advisers are handling them.

OMAHA, Neb. — Rural America lost more population in the latest census, highlighting an already severe worker shortage in the nation's farming and ranching regions and drawing calls from those industries for immigration reform to help ease the problem.

The census data released last week showed that population gains in many rural areas were driven by increases in Hispanic and Latino residents, many of whom come as immigrants to work on farms or in meatpacking plants or to start their own businesses.

"We've struggled on this issue for a long time to try to come up with a more reasonable, common-sense approach," said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, which is part of a group lobbying Congress for new immigration laws. Vilifying immigrants "just makes it harder to get there."

The population trend is clear in Nebraska, where only 24 of the state's 93 counties gained residents. Of those 24, just eight reported an increase in the white population, suggesting that most of the growth was driven by minorities, said David Drozd, a research coordinator for the University of Nebraska Omaha's Center for Public Affairs Research.

Drozd crunched the census data and found that Nebraska counties with the greatest racial diversity are a "who's who of where the meatpacking plants are," even though many plants are in rural areas that are often perceived as mostly white.

►Luring workers:From cold, hard cash to free sandwiches, here are some incentives for remote workers to move to other communities

►Move here, get paid:Small towns offer up to $20K just to get you to live there, work remotely

"In the rural areas, if you didn't have the Latino growth, employers would be struggling even more just to fill those positions," Drozd said.

In New Mexico, populations declined across 20 rural counties that stretch from the Great Plains at Oklahoma to the U.S. border with Mexico. Desperate for laborers for its annual chile harvest, the state this week pledged up to $5 million in federal pandemic relief to subsidize wages for pickers and workers at chile-processing plants – boosting available wages as high as $19.50 an hour.

Some Republican state legislators blamed the labor scarcity on supplemental unemployment benefits, which they say create a disincentive to work because they pay more than some low-wage jobs. Democrats see a persistent labor crisis.

The New Mexico Chile Association trade group says the industry is short about 1,350 seasonal laborers of the 3,000 workers needed.

The problem is just as bad for poultry farmers in North Carolina, where meat processors help power the economies of many rural counties. Half of the state's 100 counties have lost residents since 2010, the census data showed.

Bob Ford, executive director of the North Carolina Poultry Federation, predicted that labor shortages at poultry plants will only worsen as people continue to leave rural communities and migrant workers gravitate to other industries, such as building and construction.

He said higher pay for workers and better health care and housing benefits could help alleviate widespread labor shortages, but broader changes to immigration policy are probably the best solution.

The National Pork Producers Council is pushing federal lawmakers to change the H-2A visa program so that migrant workers can remain employed longer.

Bladen County, North Carolina, is home to the world's largest pig slaughterhouse, Smithfield Foods' Tar Heel plant. Between 2010 and 2020, the county's population dropped by 15.9%. Bertie County, which is home to a large Perdue Farms poultry processing facility, saw a population decrease of 15.7%.

In Kansas, some rural Republicans say Congress needs to find a practical solution.

Nancy Weeks, secretary of the Haskell County Republican Party in southwestern Kansas, said if immigrants living in the United States illegally want to move to the area and work, they should be provided a way to gain legal status "so that they pay taxes like I do."

"I don't have a problem with them coming here as long as they get legal," Weeks said. "It's the ones that don't get legal that I have a problem with."

The challenge is exacerbated in Midwestern states that already have many of the nation's lowest unemployment rates, said Al Juhnke, executive director of the Nebraska Pork Producers Association. Juhnke said his group would like to see changes that would allow seasonal immigrant workers to stay in the country longer.

"These folks buy houses. They bring their families. They go to our churches. They earn money and spend it locally," he said. "It's really a win-win-win for these communities."

In Iowa, Latino leaders eagerly awaited the census numbers in hopes that they would show population growth that would translate into more political clout for their communities and better conditions in the food production and construction industries.

Republican politicians often try to tie reforms at the U.S.-Mexican border to pathways to citizenship for workers already here, said Joe Henry, political director for the League of United Latin American Citizens local council in Des Moines. But Henry said the two issues need to be separated, and agricultural companies understand that they cannot survive without immigrants.

"They know they need that labor," he said.

Rachel Gantz, a spokeswoman for the National Pork Producers Council, said her group will continue to press Congress for changes.

"Simply put, pork producers are drawing from a rapidly diminishing pool of applicants," she said. "Our producers fear – and the recent census data suggests – that this trend is unlikely to change anytime soon."

If your savings account has been feeling a little pinched lately, you're hardly the only one. While things are opening back up, the pandemic is still raging and the economy is still in the beginning stages of recovery.

While unemployment rates are dropping, many of us are still looking for ways to save money. We reached out to our readers on Instagram to get their favorite ways to save. Here are five reader-tested ways to save money.

► Move here, get paid: Small towns offer up to $20K just to get you to live there, work remotely

1. Stay at home

According to one user, the pandemic was the ultimate money-saver:

Go through a pandemic ... Minimizes outings 😂" - zoeyschvan

Although user zoeyschvan's response was a bit tongue-in-cheek, they aren't necessarily wrong about the money-saving potential of staying home. A night of movies and popcorn at home can easily cost 10% of an evening at the cinema, even if you go for the name-brand microwave popcorn.

Of course, just because you aren't hitting the town doesn't mean you have to have a quiet evening of introspection. A cook-out with a few close friends can be a great way to spend a Saturday – especially if you're still getting used to being around crowds again.

2. Cook your own meals

Several users extolled the financial virtues of the home-cooked meal:

"I'm all about simple at home meals! It's allowed us to save LITERAL THOUSANDS by skipping doordash!" - lauren.vorreiter

"Eating at home is one of the easiest ways for us to save money! We love eating out though! 😣" - racheljoy4

It's no secret that cooking at home is just a fraction of the cost of a restaurant meal – and it's often better for you, too. Hit your favorite recipe site or catch a how-to video online to perfect your gourmet skills, or just try something new.

If you do feel like eating something you didn't cook, save money by ordering directly from the restaurant and picking up your order. This helps you and the restaurant save on costly delivery fees. Oh, and don't forget to use your handy dining rewards credit card for a little extra savings.

3. Be your own bartender and barista

It's not just home-cooked meals that make your savings account happy, as one reader pointed out:

"Drink at Home! ☕️🤣Pennies per ounce.💲💲💲" - be_in_sane

As most of us come to realize somewhere in our 20s, drinking at bars and picking up our caffeine fix from coffee shops is expensive. Even the best happy hour special is probably costing you more per ounce than your favorite bottle from the local liquor store. And with the huge variety of resources online, you can learn to expertly craft just about any cocktail or specialty coffee you could desire.

If it's the social aspect you miss, have a few friends over for cocktails and snacks. If everyone brings a bottle, you can get a bar-quality variety of spirits for less than you'd spend on a bar tab at the end of the night.

4. Skip the pricey gym membership

Keeping to the theme of staying home, one user suggests avoiding the gym, too:

"Use the gym in my apartment instead of paying for a gym membership" - skmaegdlin

Many modern apartment complexes these days have their own gyms, even if it's just a treadmill and some free weights. Combine these basics with a free online yoga routine or exercises from your favorite workout app, and you have a full-body fitness regime that won't cost you an extra penny.

Even if you don't have access to an apartment gym, you can still work out at home for cheap with minimal equipment. Resistance bands, for instance, are small-space (and pocket-friendly) alternatives to heavy free weights. And don't underestimate the value of basic body weight exercises.

5. Recognize your needs versus wants

It's all too easy to splurge if you're not thinking through your purchases, as one reader pointed out:

"Rethink purchases. Not ordering an item when I think of it, but put it on a list and review if it's really needed or useful. Not grocery shopping hungry or clothes shopping when I feel less cute." - mais_ouiii

Emotional buying is just as real as emotional eating, and the former can be as bad for your bank account as the latter is for your waistline. Giving yourself a cooling-off period before making purchases is a great way to ensure that you aren't making an impulse buy you may later regret.

It's also a good time to do comparison shopping to be sure you're getting the best deal. And don't forget to double check that you have room for the purchase in your budget before you hit the checkout screen. A healthy budget is a happy budget.
