@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She may have mourned the possible exit of her "person" a couple weeks prior, but "Bachelorette" star Katie Thurston has moved on to an engagement.

The end of her season turned rocky with back-to-back self-eliminations from frontrunners Michael A., the widowed father who cared for Katie but struggled being away from his young son, and Greg, who got the first impression rose but reached his breaking point last week when he expressed love for Katie but didn't feel validated enough.

Greg's self-elimination had Katie so distraught, she begged for a plane ticket home.

"In that moment, I completely blamed myself," Katie reflected during the season finale's "After The Final Rose." "You start to question yourself and your worth and you have what felt like back-to-back men that I was falling for leave. You start to wonder 'what if?' and do you leave to go chase them?"

Despite struggling to process it all, Katie sticks around for this week's finale, where she has two men to choose from: Blake, a latecomer originally from last season who she has obvious chemistry with, and Justin, who sneakily made his way to the finale after not making many waves this season beyond his memorable facial reactions. (He later notes in "ATFR" that a lot of his moments with Katie didn't make it on camera.)

Final dates: Katie says 'I love you' for the first time

News of Greg's departure rocks Blake and Justin, who both worry it'll impact Katie's final decision.

Blake tells Katie he loves her and vows not to leave after making such a declaration (@ Greg next time, buddy).

Katie breaks her vow not to drop the L-bomb with more than one contestant left, telling Blake she "(expletive) love(s) you so much" before spending the night together (don't worry, just because Katie's final three got a little messed up, doesn't mean "The Bachelorette"s most sex-positive star doesn't get her fantasy suites).

"I was saving it for the one," Katie tells co-host Kaitlyn of her love declaration. "My heart officially belongs to Blake."

Oop. Sorry, Justin.

Who went home without an engagement?

Katie asks Justin to talk, which is never a good sign. She explains her feelings for Blake have grown stronger and can't move forward with their relationship.

"I was looking forward to today, however I did have my overnight with Blake and in that, I did tell him that I am falling in love with him," she says. "That is something I can only say to one person. You are someone I wanted to explore things with, but given how I now feel about Blake, knowing I am in love with him, it wouldn't make sense to have us move forward."

Justin, hitting us with one last memorable reaction shot, parts with nothing but kind words for Katie: "I just hope you know how special you are and how much you bring to the table. I hope (Blake) knows what he has in you and that he doesn't take you for granted."

Katie hopes Justin is the "last goodbye" of the season. That leaves one man standing.

Is Katie engaged?

Before a theoretical proposal, Blake meets Katie's family. He worries that there's even more pressure than usual to be perfect, because he's the only contestant left.

Enter: The classic Bachelor Nation pump-fake. Just when it seems like we've hit smooth sailing, it's time for conflict to arise. Katie's aunt won't give Blake a break about … anything he says, and Blake later divulges nerves about the "expectations" surrounding an engagement.

"There's a lot going on in my head right now, but I love Katie," he says. "There's no doubt in that. I just hope we're both ready for an engagement."

Katie says that night she believes Blake is her "soulmate." But is Blake the one getting cold feet now? The next morning, as the finalist is picking out an engagement ring, he expresses enough worries about "forever" with Katie that co-host Tayshia suggests he "let her go."

"I can't give you what you came here for," he tells her the next day. "Because you deserve a lot more than that."

Sounds like a breakup, right?

"You deserve the world and I'm excited to support you and be there for you every day moving forward," Blake concludes, before getting down on one knee. He had us there for a second!

'After the Final Rose': Katie fires back at Greg in tense reunion

Tension is apparent right away in Katie and Greg's reunion. She joins him on the couch without so much as a glance.

Watching the show back, Katie realized how much validation she gave Greg, and how quickly he turned on her.

"For you to do a 180, I feel like you were looking for the perfect opportunity to escape, because you were never ready for an engagement," she says. Greg is speechless. Katie is on a roll: "I don't think you know what love is, because that was a time I needed you the most, and you ran away."

She continues, calling Greg a liar and accusing him of gaslighting her while divulging the "anger I have watching this back and seeing the way you treated me, using me to get the experience, the exposure, dare I say the acting practice at my expense. It was pretty good until the end when you kind of (expletive) it up and walked away."

Confused? Katie explains she heard rumors afterward that he was actually a "confident, cocky" guy – much different from the shy Romeo fans saw on screen.

Greg apologizes for making her feel this way, citing the "tough environment" they were in. But he maintains her talk about roses and frontrunners when he was talking about love being the reason he couldn't do it anymore.

"I felt like you were playing the Bachelorette role with me instead of just being Katie," he says. "I just wanted something real, at the end of the day."

Fury toward her ex aside, Katie concludes Blake is "exactly who I'm supposed to be with."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fall Out Boy will no longer be performing at two of the shows slated for their ongoing tour.

In an Instagram post Wednesday, the "Thnks fr th Mmrs" band announced they would be pulling out of two "Hella Mega Tour" shows after a person on their team tested positive for COVID-19.

"Out of an abundance of caution, Fall Out Boy will not perform at the New York and Boston shows," the statement said. "It is important to note that everyone on the entire tour, both band and crew, are fully vaccinated."

USA TODAY has reached out to the band's reps for comment.

The New York show that took place Wednesday at Citi Field still went on with the other two bands on the lineup — Weezer and Green Day.

In Fall Out Boy's statement, they also said the "Hella Mega Tour" has an on-duty COVID-19 protocol officer to ensure that the CDC's guidelines are being followed as they travel.

The "Hella Mega Tour" spans 15 outdoor venues across major cities, including Thursday's Boston show at Fenway Park, and comes at a time where the U.S. has had more than 35.3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 614,800 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Other shows are still going on amid rising COVID-19 cases largely do to the delta variant of the virus. Lollapalooza in Chicago saw more than 385,000 people packed into the four-day outdoor music festival, though festival organizers said said 90% of attendees on the first day of the event proved they were vaccinated.

"You're less able to transmit COVID in an outdoor space, but that doesn't mean that you can pack 100,000 people into a small, enclosed space where they're on top of each other and expect nobody's going to transmit," Tina Tan, a Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine professor says of large concert events. "That's not how it works."

Garth Brooks, who was looking forward to an arena tour seeing an estimated 700,000 fans indoors in some venues, is rethinking his plans as cases rise in the U.S..

"It breaks my heart to see city after city go on sale and then have to ask those sweet people and the venues to reschedule,” Brooks said in a statement. “It’s humbling to see people put this much faith in you as an artist, and it kills me to think I am letting them down.”

NEW YORK — After several delays, the first phase of the sex trafficking trial of R&B hitmaker R. Kelly started Monday with jury selection in New York City.

Lingering health threats caused by the coronavirus pandemic and a shakeup of Kelly’s defense team pushed the trial into the summer, nearly two years after he was charged with abusing women and girls for nearly two decades.

U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly began questioning potential jurors about whether they can keep an open mind about Kelly two years after he was charged with abusing women and girls for nearly two decades. She reminded them the defendant was presumed innocent and that they should not be influenced by any bad publicity Kelly has faced over the accusations.

The proceeding was being conducted amid pandemic precautions, restricting the press and the public to overflow courtrooms with video feeds. Much of the time, Kelly and potential jurors weren’t clearly visible on the feeds and the audio was often faint.

More screening was set for Tuesday. It was unclear how long the process will take.

Kelly, 54, has been locked up since he was indicted, mostly housed in a federal jail in Chicago. He was moved last month to the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to face trial in a case that’s further diminished his superstar status.

Last week, defense attorney Deveraux Cannick told a judge that Kelly needs to be measured for new clothing because he’s gained so much weight in jail. And he asked that court transcripts be provided at no cost because Kelly has been unable to work for two years, saying: “His funds are depleted.”

The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling singer has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of leading an enterprise of managers, bodyguards and other employees who helped him recruit women and girls for sex. Federal prosecutors say the group selected victims at concerts and other venues and arranged for them to travel to see Kelly.

Defense lawyers have said Kelly’s alleged victims were groupies who turned up at his shows and made it known they “were dying to be with him.” They only started accusing him of abuse years later when public sentiment shifted in the #MeToo era, they said.

The trial had been expected to start earlier in the year. But opening statements were moved to Aug. 18 after Kelly fired his original lawyers.

Jurors are expected to hear testimony from several of his accusers. A judge has ruled that the women will only be referred to by their first names.

R. Kelly faces his first trial on sex-trafficking charges: What to expect

Prosecutors also are expected to offer evidence that Kelly schemed with others to pay for a fake ID for Aaliyah, a singer on the rise at 15 years old, in a secret ceremony in 1994.

Aaliyah is identified as “Jane Doe #1” in court papers because she was still a minor when Kelly began a sexual relationship with her and believed she had become pregnant, the papers say.

“As a result, in an effort to shield himself from criminal charges related to his illegal sexual relationship with Jane Doe #1, Kelly arranged to secretly marry her to prevent her from being compelled to testify against him in the future,” the papers say.

Aaliyah, whose full name was Aaliyah Dana Haughton, worked with Kelly, who wrote and produced her 1994 debut album, “Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number.” She died in a plane crash in 2001 at age 22.

The case is only part of the legal peril facing the singer, born Robert Sylvester Kelly. He also has pleaded not guilty to sex-related charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

Kelly won multiple Grammys for “I Believe I Can Fly,” a 1996 song that became an inspirational anthem played at school graduations, weddings, advertisements and elsewhere.

Nearly a decade later, he began releasing what eventually became 22 musical chapters of “Trapped in the Closet,” a drama that spins a tale of sexual deceit and became a cult classic.

But Kelly has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behavior, including a 2002 child pornography case in Chicago. He was acquitted in that case in 2008.

Scrutiny intensified again amid the #MeToo movement in recent years, with multiple women going public with accusations against the singer. The pressure intensified with the release of the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” in 2019.

Criminal charges soon followed.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Quentin Tarantino says he hasn't given a penny of his Hollywood fortune to his mom — and it's all because of a harsh comment she made to him when he was a kid.

The renowned director, whose net worth is an estimated $120 million, opened up about his childhood promise to never give his mother any money from his Hollywood success during a July appearance on the podcast "The Moment with Brian Koppelman."

Though Tarantino, 58, said he knew he wanted to pursue a writing career from a young age, he struggled in school, something his mother, Connie Zastoupil, "always had a hard time about."

One day, as his mother berated him over his poor academics, she told the budding writer something he never forgot.

"And then, in the middle of her little tirade, she said, 'Oh, and by the way, this little writing career?' — with the finger quotes — 'this little writing career that you’re doing? That (expletive) is (expletive) over,' " Tarantino said.

The director then clarified his mother meant she didn't want him writing in class, when he was "supposed to be doing something else."

Regardless, the comment struck a nerve with Tarantino.

"And when she said that to me in that sarcastic way, I was in my head, and I go, 'Okay, lady, when I become a successful writer, you will never see one penny from my success. There will be no house for you. There’s no vacation for you. No Elvis Cadillac for mommy. You get nothing because you said that,' " he said.

And turns out, Tarantino wasn't kidding, telling podcast host Koppelman that, for the most part, he's stuck to that vow.

"I helped her out of a jam with the IRS, but no house," the director said. "No Cadillac."

Tarantino added it's important parents understand their comments can have a significant impact on their kids.

"There are consequences for your words as you deal with your children," he said. "Remember: There are consequences for your sarcastic tone about what’s meaningful to them."

Tarantino's mother responded to her son's comments about her in a statement to USA TODAY on Wednesday, saying her son has her love and support.

"Regarding my son Quentin – I support him, I'm proud of him and love him and his growing new family," she said. "It gave me great joy to dance at his wedding and receive his news upon the birth of my Grandson Leo."

Zastoupil added that it's easy for podcast comments to "spin and go viral without full context" and that she does "not wish to participate in this salacious transactional media frenzy."

Tarantino went on to become one of Hollywood's most successful directors, helming classic films like 1994's "Pulp Fiction" and the "Kill Bill" series and winning two Academy Awards for best original screenplay.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Spain’s San Sebastian International Film Festival will honor Johnny Depp with its lifetime achievement award as the embattled movie star's legal woes continue.

Depp is set to receive the prestigious Donostia Award in late September, which "recognizes outstanding contributions to the film world," according to the film festival, which called Depp "one of contemporary cinema’s most talented and versatile actors."

USA TODAY reached out to San Sebastian International Film Festival for comment.

The move to honor Depp comes after the actor lost a libel lawsuit last year against a British newspaper that labeled him a "wife beater" in 2018 following Amber Heard's abuse allegations after their short, volatile marriage. A judge ruled the allegations were "substantially true" during the high-profile case.

Is Johnny Depp's career kaput?Maybe, but don't underestimate the devotion of his fans

Depp exited the "Fantastic Beasts" franchise shortly after in November of that year, revealing that Warner Bros., the studio behind the films, requested his resignation "in light of recent events." (The role of the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was instead played by Mads Mikkelsen.)

The announcement was met with backlash on Tuesday from Spain’s leading group of women filmmakers, who condemned the festival’s decision to award Depp its highest honor.

Cristina Andreu, the President of Spain’s Association of Female Filmmakers and Audiovisual Media, said she was “very surprised” by the decision.

"This speaks very badly of the festival and its leadership, and transmits a terrible message to the public: 'It doesn’t matter if you are an abuser as long as you are a good actor, ' " Andreu told The Associated Press.

The association, which has close links to the San Sebastian festival, was "studying next steps," she added.

Judge sides with Johnny Depp:ACLU must reveal if Amber Heard donated $7M divorce settlement

San Sebastian International Film Festival director José Luis Rebordinos told the Hollywood Reporter that it's not his place to "judge the conduct of members of the film industry.

"The role of a film festival is to select the most relevant and interesting films of the year and to extend recognition to those who have made an extraordinary contribution to the art of film,” Rebordinos told the outlet. "The Donostia Award to Johnny Depp is our recognition of a great actor, a man of cinema with a great career."

His upcoming appearance will mark Depp's third time at the festival. He last attended in 2020 as the producer of "Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane Macgowan," a documentary about the legendary Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan. The film won the Special Jury Prize.

The Donostia Award was awarded to Viggo Mortensen last year. Previous honorees include Penélope Cruz, Donald Sutherland, Dame Judi Dench, Danny DeVito, Sigourney Weaver, Ethan Hawke, Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ryan Adams is asking for forgiveness once again — two years after he was accused of manipulating and harassing multiple female artists.

In his first interview since The New York Times published its harrowing 2019 report exposing the singer for emotionally and sexually harassing women, Adams reflected on his "cancelled" career in a Los Angeles Magazine interview published Monday.

At the time, seven women – including Adams' ex-wife Mandy Moore and singer/songwriter Phoebe Bridgers – accused Adams of championing rising female artists and then exploiting them and stifling their ambitions, often for his own sexual gain.

“I felt like they were asking me to die,” Adams said, referencing cancel culture. “So I’m losing my life’s work, and my dream of who I am, my ability to provide for myself. And I now don’t have the emotional support to help fix this. The door has slammed and what am I going to do?”

USA TODAY reached out to reps for Moore and Bridgers for comment.

'I have a lot to say':Ryan Adams breaks silence months after sexual misconduct allegations

An in-depth look at cancel culture:Chris Brown is accused of more violence against women. Are we ready to cancel him yet?

He added he not only lost career opportunities (the cancellation of his U.K. and Ireland tours, the delayed release of his "Big Colors" album), but lost friends in his personal life, comparing them to a "swarm of birds, and they all turn at the same time."

“I was in (expletive) shock,” he said. “I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety made me so sick. I couldn’t fix it. I was functional in that I kept my house OK, and my cats were OK. But I was not well.”

Addressing the elephant in the room, Adams went on to combat claims brought up by Moore, who alleged at the time that her ex-husband used her own musical ambitions as a tool to control and hurt her. The two were married from 2009 to 2016.

"His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time – my entire mid-to-late 20s," Moore told The New York Times.

Adams said he was taken aback by Moore's involvement in the story.

“I was like, what is the point of this now?" he said. "We talked about this stuff years ago. Dissolving a marriage is one of the most difficult and soul-crushing things you can do. And the best you can do is to do it with care. We did the best that we could. So, yeah, I was a little confused.”

He also pushed back against the idea that he hindered her music career.

“If that were to ever to come out of my mouth, I would have hoped that it was followed immediately by a sincere apology,” Adams said. “I am capable of saying things that I later regret and it sucks to ever have that happen…I understand her disappointment. I see her point of view."

'Challenging':Mandy Moore reacts to ex Ryan Adams apologizing a year after sexual misconduct allegations

As for accusations brought up by Bridgers, who claimed he was "completely nude" after asking her to bring something to his hotel room, Adams said he had no memory of the incident and noted that he rarely sleeps in hotel rooms.

“She was a friend and an inspiring, great musician, and she has a really funny and unhinged sense of humor,” Adams recalled.

He also addressed "insane" accusations that he had phone sex and exchanged graphic texts with an underage girl. Though he didn't deny the interaction, he clarified that he wasn't aware of her age and assumed she was older due to social media posts of her performances in New York nightclubs.

“I cannot blame her,” he said of her involvement in the Times story. “I left home when I was 15 and I get it.”

As for those who still suspect that he would knowingly have relationships with underage girls, he said: “I have no history of this kind of (expletive). I love women who are tall and mean to me and smarter than me by half. This is not my pattern."

Investigation:FBI reportedly looking into allegations Ryan Adams sexted with underage fan

In February 2019, the Times reported that the FBI's New York field office was investigating whether the 44-year-old musician committed a crime by having phone sex and exchanging graphic texts with an underage girl.

That same year, Adams wrote in an essay published in The Daily Mail that there were "no words to express how bad I feel about the ways I've mistreated people throughout my life and career."

In response, during an appearance on the "Today" show at the time, Moore said Adams' public apology was "challenging" for her "because I feel like, in many ways, I've said all I want to say about him and that situation, but I find it curious that someone would make a public apology but not do it privately."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard don't play around when it comes to games.

"When we met, she was like, 'I have a standing charades game every Saturday," Shepard remembers. "'There's like 25 people. People do go to the hospital afterwards. Just so you know, that's a part of my life.'"

"It was full contact," explains Bell, 41. "So, we'd had a broken nose, we'd had a sprained wrist."

"Thrown some backs out," adds Shepard, 46. "We are gamers."

In fact, it was over a game of charades that Shepard first thought he might be falling for the actress, who starred in UPN's "Veronica Mars" and NBC's "The Good Place."

"I was watching her tell everyone the rules of charades at her house, and she turned from America's sweetheart to just a drill sergeant," he recalls. "Like the worst from 'Platoon,' or any of these war movies. All of a sudden she was just screaming ... And I just was like, 'What is this 5-foot-1 hurricane all about? Where did this side of her personality come from?' It was very intriguing."

Now the pair, who wed in 2013, are taking their love of games to the small screen for NBC's "Family Game Fight" (Wednesdays, 9 EDT/PDT).

In their first TV collaboration, the duo hosts and are pitted against each other as members of dueling foursomes compete for a chance to win $100,000. The competition can get messy: Ice shoots down players' backs as a penalty for a wrong answer in a game called "Brain Freeze." Contestants can also be hit in the face with a sweet treat in "Pie Rollers."

The show is inspired by their highly entertaining 2019 appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," where in a round of "Taste Buds," the blindfolded couple had to identify a food based on taste, and feed clues about the item to each other.

"It turned into the biggest blow-up, frustrating couples fight caught on TV," Shepard days.

Still, they saw an opportunity, Bell says: "We very quickly – as storytellers – recognized that was awful for us, but that was really good content."

As executive producers of "Family Game Fight!" alongside DeGeneres, Shepard and Bell reveal what it's like competing against a spouse, their daughters' mild reaction to their new gig, and why they're so candid about their relationship. (Edited for length and clarity.)

Question: How do you think being together for so long benefits you as hosts and contestants?

Dax Shepard: We're so good at reading each other. When Mama's a little tired or Papa's a little tired, and the other one can really pick up in those moments – I don't know (that) you would have that in a normal co-host situation.

Kristen Bell: And then you leave going, "You saw that I was tired and you picked up all the slack during that last episode." And then you leave work with your head on his shoulder, and it just feels really nice.

Q: What type of competitors are you?

Bell: Intense.

Shepard: It's like a tornado. It gets real hot and muggy. The light augments; it's yellow for a minute, and then it's over. Then it's the prettiest summer day you've ever seen. So I think in the afterglow of these battles, we're very supportive. It's a weird thing. I want to win, and then the second I win, I feel terrible, and vice versa.

Q: Did you learn anything about your spouse during this experience?

Shepard: I get reconfirmed, when I get to work with Kristen, just what a pro she is.

Bell: I would say the same thing. It's certainly something I knew – that Dax is the greatest safety net you could have next to you on any stage or in front of any camera.

Q: Did you learn anything about yourselves?

Shepard: As it turns out, I don't like having ice water dumped on my head 18 times. After three times you're like, "This is a bad game. Let's never play this again."

Bell: A lot of them are really, really bad games. They're torture games. They're not nice games, but we got through it.

Oops! Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard forgot their wedding anniversary – again

Q: What stands out as most challenging?

Shepard: Kristen and I've been at this for a minute – 20 years apiece. After the very first day of filming, we got home and I said, "I don't want to be reckless with this statement, but I think that's the hardest day in show business I've ever had." And she was like, "Oh my God, me too!"

Bell: Between the emotional tension of wanting to root for the families, there's a lot of money on the line for them, (so) you want to do well. There's your partner, (to whom) you have to maintain that you're going to be married after the show. Then there's the endurance factor. Then there's also –

Shepard: Child care, because it goes longer and longer than was predicted.

Q: Have your kids (Lincoln, 8, and Delta, 6) seen the show? Is this something you're going to watch as a family?

Shepard: We had a rehearsal day, (and) brought them to set thinking, "Oh, they'll love this." It's messy, there's pies. But I think because we were involved they were like, "Alright. Is there another stage on this lot we can go look at something that will be more of our interest?"

Bell: Anything with your parents is just uncool, like (it's) in your DNA. You're not supposed to like anything your parents do. We thought there's a spinning stage and there's big costumes and lights and fun props, and they were like, "Ah."

Shepard: "Let's go grab something to eat."

Bell: "Where are the snacks?"

'It saved my life':Dax Shepard thanks Kristen Bell for support during recent relapse

Q: When you're giving each other clues on the show, you sometimes share tidbits about your lives, like how popular nachos made with crackers are in your house. You recently posted to Instagram about a toilet paper incident. And you're also open about more serious topics, like sobriety and couples therapy. Tell me about your decision to be so honest with the public.

Shepard: I don't believe that it was something that got motivated out of a mission of ours, (but instead) out of our fear that people were seeing us in commercials and hashtagging "Couples Goals." And ethically we thought, "Well, we're misleading all these people if they think we met each other, and it's been a perfect, easy fit like in a movie. Because it really hasn't, and (yet) I would want everyone to have the marriage I have. But also, I want to be honest about the fact that you gotta work it like a job. You gotta think it's as important to nurture as anything else. I dedicate an hour a day to working out to stay physically fit. I need to dedicate that much thoughtfulness to a marriage, or it don't work.

Bell: It really did come out of the idea of we felt like we were being inauthentic, and authenticity is really important to both of us. So, to think that there were people looking at us going, "Oh, I just have to find my Dax," (meant we've) got to set the record straight here and be like, "No, these two people are very difficult on their own. Together? Whoo!" But it is worth it. It's just like working out or making a really great, big meal. It takes five hours, but it's gonna be delicious. Everything in life takes hard work, and so we thought, "Why not pull the curtain back a little bit and start talking about the hard work?"

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The judge in Britney Spears' conservatorship case denied her new lawyer's demand to move up a crucial hearing on whether to remove her father as her conservator, as the level of acrimony among lawyers in the case rises ever higher.

Judge Brenda Penny issued a one-page order Monday denying Mathew Rosengart's petition to move up the date of the hearing to Aug. 23 from Sept. 29 to prevent further "harm" to Britney.

Rosengart argued that the question of whether Jamie Spears will be fired as her conservator is too urgent to wait any longer.

"Every day that passes is another day of avoidable harm and prejudice to Ms. Spears

and the Estate," Rosengart said in a document filed in the Spears case in Probate Court in Los Angeles on Thursday.

"All interested parties forcefully agree that Mr. Spears’s continued presence as Conservator of the Estate is contrary to Ms. Spears’s best interests, health, and well-being, and that his prompt removal – or, at the very least, his immediate suspension – is critical at this juncture," Rosengart asserted.

Judge Penny's order did not include an explanation for her decision but it was denied without prejudice, meaning it could be brought up again.

On Friday, Jamie Spears responded to Rosengart's petition, saying there is "no reason whatsoever" to remove him, and that his daughter's new legal team is basing her case for dumping him on "unsubstantiated, vague accusations."

The latest development in the Spears conservatorship case features dueling documents in the case file in which multiple lawyers and their clients exchange accusations of various misdeeds.

Jamie Spears' lawyer, Vivian Thoreen, said in his response that Jamie does not oppose moving up the hearing date but rejects any effort to remove him as his daughter's conservator.

"Mr Rosengart's assertion that the Court could suspend Mr. Spears without a hearing, after thirteen years of admirable service, carefully monitored and approved by this Court, is simply without merit," Thoreen said in the response.

USA TODAY has made attempts to reach lawyers for Britney, her father, her mother and her conservator of her person, but has not heard back. As of Monday, the Sept. 29 hearing date remains on the court calendar.

Britney Spears says the 'cat is out of the bag'

The latest exchange of documents in the Spears file was another sign of Rosengart's aggressive strategy in freeing his client from her 13-year-old conservatorship, under which she claims to have been "abused" by her father's longstanding control over her money and her intimate life choices.

"Although a two-month wait for a hearing may not seem significant in the

context of 13 years, Ms. Spears should not be forced to continue feel traumatized, lose sleep and suffer further," Rosengart argued in the petition. "Every day matters."

Britney Spears, 39, glancingly mentioned the conservatorship battle on Instagram Thursday.

"OK, so I'm sure a lot of you guys are wondering how I'm doing, and since the cat is out of the bag, literally out of the bag, and you guys know my situation, I do want to let you guys know that things are better than I ever anticipated," she says, before moving on to answer fan questions about her favorite things.

For the first time in 13 years, Judge Penny last month allowed Britney to pick her own lawyer to represent her, and she hired Rosengart, a former federal prosecutor known as an aggressive litigator.

His goal, as stated in court documents including the petition seeking a hearing date change, is to permanently remove Jamie Spears and replace him with a new professional conservator, Jason Rubin, or failing that, to immediately suspend him and appoint Rubin as temporary conservator.

Rosengart's petition also suggested Jamie Spears should resign immediately – in his daughter's best interest – without having to admit fault.

Jamie Spears' response declared there are no grounds to remove him because there are no "blemishes" on his record of serving as conservator.

"This is not an opinion; he has taken the Estate from being in debt and facing tens of millions of dollars of lawsuits to a current value of well over $60 million," Thoreen wrote. "Mr. Spears’ record as Conservator speaks for itself."

In seeking the date change, Rosengart cited a number of factors contributing to urgency, many of which have been raised in before, including during Britney Spears' searing laments at June 23 and July 14 hearings about how she has been "traumatized" by her father and the conservatorship.

Jamie Spears alleges Jodi Montgomery suggested a psychiatric hold in July

The Rosengart petition cited her professional co-conservator, Jodi Montgomery, who wants her father removed. Her mother, Lynne Spears, wants her ex-husband removed. And her "medical team agrees" his removal is necessary, the petition said.

Jamie Spears argued in his response that none of his daughter's statements nor those of other parties have been fact-checked by the court so they amount to "unsupported hearsay" assertions.

Moreover, Jamie Spears said in a separate declaration that last month Montgomery called him in a distraught state, concerned about Britney's recent behavior, said she was "mentally sick" and possibly needed a 5150 psychiatric hold. A few days later, Montgomery sent Jamie Spears an email, walking back everything she said in the phone call and discounting the need for a psychiatric hold, Spears said.

Montgomery's lawyer, Lauriann Wright, did not immediately return a message from USA TODAY.

Meanwhile, the status quo, under which Britney Spears has refused to work while her father remains, means further "dissipation" of her estate due to her father's "spendthrift" ways, Rosengart asserted.

The estate is already paying her father's salary ($16,000 a month) and his substantial legal fees (more than $1.3 million since October) and the fees charged by his media advisors – a "shocking and inexplicable $541,065.50," the petition sputters.

More:Britney Spears' medical team support efforts to remove dad Jamie from conservatorship

Rosengart claimed Jamie Spears "microscopic control" of his daughter extended to whether she could take a vacation using her own money last month. Jamie Spears said in his response this is a "false statement."

Britney Spears spent some time in Hawaii with her boyfriend, Sam Asghari, according to her Instagram page.

"Although Mr. Spears and his team ultimately relented, the mere objection to his adult daughter taking a brief, well-earned vacation at this point in her life, while other funds are lavishly expended, underscores why suspension and ultimately removal should not wait," Rosengart argued.

Los Angeles family-law lawyer Christopher Melcher, who's been following the Britney case, told USA TODAY he was surprised at Judge Penny's denial given that all the parties agreed to advancing the hearing.

"The request to remove Jamie as conservator is an important and urgent matter. The court should have been able to find time before Sept. 29 to have that hearing," Melcher said. "This was not a denial on the merits of whether Jamie should be removed; it was just a scheduling issue."

NEW YORK — Dave Chappelle, Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon and Amy Schumer are part of a star-studded group of comedians that will perform for one night only at Madison Square Garden to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11.

All proceeds from “NYC Still Rising After 20 Years: A Comedy Celebration” will benefit 9/11 charities. Proof of vaccination is required.

“We wanted to put on a fun celebration to honor this great city’s resilience. It’s nice to be able to do this with friends and people we love,” Stewart said in a statement.

The show is his brainchild with Pete Davidson, who will also perform. Davidson's father was a firefighter who died on duty during the attacks.

A ticket pre-sale for the Sept. 12 show begins at noon Wednesday on Live Nation, Ticketmaster.com and MSG and runs until 10 p.m. Thursday, with general tickets on sale starting at noon Friday at Ticketmaster.com.

Bill Burr, Colin Jost, Colin Quinn, Dave Attell, Jay Pharoah, John Mulaney, Michael Che, Ronny Chieng, Tom Segura and Wanda Sykes are also in the line up.

More:Jon Stewart, first responders, give emotional testimony before Congress on 9/11 victim fund

Stewart has been vocal about his advocacy for 9/11 responders and victims. The former "Daily Show" host gave a tearful and impassioned testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund in June 2019.

"I can't help but think what an incredible metaphor this room is for the entire process that getting health care and benefits for 9/11 first responders has come to," he said at the start of his remarks. "Behind me, a filled room of 9/11 first responders and in front of me, a nearly empty Congress," he said, referencing the absence of several lawmakers.

The House Judiciary Committee passed the bill one day after Stewart's impassioned speech. The passage of the bill would permanently reauthorize the fund that compensates victims of 9/11 and their families.

Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., said at the time that she was proud to vote to reauthorize the bill.

"Congress has a responsibility to take care of the brave first responders that rushed to the scene on 9/11," she wrote on Twitter. "This legislation is long over due for these American heroes."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Paris Hilton and her mother Kathy have more than their perfectly tinted blond locks, unwrinkled faces and a last name in common. As Paris did on Fox's early 2000s reality series "The Simple Life," Kathy has captivated television viewers with her moments of naiveté.

Kathy, who acted in series like "Bewitched," "Happy Days" and "The Rockford Files" as a teenager, quickly became a fan favorite on Bravo's unscripted series "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" (Wednesdays, 8 EDT/PDT) after joining the series this season, .

Paris returned to the small screen on Aug. 4 with the debut of Netflix's "Cooking with Paris," in which she attempts to master dishes with the help of her famous friends. She's enjoyed watching her mom make a splash on reality TV. Kathy, 62, fills the role of a "friend" (not an official "Housewife"), amusing and sometimes pranking her castmates, including her younger sister, Kyle Richards.

Paris, 40, says she sees herself in her mom's "Real Housewives" antics, which she fast-forwards through scenes without Kathy "because I'm so busy."

"I think that we both are very fun, and we have a playful side to us," says Paris. "Watching the show, I can see that I get a lot of my humor and the way I am (from) my mom. (She's) just one of the funniest people in the world, and she's the real OG."

Among Kathy's celebrated moments: Sipping a Red Bull energy drink at 1:05 a.m. because she "thought it was, like, just a soft drink," and asking earnestly, during a blow-up between housewives Sutton Stracke and Crystal Kung Minkoff, who "hunky-dory" is.

Kathy tickled her castmates in last week's episode when she asked Richards for a straw and chia seeds. Richards told her fellow housewives she thinks Kathy, who used to live in New York's Waldorf Astoria, operates her home "like a hotel too." Makes sense considering she wed Rick Hilton, grandson ofhotel magnate Conrad Hilton, in 1979.)

Kathy blames some of her gaffes – like the Red Bull incident and putting ear drops in her peepers – on poor eyesight and "always losing" her glasses.

"I saw that there were Cokes and 7UP and all that. I didn't want that because of the sugar," she says. "So I just grabbed something. I don't wear my glasses in the refrigerator, and it tasted good."

Kathy says the show's portrayal feels true to life but minimizes her complexity. "I feel all everyone is seeing is the silly side, but I have my serious side too," she says. "I went in with a very small part. Yet I do a lot more than they show. There's eight girls, so you can't really see everything. I could be having a very intelligent, intellectual conversation, but they're not getting into that."

Seeing herself on TV has made Kathy more self-aware.

"I've never thought of myself as quirky," she says. "And I've asked a lot of my close, close friends, 'Am I quirky?' They go, ‘Of course, you are!’ I'm like, ‘Really?’ They're like, ‘Well, you're fun.’ I'm not hurting anybody. I'm just trying to enjoy my life."

Paris admits she had concerns about her mom joining the franchise. Her younger sister, Nicky Hilton Rothschild, revealed during a June appearance on the network's "Watch What Happens Live" that she cried over her mom's casting. Paris says the drama between Kyle and middle sister Kim Richards, a housewife during the show's first five seasons, worried her and Nicky.

"After what we saw happening with our aunts fighting on the show, it was the last thing we would want is for our mom to be involved with the drama," says Paris. "(With) that show, there's a lot of arguments all the time. But just like my mom told me not to do 'The Simple Life,' and I did – and after she saw it, she called me and said, 'I was wrong. I love it. It's hilarious, and I'm so proud of you.' – I did the same thing with her. I called her, and I said, 'I was wrong. You are amazing and you handle yourself perfectly, and you don't get involved in the drama, and I'm just so proud of how you are on the show.'"

"Real Housewives" and "Cooking With Paris" prove the Hiltons could use some tips in the kitchen. Kathy tried to clean up glass using a grill brush. Paris isn't sure what a whisk or tongs are.

"Tong. I didn't know it was called that," she tells guest Kim Kardashian West. "I just called it like, 'the picking upping thing.'"

"Cooking" feels like a variation of her persona from "The Simple Life," during which Paris and Nicole Richie were exposed to average Americans' way of life and worked jobs at Sonic Drive-In and a dairy farm.

"I want this show to be very playful and fun," Paris says. "I have my serious side when there's an occasion for that. But when I'm being my fun, playful side, I feel like that really is like my 'Simple Life' character."

The persona – a carefree, at times ditzy blonde who once asked "What is Walmart? They sell wall stuff?" – helped Paris launch an empire. She's a DJ/model, she has a TV production company in collaboration with Warner Bros., product lines including perfumes and skin care line, and a podcast.

"The character, it's part of me because I've been doing it for so long," she says. In "Cooking," "it's all real – everything I'm saying and doing, but...I'm definitely not a dumb blonde, just very good at pretending to be one. I play into the character and have a lot of fun with it in that way. Because I just feel that everyone, especially being stuck in their houses during the pandemic ... needs a show that's just going to make them smile and laugh and be entertained and have a good time."

Paris says she "learned so many things" from her new series. She whips up the frittata she cooked with Kardashian West for her fiancé, entrepreneur Carter Reum, "almost every weekend for brunch."

Kathy and Nicky appear in the season finale of "Cooking with Paris" to prepare an extravagant steakhouse meal complete with gold-flecked onion rings and truffle butter with fungi that cost $1,000 per pound as its star ingredient.

Paris and Kathy are also collaborating on Paris' wedding planning, which will be documented in Peacock's "Paris in Love," slated for fall.

"We've been shooting every day for the past two months," she says. "It's been stressful, definitely, being a bride-to-be, but my mom has been amazing, helping me plan everything and just getting it all together.

"But, obviously because of the pandemic, a lot of the weddings got moved to this fall," she continues. "So, it's just been difficult to find the venue that we want, and also with the guest list because I always dreamed of having this huge wedding with all of my friends from around the world. But (with) what's happening in the world and everything is so uncertain, I'm not going to be able to have that huge, giant wedding. It's definitely going to be more intimate."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"Reservation Dogs" breaks new ground as the first TV series featuring an all-Indigenous team of writers, directors and series regulars.

It's a noteworthy milestone for a community long neglected onscreen, but it's also central to the authenticity –and especially the humor – of the half-hour FX on Hulu comedy (first two episodes of eight episodes streaming Monday) that follows four engagingly rebellious Native teens. The series was filmed on location on the Muscogee reservation in rural Oklahoma.

"If it was a non-Native-controlled writers room, it wouldn't be as rich with characters or even just the surprising turns in the stories," says Oscar winner Taika Waititi ("Thor: Ragnarok," "What We Do in the Shadows"), a New Zealander of Maori heritage who co-created the series with Sterlin Harjo, a Seminole/Muscogee Creek filmmaker from Holdenville, Oklahoma.

Inclusive steps:'Rutherford Falls' ushers in era of Native American representation on TV: 'We've been ready'

"Sterlin and I share very similar sensibilities, that we don't want to see ourselves portrayed standing on the mountaintop blowing a flute, talking to a tree, communing with ghosts. We’re sick of that," Waititi says of longtime stereotypes. "I've never seen us represented (as we are) on this show."

Although screen portrayals of Native people have been limited, there has been some progress. Another comedy, "Rutherford Falls," which features an Indigenous co-creator and stars, premiered on the Peacock streaming service in April, while Harjo and "Dogs" director Sydney Freeland are preparing to team up on a Netflix Native American basketball drama, "Rez Ball."

The central premise, which Harjo describes as "these kids who decide to become vigilantes and clean up the community, but in a funny way," came from the co-creators' similar experiences growing up in Oklahoma and New Zealand.

"Communities that have been poor or they're minority communities, it doesn't matter where in the world you're at. You're probably still going to love Bob Marley," Waititi says. "You're probably still going to latch onto American pop culture. We both have kids who grew up loving 'Karate Kid.'"

"Reservation Dogs," a play on Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs," follows teens who spend their days stealing a truckload of snack chips, visiting the local health clinic, strategizing against a quartet of rival teens and yearning to escape to an idealized vision of California. Underneath their antics and byplay, there's sadness over the death a year earlier of their friend Daniel.

Waititi and Harjo drafted Native colleagues to write and direct. They went beyond traditional Hollywood casting sources, in which Indigenous people are poorly represented, to find the young actors who are members of Native communities in the U.S. and Canada.

"What I love about the Native writers room is we weren't policing ourselves, and there was no catching non-Natives up," Harjo says. "We weren't afraid to go places that we needed to go. We weren't holding it back. I was like, 'Let's go hard.' The strength in numbers gave us the power to be able to say what we want."

That allows them to have fun with solemn tropes that others might have been afraid to touch. When one of the teens, Bear Smallhill (D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), encounters a spirit warrior in a moment of doubt, it's not a heroic figure, but a comically inept one who died in an accident before he could even get to the fight.

"We wanted to see a warrior from the Little Big Horn battle who was a useless warrior," Waititi says. "No one has seen that."

The series doesn't avoid the historical mistreatment of Indigenous people and the challenges so many still face today, but it concentrates on the rebelliousness, resilience and humor that has helped them survive.

"You have to show the specificities and the nuances of a place. It's not like we're focusing on the sadness, but it's there," Harjo says. "I think that helps the humor come through even more, because we grew up in these communities that are underserved but we still find ways to be funny and have imagination."

Devery Jacobs, a Mohawk actor from Kahnawake, Quebec, who plays teen Elora Danan, seconds that sentiment.

"Growing up on the Rez, I didn't think every day about how my people have endured hardships. I was like, 'Oh yeah, that's part of our history.' It's just a fact of life for us," " Jacobs says. "What I'm so happy for, in this being a comedy, is that it shows that we are three-dimensional people, and Indigenous people are really funny."

Jacobs, who also appeared in "Rutherford Falls," has a message for fellow Indigenous viewers.

"I hope that they relish seeing this community represented onscreen. I can't even imagine what it would have done for me and my self-esteem growing up if I had seen a show like this on air," she says. "I look forward to seeing elders, people my age, youths growing up take it in and really celebrate with us."

In 1999, KISS were at the LA premiere of coming-of-age teen comedy, "Detroit Rock City." (Aug. 9)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Associated Press

NEW YORK — One of Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime accusers sued Prince Andrew on Monday, taking accusations that she has repeatedly publicly lodged against him, including that he sexually assaulted her when she was 17, to a formal venue.

Lawyers for Virginia Giuffre filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court, where Epstein was charged criminally with sex trafficking a month before he killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 in an adjacent federal jail where he was ordered to await trial.

Giuffre has repeatedly made her allegations against Epstein, his onetime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, and Andrew, but the lawsuit was the first time she has directly confronted Andrew in such a formal setting. It steps up public relations pressure on the prince, even if he remains beyond the reach of the courts.

In a statement, Giuffre said the lawsuit was brought under the Child Victims Act to allege she was trafficked to him and sexually abused by him.

“I am holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me,” she said. “The powerful and rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions. I hope that other victims will see that it is possible not to live in silence and fear, but to reclaim one’s life by speaking out and demanding justice."

“I did not come to this decision lightly,” she added. “As a mother and a wife, my family comes first — and I know that this action will subject me to further attacks by Prince Andrew and his surrogates — but I knew if I did not pursue this action, I would be letting them and victims everywhere down.”

Prince Andrew vs. the feds:Can he be forced to talk about Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell?

In late 2019, Prince Andrew told BBC Newsnight that he never had sex with Giuffre, saying, “It didn’t happen.”

He said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting her and told an interviewer there are “a number of things that are wrong” about Giuffre’s account, which alleges the encounter occurred in 2001.

“I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened,” Andrew said.

After the disastrous interview, he stepped down from his royal role and has not been seen in public except for family occasions, such as the death of his father, Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh, in April.

Giuffre has long said Maxwell recruited her at age 17 to be sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell from 1999 to 2002.

According to the Monday lawsuit, which sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, the prince abused Giuffre on multiple occasions when she was under the age of 18.

During each of the alleged acts, Giuffre was given “express or implied threats” by Epstein, Maxwell, and/or Andrew to engage in sexual acts with the prince, the lawsuit said.

It said that she “feared death or physical injury to herself or another and other repercussions for disobeying” the trio because of their “powerful connections, wealth, and authority.”

It said that on one occasion, the prince sexually abused her in London at the home of Ghislaine Maxwell when Epstein, Maxwell and Prince Andrew forced her to have sexual intercourse with the prince against her will.

On another occasion, Prince Andrew sexually abused her in Epstein’s New York mansion, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit also alleged that Andrew sexually abused Giuffre on Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The lawsuit added that Andrew knew her age at the time based on communications with Epstein and Maxwell. It said he went ahead anyway “for the purpose of gratifying his sexual desires."

The lawsuit was brought under the Child Victims Act, a 2019 New York state law that allows victims to temporarily make legal claims of abuse that occurred when they were children regardless of when or how long ago the alleged abuse occurred.

Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges in Manhattan federal court, where she faces trial in November. She is held without bail. Her lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.

Giuffre, previously known as Virginia Roberts, first accused Andrew, and other men who were friends of Epstein, years ago, causing further damage to Queen Elizabeth II's second son from the fallout of his friendship with Epstein, which continued even after Epstein became a convicted sex offender in 2008 in Florida.

The Duke of York was accused in a 2015 Florida lawsuit of having sex with Giuffre who claimed she was a 17-year-old "sex slave" hired to service him and other rich and famous friends of Epstein.

At the time, Buckingham Palace issued three increasingly emphatic statements on Andrew's behalf, denying he had sex with an underage girl. Andrew himself publicly denied the accusation during a long-scheduled speech at a reception for British trade in Davos, Switzerland.

Andrew, who now lives in a mansion on the Windsor Castle estate, had already lost his prized job as a British trade envoy in 2011 due to his Epstein connection, and Giuffre's allegations only deepened the scandal surrounding him.

Meanwhile, Giuffre and lawyers representing her and other Epstein accusers have tried to pressure the prince into talking to federal investigators in New York who were pursuing Maxwell.

Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, and Gloria Allred, who represents multiple accusers of Epstein and Maxwell, have both turned up in London (pre-pandemic) to appear in the media to pressure Andrew into talking.

Andrew has denied he knew anything about Epstein's or Maxwell's alleged illegal activities, and so far the efforts to get him to cooperate have failed. His legal team has said he offered his assistance three times to the Americans under conditions, but was rebuffed.

Two U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York have called on Andrew to cooperate in the last two years but nothing has happened.

"We would welcome Prince Andrew coming in to talk to us. We would like to have the benefit of his statement," said Audrey Strauss, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in announcing Maxwell's arrest in July 2020.

Federal prosecutors also formally requested to speak with Andrew under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, an agreement between the two countries to share evidence and information in criminal cases. The request is similar to issuing a subpoena, but so far the desired interview has not happened.

So far, Buckingham Palace has not issued a statement commenting on Andrew's behalf.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bob Odenkirk is feeling the love after his July 27 heart attack. And we love it.

The once-curmudgeonly "Better Call Saul" actor is getting all touchy-feely on Twitter as he recovers, making us love him all the more. After all, friends, family and fans were deeply concerned about the 58-year-old Odenkirk following dire news of his on-set collapse and hospitalization.

The recovering Odenkirk took a walk with "Better Call Saul" co-star Michael Mando on Aug. 12 and tweeted about, well, hugs and love.

"I keep getting good energy, hugs, love, from everyone, strangers, old friends," Odenkirk wrote. "I can't take all this goodness at once, but I guess I'll have to. Hope you are having a great day today."

In an Aug. 6 Twitter update, the once perma-smirking Odenkirk went all Jimmy Stewart.

"I am doing great," Odenkirk wrote to Twitter followers in an Aug. 6 update. "I’ve had my very own 'It’s a Wonderful Life' week of people insisting I make the world slightly better. Wow! Thank you."

Not that Odenkirk is getting too carried away with the abundant affection akin to the joy for Jimmy Stewart's safely-returned George Bailey in the Christmas classic "It's a Wonderful Life."

"I love everyone right now but let’s keep expectations reasonable!" Odenkirk wrote.

The anxiety over Odenkirk last month was a real-time social media phenom.

"Breaking Bad" star Bryan Cranston wrote on Instagram that he was “anxious all morning" waking up to the news of Odenkirk's collapse. Aaron Paul, Jesse Pinkman in the series, wrote fretfully on Instagram, "I love you my friend."

Worried friends and fans have been exhaling in relief since July 28 when son Nate Odenkirk tweeted the simple words, "He's going to be okay."

Since then, Mr. Show himself has made a slow return to Twitter, tweeting his own emotional reassurance and thanks to well-wishers on July 30.

"Hi. It's Bob. Thank you. To my family and friends who have surrounded me this week. And for the outpouring of love from everyone who expressed concern and care for me. It’s overwhelming. But I feel the love and it means so much."

He also thanked the doctors who took care of him and noted that he was going to take "a beat to recover."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jane Withers starred opposite Shirley Temple in 1934's "Bright Eyes."

As an adult, Withers played Vashti Snythe alongside Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean in the 1956 drama "Giant."

Withers died August 7 at age 95.

Jane Withers, a major child acting star of the 1930s who found renewed popularity in the 1960s as Josephine the Plumber in classic Comet cleanser commercials, has died. She was 95.

Her daughter, Kendall Errair, confirmed Withers died Aug. 7 surrounded by loved ones in Burbank, California. No cause of death was given.

"My mother was such a special lady. She lit up a room with her laughter, but she especially radiated joy and thankfulness when talking about the career she so loved and how lucky she was," Errair said in the statement obtained by USA TODAY.

In her first major role at 8-years-old, opposite "America's Sweetheart" Shirley Temple in 1934's "Bright Eyes," Withers stole the spotlight as spoiled, obnoxious Joy Smythe.

"I had to play the meanest, creepiest little girl that God ever put on this planet," Withers recalled in 2000. "I ran over Shirley with a tricycle, and a baby buggy. And I thought, 'Oh dear, everybody’s going to hate me forever because I was so creepy mean to Shirley Temple!'"

Quite to the contrary, audiences loved Withers. The young actress signed a seven-year contract with Fox Film Corporation, appearing in three to five films a year. Her first starring role, in the 1935 film "Ginger," began filming on Wither's 9th birthday. She played an orphan adopted by a rich family after her uncle's arrest.

Other titles included "Paddy O’Day," "Little Miss Nobody," "Wild and Wooly" and "The Arizona Wildcat." A theater owners poll named Withers one of the top money-making stars in 1936 and 1937.

Her popularity led to Jane Withers dolls, hair bows, socks and mystery novels. At her peak, she was earning $2,500 a week and $50,000 a year in endorsements. Unlike other child stars, her earnings did not disappear.

She explained in 1974: "Fortunately, my dad had a great love of California land. He kind of dibble-dabbled in real estate in a marvelous way."

As an adult, Withers starred as the oil-rich Vashti Snythe — alongside Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean — in the 1956 drama "Giant."

Withers underwent a fame resurgence in the 1960s and 1970s portraying overall-clad, smart-alecky Josephine the Plumber in classic Comet cleanser commercials. Ever the professional, Withers took a course in plumbing to fully understand the part for the the one-minute commercials. The ads ran from 1963-1974.

“Oh, the money is nice, all right,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 1963. “I got five figures for eight of those commercials, and I’m doing four more.”

After voice actress Mary Wickes died in 1995, Withers voiced the gargoyle Laverne in 2002's animated "Hunchback of Notre Dame II."

An interviewer in 1974 asked Withers how she managed to escape the troubles that plagued many child stars in adulthood. A lifelong Presbyterian, she commented: "I always took my troubles to the good Lord, and I never failed to get an answer."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Carl "Chucky" Thompson, a music producer who helmed hits for artists like Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J. Blige, has died. He was 53.

Thompson's publicist Tamar Juda confirmed the news in a statement to USA TODAY on Monday. She did not disclose his cause of death.

"It is with a very heavy heart that I can confirm the passing of Chucky Thompson," she wrote. "To anyone in his orbit, you know how generous he was with his energy, creativity and love. Both the music industry, and the world has lost a titan."

Audio engineer Gimel Androus Keaton, better known by his stage name Young Guru, mourned Thompson on Instagram Monday.

"There is nothing I can write that will take away this pain," Keaton wrote, along with a photo of him with Thompson. "I have to say RIP to my mentor, my big brother, the man who changed my life forever."

Keaton remembered Thompson as "the kindest person the world has ever seen" and "the most gifted musician."

"You treated me like family from day one," he continued. "You put me in rooms with Biggie. I will forever be in your debt and I will forever be your little brother. This one hurts so bad I can’t even explain it. RIP @chucklife365 there will never be another you!!!!"

Thompson got his start in go-go music as part of Chuck Brown's band The Soul Searchers. As a producer, he had a hand in bringing forth hit songs like Notorious B.I.G.'s "Big Poppa" and Faith Evans' "Soon As I Get Home," as well as Blige's 1994 album "My Life."

"There are so many different facets to production, I've always wanted to cover all of the bases," the Washington, D.C.-native told grammy.com last month.

Thompson's storied career also involved collaborations with Jennifer Lopez, Usher, Snoop Dogg and TLC and saw him become a founding member of Sean "Diddy" Combs' in-house production team, known as The Hitmen.

"A typical session was brotherhood, and that's how we kick it with each other to this day," Thompson said of The Hitmen. "We talk damn near every month at least and stay connected."

Rapper Biz Markie, whose hit 'Just a Friend' became a pop culture staple, dies at 57

Associated Press

NEW YORK — Walter Yetnikoff, the rampaging, R-rated head of CBS Records who presided over blockbuster releases by Michael Jackson, Billy Joel and many others and otherwise devoted his life to a self-catered feast of “schmoozing, shmingling and bingling,” has died at age 87.

Yetnikoff’s death was confirmed Tuesday by David Ritz, who collaborated with Yetnikoff on his memoir “Howling at the Moon.” Further details were not immediately available.

The stocky, bearded Yetnikoff was a onetime lawyer with a sharp mind, a foul mouth, a big heart, a tin ear, a roving eye and an extraordinary temper, a Jewish kid from Brooklyn whose hunger for recognition and power drove him to excess in every way. In “Howling at the Moon,” published in 2004, he described his life as a three-act play: Act 1, “I start to get crazy.” Act 2, “I get crazier.” Act 3, “craziest of all.” Once likened by The New York Times to the vulgar Jewish uncle “who asks his unsuspecting nephew to pull his finger,” he was a born kingpin who helped embody a moment when rock music became big business, embraced and absorbed by corporate America, when contracts and acquisitions seemed as eventful as the music itself.

“If you are successful — as it should be — you simply have to pay an artist, give them a check for all this money,” he told Rolling Stone in 1988. “It’s my pleasure to give Michael Jackson a big, big check. Number one, it shows that we’re successful. Two, whatever he earned, we earned more.”

He joined CBS as a staff attorney in the early 1960s, was named president of CBS Records International in 1971 and CEO of CBS Records in 1975, after Clive Davis was fired amid allegations of payola and mismanagement of expenses. Yetnikoff was a volatile man in a volatile and expansive era; throughout his 15 years on top he competed fiercely with Warner Bros. for industry dominance. Warner had Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles and Madonna. CBS had Jackson, Joel, Barbra Streisand and Bruce Springsteen. When Yetnikoff helped convince James Taylor to jump from Warner to CBS, Warner lured Paul Simon away from CBS.

His reign peaked with such mega-sellers as Jackson’s “Thriller,” Meat Loaf’s “Bat Out of Hell” and Joel’s “52nd Street.” CBS’ revenues more than quadrupled under his watch, from $485 million to over $2 billion, but he also blew a fortune by arranging costly deals for Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones and others past their commercial prime.

“If I were a CBS stockholder, I would sue for dilution of assets,” former CBS Records A&R chief Mitch Miller once complained.

He feuded with friends and enemies, with other labels and his own company. He called CBS chairman Thomas H. Wyman “Super Goy” and Wyman’s immediate successor, the cost-cutting Laurence A. Tisch, “the evil dwarf.” Simon would allege that Yetnikoff traumatized him to the point of writer’s block and turned Yetnikoff into a villain in his 1980 film “One Trick Pony,” in which Rip Torn played a boorish record executive. Yetnikoff could also be righteous, threatening to boycott MTV and its then-virtually all-white playlist after its initial refusal to air the video of Jackson’s “Billie Jean” and using his own money to buy back Joel’s song catalog from a former producer and give it back to the singer.

When he married Cynthia Slamar in 1987, Mick Jagger, Streisand and Springsteen were among the guests.

“To Walter — The wildest man north of Asbury Park,” Springsteen once wrote to him. “Thanks for your friendship.”

His downfall came amid a storm of corporate turnover and backstabbing, and Yetnikoff’s personal chaos. By the late 1980s, his marriage to Slamar was collapsing and his treatment for alcoholism had not cleaned up his behavior. He alienated Springsteen and Jackson among others, raged in public against rival mogul David Geffen and exasperated the executives at his new corporate parent, Sony, which had purchased CBS in 1987 — a deal Yetnikoff helped arrange. Forced out by Sony in 1990, he tried to make a movie about Miles Davis, and failed. He tried to start a new record company, Velvel Music Group, and failed.

“I wasn’t even thinking about getting out of bed,” he wrote in his memoir. “I drew the curtains, closed the blinds and stayed in bed for months. I was immobile. I was useless. I was racked with every lousy self-loathing feeling known to man.”

In recent years, he volunteered at addiction recovery centers in New York City and helped run Commotion Records. Yetnikoff was married three times and had enough affairs to make friends doubt he could ever commit to one woman. He would remember telling Streisand in 1985 that he was marrying Slamar, only to have the singer laugh and respond, “I don’t know anyone less suited to marriage. The chances of you being faithful are absolutely zero.” His third marriage, to Lynda Kady, did endure.

Yetnikoff grew up in a working-class neighborhood where trouble began at home; his father would beat him up, his mother wanted him to get rich. Damaged, but determined, he attended Brooklyn College as an undergraduate and received a law degree from Columbia University. After being stationed in Germany while serving in the Army from 1956-58, he returned to New York and joined the law firm of Rosenman and Colin.

Among his more ambitious peers was a balding young lawyer named Clive Davis, a fellow Jew from Brooklyn who would soon leave for Columbia records and, in 1961, convinced Yetnikoff to join him. He was soon assigned to collect $40,000 from Morris Levy, a music entrepreneur notorious for his ties to organized crime. Levy became a friend and even agreed to settle his debt.

“To bright boy Yetnikoff,” he wrote, “I’m not paying because I gotta. I’m paying because I wanna. I’d hate to see you in trouble so early in your career. That’ll come later.”

The NBC talent juggernaut held its first live show of the season Tuesday at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre following a two-week hiatus during the Tokyo Olympics.

"When you come from the audition shows to the Dolby, you have got to step your act up," judge Simon Cowell said.

The lights were brighter, the sets were bigger and the production value was top notch, but the pressure proved to be too much for certain quarterfinalists that drew mixed reactions.

"It was absolutely bloody awful," Cowell said about comedian Sethward's "confusing" peacock act. "We can now officially call this show 'America Does Not Have Talent.'"

The live-show jitters didn't stop there. "I sensed a lot of nerves with you tonight," Cowell told comedian Gina Brillon, who joked about her Latino heritage and growing up in the Bronx during her skit. "Was this, for me, better than your first audition? I don’t think so."

Howie Mandel said the Gangstagrass band's performance of a bluegrass-rap mashup was "underwhelming." Cowell agreed "the song wasn't good enough."

Heidi Klum hit back, "Why are you being grumpy again?" (Crews did promise at the top of the episode the judges would "argue" with each other.)

The first round of quarterfinalists included an array of talent, including comedian Kabir Singh, magician Dustin Tavella, Beyond Belief Dance Co., escape artist Matt Johnson and The Canine Stars animal act.

But it was the singers who stole the spotlight, including Madilyn Bailey, Peter Rosalita, the 1aChord trio and Golden-Buzzer winner Jimmie Herrod, who closed the show with a dreamy rendition of Gene Wilder's "Pure Imagination."

"You are the million dollar act. Drop the mic. Done. Bravo," Klum told Herrod. Mandel added, "If America decides a singer is going to win 'America's Got Talent' this year, you are the singer to beat."

Cowell described 1aChord's soulful rendition of R.E.M's "Everybody Hurts" as one of "the best performances of the night." Following 10-year-old Rosalita's powerful rendition of Whitney' Houston's "I Have Nothing," Vergara said she couldn't "believe that voice is coming out of you."

Only seven acts will advance. However, the fate of the contestants is no longer in the judges' hands. It's up to America.

"What a PERFECT night! BRAVO contestants!!! Best of luck to everyone," Vergara tweeted Tuesday night. "Who are you voting for??"

Fans can vote up to 10 times for each act on NBC.com/AGTvote and the "America's Got Talent" app. The seven acts advancing to the semifinals will be revealed during Wednesday's results show, which will include guest performances from "AGT" winners Brandon Leake and Darci Lynne (NBC, 8 EDT/PDT).

Viewers will also get to select one wildcard contestant on the first-ever Peacock special "AGT: America’s Wildcard," where five acts will take the stage once more to get into the second round of quarterfinals next week.

The five acts vying for the wildcard are singers Dylan Zangwill, Storm Large, Matt Mauser, comedian Mike Goodwin and magician Patrick Kun.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Stevie Nicks has canceled five forthcoming performances at music festivals, citing coronavirus concerns, she said in a statement Tuesday.

Nicks had been scheduled to headline one day each of BottleRock Napa Valley in California and the Jazz Aspen Festival in Colorado in September. In October, she was to have played two days of the Austin City Limits Music Festival and one day of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. (Organizers announced Sunday that the New Orleans jazz festival would not be returning this year after all, due to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Louisiana.)

The dates were all the shows she had planned for 2021.

"These are challenging times with challenging decisions that have to be made. I want everyone to be safe and healthy and the rising Covid cases should be of concern to all of us," the 73-year-old singer said in the statement. "While I'm vaccinated, at my age, I am still being extremely cautious and for that reason have decided to skip the 5 performances I had planned for 2021."

Most of the festivals themselves are moving forward with replacement headliners. Country star Chris Stapleton will take Nicks' place at BottleRock.

"Because singing and performing have been my whole life, my primary goal is to keep healthy so I can continue singing for the next decade or longer," Nicks' statement said. "I'm devastated and I know the fans are disappointed, but we will look towards a brighter 2022."

Nicks joins a growing list of artists who have canceled 2021 performances over COVID concerns, including Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine and more, according to Billboard.

More:Live Nation concerts to require vaccination or proof of negative coronavirus test – sort of

Meanwhile, the debate over whether vaccines or negative COVID tests should be required at live music events is getting louder.

So far, most artists and venues have fallen back on whatever local health authorities are saying at the time, resulting in an ambiguous patchwork where a concert for the same band at one venue requires proof of vaccination and another does not.

But last week, the company behind many of the biggest concerts in the country weighed in. Live Nation Entertainment, parent company of Ticketmaster and Live Nation Concerts, announced they were in support of artists who want to require proof of vaccination or of negative COVID-19 test results for attendees and staff at their shows.

"We believe this is a great model, and we have already implemented this successfully at many major shows including Lollapalooza," CEO Michael Rapino said in a note to employees. "We know people are eager to return to live events and we hope these measures encourage even more people to get vaccinated."

Some music festivals are updating their COVID-19 safety guidelines, too.

Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival implemented a policy Tuesday requiring 2021 festival-goers to show vaccination proof or a negative COVID-19 test in order to enter "Centeroo," the heartbeat of the expansive event grounds.

In a statement posted to social media, the festival encouraged ticketholders to receive a COVID-19 vaccine ahead of the September event. "The last day to receive the second shot of Moderna or Pfizer, or a single dose of Johnson and Johnson is Thursday, August 19th," the statement said.

Milwaukee World Festival Inc., which operates Summerfest 2021, one of the largest music festivals in the United States, also announced Tuesday that a COVID-19 vaccination or negative COVID-19 test result will be required to attend the Wisconsin festival, which runs Sept. 2 to 4, 9 to 11, and 16 to 18.

Lollapalooza a 'recipe for disaster,' experts warn. Should more music festivals be canceled amid COVID-19?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Aretha Franklin’s long road to “Respect” took a crucial turn with a phone call in 2012.

For several years, the star had talked up the possibility of a feature film about her life and music. Though she was brimming with ambition and ideas, it sometimes seemed her enthusiasm got ahead of her – as if she could wish a multimillion-dollar movie into existence.

At the urging of her longtime publicist and friend Gwendolyn Quinn, Franklin rang up the manager of the late Ray Charles. Joe Adams had been on the frontlines as the acclaimed 2004 biopic “Ray” came together to tell the story of another Black music icon.

“That was the conversation that really put her on a different path thinking about the project: ‘Wow, this movie thing is a long process,’” Quinn said. “Joe Adams explained to Aretha how involved it can be. He gave her some great, sound advice, and got her really thinking about the things she needed to think about.”

Review:As Aretha Franklin, a soulful Jennifer Hudson keeps 'Respect' from hitting the wrong note

The biopic “Respect,” starring Jennifer Hudson as the Queen of Soul’s sanctioned leading lady, will at last hit theaters Friday, three years to the week after Franklin’s death. The MGM film, directed by Broadway veteran Liesl Tommy and featuring Forest Whitaker as father C.L. Franklin, portrays the Detroit singer’s early years of talent, tragedy and triumph.

Aretha Franklin may be gone, but the new movie very much bears her fingerprints. In a backstory unusual for a Hollywood biopic but quite in character for the strong-willed Queen of Soul, the project was set in motion and driven by Franklin herself.

In her final years, it became her passion project.

“I knew it would happen because she wanted it to happen,” said her niece Sabrina Owens.

Determined to crystalize her legacy in her own way, the star worked for nearly two decades to bring her story to life somewhere — on the big screen, the stage, even television. She ground through talks with assorted producers and investors as potential deals arose then fizzled. She churned through picks for big-name actors and directors. Shrugging off Hollywood protocol, she publicly trumpeted those wish lists and negotiations as she went.

Over the years, the headlines became routine: Aretha has anointed Halle Berry! Audra McDonald! Fantasia! Jennifer Hudson! She wanted Denzel Washington to play her father. Terrence Howard could appear as lifelong friend Smokey Robinson.

Throughout the process, say people close to her, Franklin was intent on retaining creative control. After all, she had achieved musical heights and cultural influence few humans have experienced. Who better to tell Aretha’s story than Aretha herself?

Combine that with her wariness of outsiders — and her sensitivity about the portrayal of her family — and the journey to a biopic got complicated.

In June 2012, citing failed talks with an unnamed production group, Franklin told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, that artistic control had been a deal-breaker.

“They wanted to cast who was going to play me, but I wanted to cast who would play me, (along with) who was going to play my dad and the principals,” she said. “I felt by it being my story, I was the person who needed to be happy when it was over. I didn’t feel they were more qualified to choose those people, artistically, than I was. They don’t know the people. I know my family better.”

Greg Dunmore, a close friend of Franklin, said that throughout her film quest, the singer grasped the commercial realities and the need for a bankable movie. But overriding it all was a devotion to art for art’s sake.

“I wouldn’t say she was naïve. But she was headstrong. When she came up with a strategy, she was very convinced she knew what she was doing,” he said. “And when on top of that head is a crown, there’s a certain je ne sais quoi, something special. Aretha certainly understood the power she had as a celebrity, as a star.”

Still, one Hollywood veteran privy to Franklin’s dealings but not authorized to speak publicly said that for all her drive, a Queen of Soul biopic was unlikely to have materialized while she was here: The deeply private singer would have resisted the sort of screenplay needed to make a compelling, successful film.

“She was never going to approve a script. If it was truthful, there were things that would have been blasphemous to her,” the person said. “There was no way you were going to a make a movie with her while she was alive.”

The project that became “Respect” fell into place shortly before Franklin’s passing in August 2018. While there was no script, Franklin gave her blessing to producers Scott Bernstein and Harvey Mason Jr., who had a story outline and talked regularly with the singer. MGM was in the picture and, earlier that year, record mogul and Franklin confidante Clive Davis announced that Hudson was locked down for the lead role.

By 2019, Tommy was enlisted as director, and shooting began that fall.

Though no formal agreement was signed with Franklin before her death – producers did eventually lock down a deal with her estate – the film’s momentum was a final career triumph for the storied star.

“It makes me happy she was so involved, that she was excited about it,” Mason told the Free Press the afternoon of Franklin’s death. “I’m really pleased her story will be told by someone who loves her.”

An early interest in film

Aretha long had an itch for movie stardom.

In 1968, perhaps inspired by family friend and gospel great Clara Ward’s role in the MGM film “A Time to Sing,” Franklin reworked her Atlantic Records contract, turning it into a joint deal with the record label and its sister film studio Warner Bros.-Seven Arts.

But even as her music career soared, little became of her on-screen ambitions. In 1972, she appeared in an episode of the ABC-TV series “Room 222,” then stepped up for Sydney Pollack’s long-shelved gospel documentary “Amazing Grace.” Eight years later came a brief but memorable turn in “The Blues Brothers.”

By the 2000s, Franklin’s concert touring had become limited – she had a fear of flying – and her record sales were down. But what forever loomed large were her life’s journey and body of musical work.

Franklin’s 1998 memoir, “From These Roots,” had been a best seller. Now in her 60s, the singer had her eye on the bigger picture.

“People start thinking about their legacy, looking beyond their life," said Quinn. "She had done everything else. She had achieved so much. (A biopic) was the one thing she hadn’t done. And I knew it was becoming important to her because we started dealing with it regularly.”

A first meeting with Jennifer Hudson

Franklin initially set out to take her story to the stage.

In spring 2007, Franklin hosted three days of auditions in the Detroit area, welcoming actors and singers from across the country for a musical to be based on her memoir. It was to include a performer playing Aretha in her 20s – “the foxy R&B years,” as her casting call put it.

She wanted to debut the show in Detroit before taking it to Broadway, though the project ultimately faded away.

But it was there that Dunmore, part of Franklin’s casting panel, proposed Hudson as the Queen of Soul onstage, he said. The young “American Idol” champ had just dazzled with an Oscar-winning performance in “Dreamgirls.”

Franklin, he said, instantly shot down the idea. Dunmore said he pressed his case — Hudson had the right look and vocal chops — but Franklin was adamant.

According to Dunmore, it turned out that Franklin had recently met with Hudson for tea at New York’s Trump Tower and felt they hadn’t clicked.

“She interpreted that initial interaction badly,” Dunmore said.

While not asked about that specific contention in a recent Free Press interview, Hudson did describe an early meeting with Franklin that went somewhat awkwardly:

“Aretha asked, ‘How are you going to portray me?’ I said, ‘Well, how you like to be portrayed?!’ I thought, is she shy or something? Am I talking to Aretha Franklin?”

But by 2012, Hudson was firmly on Franklin’s wish list, as the star emphasized in interviews that year.

“I don’t know that we’re looking for an imitator,” Franklin told the Free Press soon after. “I’m looking for someone who can turn in a stellar performance.”

A breakthrough at last

Franklin’s biopic hopes finally started to gain real steam in 2015 — thanks to a gangsta rap movie.

“I’ll never forget the day she called and asked if I knew who Scott Bernstein was,” Quinn said. “I didn’t, but she told me he’s a producer — he did ‘Straight Outta Compton.’ Well, oh! I had fallen in love with that movie. I loved the story and fell for all the characters and actors. I saw it four times. I think that (reaction) gave him a notch up in her mind.”

Franklin had been linked up with Bernstein via Harvey Mason Jr., who had previously worked with the singer and was a music producer on the N.W.A. biopic.

Bernstein cranked out a two-page storyline ending in 1972, the year Franklin returned to her gospel roots to cut the blockbuster live record “Amazing Grace.”

Mason arranged a phone call with Franklin during which Bernstein laid out his vision for a film.

“You’re the queen,” he told her. “But we all have struggled. We all have to fight our demons.”

The singer heard him out as Bernstein described a movie that would chronicle the struggles of Black Americans in the ‘50s and Franklin’s early career battles — her “fight for female rights, civil rights, her own voice,” he said.

“If we can tell that story,” Franklin replied, “I’d love to be involved.”

Franklin’s interest was clearly piqued, but Bernstein didn’t hear back for a couple of months. For the next year, they periodically talked, steadily gaining each other’s trust.

At last, Franklin gave him the word: She was in.

Franklin’s talks with Bernstein accelerated from there. The producer insisted to her that “these stories come with the good and the bad, and we have to have both for the audience.”

They talked in depth about Franklin’s father, her ex-husband Ted White, Atlantic’s Jerry Wexler, her children.

“She was always very cognizant that she has four sons, and she wanted them to be proud of this,” Bernstein said.

By 2018, months before Franklin’s death, things were clicking. Bernstein and company had several studios interested, and MGM ultimately stepped up.

Hudson, meanwhile, was now Franklin’s settled pick. Hudson remembers the phone call from the Queen of Soul, who told her: “I’ve finally made my decision. It’s you, young lady, who I want to play me.”

And so in 2021, at last, “Respect” has arrived.

The film has been screened and warmly received by Franklin family members — and they say it’s what she wanted.

Owens, Franklin’s niece, said the only regret is that she isn’t here to experience the film and the fanfare.

“Hopefully, somehow someway, she’s in heaven seeing what’s going on because she would be so excited,” Owens said. “She was ready for it, she wanted it, she wanted her fans to see it. And I think she absolutely would have loved this.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It's not Mr. Roarke's "Fantasy Island," although Fox's reboot honors his legacy.

The latest reimagining of producer Aaron Spelling's hit 1970s ABC anthology drama, which stars Roselyn Sanchez ("Devious Maids," "Without a Trace"), closely resembles its namesake. But the new version (premiering Tuesday, 9 EDT/PDT) offers some twists to keep up with the times.

In both series, vacationers arriving in a tropical paradise – played by a cavalcade of familiar guest stars – are greeted by the island's steward, who channels the island's supernatural powers to help grant impossible wishes.

Many of the new edition's changes pay homage to the original, which featured Ricardo Montalban as Mr. Roarke. (The 1977-84 series, and a short-lived 1998 Fox remake are streaming on Tubi, and inspired a 2020 Jason Blum horror movie.)

Here's a look at how Fox's "Fantasy Island" compares with the ABC series:

Family ties: A Roarke connection

A woman stars in the new "Fantasy Island," and two more (Liz Craft and Sarah Fain) are its executive producers. That original star Montalban, who died in 2009, was of Mexican heritage was an even rarer occurrence in the '70s than today.

Elena Roarke (Sanchez) is the grandniece of Mr. Roarke, the imposing figure who made guests' wishes come true. But she's much more emotionally expressive, revealing details of a past romance to her assistant and moved to tears by a guest's story. There's sexual tension with the seaplane pilot Javier (John Gabriel Rodriquez), too. Viewers didn't even know Mr. Roarke's first name, let alone his internal feelings.

The imposing Mr. Roarke conveyed a hint of menace, a wry, "be careful what you wish for" head shake to vacationers wishing for the wrong things. One would expect nothing less from an actor who portrayed the imperious Khan, the greatest "Star Trek" villain.

Elena is more empathetic than her granduncle, who was wise but a little harsher in his take on the human condition. Her sunnier "Island" countenances guests' wishes with a more comforting Rolling Stones vibe: You may want one thing, but in the end,you get what you need.

Tattoo removal: Who replaces Hervé Villechaize?

There are clear connections between the "Island" overseers, but there's little similarity between their assistants.

Gone is Mr. Roarke's sidekick Tattoo (Hervé Villechaize), who provided comic relief that softened the series' darker edges. Villechaize, an actor with dwarfism, played an assistant to a James Bond villain (1974's "The Man with the Golden Gun") but became a star on "Island." (He died in 1993.)

Tattoo signaled the arrival of each week's guests by rushing to the top of a tower to ring a bell and shout his iconic catchphrase, "The plane! The plane!" That's gone, too.

Elena Roarke's assistant, Ruby (Kiara Barnes), is a woman who arrives on the island with a terminal illness but, via magical powers and Elena's empathy, regains health and youth. That's not out of line with the original, which hinted that Mr. Roarke was hundreds of years old.

They're still wearing white to greet guests

The new "Island" frequently references its forebearer, starting with opening credits that reveal a lush setting – it's filmed on location in Puerto Rico – and modern theme music inspired by the original's melody.

Elena, like her older relative, dresses in white, sometimes in a suit complete with a tailored vest. Ruby wears white, too, as did Tattoo.

Guests still arrive via seaplane, but also helicopter and parachute. Elena drives to meet guests in a red Jeep, an updated tribute to Mr. Roarke's quirky topless/doorless red station wagon with the red-and-white-striped canvas top.

Elena preserves his signature staff instruction – "Smiles, everyone! Smiles!" – and delivers the simple but memorable greeting, "Welcome to Fantasy Island!" Unfortunately, Elena's question to each guest – "What can the island do for you?" – sounds too much like a UPS slogan.

The first series cast many stars from other ABC shows ("Hey, there's Potsie!"). That's replicated by the Fox edition, which features guest turns by Bellamy Young (from the canceled "Prodigal Son"), Leslie Jordan ("Call Me Kat") and a "Melrose Place" reunion of Josie Bissett, Laura Leighton and Daphne Zuniga.

Episodes are still divided into two main stories, although some plotlines are more contemporary: Tuesday's premiere features a morning news anchor (Young) who wishes to eat as much as she wants without gaining weight after a lifetime of self-denial. And an older man learns his wife was in a romantic relationship with a woman before she married him.

It's a different "Island" world, designed for a different Roarke.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Trailer Tuesdays: Aretha Franklin biopic 'Respect' and other musical movies with soul

USA TODAY Film Critic Brian Truitt ranks the top musical movies with the most soul ahead of the Aretha Franklin biopic "Respect" hitting theaters.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Beyoncé has had many exciting moments including making Grammy history, launching fashion lines, and renting out The Louvre in Paris — but teaching her daughters about self care is one of the "most satisfying."

The record-breaking musician appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar September Icons Issue dressed in several designer outfits styled by Samira Nasr and Marni Senofonte. Her looks were captured by photographer Campbell Addy in luxury adornments including a Valentino bodysuit with matching cape, an elegant Gucci dress finished with lace and feathers, jewelry from Tiffany & Co., and a less than 10-gallon sized hat from Stetson. She also appeared in an alternate cover wearing western-inspired pieces head-to-toe from her latest IVY PARK release.

Her new IVY PARK collection, which pays tribute to "the culture and swag of the Houston rodeo," will feature a coordinating line for children inspired by her own clan with husband Jay-Z: daughter Blue, 9, and 4-year-old twins Rumi and Sir.

"My kids are usually on set with me for shoots, and we’d find ourselves putting them in extra-extra-smalls so we could match," she said in the story published Tuesday. "So, it is a natural progression for IVY PARK to introduce a selection of key silhouettes in children’s sizing."

Beyoncé shared a first look at her kid's collection Wednesday on Instagram in an ad that proved to be a family affair, including all three of her kids.

"The rodeo isn’t just for the grown ups. Introducing IVY PARK Kids," the caption reads.

The advertisement featured Beyoncé and Blue walking hand-in-hand in matching cow-print leggings. Another shot offered a close-up of Sir rocking a blue cowboy hat in his mother's arms, and in another quick frame, both twins posed alongside their mother in blue matching outfits.

And while her fashion is inspiring, her message about self care is even more so. In a cover story with the magazine, Beyoncé revealed how quarantine has given her a chance to focus on herself — and that her young girls are taking notice.

"I have not always made myself a priority," she told Harper's Bazaar Tuesday. "I have to take care of myself and listen to my body."

The 39-year-old singer said years of dancing in heels, wearing makeup and hair treatments took a toll on her health, but pandemic lockdown has allowed time and space for healing.

"I went from overindulgences to creating positive rituals," she said. "It helped with my restless nights and the agitation that comes from not being able to fall asleep."

Queen Bey said she feels pressure of being the "backbone" of her family and noticed how it can take a toll on her. Through taking this time to heal, she says the greatest benefit has been setting an example for her daughters.

"I’m so happy that my daughters will have the example of those rituals from me," she said. "One of my most satisfying moments as a mom is when I found Blue one day soaking in the bath with her eyes closed, using blends I created and taking time for herself to decompress and be at peace."

And it sounds like more music is coming for Beyoncé fans.

"I’ve been in the studio for a year and a half," she said. "There’s nothing like the amount of love, passion, and healing that I feel in the recording studio. … Yes, the music is coming!"

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you want to go to Summerfest 2021, you're going to have to add a COVID vaccination to your list of what to bring to the festival.

Milwaukee World Festival Inc., which operates the Wisconsin music festival, one of the largest in the United States, announced Tuesday that a COVID-19 vaccination or negative COVID-19 test result will be required to attend Summerfest, which runs Sept. 2 to 4, 9 to 11, and 16 to 18.

The requirement also covers the Wednesday standalone "preview" concerts before those dates at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater, as well as a Milwaukee World Festival-produced concert with Little Big Town and the BoDeans Aug. 13.

Summerfest's move comes as more music venues and performers push for more safety measures as COVID-19 cases surge again around the country.

“We collaborated with national health experts and music industry executives and determined this was the best course of action for Summerfest.” Don Smiley, president and chief executive officer of Milwaukee World Festival Inc., said in a statement.

“Milwaukee World Festival has been a community leader and a tremendous partner in prioritizing the health of festival staff, vendors, performers, and attendees throughout their planning,” Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson said in the same statement. “We are pleased with their proactive decision to implement these additional safety measures and ensure festivalgoers can feel comfortable attending this beloved music fest responsibly.”

What Summerfest is requiring

According to Milwaukee World Festival's statement, Summerfest attendees will be asked at the entry gate to show a valid COVID-19 vaccination card or proof of a negative test. An original vaccination card, a printed copy of a valid vaccination card or a negative test will be accepted. Documentation may also be digital, such as a screenshot or photo on a phone.

For patrons who are not fully vaccinated, a negative COVID-19 test result must be obtained within 72 hours of attending the festival.

Lollapalooza a 'recipe for disaster,' experts warn. Should more music festivals be canceled amid COVID-19?

Masks will also be required for all children 12 and younger, according to a Summerfest spokeswoman. Children younger than 12 are not yet eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.

Also, children younger than 12 will not be required to provide a negative COVID-19 test.

Summerfest is not requiring masks for visitors over the age of 12, although in its statement the festival urged, per current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, that attendees wear masks in indoor spaces on the Summerfest grounds. The CDC also recommends masks for unvaccinated people when they're at large gatherings.

Due to the fluidity of the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, Summerfest's safety protocols and procedures could change, the spokeswoman said. The festival plans to keep fans updated on its website.

Summerfest also said it would have information on refunds for general-admission and concert tickets on its website "in the days to come."

More concerts, venues adding COVID-19 protocols

Summerfest 2021 had been set for its usual June-July dates but was postponed until September in the hopes of getting out from under the COVID-19 pandemic. It returns next month after being canceled in 2020, the first cancellation in the festival’s 53-year history.

The pandemic also forced music venues in Milwaukee and much of the country to abruptly close their doors in March 2020. Only this summer have they begun to host shows again, prompted by growing vaccination rates and a decline in COVID-19 cases this spring.

But as cases have surged across the country in recent days with the rise of the more-contagious delta variant, music venues, and some performers, have been pushing for more safety protocols such as requiring masks or proof of vaccination.

But not everyone is on board with those policies just yet. In fact, Milwaukee World Festival is hosting multiple shows at the amphitheater and BMO Harris Pavilion outside of Summerfest that have yet to announce a vaccine or negative test requirement.

Those include: Chris Tomlin (Aug. 15 at the pavilion); Maroon 5 (Aug. 19 at the amphitheater); Doobie Brothers (Aug. 24, pavilion); Hall & Oates (Aug. 28, amphitheater); KISS (Sept. 5, amphitheater); Mt. Joy and Trampled by Turtles (Sept. 24, pavilion); Slipknot (Sept. 29, amphitheater); Alice Cooper (Oct. 1, pavilion) and Primus (Oct. 8, pavilion).

Ticket holders will be notified of any new protocols for those shows, and any new information will be posted on the amphitheater and pavilion websites.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Earlier this year, we discovered Cecily Strong has impeccable aim when she flung wine over her shoulder and repeatedly splashed Colin Jost on "Saturday Night Live," all while singing Frank Sinatra's "My Way" as Jeanine Pirro.

But with her new memoir, "This Will All Be Over Soon" (out now, Simon & Schuster), we learn that the "Schmigadoon" star also has a gift for beautiful prose. Strong eloquently writes about her experiences with loneliness, anxiety and depression, all of which intensified at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic early last year. She began seeing a man who tested positive for coronavirus just a few weeks after they met; meanwhile, she was still grieving her vibrant cousin Owen, who died of an aggressive brain cancer in January 2020 at age 30.

'Schmigadoon!':Cecily Strong's new show (lovingly) pokes fun at 'problematic' Golden Age musicals

Strong achingly conveys her fears of loss and uncertainty, as well as the emotional scars left by a physically abusive boyfriend she dated on and off for years.

The book began as a sort of exercise for Strong, 37, who started writing nearly every day during lockdown.

"I felt like in doing that, it allowed me to start processing," she tells USA TODAY. "I was also discovering these little 'gifts' and connections between things. It made me feel like I had a magical realism story of my own. I think you need a little magic to process really heavy things."

Strong, who is still unsure whether she'll return to "SNL" for a 10th season, talks more about her memoir and favorite memories on the NBC sketch show.

Question: In your book, you write, "I’m trying to get comfortable with living with the unknown from day to day." What has helped you cope with that?

Cecily Strong: Being more gentle with myself and letting myself be a little softer. I feel I had harder edges before. And I think looking for sunshine. Sunshine and gardening make me feel great. Just finding joy in little things like a good dinner. Taking the wins where you can get them and enjoying them.

Q: You write candidly about your abusive ex-boyfriend. How long did it take for you to recognize that relationship for what it was?

Strong: Even writing that was trying to see it in a different way. It feels like it's something we don't talk about a lot, and I wanted to make sure I'm explaining the love as much as I'm explaining the bad thing. It's really the first time I've ever talked about it, and that certainly felt hard. But as long as you're being honest and leading with love and compassion, then it made it feel OK to talk about.

Q: You leave 11 pages blank at the end of the chapter, to represent all the things he asked you to omit after reading it. Why were those important to include?

Strong: When I sent that to him, I was expecting a different response. It was just so cold and it really threw me and I was really upset for a couple days after that. It was sort of like, "Doesn't my story belong to me, too?" So I think that's why I needed to include that because even today, years later, it hurt me to have him coolly dismiss everything I'd just written and my own experiences. I hope he can read it in the way I intended to share it, which is that there's love there, too. It's not meant to hurt somebody.

Q: Congratulations on your second Emmy nomination for "SNL." How did it feel to be recognized for this season in particular?

Strong: The show being nominated for 21 awards felt really good, just because everybody put in so much. It was a really tough year and it was difficult a lot of the time to do this show. Me personally, even just getting the rapid test and the crazy anxiety you have for 30 minutes every other day, thinking, "Today's the day I find out I have COVID." And then thinking, "I just had that crazy anxiety. Now I have to go do comedy."

So it was a really challenging year for everybody, but it was so great to have each other and that last show was just so unbelievably moving. People (online) were talking about us crying at the top of the show – we were crying because we walked in and saw this audience for the first time in a year. It was such a loving experience to get to have that as the final show.

Q: I have to know: What was your trick to always nailing Colin Jost with Jeanine Pirro’s throwing wine?

Strong: (Laughs.) I don't know! I think it was just the magic of getting to do a live performance, because I'm not known for having good aim. I don't think anyone has ever said that about me before. My favorite thing about doing "SNL" is those moments of controlled chaos.

Q: Did you practice at all beforehand?

Strong: No, we couldn't practice. I got in on Saturday and we weren't even sure I was gonna have my tub of wine until dress rehearsal. So we were figuring it out in dress and on air. That's why the show is so much fun. You're nervous for eight years, and by the ninth year, you're like, "Let a dog crawl on my head," "let me climb into a tub of wine," anything.

Q: Two of my all-time favorite sketches of yours are "Reality Stars" with Will Ferrell and "Horace" with Bill Hader.

Strong: Oh my God, those are ones I'll watch every six months or so because they make me laugh so much. And obviously I'm laughing so hard (in the sketches), although in the "Reality Stars" one, it's hidden a little bit more because my face is pulled back.

Q: I'm sure it's like picking children, but is there one sketch you consider a highlight of your time at "SNL?"

Strong: It's tough to say. I love "Singing Sisters." I love "Debra's Time." I just went to Club Cumming after the "Schmigadoon" premiere and one of the guys came up and said, "You know, we sing 'Debra's Time' here every now and then." Hearing that just makes me so happy.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jason Momoa is dedicating "Aquaman 2" to an 8-year-old superfan who died after a battle with a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer.

The young boy, Danny Sheehan, went viral last year in a video that showed him ecstatically opening an "Aquaman" toy – so much so that he caught the attention of the superhero himself.

In December, Momoa surprised Sheehan with a FaceTime call and promised to ride dolphins with him someday. "Hi beautiful boy," Momoa said to Sheehan, who replied, "Hi Aquaman. I’m so excited."

Sheehan passed away Sunday in his family's arms, according to a Facebook post shared by 4TheLoveofDanny, an account the Sheehan family used to share updates on their son's condition.

"Just after midnight, while in our arms, Danny took his last sweet small warm breaths and took flight," it read.

"Surreal and utter heartbreak can’t even begin to describe this feeling inside," the post continued. "But, I have to believe that what I whispered to him was true. Because moms don’t lie. When you wake up in Heaven, baby, you will be safe and happy and cozy. You won’t be afraid. You will be with your brother. Watching over me and daddy and everyone. We will be so sad. But you can send us rainbows and butterflies and ladybugs to say hi. We will snuggle again soon."

Momoa shared the "heartbreaking news" on Instagram Monday.

"All my Aloha to this beautiful Ohana," Momoa wrote. "Love u baby boy rest in piece You will live in my heart." The actor then dedicated "Aquaman 2' to the "lil angel."

Original story:Jason Momoa surprises young ‘Aquaman’ fan battling cancer with 'beautiful' FaceTime call

Sheehan was diagnosed in 2017 with Pineoblastoma, according to Sheehan's GoFundMe account, which raised more than $137,000 last year.

The diagnosis did not dampen his spirits. During a holiday photo session last year, his parents captured Sheehan's pure joy while unwrapping an Aquaman action figure.

"Oh my gosh, my favorite one! Aquaman! I love Aquaman," Sheehan joyfully yells in the viral Facebook video from Nov. 15, which has garnered more than 5.2 million views.

Sheehan showed Momoa his beloved toy replica during their heart-to-heart call.

"I just wanted to say thank you to the community, friends and family on Instagram for reaching out and showing me this beautiful boy Danny who is going through chemo and has cancer," Momoa wrote on Instagram last year.

He continued: "I saw his video online that made me want to get in touch and FaceTime him and spend some time talking to him."

Momoa concluded his heartfelt caption by asking Warner Bros. to "get Danny a Aquaman Trident."

Sheehan's mother, Natalie, said Momoa's call made her son "the happiest little boy ever."

"Gratitude. Awe. Disbelief. Amazement. Shock. Holy Cow-ness! And back to unbelievable gratitude. Thank you to #prideofgypsies #jasonmomoa for your beyond kind heart. Thank you for making this call," the Boston resident wrote on Facebook Nov. 18. "He can’t wait to ride dolphins with #AQUAMAN!!"

She continued: "And a huge thank you to everyone who shared D’s video and made the seemingly impossible of him meeting his superhero hero totally possible! My mom heart is bursting with joy, thankfulness, and love."

Momoa said last year the "greatest part of being Aquaman is making children happy." The actor is set to reprise his role as Arthur Curry in the "Aquaman" sequel in 2022.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Coming soon to an AMC theater near you: Bitcoin.

During a quarterly earnings call with investors Monday, AMC Entertainment revealed it will soon have technology in place at all U.S. theaters to allow consumers to buy tickets or concessions online using bitcoins.

The theater chain said it will also offer support for Google Pay and Apple Pay at its theaters in the U.S. by the end of the year.

AMC Entertainment is "in the preliminary stage" of exploring opportunities to dive into the cryptocurrency space, said CEO Adam Aron.

Aron cited his work on the board of acquisition firm Centricus – which is in the process of buying a startup specializing in blockchain technology – in helping him learn about cryptocurrency and decide to allow bitcoins as a payment option for AMC.

"I've had to learn more in the past six months about blockchain and cryptocurrency than I learned about it in the entire decade before that," said Aron.

Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin has slowly generated broader acceptance as an option for payment. In April, Venmo launched a feature to allow its users to buy and sell digital currency, including bitcoins. In March, PayPal said it would support paying for goods using cryptocurrency.

Automaker Tesla initially allowed consumers to make purchases using bitcoins, but CEO Elon Musk halted it due to environmental concerns. At a recent crypto conference, Musk said Tesla will "most likely" accept bitcoins again when it's more environmentally friendly, reports TechCrunch.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Now that Chris Cuomo's big brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal, what's next for the CNN anchor brother who helped him respond to it?

Did the younger brother have anything to do with the governor's decision last Tuesday to step down in two weeks? Why are some critics calling on Chris Cuomo to be fired?

And what does CNN have to say about the prime-time anchor's future at the network? So far, nothing, though Cuomo's return to his show Tuesday night seems to suggest he isn't going anywhere. USA TODAY also reached out to Chris Cuomo for comment.

Why does it matter what happens to Chris Cuomo?

"What happens to him at CNN is less important to me than what happens to all the other journalists whose ethics will be questioned and whose bond of trust with the citizens they serve could be damaged by the choices he made," wrote Kathleen Bartzen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics and a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication in an opinion piece for USA TODAY published this week.

"When it comes to credibility and trust, people don’t see individual reporters or news organizations. They see 'the media.' So when one journalist or outlet makes questionable choices, the tarnish can easily spread to others. And make no mistake about it, Cuomo’s choices in this situation are questionable – at best."

Here's what we know:

What does Chris Cuomo have to say about the scandal?

On Tuesday, the CNN anchor returned from vacation to his show "Cuomo Primetime" to address the scandal.

"My hope is that ultimately everyone involved can get to a better place, that some higher good will be served in all of this," Cuomo said, after dedicating the majority of his hour-long program to President Joe Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Though the anchor said he refrained from covering the scandal on CNN due to his conflict of interest, he acknowledged he gave his brother advice on the sexual harassment allegations against him and revealed he urged the governor to resign.

"I'm not an adviser. I'm a brother," he said. "I was there to listen and offer my take. And my advice to my brother was simple and consistent: Own what you did. Tell people what you can do to be better. Be contrite. And finally, accept that it doesn't matter what you intended. What matters is how your actions and words were perceived."

Cuomo insisted he "never misled anyone" on his show and he "never influenced or attempted to control CNN's coverage" of his family. He added that CNN's rules preventing him from reporting on his brother remain intact.

"It was a unique situation being a brother to a politician in a scandal and being part of the media. I tried to do the right thing, and I just want you all to know that," he said. "This will be my final word on it, and I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to do so."

What role did Cuomo play in his brother's scandal?

Last Tuesday's scathing report by the New York state attorney general's office on Andrew Cuomo's behavior also involved Chris, who was interviewed as part of the investigation and testified that he urged his brother to show remorse in conference calls in which he participated.

"The attorney general's report makes clear his actions went well beyond that," says Bartzen Culver, including acting as a strategic adviser to the embattled governor's team while his employer covered the scandal. Cuomo was instructed not to discuss his brother on the air in recent weeks.

"CNN needs to commission a report of its own to determine just how its star anchor fit into this sexual harassment pushback effort," Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple wrote. "What, precisely, did he say in the conference calls? Was he aware that the executive chamber had provided false information to the Albany Times-Union as the paper explored the predicament of “Trooper #1”? What role did he play in the governor’s denials?"

Why are some critics calling for Chris Cuomo's head?

Wemple called on CNN to "investigate" Cuomo's role in helping his brother respond to sexual harassment allegations.

Another Washington Post media columnist, Margaret Sullivan, called Cuomo's actions "deplorable" and a failure to maintain "the most basic of journalistic principles, which are independence, fairness and impartiality."

His "supposedly" long-planned vacation "should be turned into – at least – an unpaid suspension of significant length," Sullivan wrote. "And CNN should be transparent with its viewers that its anchor acted unethically and that the network won’t countenance it."

What has Chris Cuomo said about his involvement?

He acknowledged on the air in May that he had talked to his brother and members of his staff in an advisory capacity as the governor's scandal was blowing up. This was not supposed to happen, per his bosses' orders, and he apologized on air in May.

"When my brother's situation became turbulent, being looped into calls with other friends of his, and advisers that did include some of his staff, I understand why that was a problem for CNN," he said. "It will not happen again. It was a mistake, because I put my colleagues here, who I believe are the best in the business, in a bad spot. I never intended for that. I would never intend for that. And I am sorry for that.

"I've never tried to influence this network's coverage of my brother. In fact, I've been walled off from it."

But Cuomo's explanation that he counseled the governor out of a sense of brotherly duty isn't a good excuse, Bartzen Culver said.

"I would argue that makes the ethic of independence more important, not less," she wrote. "He failed in (his) responsibility by entangling himself in his brother’s political strategy. And in doing so, he cast a shadow over the work of other journalists, as people – quite fairly – could see this as evidence that mainstream journalism is too close and too comfortable with the rich and powerful."

Robert Thompson, founding director of Syracuse University's Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture, says Cuomo aiding his brother during the controversy is a "big red flag that anyone in any conversation about journalistic ethics would be raising. To a lot of people, Chris Cuomo’s credibility has been severely affected."

What has CNN said about the conflict of interest?

The network was not pleased.

“Chris has not been involved in CNN’s extensive coverage of the allegations against Governor Cuomo, on air or behind the scenes," the cable network said in a statement in May, "in part because, as he has said on his show, he could never be objective. But also because he often serves as a sounding board for his brother. However, it was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor’s staff, which Chris acknowledges. He will not participate in such conversations going forward.”

Why hasn't Chris Cuomo talked about his brother's scandal on his show?

CNN told him he couldn't. Cuomo also explained this on air in March.

"Obviously, I'm aware of what's going on with my brother. And obviously, I cannot cover it, because he is my brother," he said. "Now, of course, CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively. And they will continue to do so. I have always cared very deeply about these issues, and profoundly so. I just wanted to tell you that."

Although Thompson agrees that Cuomo "shouldn’t be covering his brother because he’s a subject in the story," he says the network's spotty approach proves "none of this is in the CNN handbook, because they don’t seem to be acting in any consistent kind of way." That some anchors were "full-on" Cuomo while the governor's brother ignored it "was a really, really problematic situation for viewers."

What about those cozy pandemic chats between the brothers?

CNN said in a statement in February that those discussions were different because of the "extraordinary time" of the pandemic . Chris Cuomo had COVID-19 and was under quarantine in his house, and the talks were a useful way for his brother to urge constituents to protect themselves.

"We felt that Chris speaking with his brother about the challenges of what millions of American families were struggling with was of significant human interest," the network said then. "As a result, we made an exception to a rule that we have had in place since 2013, which prevents Chris from interviewing and covering his brother, and that rule remains in place today. CNN has covered the news surrounding Governor Cuomo extensively.”

Should Cuomo resign or be fired?

Thompson believes CNN and Cuomo can weather the storm of criticism.

"One of the reasons CNN is reluctant to get rid of Chris Cuomo is because he’s performing comparatively well on the network," Thompson says. "If the decision is to keep him on, I don’t think it will knock CNN off the air. We’ve have seen some other reporters get into some very serious journalistic issues, who have come back and managed to survive these kinds of scandals."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Move over, Steve Rogers. Peggy Carter's the captain now.

Animated series "What If...?" – the latest Disney+ Marvel project following "WandaVision," "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier" and "Loki" – reimagines key characters, storylines and scenarios in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first of nine weekly episodes (streaming Wednesday) takes fans back to "Captain America: The First Avenger" and explains what would have happened had British intelligence agent Carter (Hayley Atwell) received the super-soldier serum in 1943 instead of Army soldier Rogers (Chris Evans).

USA TODAY has an exclusive clip from the debut of "What If...?" in which a buff, souped-up Captain Carter wields Steve's familiar shield (now with a Union Jack instead of the stars and stripes), throws motorcycles and goes to town on a bunch of evil Hydra goons.

Ranked:Every Marvel superhero movie (including new solo film 'Black Widow')

Voiced by Atwell, Captain Carter takes on the Red Skull (Ross Marquand) and Hydra in their quest to use the powerful Tesseract. But even as a super soldier, she has to deal with a bunch of sexist military dudes not taking her seriously. Her love interest Steve is still in the picture and plays an important role: Instead of becoming Captain America, he pilots an Iron Man-like armored suit called the Hydra Stomper. (Other MCU movie actors returning to voice their characters include Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark.)

"It’s an exciting and worthy progression of the character," Atwell says of this new version of Peggy. "Audiences get to see her in a more dynamic way, and it puts an end to the now-tired narrative that she’s underused beside her male counterparts. She was. Many women across industries have been and are. It’s time for change and for seeing more characters onscreen implementing that. She knows her value, always has, and here she gets to live it out."

And while Steve took becoming Captain America very seriously, Peggy gets pure enjoyment from her extraordinary new strength and abilities. "The ease with which she wields her power allows for moments of levity, which add to her charm," Atwell says. "Work has to be fun, otherwise it’s a dispiriting grind. She’s got chutzpah and style and flair. It makes for a far more entertaining experience for the audience."

Putting the focus on Captain Carter was "a natural place to begin the 'What If...?' storytelling, to look at a movie that has been around longer than most of the MCU films and use that as our first foray into the multiverse," says executive producer Brad Winderbaum. Carter is "one of the most integral characters in the show" and fans can expect to see her again, he says, with the likes of Doctor Strange.

Atwell, 39, began playing the character in 2011's "First Avenger," then on two seasons of the 2015-16 ABC series "Agent Carter" and in several MCU movies, including a memorable moment with a time-traveling Steve in the final scene of "Avengers: Endgame."

Was that the perfect MCU ending for Peggy? "Structurally, yes," Atwell says. "The satisfying delivery of their return to one another and the eventual dance is an appropriate closing point to their romance. Of course, there was a lot more going on for Peg: She would have been living a full life, which was not touched upon, and I understand why. She would need a lot more screen time to explore that."

"What If...?" producers have said some storylines might make their way into future live-action projects. Atwell says she'd be game to play Captain Carter onscreen under the right circumstances.

With "brilliant" screenwriters such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Emerald Fennell "breaking through and adding multilayered and bold qualities to their female characters, the possibility of Peggy getting an opportunity to take the helm in a far more ambitious way does excite me," she says. "I would invest fully in a process where the right creative team was put together to pave the way for Peggy to tap into the cultural consciousness of today and become a modern heroine of our times. I wouldn’t settle for less than what she and the fans deserve."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival implemented Tuesday a policy requiring 2021 festival-goers to show vaccination proof or a negative COVID-19 test in order to enter "Centeroo," the heartbeat of the expansive event grounds.

In a statement posted to social media, the festival encouraged ticketholders to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

"The safety of our patrons and staff is our number one priority," the statement said, adding: "The last day to receive the second shot of Moderna or Pfizer, or a single dose of Johnson and Johnson is Thursday, August 19th."

Unvaccinated individuals must submit a negative COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours of entering "Centeroo," the hub featuring a majority of Bonnaroo entertainment and vending. They'll do so at the "Plaza" medical tents placed throughout the festival's sprawling campgrounds, and upon approval will receive a "Health Check Wristband" to allow for entry throughout the weekend.

For those who lose their vaccination card or miss the 72-hour window, Bonnaroo will offer rapid testing at all medical tents for $40. If an attendee tests positive, they will take a second complimentary test for confirmation.

All attendees with confirmed positive cases will have their festival wristbands removed and will be asked to collect their belongs and exit the site immediately. They'll also be given a card with instructions for how to request a refund.

Festival organizers request unvaccinated festivalgoers to wear a mask at all times at Bonnaroo — and masks will be required for all who enter enclosed spaces such as the plaza barns and general store.

Mere months after traditional large-scale concerts returned, the ground has been quickly shifting beneath the live music industry in recent weeks as the Delta variant becomes a growing concern.

Last month, Chicago's Lollapalooza festival made the call to require vaccination proof or negative tests for all attendees of the four-day event. Nashville singer-songwriter Jason Isbell made national news this week after announcing he'd implement a similar policy at all of his 2021 concerts, including eight nights at the Ryman Auditorium.

Nashville venues 5 Spot and City Winery have adopted vaccination or negative test policies for upcoming shows, while additional clubs plan to address vaccination requirements this week; Concert giant Live Nation rolled out a policy late last week that allows artists to require vaccination proof or negative test result for upcoming tours.

On Bonnaroo's social media channels, fan response to the decision has been largely positive, though not without its critics. Next, the Bonnaroo crowd awaits Thursday's release of the full festival schedule.

Bonnaroo takes place Sept. 2-5 at Great Stage Park in Manchester, Tennessee, about 60 miles south of Nashville.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"America's Got Talent" contestants laid it all on the line Tuesday to advance to the semifinals, but one Golden Buzzer winner didn't have the chance to.

"It was a great show (last night) but there was somebody missing – Nightbirde," Terry Crews said during Wednesday's live results show, referring to Ohio singer Jane Marczewski, who previously shared she has a "2% chance of survival" with "some cancer in my lungs, spine and liver."

Marczewski – who earned Simon Cowell's Golden Buzzer following an emotional performance about being more than her cancer – revealed on Instagram earlier this month she was withdrawing from the competition because her "health (took) a turn for the worse."

The singer virtually returned Wednesday to provide an update following her departure.

"I cannot say thank you enough for the opportunity to have a moment to share my story and we are witnessing such a beautiful picture of the human spirit," she said, adding that the overwhelming amount of support she received has "restored my faith in humanity."

'AGT' contestant Nightbirde withdraws from competition after cancer 'takes turn for the worse'

Cowell said Marczewski made the right decision to focus on "your well-being, your health and your recovery."

"You made the decision, rightly so, that your health is your priority right now and I know the last time we spoke you actually said that you feel like you let people down," Cowell told her, holding back tears. "On behalf of all of us, you haven't let anyone down. Even though you haven’t competed – you already won."

The reigning champ Brandon Leake also returned to "AGT" Wednesday to perform a powerful spoken word performance alongside the With Our Words Poetry Collective about his hometown of Stockton, California.

And now Leake is ready to pass on the torch to the next "AGT" champion.

Seven acts moved one step closer to claiming the grand prize by advancing to the semifinals with America's votes.

Here's what happened during the "America's Got Talent" semifinals:

'AGT's first live showhits high note with singers, flops with 'bloody awful' comic Sethward

The fans' picks

The three acts that received the most votes automatically advanced.

1aChord was the first act to move forward following their soulful rendition of R.E.M's "Everybody Hurts" that Cowell called "the best performance of the night." After advancing, Cowell told the trio they "have every opportunity to win this show."

Comedian Gina Brillon joined them in the safe zone soon after, despite the judges sensing some nerves during her act. The comedian had to pinch herself, "Am I actually having this moment?"

Singers Peter Rosalita and Jimmie Herrod, Sofía Vergara's Golden Buzzer, both advanced in a dramatic reveal that made viewers believe only one was moving forward. "You guys are so good at getting us," Herrod said.

Magician Dustin Tavella was also safe, leaving him feeling "super humble" and "super thankful."

The face-off

Madilyn Bailey (singer), Kabir Singh (comedian) and Beyond Belief Dance Co. (dance group) finished in the middle of the pack and were on the brink of elimination.

The three acts went head-to-head in a live voting round for the "Dunkin' Save," where fans had the opportunity to rescue only one performer. Whoever received the most votes in a 30-minute flash round would move on.

In the end, viewers saved Singh. "I know half of you voted for my mom, not me, but it's OK," he quipped.

But the results weren't over just yet. The judges had the chance to save either Bailey or Beyond Belief Dance Co.

"This is never an easy thing to do," Heidi Klum said before voting for Beyond Belief Dance Co. Vergara also picked the group of young dancers. Mandel and Cowell both opted for Bailey, sparking a tie.

The act with the most overnight viewer votes would advance: Bailey.

Eliminated

The four acts with the fewest votes – Gangstagrass (band); The Canine Stars (dog act); Matt Johnson (escape artist); and Sethward (comedian) – were eliminated.

Beyond Belief Dance Co. was also sent packing.

Next week

"America's Got Talent" will return on Tuesday for the second quarterfinal round (NBC, 8 EDT/PDT), where 12 other acts will try to blow America away to advance to the semifinals.

Next week’s performers include Aidan Bryant (aerialist); Dokteuk Crew (dance group); Johnny Showcase (singer); Josh Blue (comedian); Korean Soul (vocal group); Peter Antoniou (mentalist); Positive Impact (acrobats); Shuffolution (dance group); T.3 (vocal group); Tory Vagasy (singer); and Golden Buzzer winners Northwell Nurse Choir and Victory Brinker.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@LOS ANGELES – Jennifer Hudson was one of the last people on Earth to speak with Aretha Franklin.

The final of many conversations between Franklin and the actress hand-picked to portray her onscreen came days before the Queen of Soul's death on Aug. 16, 2018, at 76 of pancreatic cancer.

"One of the last things we spoke about was my son David loves to cook, because she loved to cook," says Hudson, 39, who moves from buoyantly showing off her purple fluffy slippers to somberly discussing the legend on a suite couch at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. "She told me what she ate and I sent her a video. I never heard back.

"It was the most bizarre thing. It was like when she died, I had literally just talked to her. Even down to the last day, we used to talk every week. I miss those talks."

Three years to the week after Franklin's death, the culmination of those conversations materialize onscreen with Hudson's performance in "Respect,"the long-delayed Franklin biopic finally hit screens nationwide this weekend.

"It's been a very long road," Hudson says.

Jennifer Hudson:Heads to Detroit to watch ‘Respect’ with Aretha Franklin's family

Hudson's public ties with her music idol can be traced all way back to 2004 – when the then-unknown Chicago singer belted out Franklin's 1970 hit "Share Your Love With Me" in her "American Idol" audition. Though she finished in seventh place on "Idol," a star was born.

After her Oscar-winning performance as Effie White in 2006's "Dreamgirls," Hudson would answer the common interview question of her next dream role with the answer "Aretha Franklin."

Franklin herself summoned a too-nervous-to-eat Hudson to a 2007 New York hotel breakfast meeting to discuss a possible screen portrayal. But the singer was one of many names discussed, and there wasn't even a screenplay at the time.

Nearly 10 years later, on a day off from her starring role in Broadway's "The Color Purple," Hudson finally received the fateful call from Franklin, who had retained the right to approve casting. She was the chosen one.

"She told me, 'It is you, young lady, who I want to play me,' " Hudson recalls, adding there was one condition. "She did remind me that she was the Queen of Soul and just as long as we had that understanding. I said, 'Yes ma'am, I know my place, and I respect that.' "

‘Respect’ was years in the making:The story behind Aretha Franklin’s long quest for a biopic

Through evolving cast changes and delays in pulling together Franklin's passion project – ultimately landing with director Liesl Tommy and a cast including Forest Whitaker as Aretha's domineering father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin – Hudson honed her Aretha Franklin performance, working four hours a day to play piano for the screen.

"I’m never gonna play like Aretha; that was a gift from God. I'm aware of that," Hudson says. "But I have my little ear. I can peck just a little bit."

With her former fellow "The Voice UK" judge Tom Jones working as her vocal coach, Hudson worked on her Aretha voice.

"You don't want to duplicate or imitate," she says. "But the resolve was to show her influence on me and pay homage to certain nuances, like the way she shaped her mouth when she sang."

When Franklin died, it was Hudson, dressed in black, who steeled herself to give the stirring version of the gospel singer's "Amazing Grace," which brought Franklin's mourning family to their feet.

"We are at Aretha Franklin's funeral, that's emotional enough, and then to have to sing – that's a whole other layer," Hudson says. "There were so many different emotions going on."

While filming "Respect" in Atlanta in late 2019, Hudson says, she would feel the singer's presence as she went through 83 period outfits, 11 wig changes and re-created historical performances such as at Los Angeles' New Temple Missionary Baptist Church – where Franklin's smash hit gospel live album "Amazing Grace" was performed.

The feelings were especially strong during one raw scene in which Franklin hits bottom with her drinking problem and sees a vision of her beloved deceased mother, Barbara (Audra McDonald). Hudson, whose own mother died in 2008, kept the makeup off and her hair untamed.

"I wanted it to be real," she says. "And it was so raw, I couldn't help but to relate to it: her loss, her story, it intertwined with my own in a way. So many pieces of this felt true to me."

After filming wrapped in February 2020, the single mom went into COVID-19 lockdown with her son David, 12 (with her onetime fiancé, former professional wrestler David Otunga), in her Chicago home. She still managed to organize an epic outdoor laser tag party in August for David's 11th birthday. "He's planning it this year. If anyone can top me, it's David," Hudson says.

The singer/actress has built a special wall at home for her accumulating acting awards and two Grammys (for "The Color Purple" cast album and her 2008 R&B album).

"So there's the BAFTA and the Grammys," says Hudson, using a hand sanitizer to represent the centerpiece Academy Award. "The Oscar sits in the middle with everything else around it."

She avoids the question of whether there's room for future awards. Hudson is not obsessing about "Respect" plaudits, even as she garners strong reviews for her performance.

“I just wish she could have saw it,” Hudson says, intoning Franklin, before coming to a realization. "Oh my God, this movie is finally here. It's happening. It's exciting and scary at the same time. But I don't even know what level that would be if she was actually here. I know Aretha would have something to say."

And if she could continue their conversations, Hudson knows what she would say.

"I sit here and think, 'I just hope I made her proud.'"
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@NEW YORK — R&B star R. Kelly will face an anonymous jury made up of seven men and five women when his New York City sex trafficking trial goes forward next week with opening statements.

The panel was sworn in on Wednesday after dozens of potential jurors were screened by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in federal court in Brooklyn.

The judge sought assurances from prospective jurors that they could remain impartial despite the bad publicity swirling around Kelly since his 2019 arrest. Some told her that they were mainly aware of Kelly from his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly.” Many said they knew little or nothing about the case.

Kelly, 54, won multiple Grammys for “I Believe I Can Fly,” a 1996 song that became an inspirational anthem played at school graduations, weddings, advertisements and elsewhere.

R. Kelly sex trafficking trialbegins search for a jury, amid COVID-19 precautions

The jury selection spanned three days with Kelly seen on a video feed sitting impassively at the defense table, wearing glasses and dressed in a suit. The scene was beamed into an overflow courtroom after a judge took the unusual step of barring the press and public from watching trial in person, citing coronavirus concerns.

The multiplatinum-selling singer has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of leading an enterprise of managers, bodyguards and other employees who helped him recruit women and girls for sex. Federal prosecutors say the group selected victims at concerts and other venues and arranged for them to travel to see Kelly.

Defense lawyers have said Kelly’s alleged victims were groupies who turned up at his shows and made it known they “were dying to be with him.” The women only started accusing him of abuse years later when public sentiment shifted in the #MeToo era, they said.

The trial had been expected to start earlier in the year. But opening statements were moved to Aug. 18 after Kelly fired his original lawyers.

What to expect: R. Kelly faces his first trial on sex-trafficking charges

Jurors are expected to hear testimony from several of his accusers.

A judge ruled earlier this month that prosecutors are allowed to present evidence about how Kelly allegedly had "sexual contact" with then- teenage singer Aaliyah, referred to as "Jane Doe #1," according to court documents, including their secret marriage.

The outline of the story of Kelly and Aaliyah, who died in a 2001 plane crash, has long been known although Kelly has never admitted to wrongdoing. They secretly married in 1994, when she was 15 and he was 27 – allegedly after he bribed a government official to obtain a fake ID for her showing her age as 18, according to a 55-page motion filed by prosecutors in July. The marriage was soon annulled.

In a pre-trial motion, prosecutors allege that Kelly believed she became pregnant, so he secretly arranged a marriage to protect himself from possible criminal charges, because a wife can't be forced to testify against a husband.

"It's clearly relevant and it clearly shows a motive for Racketeering Act Number One, so that is admissible," U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly ruled.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Running into your ex post-breakup is never fun. But having to keep acting like you're in love after you've called it quits? That's next level.

Joey King, 22, and Jacob Elordi, 24, stars of Netflix's rom-com trilogy "The Kissing Booth," met and began dating while filming the first film, which premiered in 2018, King confirmed that year to Bello Magazine.

Three years and two films later, the two have continued to play a couple despite their own relationship ending.

"The Kissing Booth 3" arrives Wednesday on Netflix, and prompts main character Elle Evans (King) to make a difficult choice between who she'll attend college alongside: her longtime best friend Lee (Joel Courtney), or boyfriend Noah (Elordi).

"No one's thinking to themselves, 'That was easy' because it wasn't," King told Cosmopolitan last September of continuing to work with Elordi. "I'm sure people will analyze every movement and every detail. And you know what? Let them. But at the end of the day, I was just thrilled to be Elle Evans again. Elle Evans needs her Noah Flynn, and whatever that means for my personal life, I'll do anything to make sure the story of my character who I care about so much is complete."

King and Elordi made it work professionally even through rocky personal experiences. We're looking back on other famous couples who did the same.

Tarek El Moussa and Christina Haack, 'Flip or Flop'

Tarek El Moussa and Christina Haack had been married for a few years when they began co-hosting the HGTV home renovation series "Flip or Flop" in 2013.

Though the two called it quits in 2016, they continue to co-host the show and co-parent their two children, Taylor, 10, and Brayden, 5.

"At the beginning, it was like pulling teeth," El Moussa told USA TODAY in 2019 of working with his ex. "Today, we have a good working relationship."

And they've both since moved on: Haack is now dating Joshua Hall following her marriage to Ant Anstead ending; El Moussa proposed to "Selling Sunset" star Heather Rae Young last year.

Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, 'Q’Viva! The Chosen'

Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony worked together plenty while they were a couple, but the content didn't stop when their marriage did.

The two briefly dated on and off in the late ’90s and early 2000s and collaborated on the 1999 song "No Me Ames" before tying the knot in 2004. In 2006, they starred in the musical biopic "El Cantante" and went on tour together the following year. They welcomed twins Emme and Maximilian,now 13, in 2008.

But in July 2011, the two announced an "amicable" separation. Just a few months later, the first episode of their reality talent competition show "Q'Viva! The Chosen" premiered, during which People reported Lopez joked that her and Anthony's relationship was “very Sonny and Cher after the divorce."

Now, following a split with fiancé Alex Rodriguez earlier this year, Lopez has reignited another one of her famed 2000s relationships: Bennifer is back.

Jennifer Aniston and Tate Donovan, 'Friends'

Tate Donovan recalled feeling like he was "sort of dying inside" playing Jennifer Aniston's love interest on "Friends" amid their real-life breakup in 1994.

“I was just happy to be on the team. The only bummer was Jennifer and I were breaking up at the time,” Donovan told Us Weekly in 2018. “And so that was tricky to sort of act, and act like we are just meeting each other, and falling in love, or whatever, interested in each other, when we’re sort of breaking up. That was just tough.”

The couple had dated for two years, but the relationship was coming to an end as Donovan was filming his arc as one of Rachel's personal shopping clients-turned-love interest on the hit sitcom.

“It was just six episodes. I mean, only because we were breaking up. We were like, ‘Hey, can we not keep doing this? ‘Cause this is really painful and tough,’” he told the magazine.

Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere, 'Heroes'

Milo Ventimiglia vowed he would "never do it again" when asked about dating a co-star after his high-profile relationship with fellow "Heroes" star Hayden Panettiere came to an end before the show did.

The two began dating in 2007 after meeting on the set of the NBC superhero drama, where they both held starring roles: Ventimiglia as hospice nurse Peter Petrelli and Panettiere as high school cheerleader Claire Bennet. They called it quits in 2009 but remained working together on the show for another year.

“There are things that happen to you in your life that shape who you are," he reflected to Mr. Porter in 2017. "Everything I’ve been through from jobs to friendships to partnerships, everything has built me to who I am. You learn from it. You learn a better way of doing things. It wasn’t until my mid to late twenties that the job wears on you, relationships wear on you. But I wouldn’t change a thing. When you get knocked over the head in life, it builds your perspective.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dolly Parton announced this week that she is co-authoring her first novel next year – and releasing an album inspired by the book.

“Run, Rose, Run,” which the country music icon is writing with bestselling author James Patterson, will be released by Little, Brown and Company on March 7, 2022. An album based on the book will also be released alongside the novel.

“I cannot be more excited about the release of my very first novel 'Run Rose Run' with the great James Patterson,” Parton shared on Facebook on Wednesday.

“I also have a new CD to go along with the book. All new songs written based on the characters and situations in the book. I hope you enjoy the book and the songs as much as we’ve enjoyed putting it together,” she added.

Patterson on Wednesday tweeted that he is “delighted to team up with America’s most beloved superstar” on the project.

The 400-page novel is “a thriller about a young singer-songwriter on the rise and on the run, and determined to do whatever it takes to survive,” according to Little, Brown and Company's website.

“Nashville is where she’s come to claim her destiny. It’s also where the darkness she’s fled might find her. And destroy her,” the site adds.

USA TODAY has reached out to Parton’s representatives for more information.

Although the book marks the “Jolene” singer’s first novel, it isn’t her first foray into literary works. Parton has authored multiple books, including a coffee table book last year telling stories behind more than 170 of her songs.

Parton in 1995 started the Imagination Library program, which has mailed free books to millions of children between birth and the start of kindergarten. Parton this year presented the 100 millionth book donation from Imagination Library to the Library of Congress’s collection.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Associated Press

MADRID (AP) — Declaring “victory” over Instagram after a controversial poster for his upcoming film was censored and then reinstated, Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar said Thursday that society must be alert to the power of algorithms in deciding what humans are permitted to see.

“We have to be vigilant before the machines decide what we can and cannot do,” Almodóvar said after a poster for “Parallel Mothers” displaying a lactating nipple was removed by Instagram’s algorithm due to its ban on nudity. The social network has since apologized and backtracked after recognizing the “artistic context” of the image.

Almodóvar, in an emailed statement, thanked thousands of Instagram users who kept re-uploading the image after it was removed.

“You have succeeded in getting the minds behind the algorithm that decides what is or is not obscene and offensive to back off and allow the poster to circulate freely,” he said. “No matter how much information the algorithm possesses it will never have a heart or common sense.”

Instagram’s parent company Facebook apologized the day prior for removing the official poster, telling The Associated Press on Wednesday that several images of the poster for “Madres Paralelas,” which shows a lactating nipple, were removed “for breaking our rules against nudity” after they were uploaded on Monday.

“We do, however, make exceptions to allow nudity in certain circumstances, which includes when there’s clear artistic context. We’ve therefore restored posts sharing the Almodóvar movie poster to Instagram, and we’re really sorry for any confusion caused,” the company said in an emailed statement.

Facebook and Instagram’s longstanding rules — and previous bans — have spurred the use of the #FreetheNipple movement and hashtag on Instagram, which is used by many artists and celebrities to portray nipples despite the rules. The ban does not extend to male nipples.

The poster’s Spanish designer Javier Jaén told AP that he had questioned whether the poster would have trouble on social networks but stayed true to his vision after receiving the personal backing of Almodóvar. “He told me that he had made films with posters his whole life, long before Instagram, and he would keep doing so after Instagram, too,” Jaén said.

“This is probably the first image I saw when I was born. A company like Instagram tells me my work is dangerous, that people shouldn’t see it, that it’s pornographic. How many people are they telling that their body is bad, that their body is dangerous?” Jaén added, noting he had received overwhelming support and thousands of people had reposted his poster on Instagram.

“They say their technology can’t differentiate the context. I don’t care. Change your technology then,” the designer said.

Jaén had written in a post that the poster had been removed from his Instagram page on Tuesday: “As expected, @instagram took down the poster that we made for the latest Almodóvar film #madresparalelas.” After reposting the image, he said, it was allowed to stay.

A request for comment from Almodóvar’s production company went unanswered.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"Jeopardy!" had 16 guest hosts in the wake of Alex Trebek's death, only to name executive producer Mike Richards Wednesday as its new permanent host, beginning with the 38th season on Sept. 13.

Another guest host, actress and neuroscientist Mayim Bialik, will host primetime specials and tournaments on ABC, beginning with a national college contest next year.

Producer Sony Pictures Television says it relied on focus groups of viewers, general fan reaction, social media and, yes, TV ratings, to guide it in picking Trebek's successor.

More: 'Jeopardy!' announces two new hosts: Mike Richards and Mayim Bialik

But while the seven months of rotating quizmasters was perceived as an on-air auditions, "this is not a host competition," Richards told USA TODAY last February. "This is people who love this game, and their respect for Alex is off the charts. That’s how we went about it: Who would feel a connection? Who has the unique talents? Because it’s so hard to host the show, as I can tell you having hosted five series myself. Each person brings their own intense love for the game."

Ratings are an important but imperfect way to measure success: Some fans watch the show regardless of the host; there was tremendous interest in the immediate aftermath of Trebek's last show Jan. 8, fueling ratings for early guest hosts including former champion Ken Jennings, who presided over the show for the next six weeks; and TV usage declines in summer, depressing ratings in recent weeks, including for LeVar Burton, the most recent host for which ratings are available. But it's a useful guide to see peaks (Aaron Rodgers) and valleys (Dr. Mehmet Oz, Anderson Cooper).

"Jeopardy!" is the most-watched show in syndication this season, averaging 8.7 million viewers.

The show's 37th season wraps up Friday with Fox Sports' Joe Buck as the final guest host.

Tucker Dupree’s life changed dramatically when he was a senior in high school looking forward to adulthood and the independence it would bring.

When he woke up on Oct. 18, 2006, he couldn’t see anything from the center of his left eye. Four months later, the condition worsened as he lost central vision in both eyes.

Dupree was eventually diagnosed with Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, an inherited disease that causes blindness.

“Acquiring my disability at the age of 17 changed my life forever,” he said. “I have been able to show people what you can do with this disability and help shed light on: ‘It's not what happens to you, it is what you do with what happens to you to help write your legacy.’”

In 2012, Dupree, now 32, won three medals in swimming at the Paralympic Games in London six years after losing his central vision, and he added a fourth during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.

His story of perseverance and resilience appeared in The New York Times. Now he is among six people sharing personal stories as part of USA TODAY Storytellers Project’s virtual show, which is also a benefit for No Kid Hungry.

No Kid Hungry works with communities nationwide to feed children by distributing grants to schools, food banks and community groups, while also providing advocacy and raising awareness.

The show will livestream at 7 p.m. ET on Aug. 26. Register in advance to receive a reminder at https://www.storytellersproject.com/all-events and watch on the Storytellers Project’s Facebook page, YouTube channel or website.

Also sharing stories are:

Lydia M. Sites, 43, of Cincinnati, Ohio

Chris Howlett, 28, of Louisville, Kentucky

Peggy Lawrence, 49, of Conyers, Georgia

Juan Carlos Luna Vargas, 42, of San Bernardino, California

George Baker of Atlanta, Georgia

Like Dupree, Howlett had to overcome obstacles during his formative years. He grew up in foster care and struggled through school while facing uncertainties as he moved in and out of more than 100 foster homes.

Howlett said he didn't find stability until he graduated from the University of Louisville. It was his drive and optimism that kept him from falling through the cracks, he said.

"I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination," Howlett said.

Lawrence, a school nutrition director in Rockdale County Public Schools in Atlanta, will talk about her work ensuring children who were educated at home during the pandemic still received a nutritious lunch.

She said the school district delivered 2.7 million meals via school bus routes.

“My story will center on the myriad of emotions that I dealt with, including the incredible kindness and collaboration we received from our community,” she said.

“I hope to convey that when times are tough, it is the simplest things that bring comfort and joy to those around us. Food and the human connection mattered more than ever, and those are what we do best.”

Luna Varga, a teacher in Rialto, California, has a story about how his elementary school teacher inspired him to dream bigger.

“I wanted nothing more than to be a dishwasher,” he said. “Lucky for me, my fifth-grade teacher, Ms. Linda Brown, changed my life. She made me believe that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to.”

This show will also include an interview led by Storytellers Project founder and Director Megan Finnerty and Pamela Taylor, senior vice president and chief communications and marketing officer at No Kid Hungry.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This holiday season, Michael B. Jordan is gifting us a dose of romance.

The action star takes on his first romantic drama with “A Journal for Jordan” (due in theaters this December), a true story of a soldier deployed to Iraq who keeps a journal of love and advice for his infant son.

USA TODAY has the exclusive first look at the trailer and photos for “A Journal for Jordan,” directed by Denzel Washington and based on the bestselling memoir by Pulitzer Prize-winning former journalist Dana Canedy about her late partner, Sgt. Charles Monroe King.

Taking a break from action films like “Without Remorse” and the “Creed” franchise “was a good change of pace,” Jordan says. “I've done a lot of physical roles, because that's been my appetite. I'm 34; the last seven years has been (about) physically developing into your sweet spot.” But he says he was ready to try something more exposed. "I felt safe to be able to go into this, to explore these characters, and to be vulnerable in that type of way."

It helped that Washington, who last directed the 2016 Oscar nominee "Fences," was behind the camera, offering what the actor calls "a master class of character development and directing."

“Everybody wants to work with him, and he's a very selective guy,” says Jordan, who is also a producer on the film. “So the fact that he wanted to work with me was a huge deal for me.”

Canedy, a publishing executive at Simon & Schuster whose son is now 16, shared her stories with the filmmaking team, pointing “us in the right direction of what they were going through during these times," Jordan says. "The story would not be happening if it wasn't for (the family's) approval and signoff on everything."

Onscreen as Iraq-bound soldier Charles, the actor embodies the ideal – and yes, ripped – partner, showering the woman in his life (Chanté Adams as Dana) with adoration and sweet gestures. “Dear Jordan,” Charles writes to his baby son, “just take one look at your mother. That will tell you what I think beautiful is.”

How much of a hearts-and-flowers guy is Jordan? The actor opened a window into his personal life this pandemic year, sharing occasional photos on social media with his girlfriend, Lori Harvey.

“I consider myself a romantic. I like love. I've had an amazing example of what love looks like growing up,” says Jordan, noting he naturally gravitates toward “being able to be a person of service. … There's a certain level of catering to that I enjoy.”

That doesn’t mean he’s a devotee of the heart-twisting genre. “Typically I don't watch a lot of romantic movies. That's not my go-to,” he says, although his favorites include classics like “Love & Basketball” and “Love Jones.” When "Journal" crossed his path, "it was just the right time to do it."

“Journal” began shooting last December, months before the vaccination rollout began. “I got tested near five, six days a week,” he says. “Just trying to be responsible. I stayed indoors, stayed to myself a lot.”

During production, which ended in April, he recalls “getting used to the process of face shields and face masks and on set (figuring out what) protocol was going to be. We went through all the steps to make sure that there weren't any hiccups and delays in production. It was as normal as it could have been at that time.”

And while new films are now often streaming concurrently with their theatrical release, “Journal” is still aiming for a traditional debut. According to Washington’s pointed narration in the trailer, audiences will be able to catch his new film “exclusively in theaters this Christmas.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The long-running quiz show is making Double Jeopardy a reality by announcing two new permanent hosts: Executive producer Mike Richards, who will lead the nightly syndicated "Jeopardy!" and "The Big Bang Theory" star Mayim Bialik, who will take on primetime specials and tournaments on ABC, starting with a college championship next year.

"Jeopardy!" has spent the past seven months rotating 16 guest hosts at the podium once manned by late host Alex Trebek. Some, including LeVar Burton and former champ Ken Jennings, were contenders for the permanent slot, while others, such as "Good Morning America" anchor Robin Roberts, were paying tribute to Trebek's legacy.

Two of them – Richards, 46, and Bialik, 45 – got the permanent nod from Sony Pictures Television.

How they fared:'Jeopardy!': You had your favorites, but how did the guest hosts fare in the ratings?

"I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to host the syndicated version of 'Jeopardy!,' ” Richards said in the Wednesday announcement. “Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined being chosen to step into a role of this magnitude."

Richards, only the second host in the current version of the show's 37-year history, will take over for the 38th season premiere on Sept. 13, and is expected to step down from his producer role. (The season finale, with guest host Joe Buck, airs Friday). Variety last week reported Richards was the front-runner, but Sony declined to comment at the time.

Richards was also a top pick of USA TODAY's TV critic Kelly Lawler who kept tally and ranked all 16 of the guest hosts' performances. While some fans complained that Richards picked himself for the job, the final choice was made by top Sony executives, based on focus groups and other data, and Richards told staffers in a memo this week that the choice was not his to make.

"I was very surprised by the reaction to me and very flattered," Richards said in an interview last May. "I think it speaks to the passion of our fan base that they can (embrace) a guy that's unknown."

Bialik, who also stars in Fox sitcom "Call Me Kat," described the potential to host the show more permanently a "dream job."

The dream became a reality and Bialik describes it as "surreal."

“I couldn’t be more thrilled to join the Jeopardy! family,” Bialik added in a statement. “What started out with my 15-year-old repeating a rumor from Instagram that I should guest host the show has turned into one of the most exciting and surreal opportunities of my life!"

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vicente Fernández is recovering after suffering a traumatic fall.

The legendary Grammy Award-winning Mexican singer, known for hit songs such as "“El Rey” and "Para Siempre," underwent surgery in Guadalajara and is on a ventilator, according to a statement written in Spanish and shared to his social media Tuesday.

Fernández is in "serious but stable" condition following a fall that caused a spinal cord injury. He is currently on "ventilatory assistance and in critical patient care in the intensive care units," the statement said.

While the 81-year-old king of ranchera music is on a ventilator, his brain function is intact, according to his doctors. They expect his mobility to improve and say he’s only minimally sedated.

Opinion:I survived COVID after being on a ventilator, but my nightmare was far from over

The post added that it would keep the singer's followers informed and requested privacy. It also noted that his family members will not be providing interviews.

His son, singer Alejandro Fernández, shared a photo of himself with his father on social media.

"I love you, dad,"he captioned his post in Spanish.

Fernández has sold more than 65 million albums and filmed more than 35 movies. He has won three Grammys and eight Latin Grammys, in addition to being named Person of the Year by the Latin Recording Academy in 2002.

This isn't the first time Fernández has struggled with a health issue. In 2019, he revealed he had a cancerous lump in his liver, but refused a liver transplant out of concern that his donor could be a "homosexual" or an "addict."

"They wanted to give me some other man's liver, and I told them 'I'm not going to sleep next to my wife with another man's liver,' " Fernández said at the time on a Mexican TV program "De Primera Mano." "I don't even know if he was homosexual or a drug addict."

His controversial comments stirred backlash online.

"Let me remind yall (sic) Vicente Fernandez said he would rather die than get a liver from a gay person when he was needing a transplant soooo," user @whoachata wrote Wednesday.

Others have shown support for the singer.

"From the bottom of my heart I respectfully send LOVE prayers healing vibes to the legend Vicente Fernández currently in the hospital in Guadalajara," user @lorinkotb wrote.

A year after that controversy, he faced pulmonary thrombosis, and in March 2015, the singer had three hernias removed.

This year, Fernandez was faced with the release of photos that appeared to show him touching women without their consent while he was posing with them. He was also accused of sexual abuse by singer Lupita Castro. Fernandez has denied any inappropriate behavior.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Justin Bieber leads the nods with seven, including artist of the year and video of the year for “Popstar,” with DJ Khaled and Drake.

Megan Thee Stallion has six, including one for artist of the year.

Billie Eilish, BTS, Doja Cat, Drake, Giveon, Lil Nas X and Olivia Rodrigo each have five nominations.

VMAs will return to a live production at Barclays Center in New York at 8 p.m. ET Sept. 12.

A high-profile cameo in “Popstar” and his own No. 1 hit “Peaches” launched Justin Bieber to the top of the nominations list for the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards.

Bieber leads the lineup with seven nominations, including artist of the year and video of the year for “Popstar,” his collaboration with DJ Khaled and Drake.

Nipping at Bieber’s tally is Megan Thee Stallion with six nods, also including one for artist of the year. The majority of the rapper’s nominations are for “WAP,” her saucy pairing with Cardi B; the duo’s performance of the song on the Grammy Awards in March courted both controversy and praise for its raunchy display.

Surprise:Justin Bieber drops unannounced EP "Freedom"

The VMAs will return to a live production from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, at 8 p.m. ET Sept. 12. Last year, the show was originally scheduled to take place at the venue until rising COVID-19 cases forced producers to call an audible and stage some performances outdoors and some in front of a green screen.

With the current surge of the coronavirus causing more uncertainty, show officials will announce additional protocols closer to the event.

Following the leading nominations from Bieber and Megan Thee Stallion are a slew of chart-toppers with five nods each – Billie Eilish, BTS, Doja Cat, Drake, Giveon, Lil Nas X and breakthrough darling Olivia Rodrigo.

Perennial favorite Taylor Swift will vie for four awards, including artist of the year and three for "Willow," while other familiar VMA artists – Ariana Grande, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak and Ed Sheeran – scooped up three nominations each.

Review: Taylor Swift's "Evermore" is spellbinding

Fans can vote for their favorite artists in 14 gender-neutral categories, including video of the year, artist of the year and best collaboration, through Sept. 3 at vma.mtv.com. Voting for the best new artist award will continue into the live show.

Black Eyed Peas star will.i.am. talks about headlining the upcoming Global Citizen Live concert event, which will also see performances from stars including Coldplay, Billie Eilish, Jennifer Lopez, Lizzo and Ed Sheeran. (Aug. 11)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nate Burleson will spend more time in front of the CBS cameras after the network announced a new long-term deal with "The NFL Today" analyst Wednesday.

The deal will expand the former wide receiver's role across CBS News and CBS Sports, including joining "CBS This Morning," the network's morning program, as co-host alongside Gayle King and Tony Dokoupil, starting in September. He'll replace longtime journalist Anthony Mason, who will remain with CBS to report on culture.

"This is an extraordinary opportunity, and I look forward to the challenge of upholding the standard set by the legends who came before me,” said Burleson in a statement. “Life is about being ready for the right opportunities, and I have been preparing for this moment since my first day on television."

Burleson, 39, regularly appeared on the network since 2017 when he joined "The NFL Today," the network's pregame, halftime and post-game show. He'll continue as an analyst on the show.

"Nate is an extremely gifted broadcaster, interviewer and storyteller, whose deep curiosity and enthusiasm is the perfect fit for mornings on CBS," said Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations. "His wide range of experience and interests -- from news to sports, from music to poetry, and from fashion to cryptocurrency -- provides a unique perspective that will deepen the show's connection with our viewers. He excites audiences in every arena, and we're fortunate to have Nate joining Gayle and Tony at the table in September."

Burleson's new contract includes yearly appearances on Nickelodeon, which debuted kids-themed NFL coverage in 2020 with Burleson as part of the broadcast team.

He will also continue to have a role on NFL Network, where he most recently served as co-host for the daily show, "Good Morning Football."

Burleson played in the NFL from 2003-13 with the Minnesota Vikings, Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions, compiling 5,630 receiving yards and 39 receiving touchdowns in his career.

"Having a chance to inform, enhance or simply brighten up the morning for our viewers is an honor," Burleson said. "The sport of football and I will always be inextricably intertwined."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@And you thought royal renegades Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were a problem for the British? Now it's Harry's uncle, Prince Andrew, once again in the withering spotlight – and it's not looking good.

In what appears to be a first for a senior royal, the Duke of York – second son of Queen Elizabeth II, ninth in line to the throne – has been sued in federal court in New York and accused of sex crimes, including being a knowing beneficiary of the alleged sex-trafficking of a teen girl by Andrew's former friend, the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

As far as his already tattered public image is concerned, the damage to Andrew is irreparable, and his legal team's strategy has been puzzling silence.

But that's probably the right course because his legal predicament might not be as dire as it looks owing to the intricacies of international law, says Mark Stephens, a specialist in international law with the prominent London firm Howard Kennedy.

"There's no good outcome to this for Prince Andrew" in terms of his reputation, Stephens told USA TODAY. "The best option for him is to not make anything worse. (His lawyers) know this and he is being advised that the legal process is bristling with complexities" that could at least delay the case for years or even provide the prince with a legal escape route.

Virginia Roberts Giuffre, now 38, accuses Andrew of sexually abusing her at Epstein's mansion in Manhattan in 2001 when she was 17, asserting it was an encounter arranged by Epstein for his royal pal and that Andrew knew it. Andrew has repeatedly denied her accusations, beginning in 2015.

At the moment, lawyers say, Andrew is already seen as guilty in the court of public opinion, of poor judgment at best and sex crimes at worst.

It's "game over" for what's left of Andrew's reputation, declares Amber Melville-Brown, a British lawyer and partner in the media-and-reputation team at the international law firm Withers.

British royals generally abhor appearing in court (let alone to answer for sex-crime allegations). That's been the case ever since Queen Victoria's son Bertie, later Edward VII, appeared as a witness in two court cases (a divorce case and a slander case) in the late 19th century, which was utterly shocking to Victorian Britain at the time.

For more than five years, Andrew, 61, has vehemently denied all the accusations, and Buckingham Palace has backed him up in emphatic statements. Neither has yet responded specifically to the lawsuit.

But the suit has placed Andrew, his family, the British government and one of its key pillars, The Crown (the real one, not the Netflix series), in a right royal muddle.

If Andrew ignores this lawsuit, he'd be risking losing by default and could be ordered by an American court to pay millions in compensatory and punitive damages. If he engages and is forced to give a deposition (and answer questions he has so far avoided), he runs the risk of opening himself up to self-incrimination and possible criminal charges.

If there is ever a civil trial and he loses, well, Katy bar the door. It would be humiliating and expensive in the extreme if American lawyer David Boies and his client, Giuffre, get their way.

"It is unprecedented in my experience, I've never sued a member of the royal family and other than divorce actions, I'm not aware of anyone who has," Boies told USA TODAY.

But not so fast, says Stephens. Even if, say, Andrew loses a default judgment in an American court and is ordered to pay damages, "it can't be enforced in the United Kingdom without there having been a contested hearing" in the American court, Stephens says, or by first obtaining a judgment in an English court.

That's not going to happen because Andrew can't be forced to participate in an American proceeding. He can't be extradited because it's a civil lawsuit, not criminal charges. As a "prince of full blood," he could claim sovereign immunity, which could take years to resolve if challenged, Stephens says. And a civil case can't proceed until a related criminal case – the Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell prosecution ongoing in New York – is resolved first, which also could take years.

Boies said his team tried to open settlement talks with Andrew's lawyers but they would not engage. (The prince's lawyers declined to comment to USA TODAY.) He said Giuffre, facing an Aug. 14 deadline to file her lawsuit, ran out of time to further pursue a settlement.

Giuffre has been accusing Andrew publicly, in other lawsuits and in the media, since 2015, and has been ignored or dismissed by the palace media operation – but embraced by the British tabloids who have long mocked Andrew as "Randy Andy."

Boies argues Giuffre's suit is based on the "bedrock principle" of the American and English justice systems, that no one is above the law, not even the queen's alleged favorite child.

"It applies equally to everyone and wealth, position, title, family connections – none of that insulates someone from being required to answer in court for allegations," Boies says. "And part of this is sending a message that you can't, simply by stonewalling and hiding behind castle walls, avoid being held to account for these (accusations)."

But Stephens argues that international law makes it possible for Andrew to do just that. "His lawyers know what they're doing and they're not having him cooperate in either civil or criminal proceedings," while accepting the reputational damage, Stephens says. "He will not be coming to the U.S. anytime soon, and he is protected by those high castle walls."

Melville-Brown says formal legal proceedings can be a "hammer blow" to any vestige of Andrew's reputation that remains. No matter what he does, the public is likely to react negatively, the lawyer told USA TODAY.

"If he speaks out again in his own defense, he will be seen as self-serving or tone-deaf; if he keeps silent, he will be seen as self-protective with something to hide," she said.

Giuffre's legal team know this, Stephens says. "They know full well that the only way to get him to cooperate is to shame him into doing it, so they've been heaping public opprobrium on him" for years, Stephens says.

Meanwhile, the pitiless lenses of the tabloids are once again trained on Andrew, who, with his ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, were spotted by paparazzi arriving Tuesday at Balmoral, the queen's Scottish estate where she spends six weeks every summer and hosts multiple members of her family.

"That's why he's at Balmoral having crisis talks with the queen," Stephens says. "His actions reflect on the rest of the monarchy and at some point they have to make a decision (about what to do). That's why (Boies and Giuffre) are trying to put as much pressure as possible on him, so that reputationally (the suit) is impossible for him to ignore."

Since 2011, Andrew has been been shamed and scorned for his links to Epstein and Giuffre, forced in 2019 to give up his royal roles, seen only occasionally in public since, and mostly relegated to riding his horses on the grounds of his residence, Royal Lodge, close to Windsor Castle.

Two consecutive U.S. attorneys in Manhattan have publicly demanded Andrew cooperate with the FBI investigating Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking and Andrew's longtime friend Maxwell's alleged involvement (for which she is awaiting trial in federal court in New York afterpleading not guilty). It never happened: Andrew says he doesn't know anything about those matters.

He also has denied ever meeting Giuffre, despite a decades-old picture shared on the internet that shows the two together in Maxwell's London home. "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever," he told the BBC in an interview in 2019, which was widely condemned in the U.K.

Giuffre, now a mother of three, a former Floridian and now a resident of Australia, is one of Epstein's many accusers. She claims Epstein and Maxwell trafficked her to Andrew three times, in New York, London and the U.S. Virgin Islands, when she was 17, which is the age of consent in New York.

"The flaw in her case is that she alleges he knew she was being trafficked but there's zero evidence offered (in her lawsuit) that he knew," Stephens says.

Giuffre is suing Andrew in federal court, even though she is invoking New York state laws on sexual abuse, because that's where cases involving mixed citizenship are heard, Boies says.

Although she had reached the age of consent at the time of her alleged encounters with Andrew, Boies says she was subject to the "inherent coercion" of sex trafficking, which trumps the issue of consent. But she still has to provide evidence that Andrew knew she was trafficked, Stephens says.

In addition to sexual abuse laws, she is invoking the new Child Victims Act of New York, which extended the statute of limitations for civil suits by adults alleging sexual abuse when they were under the age of 21. That law will expire Aug. 14 so her lawsuit had to be filed by then, Boies said.

Is it really possible that this matter would go all the way to a trial in an American court?

"It's tough to say how likely it is," says Arick Fudali, managing lawyer at the Bloom Firm in Los Angeles, which represents eight other Epstein accusers. "Trials are rare in these types of cases but they do happen."

At best, Boies argues, Andrew can only delay the case, not kill it. Ignoring Giuffre and her accusations is no longer an option, he says.

Thus far, Stephens counters, it may be the prince's best option.

So what, ultimately, do Boies and Giuffre want from Andrew? A "vindication" of her credibility, an apology and an "acknowledgement of what happened," Boies says. Does he expect him to comply?

"Probably not."

Associated Press

NEW YORK — Patricia Hitchcock O’Connell, the only child of Alfred Hitchcock and an actor herself who made a memorable appearance in her father’s “Strangers on a Train” and championed his work in the decades following his death, has died at age 93.

Hitchcock died Monday in her sleep at home in Thousand Oaks, California, her daughter Tere Carrubba said Wednesday. She died of natural causes, said Carrubba.

“She was always really good at protecting the legacy of my grandparents and making sure they were always remembered,” said Carrubba, one of Patricia Hitchcock’s three daughters. “It’s sort of an end of an era now that they’re all gone.”

Known to many as Pat Hitchcock, she was born in London to Alfred Hitchcock and Alma Reville Hitchcock in 1928 and spent much of her life in and around the family business.

During her childhood, Alfred Hitchcock directed such classics as “The 39 Steps,” “The Lady Vanishes” and “Shadow of a Doubt,” moved to California after signing a multipicture deal with producer David O. Selznick and rose to global fame as the “Master of Suspense.” Alma was his indispensable adviser, a former film editor through whom he vetted story ideas and screenplay treatments.

“My mother had much more to do with the films than she has ever been given credit for — he depended on her for everything, absolutely everything,” Pat Hitchcock told The Guardian in 1999.

Pat would visit her father’s movie sets and by her teens was acting in school plays and appearing on stage, including the Broadway productions “Solitaire” and “Violet.” She was admitted to London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1947 and was about to graduate when her father contacted her and said he had a role for her in his new film, “Strangers on a Train,” adapted from the Patricia Highsmith novel. The 1951 production starred Robert Walker and Farley Granger as strangers who meet on a train and agree — at least Walker thinks they agree — to a double murder: Walker will kill Granger’s wife, and Granger will kill Walker’s father. Pat Hitchcock plays the sister of a woman (Ruth Roman), with whom Granger is in love.

Walker duly carries out his side, strangling Granger’s wife on the grounds of an amusement park, and pressures Granger to honor the bargain. He turns up at a party attended by Granger and chats up an elderly woman about the best way to kill someone — strangulation. He has placed his hands on her neck, when he looks up and sees Pat Hitchcock staring back in horror. Unnerved by her resemblance to his murder victim — they wear similar glasses — he nearly chokes the guest to death. Hitchcock’s character later sobs that she felt as if she was the one he might have killed, leading to suspicions about the murder of Granger’s wife.

“I think he was using her as the audience,” Pat Hitchcock, interviewed for a 1997 BBC special on her father, said of her character. “I think he was having her go through what the audience went through.”

Hitchcock was a lively, witty actor with a heart-shaped face and her other acting credits included the TV sitcoms “My Little Margie” and “The Life of Riley” and several roles in the TV series “Alfred Hitchcock Presents.” She also had parts in her father’s “Stage Fright” and in his horror masterpiece “Psycho,” in which she plays an office colleague of Janet Leigh, who later in the film is famously stabbed to death in a motel shower.

More recently, she worked for Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine, appeared at numerous film festivals and in numerous Hitchcock documentaries and contributed photographs and a foreword to “Footsteps in the Fog: Alfred Hitchcock’s San Francisco,” by Jeff Kraft and Aaron Leventhal. She also co-authored a book on her mother, who died in 1982, “Alma Hitchcock: The Woman Behind the Man.” (Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980).

Pat Hitchcock was married for more than 40 years to Joseph O’Connell, who died in 1994. They had three children.

She would insist that her childhood was happy and that her parents were normal, but she wasn’t spared her father’s distant, controlling nature and his skewed and sometimes cruel sense of humor. As a girl, she often ate alone, was sent to boarding school and deprived of a college education when her father decided she should instead return to England. She would express regret that he didn’t cast her in more of his films.

“I certainly wish he’d believed in nepotism,” she liked to say.

At home, the director once painted a clown face on her while she was sleeping, anticipating her shock when she awoke the next morning and first looked in a mirror.

During the filming of “Strangers on a Train,” knowing her fear of heights, he bet her $100 that she wouldn’t ride a Ferris wheel on the set. She disputed a story from Andrew Spoto’s 1983 biography “The Dark Side of Genius” that he left her stranded, and terrified, for an hour.

“What happened is they turned off the lights and pretended they were going away — for all of what I’d say were 35 seconds — and put the lights on and we came down,” she told the Chicago Tribune in 1993. “The only ‘sadistic’ part is that I never got the hundred dollars.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Emma Corrin says they have "a (long) way to go" in their gender identity journey.

After coming out in July as queer and updating their pronouns to she/they, "The Crown" actor said they are still discovering how they specifically identify during an interview with to ITV's Granada Reports.

"My journey's been a long one and has still got a (long) way to go," Corrin, 25, told the outlet Thursday. "I think that, you know, we're so used to defining ourselves — and that's the way, sadly, society works — is within these binaries and it's taken me a long time to realize that I exist somewhere in between, and I'm still not sure where that is yet."

'It’s all a journey': 'The Crown' star Emma Corrin wears chest binder in 'intimate' photos

Corrin, who portrays Princess Diana in Netflix's "The Crown," said they're "still figuring it all out," but the actor believes "everyone is and that's kind of the point."

"There's no fixed identity, especially for, like, people in the queer community," they added. "It's going to be an ongoing journey but yeah, I hope that sharing (my truth) helps people."

Corrin said sharing their progress along the way is important to continuing the conversation around gender identity because "visibility is key with these things."

"When I started posting about it, obviously, it felt very sort of scary and revealing and I wasn't sure whether it was the right thing to do," Corrin said. "But the feedback I got from other people in the queer community has been wonderful. You know, it's like, great and it's something to be celebrated."

A deeper look at nonbinary:Stars like Demi Lovato, Elliot Page, Sam Smith identify as nonbinary. What does that mean?

In July, Corrin detailed their experience using a chest binder for the first time in an Instagram post and emphasized the importance of doing it safely.

"It’s all a journey right. Lots of twists and turns and change and that’s ok! Embrace it," they wrote alongside a series of black-and-white photos.

The Grammy Award-winning artist, 50, took to Twitter Thursday to issue a public apology to the Obamas for being a "terrible guest" after sharing footage from Barack Obama's exclusive 60th birthday bash in Martha’s Vineyard.

"Mr. And Mrs. Obama , Please forgive me 4 being the 'terrible guest' at such a sacred event for your family," she tweeted. "I was so inconsiderate, Thank you for all your love. What an example of ‘how NOT ‘ to be."

Badu, who was born Erica Abi Wright, closed her apology with her birth name.

The singer also shot down fan claims that the former first couple made her "take down the video and apologize publicly." Badu replied, "Naw sis. It’s just right thing."

Barack Obama celebrates at 60th birthday bash after scaling back guest list because of COVID concerns

The former president held a 60th birthday bash in the backyard of his Martha's Vineyard mansion with Michelle Obama. Although it was scaled back because of concerns about the rapid spread of COVID-19, the event attracted many high-profile guests, including Badu, H.E.R., John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade.

Some of the A-List guests took it upon themselves to share photos and videos from the exclusive party. Badu posted a now-deleted video next to a maskless Barack Obama, who was enjoying himself while dancing with guests. Grammy Award-winning artist H.E.R. shared a shot of her standing between the former president and first lady.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE COOLEST @barackobama what an amazing night!!!!!!!" H.E.R. captioned a since-deleted post on Sunday that included a video of her and Obama dancing. A soon-after updated post included a line about being "grateful to have been able to celebrate with you and your family SAFELY." The post is no longer up on her page.

Artist Trap Beckham, who performed a special version of his hit single "Birthday Chick" during the event, also shared many photos and videos. He took down the footage but it was widely reshared online.

"Just want to take the time out to Apologize to Obama & Staff for using my social media Saturday as if it were a regular party," he tweeted. "Tbh I was just excited & I never knew it would blow up like this.

Trap Beckham reposted Badu's apology on Twitter Thursday, adding, "Well said . Truly a misunderstanding and and a honest mistake."

The Obamas were met with criticism for throwing a maskless affair as the Delta variant continues to spread, but spokesperson Hannah Hankins told USA TODAY last week that his outdoor birthday bash "was planned months ago in accordance with all public health guidelines and with COVID safeguards in place."

Guests were required to adhere to all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public health protocols, including a testing regimen managed by a COVID-19 coordinator.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nanci Griffith, a Grammy-winning self-described "folkabilly" singer who was the first artist to record "From a Distance," died Friday in Nashville.

She was 68. Her cause of death was undisclosed, according to a statement from former label Rounder Records.

Griffith received considerable acclaim for her 1993 covers collection, “Other Voices, Other Rooms,” which featured guest appearances from friends including John Prine, Emmylou Harris and Bob Dylan, providing harmonica on his own “Boots of Spanish Leather.” The following year, it won the Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album – over one of Dylan’s releases.

Though Griffith never had a commercial hit single of her own, several of her compositions – first recorded by her— became hits for other country artists. That included Kathy Mattea’s first Top 10 hit, “Love at the Five and Dime,” and Suzy Bogguss’ “Outbound Plane.”

Her 1993 album "Other Voices/Other Rooms" won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.

“A beautiful soul that I love has left this earth,” Bogguss wrote on Facebook. “I feel blessed to have many memories of our times together along with most everything she ever recorded. I’m going to spend the day reveling in the articulate masterful legacy she’s left us.”

Griffith was born July 6, 1953, in Seguin, Texas, and spent her formative years in Austin. Music briefly took a back seat as Griffith started her career as a kindergarten teacher, but she left education in 1977 to pursue songwriting full-time.

She released a pair of albums — 1978's "There's a Light Beyond These Woods" and 1982's "Poet in My Window" — before releasing "Once In a Very Blue Moon," co-produced by Griffith with Americana staple Jim Rooney in 1984.

Throughout her career, Griffith cornered a self-described "folkabilly" sound that merged elements of country music with her empathetic folk sensibilities.

After four albums, Griffith made a major label debut with 1987’s “Lone Star State of Mind.” Along with many of her own compositions, the album included the first recording of Julie Gold’s “From a Distance,” which became a Grammy-winning hit for Bette Midler three years later.

After finding her footing on Music Row with “Lone Star” and follow-up “Little Love Affairs” – both of which cracked the top 30 on the Country Albums chart – Griffith took a detour into synthesizers and drum machines on the pop-leaning “Storms” in 1989. Following the success of “Other Voices,” she took a similar approach with her original songs, enlisting members of U2, Counting Crows and Mark Knopfler to appear on 1994’s “Flyer.”

Griffith’s bold musical moves continued in the 2000s – most dramatically on the string-laden torch song collection “Ruby’s Torch,” which she said she took out a loan on her house to finish.

Those who collaborated with Griffith includedRobert Earl Keen, Lyle Lovett, Iris DeMent, Jimmy Buffett, Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers and Darius Rucker, among others.

"I've been allowed to run totally amok in my career, like a bad kid in the neighborhood throwing rocks through windows," she told The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, in 2006. "I've done country, bluegrass, folk, my songwriting, classical... it's just been really fun. I'm appreciative and grateful."

In 2012, Griffith released her final studio album, “Intersection.”
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@They've earned billions of streams, won armfuls of awards and commanded sold-out arenas – but nine years ago, Dan + Shay found their footing in a far more humble space.

"We'd sit down in our buddy's basement and camp out, just the two of us," says the country/pop duo's Dan Smyers.

"We'd really, really dive in, and I think that created that Dan + Shay sound. Having unlimited time, where we didn't have to hop on a bus every Wednesday night, get back Sunday, throw the laundry in and boom! Suddenly you're back out (on the road)."

Unfortunately, success – which reached a new peak with the massive ballads "Tequila," "Speechless" and "10,000 Hours" – meant that Smyers and bandmate Shay Mooney would never have "unlimited time" again.

Until they did.

The duo was just three shows into their first-ever arena headlining tour when the pandemic pulled them off the road. After a couple of months at home, they dove in again, and reemerge this week with their fourth album, "Good Things," recorded and produced largely in Smyers' home studio.

Though it's not without a breakup anthem or two, it's a notably upbeat and affirming collection — and Dan + Shay will share those vibes through a huge outdoor concert Friday in Nashville.

"It's gonna be a celebration of life," Mooney says of the event. "And getting to see all these amazing people that have helped us get where we are at this point."

ACM Awards:No, Dan + Shay were not lip-synching; Duo 'bummed' about broadcast audio issues

In-person concerts:Do you need a COVID-19 vaccine to go to a concert this year? It depends

'We need it for our souls'

That's reflected in recent single "Glad You Exist," an ode to the miracle of finding your soulmate — but even before its release, the duo told fans "Glad You Exist" was also for them.

"There's a couple billion people in the world, and a million other places we could be," Mooney belts over a buoyant acoustic guitar.

"But you're here with me/Take a moment just to take it in/ 'Cause every high and every low led to this/ I'm just so glad you exist."

The title track of "Good Things" might be the epitome of the album's positive spin. Yes, it's about a breakup, but the narrator hopes his ex will remember the better times. "You're not together anymore, but you're dancing through the pain," Mooney explains.

The duo even raised the keys of a couple of songs, giving them a sunnier bent. Between those moves and the unflappable groove of "Steal My Love," there's very little room for bitterness on "Good Things." To hear Smyers tell it, that's what the times demanded.

"You saw it in pop music when the pandemic was hitting," he says. "There were things like The Weeknd and Dua Lipa: super-happy, up-tempo dance records were really popping off, because I think people seek music as escape. Overall, we were kind of seeing a lot of light at the end of the tunnel at beginning of the year, when we were deep in the weeds on the album...we need it for our souls to put out some stuff that was uplifting and positive."

'The beauty of being a songwriter'

The duo also closed some literal distance during the making of "Good Things" when Smyers, his wife and dogs moved from Nashville into the Mooney family's less urban neck of the woods.

Previously, Mooney jokes, "It was like 'Yeah dude, let me let me settle up the horse and buggy, and I'll be there in six days.' It was a full journey."

The change allowed for more spontaneous sessions, but the duo also made an effort to dig back into the catalog and give some older, unreleased material a fresh listen. That included one of Mooney's old favorites: "Let Me Get Over Her," a minor-key waltz that like "Tequila" before it, finds Mooney singing about a former flame he can't keep off his mind.

For a couple of happily married guys, Dan + Shay have a knack for singing about heartbreak — and they've had that pointed out to them before.

"I think that's the beauty of being a songwriter," Mooney says. "You're able to jump into that role of being a storyteller. Because yes, obviously, we are happily married now. But that doesn't mean we haven't been through heartbreak...We also have a lot of our buddies there that were sharing stories, and you're able to put yourself in that place."

Another, much older song made its way into "Good Things" — one that Dan + Shay didn't write. Bill Withers is a credited songwriter on the album's latest single, "Lying," after the duo noticed its rising and falling piano motif resembled the one heard in "Lean On Me."

"There's not enough words to describe how amazing that song is," Smyers says.

"It's just a timeless, iconic song that every single person knows. And I would assume that there was some subconscious inspiration…when we finished that song, it was obvious just listening back (that) we were in some way inspired by it. And we felt like it was the right thing to do."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There are plenty of American stories left for Ryan Murphy left to tell.

The prolific producer behind FX's "American Horror Story" and "American Crime Story" expands his franchise of domestic dramas with two new spinoffs, "American Sports Story" and "American Love Story," the network announced Friday.

The two new series already have topics for their first seasons. "Sports" will base its first installment on "Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez and Football Inc," the podcast from the Boston Globe and Wondery. The project charts the rise, fall anf death of the NFL star, a convicted murderer, exploring "the connections of the disparate strands of his identity, his family, his career, his suicide, and their legacy in sports and American culture," FX says in a statement. "Love" will first explore "the whirlwind courtship and marriage" of John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a 1999 plane crash, and Carolyn Bessette.

The new spinoff anthology series will also be produced by Brad Falchuk, Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson.

Murphy's latest FX "American" series include "American Horror Story: Double Feature," (Aug. 25, 10 EDT/PDT) and "Impeachment: American Crime Story," due Sept. 7 (10 EDT/PDT), which focuses on Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s, starring Clive Owen and Beanie Feldstein. The first trailer for the season was also released Friday.

FX also confirmed it is developing a potential next installment of "Crime Story," tentatively titled "Studio 54: American Crime Story," telling "the saga of Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, who in 1977 turned their midtown Manhattan disco into an international mecca of nightlife for the rich and famous and commoners alike – renowned for its lavish parties, music, sex and drugs," FX says. "With Rubell and Schrager’s meteoric rise came their epic fall less than three years later when the impresarios were convicted of tax fraud."

Murphy's episodic anthology series "American Horror Stories" debuted on Hulu this summer with episodes starring Paris Jackson, Matt Bomer and Kaia Gerber. The show, which the network described as its most successful FX on Hulu launch, will return for a second season, FX confirmed.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lizzo has descended from hit-making heaven to address the gossip among the mortals, and tags Cardi B in to help her new single "Rumors."

Adorned in gold and laurel crowns and surrounded by statues and Greek hydria, the Grammy-award-winning duo came together for Friday's release to confirm all the ridiculous things people have said about them. Instead of denying the false statements, Lizzo and Cardi B are owning up because according to their career success — they will remain on top because "haters do what they do."

"This has been a long time coming," Lizzo said in a YouTube video with Cardi B before the song's release. "I been in my studio just trying to stay safe and working on music."

In "Rumors," Lizzo's first song since her 2019 album "Cuz I Love You," the singer stresses the point that people are "spendin' all their time trynna break a woman down" with false statements and judgment while there are "realer" things going on in the world.

Lizzo, who has been a vocal advocate for self-acceptance and body positivity, has faced negative comments throughout her career for loving herself and having fun while dancing on social media.

More:Lizzo criticized body positivity. Here's what you need to know about body neutrality.

She addresses the backlash she has faced in the lyrics and is fiercely unapologetic.

"If you thought that I was ratchet with my (expletive) hanging out, just wait until the summer when they let me out the house," she sings, seemingly alluding to eventually escaping the pandemic lockdown.

Cardi B joins later in the song sporting an ethereal gold chest piece while also being a queen mother with her baby bump. She is expecting her second child with Migos rapper Offset.

She lists off some of the criticisms she's heard about herself, including body surgeries, fake streams and even the FCC complaints she received for her "freaky" Grammys performance with Megan Thee Stallion.

Despite all the negativity, the "Bodak Yellow" rapper fires back. "I'm calmed down and I'm locked in, And my records live in the top ten."

This is the second time the two have teamed up together after making their movie debut in the 2019 movie "Hustlers."

But social media users suggested Lizzo and Cardi B were alluding to a different movie in the "Rumors" video.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Horatio Sanz, a "Saturday Night Live" alum, has been accused of grooming and sexually assaulting an underage fan in a new lawsuit filed Thursday. He is denying the claims.

The unnamed Pennsylvania woman, identified as "Jane Doe" in the complaint, claims she was 17 at the time of the sexual assault and first met Sanz in 2000 when she was 15. According to the suit, Sanz started grooming her shortly after through AOL Instant Messenger, in which he'd repeatedly request "revealing" photos from her, and later "admitted and bragged to (her) that he masturbated during these conversations."

The suit also details multiple occasions in which Sanz allegedly invited her to numerous "SNL" parties in 2001 and 2002, in which she was served alcohol despite being underage and invited to sit "on (Sanz's) lap with her legs positioned between his legs."

"SNL" Studios and NBC Universal are also named as defendants in the suit for enabling the "sexually harassing and predatory conduct of its employees."

USA TODAY reached out to "SNL" for comment.

In addition to the online grooming allegations, Sanz is also accused of sexual assault at a party in May 2002 when the woman was 17 years old. His alleged actions included unwanted kissing, groping and "digitally penetrating her genitals forcibly and without (her) consent," according to the suit.

The lawsuit also claims that Sanz admitted to the behavior later in 2019. As shown in text messages included in the lawsuit, he said he "felt terrible" about hooking up with her at the time and was "very sorry." He also allegedly wrote that she could "#metoo" him if she wanted, because "it happened."

Sanz's attorney, Andrew Brettler, says the claims are "categorically false" in a statement to USA TODAY.

“However often she repeats her ludicrous allegations or tries to rope in other high-profile names to generate media attention, they will always be false. Before filing this lawsuit anonymously, she demanded $7.5 million in exchange for her silence. We, of course, refused and will vigorously contest these totally meritless claims.”

Brettler is seemingly referring to Jimmy Fallon, who is mentioned in the suit for allegedly attending the parties where the assaults occurred, but the late night TV host is not included as a defendant.

The woman is now seeking unspecified damages according to the suit, which also notes that she suffered "psychological and emotional harm."

Sanz appeared on “SNL” from 1998 through 2006 alongside Fallon and Chris Parnell, and is set to star in the upcoming live-action "Clifford the Big Red Dog."

LAKEWOOD, Colo. — The creators of the irreverent animated television series “South Park” are buying Casa Bonita, a quirky restaurant in suburban Denver that was featured on the show.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker said in an interview with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Friday that they had come to an agreement with the current owners of the restaurant, which closed to diners in March 2020 as the pandemic took hold. It declared bankruptcy in the spring.

“We’re excited to work with everybody and make it the place we all want to make it,” Parker said.

The Lakewood restaurant has been in business since 1974 but gained wider recognition when it was featured on a 2003 “South Park” episode and when the Denver Broncos announced some of their draft picks there in 2018.

‘South Park’ creators sign $900 million deal to extend series through 2027, produce 14 films

The Mexican restaurant is known for its decor, which includes a pink facade and large indoor waterfall, as well as its cliff divers and skits that feature an excitable actor in a gorilla costume. But some have noted there is room for improvement.

Stone and Parker, who met at the University of Colorado Boulder, did not offer any details about the sale, which is pending bankruptcy proceedings. But they did say they would make some upgrades, like having two gorillas in the skits instead of just one.

"The one area that we would all love to see an upgrade — and I think I speak on behalf of everybody who patronizes Casa Bonita — is the food could be a little better,” Polis said.

“I think it could be a little more than a little better,” Stone added.

Casa Bonita’s 85-foot-tall (26-meter-tall) pink clock tower stands out in the otherwise nondescript strip mall. The 52,000-square-foot (4,831-square-meter) restaurant can seat more than 1,000 guests. The 30-foot-tall (9-meter-tall) waterfall at the center was designed to resemble the cliffs of Acapulco.

Amid the ruckus over the new host of "Jeopardy!", contestant Matt Amodio has methodically scooped up resounding victories and a place in the quiz show's hall of fame.

As of Thursday, the Yale University doctoral candidate in computer science earned $547,600 in 17 games, winning in such decisive fashion — and with nervy bets — that runaway games were not uncommon.

The cash total puts him at No. 3 on the list of top winners for regular-season play, edging ahead of Jason Zuffranieri ($532,496) and in the company of "Jeopardy!" luminaries Ken Jennings ($2.52 million) and James Holzhauer ($2.46 million).

Amodio said his restrained on-camera demeanor reflects his competitive focus. As for his repeated use of "What's..." instead of alternatives such as "Who is...", that's part of his effort to limit "unnecessary moving parts" that might undermine his play, he says.

More:'Jeopardy!': Matt Amodio becomes No. 3 on all-time winners list, behind Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer

Amodio's streak held through Friday's season finale, so he will return Sept. 13 for the show's 38th season. That's when the late Alex Trebek's successor, Mike Richards, takes over as host, his selection dismaying some "Jeopardy!" fans who'd rooted for other candidates. One of the other contenders, actor Mayim Bialik, will host prime-time "Jeopardy!" programs to come.

Amodio, a native of Medina, Ohio, was self-effacing in an interview with The Associated Press, praising the contestants he's bested and calling himself "incredibly fortunate." He cited insight gained from the quiz-show film "Slumdog Millionaire" and offered his view on whether a photographic memory is a real thing. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.

Question: How did you became so knowledgeable about so many different topics?

Matt Amodio: I like to read. I think that you can't do it without reading. So on a regular basis, I just fall into a rabbit hole of Wikipedia links, (and) every article opens up 20 more things that I have questions about it. This is just how how I spend my day, or my nights when I'm done working. I did change one thing for preparation for the show, though, because I don't necessarily find culture to be super-interesting. I'm a historian at heart and I like learning about culture maybe 40 years, 50 years later. I like looking at it in the rearview mirror.

Q: Any specific categories that give you pause?

Amodio: I feel like it's a bit like "Slumdog Millionaire," where every question that comes up, the guy has a a personal connection about how he knows the answer. I'm not necessarily the biggest opera fan in the world, but my grandpa lives and breathes opera, so just through talking with him I found I absorbed a lot. And there are other things like that as well. I'm a really big baseball fan, less interested in other sports, but my friends have always been very big basketball, football, hockey fans. I found I had a pretty good vocabulary for that just through collateral exposure.

Q: James Holzhauer's performance raised speculation about whether he had a photographic memory. Would you claim that for yourself?

Amodio: From what I have read, I'm skeptical of the existence of photographic memories. Personally, I don't think I have a different memory than any other person. I may have just a little bit better recall. When other people describe how they remember things — or more importantly, how they forget things — I can totally relate.

Q: You ring in very quickly but seem to take a long beat before answering. Is that a strategy?

Amodio: Yes. I'm a big believer in measure twice, cut once. I'm very worried that I'm going to know it, or I'm going to think I know it, and then say it. And if I just took one extra second to pause and doublecheck my work, I would have the correct answer. So it's just out of an abundance of caution. I'm not going to let hastiness turn into sloppiness.

Q: There's been instances when you've made viewers nervous with really big bets. How do you decide when to go for it or hold back?

Amodio: I never endanger the game. The No. 1 priority for me is being able to play the next day. So I never want to make a bet just looking for more money in a way that would risk the outcome of the game. That being said, in general, I know more than half of, for example, the Final ('Jeopardy!' answers). In a gambling setting, if you have a better than 50% chance, it makes sense to put all your marbles in there and in the end, in the long run, it'll work out. Now, unfortunately, I might not get to see the long run, so maybe it won't even out.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bill Cosby gave one of his first interviews after being released from prison in June to discuss the Olympics and the pandemic.

On Friday morning, Cosby was interviewed for roughly 15 minutes on WWGH radio show "Now with Scott Spears" in Marion, Ohio. The conversation included topics such as the Olympics, teaching and education, and the pandemic.

However, what wasn't brought up in the conversation was recent allegations against Cosby and the overturning of his convictions that sent him to prison. Cosby was arrested in 2015 after a district attorney found newly unsealed charges against Cosby with only a few days before the 12-year statute of limitations was about to run out.

He was accused of drugging and molesting an employee at Temple University, Andrea Constand, at his house more than a decade ago. He has continually denied the allegation and said their encounters were consensual.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in June ruled the district attorney pressing charges against Cosby was obligated to honor the promise from the previous district attorney that they would not charge Cosby.

Cosby was released from prison hours after the decision was made. He later would take to Twitter to thank the court for their decision and to continue defending himself.

The radio host said he didn't ask Cosby about the allegations and lawsuits because the 84-year-old comedian is currently going through multiple civil lawsuits. The host added Cosby's lawyers have advised him not to speak on these topics until the proceedings finish.

Spears said once the lawsuits against Cosby are finalized, he plans to set up another interview with the comedian on his show to discuss the lawsuits, allegations and his prison time.

Cosby gave his first post-prison interview to Detroit radio station Mix 92.3.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Spoiler alert! The following post discusses important plot points and details from “Free Guy” so beware if you haven’t seen it yet.

Ryan Reynolds’ new action comedy “Free Guy” introduces an original video-game world, though there are plenty of high-profile cameos and a couple fun Disney easter eggs.

Directed by Shawn Levy, the film centers on a background video-game character Guy (Reynolds) turning from mild-mannered bank teller to a heroic phenomenon in a crazy “Grand Theft Auto”-style online landscape when he meets the uber-cool Molotov Girl, an avatar for game programmer Millie (Jodie Comer).

The digital world of Free City is threatened by a greedy software mogul Antwan (Taika Waititi) and his upcoming “Free City 2” sequel, which will erase Guy and all his video-game friends. The good guy fights back as real-world fans watch online, and Guy not only saves the day, but gets to exist in a new “Free Life” game with dinosaurs as well as his old pal Buddy (Lil Rel Howery).

“Free Guy” is populated with celebrities and references galore, and Reynolds breaks down some of the coolest appearances, including one bittersweet scene with a late game-show icon:

Alex Trebek has a posthumous moment to shine

When Guy’s exploits in the game prove popular in the real world, he even gets to be a “Jeopardy!” clue: “This colorful character in the video game 'Free City' has been turning heads by being the good guy.” Trebek hints to Guy’s relative mystery for the general populace with the line, “Who is he or she indeed.”

Reynolds has been on the real "Jeopardy!" show a few times, including an appearance in Trebek’s last round of episodes before his death last November, and the actor wanted Trebek in “Free Guy.” “I wouldn't necessarily say I'm a friend of the show, but I'm friendly to the show,” Reynolds says. “And then weirdly in this moment, it was me asking Alex for a favor. He's as gentlemanly and integrity-filled and as stalwart as you would imagine him to be in real life. He said yes right away, so we came in and grabbed our little cameo and I was super grateful for him for taking the time to do that.”

Trebek and Reynolds talked frequently, and shortly before his death, the host called Reynolds about a charity function he was doing. “The man was quite beautiful as far as human beings go, that’s for sure,” Reynolds says.

The Rock, Hugh Jackman and friends join in on the fun

Many of Reynolds’ fellow A-list friends have roles to play in “Free Guy.” Channing Tatum steps up as Revenjamin Buttons, a dance-happy avatar with moves like the “Shaky Man” and “Thanos’ Glove,” while others have small voice-only parts: Dwayne Johnson plays a masked bank robber, Tina Fey is a vacuuming mom, John Krasinski is a silhouetted gamer, and Reynolds’ old pal Hugh Jackman is a masked mystery man in an alley quickly disposed of by Molotov Girl.

“I genuinely love Hugh for all of our silly rivalries and that sort of stuff. He's one of my closest friends. I'm really lucky to be able to call him that,” Reynolds says. “Cameos are part of the showbiz ecosystem. I feel like when somebody asks you to do a cameo, unless you're geographically unavailable, I'm pretty much always going to say yes.”

Ryan Reynolds gets to be Captain America AND a Jedi (sort of)

Although Reynolds is well known for his masked quip-meister Deadpool, he gets to borrow from another Marvel Comics character during the climactic “Free Guy” fight: As the whole world watches online, Guy tussles with Dude (also Reynolds), Antwan’s ultra-muscular, dimwitted upgrade of Guy. Just as Dude unleashes his "Deathblow" maneuver in their video-game brawl, Guy suddenly blocks it out of nowhere with Captain America’s shield. And in one of the movie’s funniest gags, the scene cuts to Chris Evans (aka movie Cap) in a coffee shop watching on his phone who then shouts, “What the (expletive)?!”

Evans was also in Boston when “Free Guy” was filming there, and Reynolds texted his friend to come by and do a scene. “He was incredibly kind and gracious,” Reynolds says. “I told him exactly what was happening and we were 100% ready for him before he ever even got close to set. He was in and out in about seven minutes.”

However, Reynolds confirms that it wasn’t one of Evans’ actual movie shields: He didn’t even know if Disney (which purchased 20th Century Fox in 2019 when “Free Guy” was in pre-production) “would say 100% yes until after we shot it. So we were leaving room to make that shield something else if we had to.” The Mouse House was also cool with the bit where Guy whips out a lightsaber on Dude and the “Star Wars” theme kicks in.

“It’s a pretty special feeling to be in a theater seeing that happen,” Reynolds says. “For all of our concerns and worries, (Disney) ended up being the most supportive partner you could ever imagine. They were pretty gung-ho about making an original blockbuster film in the summertime.”

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When writer-director Siân Heder was casting the tear-jerking, joyful drama "CODA," centered on a child of deaf adults (CODA), the first stop was obvious.

Marlee Matlin, the first and only deaf actress to win an Oscar (for the 1986 drama “Children of a Lesser God”), was perfect for the part of mother Jackie.

But “CODA” is a complete group effort, earning the best ensemble award at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival (the same festival at which AppleTV+ bought the distribution rights for a record-shattering $25 million).

With Matlin's insistence that deaf actors play deaf roles, "CODA” features a number of breakout performances.

“Marlee is the most famous, and often only deaf actor that people know,” says Heder. "There are many more Marlee Matlins out there who just need a shot."

As "CODA" (now on Apple TV+) opens, meet the stands-outs, both deaf and hearing actors.

'We are not costumes':Why Marlee Matlin put her foot down for 'CODA' to cast deaf actors

Troy Kotsur stars as Frank Rossi

The charismatic Kotsur, 53, steals scenes and hearts as the love-smitten husband to Jackie and tender father. A longtime actor with the National Theater of the Deaf, Kotsur choreographed his own sign language for a stint on TV's "The Mandalorian."

In "CODA," the veteran actor embodies a Gloucester fisherman, learning to fix lobster nets to get in character and growing out a massive beard. But his most memorable scenes display his lightning-quick and bawdy American Sign Language improv skills — explaining to his daughter how a condom works in front of her new boyfriend, or describing his painful jock itch to the doctor.

"We had to stop some of those takes because the crew was laughing," says Matlin, who broke character a few times herself due to Kotsur's spontaneous moments.

Emilia Jones is the singing 'CODA' center

Heder sought miracle-casting for the central role of Ruby, the film's high school-aged CODA, who shocks her deaf parents by pursuing a singing scholarship.

"I needed someone to sing incredibly well, who can sign like a native signer and who is brave enough to jump off a quarry cliff," says Heder. "All this and carry the movie."

She found her Ruby in British actress Emilia Jones, 19, who had never taken a singing lesson. Jones' scenes depicting Ruby finding her voice are not only real and raw, but chillingly beautiful.

"We recorded all the singing live," says Heder. "So a lot of the breakthroughs that Ruby has in the movie were actual breakthroughs."

Daniel Durant smolders as Leo Rossi

The 31-year-old Durant, who starred with Matlin in ABC Family's "Switched at Birth," perfectly exemplifies Ruby's dishy older brother Leo, who is fixated on finding Tinder dates. Leo's scenes with Ruby, in which they rib each other in outrageous ASL, show family teasing while belying a true bond. Durant sears in a beach scene with Jones in which the older brother explodes while expressing the frustration of living as a deaf older sibling seemingly having to be dependent on his hearing younger sister.

Eugenio Derbez is inspirational teacher Bernardo

Not always a familiar face for American audiences, the comedic Mexican actor, 59, is one of the most influential Hispanic actors in the world. His restrained performance as the tough but quirky chorus instructor who finds an unpolished gem in Ruby is pitch perfect.

"Bernardo is definitely a character, but we wanted to make sure he still felt real and grounded," says Heder. "Eugenio really walked the line here."

The musically trained Derbez learned to play piano for the part, so it's the actor performing during chorus numbers such as "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)" onscreen.

She was 68. Her cause of death was undisclosed, according to a statement from former label Rounder Records.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@YA literature is experiencing a renaissance. There are more intriguing voices and diversity in its pages than ever. In a new series, USA TODAY profiles five bestselling YA authors leading the charge to talk about the books, writers and moments that shaped their careers. So far, we've talked to Jenny Han, Angie Thomas, Adam Silvera and Jason Reynolds. Sabaa Tahir is the final in the series.

Sabaa Tahir’s road to bestselling author began with a chance encounter.

Tahir grew up in the remote town of Ridgecrest, in California’s Mojave Desert. The town, about 100 miles from the nearest mall, felt isolating. There was a library and a few used and independent bookstores, but even they were limited.

“When I was a kid, I was out in the middle of nowhere,” Tahir tells USA TODAY. “I can't believe I found 'Seven Daughters and Seven Sons.' I can't believe that book happened to be in my tiny little elementary school library.”

The YA novel, by Barbara Cohen and Bahija Lovejoy, is about Buran, a young woman in an ancient Arab nation who disguises herself as a boy in order to live the life she wants. The book mesmerized 10-year-old Tahir.

It was the first time Tahir saw the Arabic greeting "assalamu alaikum" in a novel. The book “reflected what I say to my parents every day. It was a revelation,” said Tahir. As a Muslim and Pakastani, she identified with the story set in the Middle East and South Asia. “It was a huge moment for me because I realized these stories mattered.”

Later, Tahir stumbled on Ursula K. Le Guin’s “Earthsea” series in her middle-school English textbook. It was not part of her class’ curriculum. “The pictures of the dark-skinned Ged are what drew me in because he looked like me,” said Tahir. “I remember being shocked because I had not seen that in a fantasy book.” In her experience, fantasy books had always centered white characters.

Tahir believes every book is one of two things: a window into another person's life or a mirror into one's own. When she would work on her first novel, she did so wanting to give a mirror to young people like her.

Tahir would go on to get a degree in journalism while still indulging in reading fantasy books, many of which were YA. While working as a newspaper editor she would pen her first book, the bestselling “An Ember in the Ashes.” Tahir admits, “You know, deep, deep, deep down, I always wanted to be an author, but I never really let myself think that it was possible because it was not a practical job.”

“An Ember in the Ashes,” a fantasy novel about a young girl Laia who lives in an oppressive society, debuted as a USA TODAY bestseller. Her next books in the fantasy series, “A Torch Against Midnight” and “A Reaper at the Gates,” would also become bestsellers.

“I wanted to make ('An Ember in the Ashes') feel like home to a lot of brown kids out there and I wanted them to see themselves, their culture and their family events,” said Tahir.

Years after first reading it, Tahir tried to track down a copy of “Seven Daughters and Seven Sons.” It would prove difficult until recently. In addition to lack of diversity, book accessibility is still a problem, Tahir says. “It was a serendipitous thing that I managed to stumble upon this book that had such a big impact.”

More:'The Hate U Give' author Angie Thomas says this YA novel is why she writes books for 'people like me'

More:'They Both Die at the End' author Adam Silvera took this unconventional road to YA success

The fact that that one book made its way through was almost a miracle. “I would have loved to read more about kids like me who are struggling a little bit more or who had adventures.”

About two years ago Tahir walked into a used bookstore in Palo Alto and over to the young adult section. She found no diversity in its titles.

There was “Harry Potter.” There was “Twilight.” There were multiple copies of S.E. Hinton's “The Outsiders.” When Tahir addressed the section's lack of diversity, the seller replied that they only stocked the ‘classics’."

Tahir was not satisfied with his response. “You need Jason Reynolds. You need Ellen Oh. You need Adam Silvera, Angie Thomas, and you need Nicola Yoon,” said Tahir. “It didn't make any sense to me.”

When it comes to the books that provide a mirror, the publishing industry still has a long way to go. A 2019 study by Lee & Low Books surveyed publishing houses about their employee makeup and found that a significant majority identified as white (76%) and heterosexual (81%.) This is still "pretty depressing,” says Tahir. “Because that's not what America looks like.”

But Tahir acknowledges there has been growth. She applauds the increase in imprints that are now focusing on diverse stories by diverse authors. Something that has been neglected by mainstream publishing. One imprint, in particular, is Nicola and David Yoon’s Joy Revolution at Random House. Debuting in 2022, the imprint will focus on books that are joyful, romantic, and written by and about people of color. “I think that’s wonderful.”

Tahir also applauds diversity in genres among her fellow YA authors. Authors Jason Reynolds and Elizabeth Acevedo are currently tackling adult novels, and Angie Thomas is working on a middle-grade fantasy novel. Tahir herself is making the jump from fantasy to contemporary with 2022’s “All My Rage,” a novel inspired by Tahir's own childhood.

“We’re going in all these different directions and you see it a lot amongst previously marginalized and currently marginalized authors,” says Tabir. “We have so much to say and so many stories to tell."

And Tahir will continue to tell her stories while holding up a mirror.

The 38-year-old singer/songwriter revealed Sunday on Instagram that she and her husband, drummer for The Black Keys, Patrick Carney are expecting their second child together.

"You know you're pregnant when…" Branch captioned her social media post. "Woke up to a picture my friend Sonya sent of scones she was eating in England and I immediately had to hop out of bed and make a batch myself. @officerpatrickcarney was my hero (as usual) and went to the market in search of double cream."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Debra Winger has set the record straight over why she quit her starring role in director Penny Marshall's beloved 1992 baseball film, "A League of Their Own."

The three-time Oscar nominee Winger, 66, told Britain's Daily Telegraph she objected to Madonna's casting, because it made the project "an Elvis film."

Madonna, coming off her role as Breathless Mahoney in 1990's "Dick Tracy," signed on as center fielder Mae Mordabito in the story of the first female professional baseball league.

"The studio agreed with me because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract," Winger said. "In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court."

Geena Davis: The actress spills 'League of Their Own' secrets on film's 25th anniversary

In one of her most celebrated roles, Geena Davis took over Winger's role as catcher Dottie Hinson, the heart of "League." The sports comedy-drama stars Lori Petty as pitcher Kit Keller, Rosie O'Donnell as Doris Murphy and Tom Hanks as manager Jimmy Dugan.

Winger said she was ultimately dismayed by the film. In her opinion, the story did not appropriately honor the original, real-life players.

"As entertaining as (the final film) was, you don’t walk away going 'Wow, those women did that.' You kind of go, 'Is that true?' " Winger said.

Winger, who had trained with the Chicago Cubs for three months for the role, said the actors did not train long enough to look convincing playing baseball onscreen — except for Petty and Davis who "did OK," she admits.

"I certainly don’t begrudge any of them," Winger said.

"A League of Their Own" made history as the first movie directed by a woman to gross $100 million at the box office and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2012.

Marshall, who died in 2018, said she had considered Demi Moore for the lead role, but Moore was pregnant at the time and could not take the part.

Davis told USA TODAY in 2017 that she, too, had questions about the Madonna casting before filming. "She was Madonna. We wondered if we were going to be able to talk to her. Was she going to have an entourage? Were they going to put up walls around her where she stands?" Davis recalled feeling of the "Material Girl" co-star.

Ultimately, Madonna was a team player who worked hard and slid head-first into bases for the camera. "That was painful. But she was so game. She was a trooper," Davis said.

As for the ultimate performance, Winger was slightly less direct in criticizing Madonna, whose last major film role was 2002's "Swept Away."

"I think (her) acting career has spoken for itself," Winger said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In a recent interview, Johnny Depp suggested there's a Hollywood boycott against him.

It's the first interview Depp has given since losing a British libel suit against The Sun tabloid in 2020.

Depp referred to a “surreal five years” around the case and the acrimonious end to his marriage with Amber Heard.

Johnny Depp said he's being boycotted by Hollywood in his first interview since losing his high-profile libel suit against Britain's The Sun tabloid newspaper in 2020.

Depp, 58, spoke in often incomplete responses — described as "riddles" and "broken sentences" — during an interview for Britain's The Sunday Times (part of the same Rupert Murdoch-owned publishing group as The Sun).

It comes nine months after a British High Court judge in Nov. 2020 said The Sun's description of Depp as a "wife beater" from an April 2018 article was "substantially true." Depp has lost subsequent legal efforts to appeal the verdict.

With another legal battle arriving in April 2022 — a $50 million U.S. defamation lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard stemming from a Washington Post opinion piece on domestic abuse — Depp's people told The Times "he could not talk about the court case given the looming U.S. trial," the article states.

But the "Pirates of the Caribbean" star alluded to the "surreal five years" surrounding the case and spoke about the film industry fall-out on his once-formidable career.

In the wake of the trial,Depp was replaced by Mads Mikkelsen as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in the "Fantastic Beasts" franchise. And his new film, "Minamata," focusing on Life photographer W. Eugene Smith's uncovering of mercury poisoning of Japanese villagers in the early 1970s, will not be released in the U.S. by MGM.

"This affects those in Minamata and people who experience similar things. And for anything…" Depp said in halting language. "For Hollywood’s boycott of, erm, me? One man, one actor in an unpleasant and messy situation, over the last number of years?"

"But, you know, I’m moving towards where I need to go to make all that…" Depp said before trailing off, adding, "To bring things to light."

Speaking of the circus-like showbiz trial's aftermath, Depp referred obliquely to the "absurdity of media mathematics."

"Whatever I’ve gone through, I’ve gone through. But, ultimately, this particular arena of my life has been so absurd," he said.

"What the people in Minamata dealt with? People who suffered with COVID? A lot of people lost (their) lives," Depp said. "But what I’ve been through? That’s like getting scratched by a kitten. Comparatively."

Is Johnny Depp's career kaput? Maybe, but don't underestimate the devotion of his fans

Depp said he has felt support from his fan base who have "stayed on the ride with me."

"They have always been my employers," Depp said. "I’m proud of these people, because of what they are trying to say, which is the truth. The truth they’re trying to get out since it doesn’t in more mainstream publications. It’s a long road that sometimes gets clunky. Sometimes just plain stupid."

Depp added he has no plans of stopping filmmaking even in the current environment.

"Actually, I look forward to the next few films I make to be my first films, in a way. Because once you’ve … Well, look," he says, again seemingly speaking in riddles. "The way they wrote it in The Wizard of Oz is that when you see behind the curtain, it’s not him. When you see behind the curtain, there’s a whole lot of (expletive) squished into one spot. All praying that you don’t look at them. And notice them."

The actor is set to receive a lifetime achievement award in late September at Spain's San Sebastian International Film Festival. However, the announcement was met with backlash from Spain's leading group of women filmmakers, condemning the festival's decision.

Depp's first interview also comes after Heard, 35, announced she gave birth to a baby girl, Oonagh Paige, on April 8. The actress is set to reprise her role as Mera in the "Aquaman" sequel "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," due for release in 2022.

"Lost a commercial with Uber eats partnering with the NFL," Cutler wrote on Twitter. "Was going to film in LA, 'views aren't aligned.' Guess they don't like future School board members. Frees up my weekend."

The 38-year-old Cutler only recently returned to Twitter and has used the social media platform to voice his displeasure with health regulations related to the coronavirus pandemic, including mask mandates.

The one-time Pro Bowl passer-turned-reality TV star also has hinted at a possible run for school board in Tennessee over mask mandates.

"We are proud of all the work Uber has done over the last year to help get as many people vaccinated as possible. As such, we prefer to partner with those who support that work," an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement to USA TODAY.

Cutler was a first-round selection – No. 11 overall – by the Denver Broncos in the 2006 NFL draft. After three seasons in Denver, Cutler was traded to the Chicago Bears. He had an up-and-down career in Chicago, twice leading the NFL in interceptions, while also helping the team reach the 2010 NFC championship game and becoming the Bears' all-time career passing yardage leader. After a brief retirement, Cutler signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins in 2017. He finished his 12-year NFL career passing for 35,133 yards and 227 touchdowns.

In 2013, Cutler married reality TV star Kristin Cavallari, and he made appearances on her show "Very Cavallari." Their marriage ended in divorce in 2020.

The picture highlights Page's toned abs and includes a TGIF sticker. Fans took a screenshot of the since-expired story, which looks to be taken in a trailer or dressing room, and have shared it with excitement for the actor.

Page's abs were previously seen in the shirtless pool picture he posted in March. In the caption Page wrote, "Trans bb’s first swim trunks #transjoy #transisbeautiful."

In March, Page shared that he had undergone top surgery (subcutaneous mastectomy), a procedure for transgender men to have breast tissue removed.

The surgery has made it possible for Page to recognize himself in the mirror, he told Time magazine in March. Page has been very open about the procedure, in part to raise awareness for trans healthcare rights.

"I want people to know that not only has it been life changing for me, I do believe it is life saving and it's the case for so many people," Page told Oprah Winfrey in April. "Because there is such an attack on trans health care right now, when already there is such a lack of access or trans people who don't even want to go to the doctor."

The internet has applauded Page for his show of trans joy. Cosmopolitan called the selfie "downright smoldering" and Men's Health commended him on his "thirst trap game."

Since coming out as transgender on Instagram last December, Page has used his social media platform to showcase trans pride and promote visibility and equality.

At the end of this month, Page will be honored with an achievement award from Outfest, a LGBTQ film festival in Los Angeles.

In a release announcing the award, Page accepted, saying, "Now more than ever, it is so important for our voices to be amplified and represented in film and media, and for people to hear our stories."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The new biopic “Respect” runs through two decades of Aretha Franklin’s life in 2½ hours, starting at age 9 and culminating with her back-to-the-roots gospel project “Amazing Grace.”

The film, starring Jennifer Hudson as the Queen of Soul and Forest Whitaker as her father, C.L. Franklin, is the movie directorial debut of Broadway veteran Liesl Tommy.

Tommy and her team say they sought to present a Franklin story that felt authentic, and they took pains to nail certain details – dissecting her recordings to accurately re-create the music, for instance, or using original blueprints to replicate the Franklin family home.

But for moviegoers, there are bound to be questions about key moments and plot points depicted in "Respect."

And they’ve got good reason to have their guard up: In recent years, music biopics have been called out for the history they've screwed up – from Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” to “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” not to mention this year’s other big Franklin project, the TV series “Genius: Aretha.”

Here’s some clarity on “Respect”:

'Respect':Jennifer Hudson reveals her final Aretha Franklin conversation and one condition of playing the legend

Did Dinah Washington curse and turn a table over when Aretha Franklin dared sing 'Unforgettable'?

In a scene set at New York’s Village Vanguard club in 1964, Washington (Mary J. Blige) becomes incensed when the little-known Franklin begins to play “Unforgettable,” one of the jazz great’s signature numbers.

Flipping her table in disgust, Washington curses at Franklin for daring to cover her song in her presence.

It’s unlikely that ever happened – at least not with Franklin.

Rather, the episode seems to be drawn from an incident involving Etta James, who once told writer David Ritz how Washington reacted badly when James performed “Unforgettable” during a Rhode Island set.

James said she ran to her dressing room in tears, later to be consoled by some mentoring words from Washington herself – just like “Respect” depicts the Aretha situation.

In Franklin’s 1998 memoir, "From These Roots," also written by Ritz, the singer recounted a less incendiary encounter with Washington, following a Detroit performance: The visiting Queen of the Blues chided Franklin for leaving shoes all over the dressing room.

Review:As Aretha Franklin, a soulful Jennifer Hudson keeps 'Respect' from hitting the wrong note

Was Aretha Franklin raped as a young girl by a guest at her father’s home?

In “Respect,” Aretha is seen as a 10-year-old in her Detroit bedroom when an older, unnamed male house guest wanders in, offering to be her “boyfriend.” In a later flashback, it's implied that’s when she was violated and impregnated.

The paternity of Franklin’s oldest son has long been shrouded in mystery. She was 12 when she gave birth to Clarence, and some accounts through the years contended the father was a schoolmate named Donald Burke. Others speculated she was raped while on the road down South, traveling with her father's gospel caravan.

But in a will purportedly handwritten by Franklin and discovered after she died in 2018, she identifies a man named Edward Jordan Sr. as the father of Clarence. Though few details about him have circulated, Jordan was known to have fathered her son Edward, born when Franklin was 15.

In the will, Franklin emphatically declares that Clarence's father is to receive no money or property: "He has never made any contribution to his welfare, future or past."

Did the Beatles really offer Aretha an exclusive song – which she turned down?

Yes and no.

In “Respect,” producer Jerry Wexler (Marc Maron) tells Franklin she has been offered a song to record, and if she passes, the Beatles want it for themselves.

The composition in question: “Let It Be.”

Franklin is seen rejecting the idea. It’s a Catholic song, she says, and “I’m Baptist.” (If Aretha really did perceive “Let It Be” that way, she’s certainly not alone – though the song’s “Mother Mary” lyric is actually a reference to Paul McCartney’s late mom.)

In reality, according to Wexler, the Beatles had sent him an early demo of the gospel-inflected McCartney song and Franklin did record it. Though she initially hesitated to release the track, it appeared on her seventh Atlantic Records album, alongside another Beatles cover, “Eleanor Rigby.”

In fact, her take on the song, released in January 1970, beat the Beatles to the punch: The world wouldn’t hear the group's own version of “Let It Be” until their single was released two months later.

Did Aretha Franklin really fall off the stage in a drunken stupor during a concert?

In spring 1967, the singer definitely had an onstage mishap during a Columbus, Georgia, performance, breaking her arm. That May, Jet magazine published a photo of Franklin in a sling at Detroit’s Henry Ford Hospital.

The cause of the accident is murky. At the time, the official explanation was that Franklin had been blinded by stage lights. But her agent Ruth Bowen, talking years later with biographer Ritz and relaying what she had been told by one of Franklin’s assistants, claimed the singer may have been “tipsy.”

In the movie, her drunken onstage collapse is placed later in the '60s, as Franklin wrestles with fame and the death of Martin Luther King Jr. She hits the deck while mumbling her way through “I Say a Little Prayer,” a chart smash for her in fall 1968.

But the real-life incident happened much earlier, when Franklin was tasting her first success with Atlantic.

Did Jerry Wexler name Aretha the Queen of Soul?

Here, “Respect” is a bit fuzzy: Maron's Wexler, pictured speaking to cameras for a promotional video, affirms Franklin’s status as “Queen of Soul.” The movie doesn’t explicitly give the producer credit for the coronation, but viewers may be left with that impression.

While not depicted in the film, the title was bestowed on Franklin in early 1967 by Chicago disc jockeys Pervis Spann and E. Rodney Jones. It came as they honored her at a Regal Theater event, with Spann placing a crown on her head.

Did everybody really call her 'Ree'?

Ree? Not really, according to family members.

While that nickname would later become popular for some inside Franklin’s circle, it wasn’t the go-to moniker during her younger life. Contrary to what’s seen in “Respect,” where “Ree” flies left and right, friends and family called her "Aretha."

In the movie, the nickname is even depicted as the inspiration for one of the signature backing vocals in the hit song “Respect”: As Franklin’s sisters help her work out the tune at a piano, they start singing “Ree-Ree-Ree” in tribute to her.

In truth, that backup vocal hook was likely just a catchy spin on the title – “Reeeee-spect.”

Franklin’s kin say the movie whiffed on another intimate family detail. In a scene set at her California home, a frazzled Aretha is snapping at everyone around her. Amid the tension, her grandmother – Big Mama, as she was known – agrees to take the singer’s young sons back to Detroit. Just one hitch: Big Mama wouldn’t have been there. She didn’t travel.

Did C.L. Franklin offer words of encouragement just before a nervous Aretha recorded 'Amazing Grace'?

While her preacher father was present at the Los Angeles church where “Amazing Grace” was captured in 1972 for a best-selling gospel album and documentary, he wouldn’t have given her a pep talk in a stairwell beforehand.

That’s because C.L. Franklin didn’t show up until Day 2.

C.L. Franklin took to the pulpit that second night to address the congregation, just before Aretha performed the song that had been her first professional recording, “Never Grow Old.”

In unreleased footage from Sydney Pollack’s documentary shoot, C.L. Franklin describes how he crammed clothes into a suitcase and hopped onto a last-minute flight from Detroit to make the final day of the sessions.

NEW YORK (AP) — “Free Guy,” an action comedy starring Ryan Reynolds as a background character in a videogame, opened better than expected over the weekend, collecting an estimated $28.4 million in ticket sales despite a marketplace challenged by COVID-19.

After a few weeks of declining audiences and underwhelming debuts amid the delta variant surge, “Free Guy” succeeded with an old-school formula: an original, star-fronted movie with good word-of-mouth playing only in theaters. The movie directed by Shawn Levy was made by the Walt Disney Co.-owned 20th Century Fox, with a theatrical release contractually stipulated for the roughly $100 million production.

Playing in 4,165 North American theaters, “Free Guy” was expected to debut around $20 million. Its surprisingly strong opening gave further proof to what some analysts have been saying throughout the year — hybrid releases that send new movies immediately onto streaming platforms can significantly sacrifice ticket sales. The last two No. 1 movies — Warner Bros.′ “The Suicide Squad” and Disney’s “Jungle Cruise” — were debuted simultaneously in theaters and homes.

But however movies are being released right now, box office conditions are far from ideal. The rise in U.S. coronavirus cases over the last month has corresponded with diminished ticket sales at theaters. Some cities, including New York and San Francisco, are preparing to make vaccine passports required for entering movie theaters.

David A. Gross, who runs the movie consultancy FranchiseRe, estimates that new releases are selling about half the tickets they normally would.

“Since Memorial Day weekend, the domestic box office has been running at approx. 50% of 2019 levels, with several spikes from strong titles, but then returning to 50% of 2019,” Gross said in an email. “Under normal conditions, ‘Free Guy’ would be opening 50% higher than this weekend’s number — comfortably.”

But the enthusiasm for “Free Guy” was enough to lead Reynolds to announce Saturday that Disney wants a sequel. In the film, Reynolds’ character, Guy, realizes he’s a “non playable character” in a “Grand Theft Auto”-like game. It features co-stars Jodie Comer, Lil Rel Howery and Taika Waititi.

Reviews were good (82% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), and a male-heavy audience gave “Free Guy” an “A” CinemaScore. (About 60% of moviegoers were male, Disney said.) “Free Guy” also added $22.5 million internationally.

“Free Guy” is also the latest in a comeback for gaming-based movies. After decades of futility, Hollywood is increasingly finding success by mining videogames for intellectual property. Reynolds starred in one of the best performing videogame adaptations — 2019′s “Pokémon: Detective Pikachu,” which grossed $432 million worldwide.

“Free Guy” will play exclusively in theaters for at least 45 days — and its strong performance through the weekend suggests it could buck the summer’s typical trend of fast drop offs.

Last week’s top film, “The Suicide Squad,” slid steeply, dropping 70% in its second weekend. After its $26.2 million debut, James Gunn’s “Suicide Squad” redo pulled in just $7.8 million for Warner Bros., bringing its two-week total to $42.9 million. It’s concurrently playing on HBO Max.

That film’s tumble gave a few other releases more room at multiplexes. Sony Pictures’ horror sequel “Don’t Breathe 2” opened with $10.6 million, in line with studio projections. While “Don’t Breathe 2” debuted with less than half the opening of the 2016 original, the sequel was made with a modest budget of $15 million.

MGM and United Artists’ Aretha Franklin biopic “Respect,” starring Jennifer Hudson, debuted with $8.8 million. “Respect,” which has drawn praise for Hudson’s leading performance, also landed an “A” CinemaScore. Its audience was 66% female.

Apple didn’t report grosses for “CODA,” one of the company’s major movie acquisitions and one seen as a crowd-pleasing milestone in deaf representation of on screen. The film, starring deaf actors Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur and Daniel Durant, was a prize-winning sensation at the Sundance Film Festival in January, where Apple plunked down a festival-record $25 for the film. “CODA,” which stands for child of a deaf adult, debuted simultaneously in theaters and on Apple TV+.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Onscreen "Game of Thrones" couple and real-life friends Emilia Clarke and Jason Momoa reunited this weekend at a birthday celebration. The pair took to Instagram to show their affection, with photos capturing them in each other's arms and lots of heart emojis.

Clarke, who played dragon queen Daenerys Targaryen, posted a photo on Saturday of Momoa literally sweeping her off her feet at a party for "Thrones" co-creator David Benioff. She captioned it, "When your sun and stars rolls into town you check that he can still bench press a Khaleesi."

Momoa commented on the post, "love u forever moon of my life" including seven heart emojis.

The cast members have remained friends for years, despite only sharing a few episodes together before Momoa's character, Khal Drogo, was killed at the end of the first season.

In the caption, Clarke referenced her character's short-lived romance with the fierce Dothraki warlord, adding the hashtags #drinkingwithdrogoimamazedwesurvived #theboysarebackintown and #likeheneverleft.

Momoa, who in real life is married to actress Lisa Bonet, shared his own collection of photos from the celebration, including a picture of Clarke sitting on his lap. He wrote in the caption, "MOON OF MY LIFE. you are wonderful love u forever" and referenced the pair's wide grins with the hashtag "#smilelyeyes."

In the rest of the caption, Momoa celebrated "Game of Thrones" showrunner Benioff and included photos of the two together at the party.

The cast members, many of whom share off-screen connections, reunite frequently and share photos with their loyal fanbase. In April, the "Game of Thrones" cast and crew joined host Conan O'Brien for an reunion special to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the show.

In 2022, the "Game of Thrones" universe will be expanded upon in the upcoming series "House of the Dragon," a prequel about the House of Targaryen civil war set centuries before the time of Clarke's character.
