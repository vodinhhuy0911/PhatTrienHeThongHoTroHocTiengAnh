It was July in north Norfolk and the coast road was busy with holiday traffic. Visitors were thronging the narrow, flint-cottage streets of villages like Cley-next-the-Sea and Blakeney, streets that would become even busier once the summer school holiday got into full swing in August. Most visitors travel here to enjoy the relaxed seaside atmosphere of Norfolk's former fishing ports; some come for the beaches, like the enormously wide arc of sparkling sand at Holkham Bay near Wells-next-the-Sea. Others are drawn by the seafood, which here on the coast is usually so fresh that it is still redolent of the North Sea that bore it.

Cromer crabs are one popular local delicacy here, as are Brancaster mussels and cockles from Stiffkey, known locally as "Stewkey blues". What is less familiar to most visitors is a locally abundant wild plant that provides the perfect accompaniment to seafood. Samphire – or, as locals call it, "sam-fer" – is not the same plant that Shakespeare writes about in King Lear ("Half-way down, hangs one that gathers samphire; dreadful trade!"), which is rock samphire found only on precarious cliff faces, but marsh samphire, Salicornia europaea, a species that, as its name suggests, grows in coastal marshes.

Although it shares the same iodine-rich briny quality, marsh samphire is not a type of seaweed but a cacti-like, salt-tolerant plant that thrives in mud that is covered by the incoming tide twice a day. Marsh samphire can be found all around the British coast in suitable habitats, but many consider the most succulent is that which grows in the vast tidal mudflats of the north Norfolk coast.

Picked between June and August before it becomes woody, part of this locally abundant plant's charm comes from its habit of growing in inaccessible places. It is a plant of the edge, of saltmarsh and creeks: that nebulous tidal zone where it is never quite clear where the land ends and the sea begins. At its most palatable early in the season, the timing of its picking is crucial, not only of time of year but also of the sea itself, as the gathering of samphire necessitates a venture out into muddy creeks at low tide. For those who pick the plant, a good knowledge of local geography and sometimes treacherous tides is essential, as are Wellington boots and a tolerance of mud.

Shortly after the US Forest Service was established in the early 20th Century, a series of seven major fire lookout towers were planned along the Front Range, from Wyoming to New Mexico, to aid in the detection of wildfires. Devil's Head was one of the original sites. First stationed in 1912, a lookout tower was built in 1919 and was staffed by Helen Dowe, the first female fire lookout in Colorado and the second in the United States, after Hallie Morse Dagger of California. In 1951, the Army's Company A, 973rd Engineer Construction Battalion from Fort Carson built the new tower, which is still in use today. Over the years, the tower gained local prominence due to its unique position atop a large granite outcrop, with panoramic views of the Front Range. In 1991, Devil's Head Lookout was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Farinacci-Silfies took over the lookout position two years prior from veteran lookout Billy Ellis, who retired at 87. During his 35 seasons staffing the Devil's Head lookout, Ellis spotted 200 fires and climbed the equivalent of Mt. Everest 43 times. Thinking back to the origins of the Forest Service, Farinacci-Silfies smiles at the fact that now, 100 years after Helen Dowe first staffed the tower, a woman is again watching over the forest.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Standing in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal in Guatemala, visitors are surrounded by steep limestone pyramids nearly as tall as Notre Dame cathedral while the calls of howler monkeys and toucans emanate from the site's rainforest backdrop. Constructed without the aid of beasts of burden, metal tools or the wheel, these grandiose stoneworks served as the seats of power for the kings and priests who ruled over what was one of the most influential city states in the Maya realm, which spanned Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize as well as portions of Honduras and El Salvador.

Tikal was an economic and ceremonial hub of a civilisation that, in light of recent laser-based aerial surveys that revealed more than 60,000 structures hidden for centuries by thick jungle, may have once encompassed as many as 10 to 15 million people in total.

In the presence of Tikal's massive stone palaces and temples, each one oriented to attend to the sun's daily transit across the sky, the Maya's prowess as architects and astronomers looms large. But the Maya never would have accurately predicted eclipses and these monuments never would have risen up towards the sky without the mastery of something much more elemental to Mayan survival at Tikal: water.

With no rivers or lakes nearby, the Maya had to create a network of huge reservoirs at Tikal to collect and store enough rainwater during the region's prodigious wet season to last its sizable population – estimates range from 40,000 to as many as 240,000 people at the city's 8th Century peak – through the four- to six-month dry season. These reservoirs facilitated more than 1,000 years of Mayan presence at Tikal, from roughly 600 BC until the site's urban core was finally abandoned by the ruling class around 900 AD.

Last year, archaeologists using modern scientific techniques revealed a new depth to the Maya's hydrological feats. Sediment cores taken from Tikal's reservoirs show that the Maya created the oldest known water filtration system in the western hemisphere.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"You know there is a book by Jules Verne called the Mysterious Island, where people find themselves on an island and begin to build a civilisation?" asked Mykhailo Videiko, an archaeologist at Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University in Ukraine. "But here it is not a fictional story," he paused. "This is a real story." Silenced twice, once by time and again by politics, the ancient civilisation of Cucuteni-Trypillia is once again finding voices to share its story.

The story of Trypillia, as it is commonly known, started 7,000 years ago in what is now Eastern Europe, primarily Moldova, Romania and Ukraine. Excavated settlements offer modern archaeologists one of the earliest known examples of urbanisation and suggest a population that exceeded one million people.

The people of Trypillia "managed to implement almost all technological innovations of their time," said Videiko. Advanced kilns supported sophisticated pottery decorated with patterns and colour. Construction techniques allowed for buildings as large as 700sq m. Found objects indicate a culture that worshipped goddesses.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The local Khasi people, on the other hand, long ago adapted to the extreme precipitation. They build corrosion-resistant bridges using the roots of the Indian rubber tree (Ficus elastica), feeding them through hollow canes of Areca nut palm and training the growth for decades until the banks of a stream become connected. Since umbrellas are often rendered futile by strong winds, locals craft knup – knee-length carapaces made from bamboo and broom grass – that allow double-handed work even in rainstorms. In nearby Mawsynram, a village that has long competed with Sohra for the title of the world's wettest place, villagers use grass to sound-proof their huts against the battering of rain.

Today, Sohra receives an average annual rainfall of 11.43m, a modest figure compared to 1861 when the town had a record-breaking year of 26.46m of rain – enough to submerge the Statue of Liberty in waist-high water. That same year, it set a record for the most rainfall in a calendar month. Then, in 1995, Sohra broke another record when it received a staggering 2.49m of rain in 48 hours.

During winter, however, Sohra faces acute water shortages, compelling locals to fetch water from the nearest shared water tank or community tap. Homemade contraptions are used to ease the Herculean task of heaving several hundred litres of water every day on foot. Containers can be seen wedged under pipeline leaks everywhere, and people walk for miles to the closest spring for water-intensive chores such as washing clothes.

"My mother carried water when she was a child, I followed her footsteps, and now, my children follow my suit. They begin early in life – sometimes as young as four or five years of age. What can be done? It's unfortunate but everyday life for most children in Sohra can't be all fun and games – they have to share the burden of this land with the grown-ups," said Lakynti, a resident of Sohra.

During the May-to-September rainy season, however, leaky roofs and flooded rooms aren't unheard of. In many Khasi households, mornings mark the commencement of the crucial act of salvaging waterlogged belongings, a task reminiscent of the experience of Welsh missionary Thomas Jones, who wrote in 1841, "Most of my time is occupied in saving our goods from being ruined by the rain."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Maryann Tebben, author of Savoir-Faire: A History of Food in France, expands on the notion of a changing consumer, reflecting on how "they hear about it, they're reading about it, they're careful about the ecological footprint that they have, and they're more savvy than their parents or grandparents were about what food does for the environment."

When I think of French cuisine, plant-based cooking isn't the first thing that comes to mind. I think of meat, of Toulouse sausage, foie gras and calf brains. But, Ducasse points out, the growing emphasis on plant-based dishes didn't happen overnight; in recent years, vegetable-forward menus have been growing in the nation's top kitchens. And at Ducasse's restaurants, this focus goes back even further.

In 1987, he introduced plant-based menu Jardins de Provence to his three-Michelin-starred Le Louis XV restaurant in Monaco. Now, "30-40% of clients choose this 100% vegetarian menu," he explained.

Patrick Rambourg, a researcher specialising in French gastronomy and the author of Histoire de la cuisine et de la gastronomie françaises(History of French cuisine and gastronomy),has also been observing the transition to more sustainable cuisine in recent years. He agrees that France is in the midst of its next culinary evolution; and in his view, it wasn't catalysed by the pandemic. Instead, the movement has been slow and profound, he believes, growing due to an interplay between changing consumer demands and the eagerness of chefs to embrace the challenge of transforming vegetables into the star of a dish.

"The chefs are aware of a changing consumer that cares about where products come from. There are also people that want to eat high-end cuisine, gastronomy, but don't want to eat something unhealthy," he said. "There's a change in consciousness around cuisine. Kitchens don't have a choice but to adapt."

However it has come about, Ducasse is embracing the shift toward sustainable, vegetable-forward cuisine. In September, Naturaliste will transform into Sapid, a more permanent plant-based restaurant centred around conviviality on Rue Paradis in Paris's 10th arrondissement. It will feature a refectory-setup with communal tables, encouraging the social contact that people lacked during the past year.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The compatriots pushed their way through the debris into a Native American mound, amazed by what they saw. Inside lay unimaginable treasure. Hundreds of engraved conch shells, thousands of pearl and shell beads, copper breast plates, large human effigy pipes and piles of brightly coloured blankets and robes. Newspapers would later call the find an American "King Tut's tomb".

"Nothing like this had ever been discovered anywhere else in North America," said Eric Singleton, curator of ethnology at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. But the treasure soon disappeared.

Spiro Mounds had been unearthed by a group of local men who called themselves the Pocola Mining Company. The artefacts they discovered were immediately sold around the globe. Spiro's bounty is now spread among more than 65 museums across the US, Europe and Asia, and researchers are still discovering additional galleries and people possessing its riches. Nearly a century later, the incident remains the worst looting of an archaeological site in US history.

Onward travel east was only possible by foot or with pack animals. Now though, with Belt and Road construction, the track has been extended by some 75km, as far as the village of Bozai Gumbaz, around three quarters of the way along the Wakhan. "It follows an old trading route that the Kyrgyz nomads take to get to Sarhad from where they live around Chaqmaqtin Lake," said Summers. "The bulldozers have come in, and while they've only constructed something the size of a farmer's track, the potential consequences are much bigger. The Chinese are said to be building the stretch that will eventually connect their border with Bozai Gumbaz, something that will open up the cul-de-sac once more. Ultimately, it will give China great access to the markets of Central Asia and beyond." (Credit: Simon Urwin)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@But in the sea of revelry after the historic landing, one important crew member was missing: Mau Piailug, a master navigator from Satawal, a tiny atoll in Micronesia. He was the only crew member fluent in the art of wayfinding, and by 1976, he was one of few master navigators left in the world.

The Satawal people still relied on wayfinding for sustenance, and Piailug had started his training in tidepools with his grandfather, also a master navigator, before he could walk. That's why Hōkūle‘a's crew sought him out for their inaugural expedition; with wayfinding long absent from Hawaii, they needed an expert to teach them the craft. Piailug, who navigated the entire Hawaii-to-Tahiti journey, had hesitantly agreed to help, but soon regretted it. Crew members argued throughout the journey, and several lacked the required focus and discipline for non-instrumental navigation, so Piailug hurried home to Satawal as soon as Hōkūle‘a entered Pape'ete harbour. He left one parting gift: an eight-track cassette tape with return-voyage instructions and a final, fiery message: "Don't come look for me. You will never find me."

Despite Piailug's absence, the Hōkūle‘a crew set their sights on another Hawaii-to-Tahiti journey. But the ocean had other plans. In 1978, Hōkūle‘a capsized, and seasoned crew member Eddie Aikau, one of Hōkūle‘a's greatest supporters, surfed off to find help. Hōkūle‘a and the team were eventually rescued, but Aikau never returned. Grief swept in with hurricane-like force, jeopardising the future of this budding movement.

"Hōkūle‘a was on the brink of becoming just another canoe in a museum, like so many canoes are today," said Matahi Tutavae, a Tahitian voyager who trained and eventually sailed with the Hōkūle‘a crew in 2010. "[Polynesian] culture belonging to museums has been detrimental to our people. It says our traditions are stuck, they're in the past. But Nainoa [Thompson] was instrumental to getting Hōkūle‘a back in the water."

Thompson had trained with Aikau throughout the 1970s, and the two bonded through a mutual dedication to wayfinding, and the cultural pride it sparked. But the 1978 tragedy tested Thompson's strength – could he wayfind without his friend? The answer had to be yes, Thompson knew, and he would continue pushing Hōkūle‘a's limits to honour Aikau.

But the 1978 capsizing catastrophe did pinpoint the Hōkūle‘a crew's many blind spots – weaknesses that would make long-distance wayfinding risky, if not deadly. Thompson and his father, Myron "Pinky" Thompson, one of Hōkūle‘a's founders, knew they needed an expert versed in the art of non-instrumental navigation, someone who'd grown up wayfinding, to teach them – and the only man on the planet skilled enough for this task was the very man who'd sworn off Hōkūle‘a two years before.

Thompson flew to Micronesia anyway.

"Mau was there waiting for me," he recalled, noting that Piailug was heartbroken about Aikau. "We sat on a driftwood log by the beach, and I asked him, 'Can you come back? Will you teach us?'," That last question hit home for Piailug, who, in 1978, was just shy of 50 years old. "Mau needed to go down the end of his life knowing navigation would not go extinct, because if one day there are no navigators, we will be people no more."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Like an old man surveying his lawn for crickets, the bird's every step seemed deliberate, calculated even; his body was tilted forward, eyes focussed on the ground. The bird – the height of a toddler – stopped, scratched the earth with his strong claws, stabbed at a locust with his sturdy black beak and then stepped over to join two birds foraging nearby. The locust was still clamped in his strong bill; this male had a youngster to feed.

"I hear them every day now," Ndlovu, a wiry man with strong arms, said, jutting his chin towards the birds that nest close to his home. "They've been calling a lot; there will be rain soon."

Out here in the Matobo Hills of south-west Zimbabwe (recognised as a Traditional Cultural Landscape by Unesco), most families are subsistence farmers and rain is a fundamental element of survival. Here, these large black birds, Southern ground hornbills (Bucorvus leadbeateri), are considered to be the callers of the rain. Amahundundu, the Ndebele and Kalanga people of the Matobos call them, naming the birds for their low, thunderous call that can be heard up to 5km away. They are so important to these communities that when a ground hornbill dies, elders gather and give the bird the same traditional burial they would a human.

Kill an ihundundu ("i" refers to the bird in the singular, "ama" in plural), they believe, and you will go mad. You will anger the gods, rain will not fall and you could be banished from the community for life.

Southern ground hornbills, which live in family groups, can be found on open savannah and grassland all the way from South Africa to Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But as the species' natural territory has shrunk due to development, farming and overgrazing, its population has plummeted – to such an extent that the International Union for Conservation of Nature now classifies these apex predators as vulnerable in sub-Saharan Africa and endangered in South Africa and Namibia.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As this is Italy, good food must complete the idyllic scene. Enter Paolo Magnanimi, of the Appian Way's Hostaria Antica Roma. The restaurant is located within sight of the park's iconic Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella and fronted by a flower and vegetable garden tended by Magnanimi's father, Massimo. Inside, the menu lists dishes that can't be found at any other restaurant in the city, or perhaps in the world. Behind these creations is Magnanimi, a cook passionate about creating and serving meals that are deeply rooted in this park's history, from the days of ancient Rome.

For most, ancient Roman food doesn't sound appealing. What first comes to mind are freakish scenes like Trimalchio's banquet in the 1st-Century AD story Satyricon, where a nouveau riche host throws an ostentatious feast that includes such "delicacies" as bull's testicles, sow's udders and a hare decorated with wings to resemble Pegasus.

But Magnanimi keeps it real, recreating delicious dishes that regular Romans ate, not the exotic fare that was reserved for the super elite. A chef and historian who has spent more than 25 years studying ancient recipes, Magnanimi says Romans were nature lovers and sensual pleasure seekers who greatly appreciated good food, though over-indulging was very "un-Roman". Grains, legumes, vegetables, eggs and cheeses were the base of the diet, with fruit and honey for sweetness. Meat (mostly pork), and fish were used sparingly, and as the empire expanded beginning in the 3rd Century BC, Romans welcomed new flavours – be it pepper from India or lemons from Persia. Garum, similar to an Asian fish sauce, was liberally used to add a rich umami flavour to Roman dishes. All this was enjoyed with honeyed wine at dinners called convivium – gatherings to celebrate life and the seasons.

Magnanimi embodies this spirit of celebration, whether telling stories to guests or stirring up something delicious in his kitchen. Now 54, he laughs telling me how as a younger man he had a hard time convincing his father that customers would like his revivals of ancient dishes.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"We were old school, so used radiotelemetry to track them," she said. "As I walked, I was passing so many mushrooms and a big orangey-red one on a tree stump caught my eye. I really wanted to know its name, but it was impossible to find out anything." The lack of information about Chilean fungi hit Furci, who was studying aquaculture during this period, like a "lightning bolt". "I suddenly thought, 'This is what I'm going to do [with my life]'," she said. "Nothing had happened previously with me and fungi, apart from trying psilocybin – magic mushrooms – at some point. But that wasn't the reason. It was just this one mushroom in the forest."

Since that moment in 1999, Furci has dedicated her life to studying, protecting and championing one of the planet's most important but least-known group of organisms. She became Chile's first female field mycologist (a biologist specialising in fungi), has written field guides and, in 2012, launched the Fungi Foundation, the first NGO dedicated to these organisms. The following year, thanks in large part to her work, Chile made history by becoming the first country in the world to include protection of fungi – organisms such as yeasts, moulds, mildews and lichens, as well as mushrooms – in its environmental legislation.

"My work is really about bringing justice to the fungi, acknowledging their essential and fundamental role," she said. "They're the coolest and most important organisms on Earth. Life on Earth wouldn't exist as we know it without them. But they're unacknowledged."

Speaking from her home in Santiago, Furci described herself as a "product of exile". She was born and brought up in London after her Chilean mother, a student and member of the Socialist party, was forced to flee by the brutal Pinochet dictatorship. After the return of democracy in 1990, the family moved to Chile when Furci was 15. "The children of exiles are a generation of unrooted people," she said with a smile.

Pausing periodically to sip mate tea, Furci explained that even as a teenager she was driven by the desire to have a positive impact on the world. "I was always interested in giving back, either to humanity or the Earth," she said. Although she came to fungi by chance, these essential but under-appreciated organisms were a natural fit. "Fungi are the recyclers, the decomposers; they make sure energy is ever flowing in ecosystems," she said. "Fungi allow plants to live outside of water [by providing nutrients and moisture in return for sugars produced from photosynthesis]. They allow animals to digest their food." Remarkably, fungi even enable plants to communicate with each another. Thin strands of mycorrhizal fungi connect different root systems and allow information and nutrients to be exchanged. These subterranean networks have been dubbed the "wood wide web".
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Carving and moving the pillars would have been a tremendous task, but perhaps not as difficult as it seems at first glance. The pillars are carved from the natural limestone layers of the hill's bedrock. Limestone is soft enough to work with the flint or even wood tools available at the time, given practice and patience. And because the hill's limestone formations were horizontal layers between 0.6m and 1.5m thick, archaeologists working at the site believe ancient builders just had to cut away the excess from the sides, rather than from underneath as well. Once a pillar was carved out, they then shifted it a few hundred metres across the hilltop, using rope, log beams and ample manpower.

Schmidt thought that small, nomadic bands from across the region were motivated by their beliefs to join forces on the hilltop for periodic building projects, hold great feasts and then scatter again. The site, Schmidt argued, was a ritual centre, perhaps some sort of burial or death cult complex, rather than a settlement.

That was a big claim. Archaeologists had long thought complex ritual and organised religion were luxuries that societies developed only once they began domesticating crops and animals, a transition known as the Neolithic. Once they had a food surplus, the thinking went, they could devote their extra resources to rituals and monuments.

Gobekli Tepe, Schmidt told me, turned that timeline upside down. The stone tools at the site, backed up by radiocarbon dates, placed it firmly in the pre-Neolithic era. More than 25 years after the first excavations there, there is still no evidence for domesticated plants or animals. And Schmidt didn't think anyone lived at the site full-time. He called it a "cathedral on a hill".
