THE world has an energy dilemma. On the one hand, we need to drastically clean up energy use in higher-income countries to tackle climate change. But on the other, there are still millions of people who don’t have reliable access to energy. As their energy access improves, there is a risk that this could offset some of the world’s shift to low-carbon energy. It doesn’t have to be that way: this is also an opportunity for some countries to skip much of the fossil fuel stage altogether.

For low-income countries, making big improvements in access to electricity is crucial. Better access to energy is linked to improvements in education, economic development and health, for example. According to the latest data from international organisation Sustainable Energy for All, more than 750 million people lack access to electricity and over 2.5 billion people don’t have access to clean cooking technologies or fuels. Many more have limited or unreliable access to electricity.

Improving this situation could be a chance to do things differently. Instead of developing energy infrastructures based on fossil fuels, low-income countries could leapfrog straight to cleaner, low-carbon technologies.

This isn’t a pipe dream. In the telecommunications sector, for example, landlines never fully took hold in many low-income countries. Instead, people moved straight to using mobile phones. This has also enabled services such as banking via “mobile money”.

The potential for leapfrogging in the electricity sector has been strengthened recently by the steep fall in the costs of renewable technologies, and reductions in the costs of complementary technologies such as batteries. According to a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, the cost of large-scale solar has fallen by 85 per cent in the past decade, while wind power costs have fallen by about 50 per cent. The conventional assumption that fossil fuel electricity is cheaper is now on its way out, as is the idea that improved access is all about centralised electricity grids.

A good example of this is the solar homes programme in Bangladesh, which extended electricity access to 4 million homes (about 12 per cent of the population) by 2016. This provided much quicker access to services such as electric lighting than extending the centralised electricity grid would have done.

Similarly, off-grid solar systems now provide about 7 per cent of Rwanda’s population with access to electricity. Many of these systems are large enough to power TVs and appliances as well as lighting.

Of course, initiatives like these don’t completely solve the energy access problem. To provide the necessary power for industries and all domestic uses, renewables must be deployed at a much larger scale. This requires investment in grid infrastructure, too. It will be important to avoid repeating the recent experience of Vietnam, where solar and wind investment increased rapidly, but many plants couldn’t operate fully because of grid constraints.

So what else needs to happen to make leapfrogging possible? It is crucial to recognise that most low-income countries have very low emissions and their priority has to be expanding energy systems to underpin economic development and universal energy access. Fossil fuels shouldn’t be entirely ruled out, but should be part of a wider strategy that prioritises low-carbon investments. That often means reforms to policies and regulations so that low-carbon options aren’t disadvantaged, and a big scale-up of finance from donors to reduce the financial risks of adoption. Only then will low-income countries be able to leapfrog to cleaner energy.

Paving materials come in many forms (clockwise from top: granite, cement, marble, cobbles), but being hard makes them less than ideal for pedestrians Top: Gordon Scammell/Alamy; Bottom (L/R): Franck Legros/Getty Images; David Keith Jones/Alamy; The Photo Works/Alamy

WHEN Viveca Wallqvist first phoned a local asphalt company, she didn’t mince her words. “I have something to tell you,” she said. “Your material is really hard – too hard. People are getting hurt.” Her comments didn’t go down well. “They were like, ‘Who is this crazy scientist?,'” she recalls. Asphalt is supposed to be hard, they said. But a few days later, the company rang back. It was the beginning of a journey that could reinvent the ground we walk on.

Wallqvist’s passion is rare. It is more than two millennia since the Romans laid their first pavimentum, from where we get the word “pavement”. Since then, very few people have questioned the fact that the pavements we walk on are, in effect, extensions of the road surface, made of stuff with properties that almost exclusively reflected the needs of horse-drawn and then motorised vehicles rather than pedestrians. Wallqvist, a materials chemist at the Research Institutes of Sweden in Stockholm, is determined to change that.

Meanwhile, in London, plans are afoot to build a giant research facility to test new, spongier walking surfaces. It is the brainchild of Nick Tyler at University College London, who is also convinced that pavement pounding is harming us. The average person takes around 200 million steps in a lifetime, he notes, and we aren’t evolved to deal with such hard surfaces.

IT IS almost impossible to go a day without interacting with an algorithm. They help direct the whole of our online experience, recommending what we should buy, read, watch and listen to. Some 74 per cent of adults in the US use Facebook at least once a day – and what they see is decided entirely by an algorithm. Offline, they are increasingly used to help us make tricky decisions, screening job applications, moderating exam results and even directing which crimes police investigators focus on.

As they have become ubiquitous, algorithms have generated a mixture of hype and concern. On the one hand, we are regularly told that they can be opaque and biased. On the other, we hear that they can be incredibly handy, pulling off tasks that humans can struggle with, from optimising complex trade logistics to spotting the earliest signs of disease in medical scans.

Ollie Hirst

MANY of us have uploaded our lives to the internet. Banking, work emails, social media, dating profiles, medical records – all that vital, sensitive information. So it is a little disconcerting that the internet has a fatal security flaw. Don’t panic; our private information is safe for now. But before very long the encryption algorithms that protect us online are going to crack.

That is the urgent driving force behind a new, more secure kind of internet that harnesses the power of the quantum realm. Once up and running, the system will be able to do a lot more than protect our data. It could bring us unforeseen quantum apps, and maybe become the scaffold for a world-spanning quantum computer of incredible power.

Building the quantum internet is a huge and multi-faceted engineering challenge, but the foundations are already being laid. Networks of fibres are spreading. Scientists are chatting in secret on local networks. There are even plans to use tiny satellites to enable long-distance quantum connections. Sooner or later, we could all be joining the quantum information superhighway.

Human culture and industry have long been based on information. If you could get the right kind of information, understand it and share it, you could gain power and profit. The rise of the internet as we know it cemented the role of information and we are only beginning to feel its profound effects. Now we are at the threshold of a new information age, which could change things all over again.

A newly described species of wild tobacco that scientists found growing next to a highway truck stop in Western Australia is covered in sticky glands that trap and kill small insects, including gnats, aphids and flies.

While a range of carnivorous plants are known across the plant kingdom, this is the first wild tobacco plant discovered to kill insects. Dubbed Nicotiana insecticida, it was uncovered by a project looking for tobacco plants across Australia.

The team, which included Mark Chase of London’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, collected seeds from the insecticidal plant at a truck stop on the Northwest Coastal Highway, and then cultivated them at Kew, where the plants went on to develop the same sticky glandular hairs and to kill insects inside the greenhouses.

The insect-ensnaring hairs resemble those on carnivorous sundew plants, but it isn’t clear if the plant extracts any food from the insects it kills. “We have no evidence that there is any nutritional benefit to the plant,” says Chase, who adds that the team is arranging some tests to see whether the plant absorbs any nutrients.

But even if it doesn’t absorb nutrients, killing insects in this way could still be beneficial for N. insecticida. “It definitely protects the plants from insects like aphids,” says Chase.

The plants may also benefit when the dead insects decay. Chase says the species may be like South African Roridula plants, which kill insects in the same way. “There is a bug that lives on these plants and is not trapped by the sticky hairs. It eats the trapped insects and defecates on the ground, and the plant benefits from this,” says Chase. However, there is no evidence yet that this is what happens with N. insecticida.

Nicotina insecticida has sticky hairs that trap insects Maarten Christenhusz

The plant hasn’t yet been approved for commercial use by Australia, and the terms of the collecting permits issued to botanists like Chase strictly prohibit them from developing commercial applications. However, Chase says N. insecticida is fairly easy to grow and could perhaps be used as a biological control agent for killing aphids and fungus gnats in greenhouses.

The species is one of seven new-to-science species of Nicotiana described by the team. The others include Nicotiana salina, which grows along salt lakes on the eastern edge of the Western Australian wheatbelt, and Nicotiana walpa in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the Northern Territory, which only grows after storms strike the desert.

It has been a busy week for insecticidal plants – a study published on Monday revealed that a plant that grows in bogs along the west coast of North America uses its flowers to eat insects. Before now, researchers had no idea that Triantha occidentalis was carnivorous.

A plant that grows in bogs along the west coast of North America has been spotted using its flowers to eat insects. Until now, researchers had no idea it was carnivorous.

Carnivorous plants absorb nutrients from insects and sometimes vertebrates. Before now, there were 11 known groups of such plants, with the last being described in 2012.

Now, Qianshi Lin and his colleagues at the University of British Columbia in Canada have demonstrated that a small flowering plant called Triantha occidentalis is also a meat-eater.

“It is not just another species of known carnivorous plants,” says Lin. “This is a totally new group of carnivorous plants.”

The researchers decided to look at T. occidentalis after previous research found the plant had lost genes that were also missing in carnivorous plants. They examined the concentration of nitrogen within the plant and found it comparable to carnivorous plants, suggesting it could be acquiring the nitrogen from insects.

Read more: Carnivorous pitcher plants are regularly eating vertebrate animals

To find out more, the researchers placed fruit flies that had been fed nitrogen-15 isotopes onto the clustered flowers on the plant’s stems, which are known as inflorescences and had previously been noted to have sticky hairs that could be used for trapping insects. They later found this isotope inside the plant at higher concentrations than before the fruit flies were introduced, which indicated that it had consumed the fruit flies.

“Somewhat unique is that they capture insects with inflorescences,” says Gerhard Gebauer at the University of Bayreuth in Germany. “Most carnivorous plants capture insects with their leaves so this is unexpected in a certain way.”

Gebauer had previously suspected that plants within Triantha are carnivorous after observing that the nitrogen concentrations of Tofieldia calyculata, a plant in the same family found in the Austrian Alps, were different to those of non-carnivorous plants in the region.

“Nobody else before has expected carnivorous plants in this taxonomic group, except for [Tofieldia calyculata],” says Gebauer.

My, what blue wool you have Veryan Dale/Alamy Stock Photo

LIKE many constructions, it started small. But now thousands of children with autism are making friends and learning social skills by playing a version of online building game Minecraft.

Stuart Duncan got the idea through a popular blog he ran about his own experiences with autism as well as bringing up a son with autism. Other parents with autistic children started telling him that their kids were crazy about a game that let them explore a randomly generated wilderness. However, despite loving the game, many of the children were being bullied by other players.

So, in 2013, Duncan, a web developer in Timmins, Canada, set up a server to run a version of Minecraft exclusively for children with autism and their families. He thought the invite-only server would attract 10 or 20 people. To his surprise, hundreds requested to join in the first few days.

Advertisement

Now, almost three years later, running “Autcraft” is his full-time job. The community boasts nearly 7000 members, along with a team of admins to help manage its many activities. “Parents see such a benefit for themselves and their children,” says Duncan.

“Minecraft strips away the pressures and distractions of the real world. You can really just be yourself“

The server caught the eye of Kate Ringland at the University of California, Irvine. She has spent 60 hours inside this virtual world, watching how the kids play and chat to one another. Ringland sees Autcraft as not just another online community, but as a tool that helps autistic children practise social skills. She will present her work at the Human Factors in Computing conference in San Jose, California, next month.

In Minecraft, you manipulate blocks of materials like wood and stone to build whatever you like – from painstaking recreations of cities to simple computers. “This is a great way for them to play a game they love, but also have a social experience,” says Ringland. “It’s giving an alternative way for these kids to express themselves and communicate without the stresses of the physical life stuff.”

Everyday social situations can be challenging for autistic children, who may struggle to pick up on social cues or understand another person’s perspective. Duncan thinks Minecraft strips away the pressures typical of the real world. There is no noisy or unfamiliar environment to distract you, no pressure to track the other person’s facial expressions or worry about eye contact. “With Minecraft, you can really just be yourself,” he says. “The social interactions, the relationships, the communication – everything just boils down to you and your keyboard.”

To join Autcraft, you must fill out an application. Once approved, you are free to roam the landscape and build your own structures. You can also take part in group games – like massive battles against “withers”, a kind of ghostly villain – or build things as a team. But you have to stick to some rules. Harassing other players or destroying their property can get you banned. A spin-off server for teenagers is slightly more permissive.

Ringland observed players on Autcraft and combed through discussions on related online forums. She saw people build friendships and have fun together. She also saw kids expressing their feelings – joy over a good time in the game, and anxiety or sadness about problems in the real world. “There’s a lot of reflection going on,” she says. “Minecraft is supporting a lot of these social behaviours.”

Joining a community like Autcraft could be a good first step to feeling less socially anxious and more engaged, says Elizabeth Laugeson, director of the PEERS Clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles, which teaches young adults with autism how to build relationships. But it shouldn’t be the only outlet for learning these skills, she says. “Minecraft is not necessarily teaching the social skills they need to navigate the real world.”

Yet where it works, Autcraft shows how powerful it can be to create social environments centred on a common interest, says Matthew Lerner at Stony Brook University in New York. “It builds from the interests and passions of people with autism rather than trying to redirect or surprise them.”

Building connections Minecraft has helped Keith Stuart, games editor at The Guardian, build a relationship with his autistic son Zac, inspiring his forthcoming novel, A Boy Made of Blocks. “Most games have missions and objectives, pushing you in certain directions. Minecraft presents you with a world and a bunch of tools and you can do what you want. If Zac just wanted to roam the landscape hunting sheep or digging holes, he could. He is free to express himself. There are rules but they are very clear and don’t change. The powerful combination of openness and clear rules definitely appeals to my son. “I’ve written about this for The Guardian and had a flood of parents saying it is exactly what happened with their son or daughter. “As a parent of a child with autism, I worry about putting him in social situations. Autcraft and similar servers [see main story] try to create an environment in which people can express themselves without fear. That’s important to parents who are nervous about what their children will encounter in multiplayer online games. “Parents often have a managerial relationship with video games, but far from potentially being damaging to children, they can give us a new way to communicate. We learned so much about Zac and what he liked and what he wanted to be through talking to him about Minecraft.”

For the first time ever, Marburg virus disease has been confirmed in West Africa. The case was reported by health authorities in Guinea’s southern Gueckedou prefecture, where the country’s latest Ebola outbreak was declared over less than two months ago. Guinea is currently dealing with a third wave of covid-19 cases.

Guinea’s health ministry said that on 25 July the patient arrived at a local clinic in the Koundou area of Gueckedou for treatment and a medical investigation team was dispatched to investigate his worsening symptoms, including fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain and bleeding gums. He died on 2 August. A field laboratory in Gueckedou collected samples from the deceased patient and Guinea’s national haemorrhagic fever laboratory confirmed he had Marburg virus. The Pasteur Institute in Senegal also confirmed the result.

Described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a highly infectious virus that causes haemorrhagic fever, Marburg belongs to the same family as the Ebola virus.

Matshidiso Moeti, regional director for Africa at the WHO, noted that the ability of the country to quickly stem the spread of the disease largely relies on local health authorities and health officials being able to quickly detect the disease. Response to the outbreak is being built on Guinea’s past experience and expertise in managing Ebola, which is transmitted in a similar way, Moeti said.

The most recent outbreak of Marburg virus occurred in Uganda in 2017 during which three cases were confirmed. All three patients died. In 2005, the largest documented Marburg outbreak occurred in Angola, with 329 people dying out of a total of 374 cases.

While vaccines and some treatment options are now available for Ebola, there are none approved for Marburg aside from supportive care, including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms.

The government of Guinea said it is working with its partners to quickly implement contact tracing in order to find anyone who could have been in contact with the man who was confirmed to have contracted Marburg virus. It is also introducing public education and enlisting community members to raise awareness, as this is the first time that the disease has been recorded in the country.

WHO said it already has a team of infectious disease experts in the area, and that cross-border surveillance is being enhanced to quickly detect any cases, with neighbouring countries on alert.

“The Ebola control systems in place in Guinea and in neighbouring countries are crucial to the emergency response to the Marburg virus,” said a WHO statement.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica) showing its fangs Joe McDonald/Getty Images

Different snake species have independently evolved fangs that allow them to inject venom into other animals, either to attack prey or for defence. Now we know how: they turned small wrinkles inside the base of the fang – an ancient feature inherited by most living snakes – into deep channels to carry venom towards the tip.

Alessandro Palci at Flinders University in Australia and his colleagues wanted to explain the origins of venom fangs, which are found in so many species of snake that they must have evolved on several separate occasions.

They used high-resolution microCT scans to have a closer look at snake fangs. After examining fangs from 21 snake species and teeth in two lizard species they found a common feature. Inside, the dentine tissue near the base of the tooth or fang was folded into a series of vertical pleats extending towards the tooth tip. The researchers then took tissue samples from one lizard and three snake species to confirm the presence of these so-called plicidentine structures under the microscope.

Advertisement

“Before CT scanning there was really no way to look inside snake teeth in a satisfactory way,” says Andrew Durso at Florida Gulf Coast University, who wasn’t involved in the analysis. “They’re very small and very hard and so dissecting one was not really an option, especially if you want to visualise how it looks inside.”

Plicidentine is common in extinct reptiles but not as well-known in living animals, only previously reported in a few fish and three lizard species.

Different snakes have different types of venom fangs A. Palci

The team found plicidentine in both venomous and non-venomous snakes. Species that branch off near the base of the snake evolutionary tree – like non-venomous boas and pythons – have relatively small wrinkles.

But in the venomous snakes that branched off higher up the tree, the wrinkles are larger – and one wrinkle has developed into a deep channel that carries venom to the fang tip. “The plicidentine is always there but it’s probably a random mutation that causes the infoldings to grow bigger and form a groove,” says Palci.

This may be because, once any given snake evolved to produce venom, natural selection favoured those with larger plicidentine wrinkles to help channel the venom to the fang tip.

“If the venom gland is discharging venom close to the grooved tooth, then it’s a possibility the tooth will be selected for injecting venom,” says Palci.

The landmark report released yesterday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has left many people reeling about the current and future state of our planet. But Tamsin Edwards at King’s College London, a lead author on the report, says it is understandable that it takes time for the gravity of the situation to sink in. “I think many people aren’t that aware that we have already committed ourselves to changes that are irreversible. That is a profound thing to take on board,” she says.

Those changes include warmer ocean temperatures, ocean acidification and a decline in oxygen levels in our seas. All are now irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales because of humanity’s fossil fuel burning and other activities. “We are changing the planet. It will continue to change no matter what we do in terms of our emissions, for hundreds to thousands of years. That is beyond our comprehension in many ways,” says Edwards.

Her involvement in reviewing the global environmental crisis is intimately connected to her own personal health crisis. Edwards was appointed a lead author on the report in 2018, around the same time she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Three years ago, she delayed chemotherapy to attend a vital meeting in China with some of the 234 other authors of the report. The covid-19 pandemic pushed those meetings online, culminating in the past fortnight where the final text was approved by 195 governments, a process that adds to the report’s gravitas.

For Edwards, one key message from the report is the upgrade from human influence on global warming from “clear” in a 2013 IPCC report, to “unequivocal”. “The much, much stronger statements on human influence is really striking,” she says. “To see that human influence is the main driver of air temperatures, ocean temperatures, hot extremes, Arctic sea ice loss, glacier loss, sea level rise, and many other aspects as well, it’s an incredibly strong message.”

The IPCC’s findings may seem gloomy, but Edwards says they also show there is still hope. The report finds that in the very lowest of five scenarios for future CO 2 emissions, the world is likely to hit the Paris Agreement’s target of 1.5°C of warming in the next 20 years, before cooling later this century to 1.4°C.

“It is important to realise that it is still possible to limit warming to 1.5°C with not much overshoot, with immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in emissions. Obviously, optimism and pessimism isn’t the remit of our report. All we can do is lay out the evidence,” says Edwards.

Will the world listen to that evidence? Inger Andersen at the UN Environment Programme said on 9 August at a press conference that the world had failed to heed 30 years of warnings from the IPCC. “The world listened but didn’t hear. It listened but didn’t act strongly enough. As a result, climate change is a problem here, now,” she said.

Edwards says the response to the report has been positive, and has recognised that it isn’t just one study, but a review of 14,000 scientific papers. “I’ve seen a great willingness to listen,” she says. Moreover, the timing of the report, just three months before world leaders discuss political action on climate change at the COP26 conference in Glasgow, is helpful, says Edwards.

The report may be finished, but the work of Edwards, who is now clear of cancer, isn’t stopping. “I’ve always felt my strongest lever in climate change is to keep talking about it. I want to keep getting the science out there to the public and policy-makers, this year and beyond,” she says.

Roosting jam-packed together increases the spread of pathogens 167/Joel Sartore/Ocean/Corbis

EMMA TEELING loves bats. She is so keen on them that she has spent the past three summers clambering around Gothic churches in Brittany searching for greater mouse-eared bats under dusty eaves and in dark bell towers. She is aware that others do not share her passion. Bats have been demonised throughout history and across cultures. For most of us, Teeling’s little furry fliers are the crepuscular creatures of folklore, witchcraft and horror stories.

Indeed, the dread instilled by bats has only increased in recent years, with the discovery that they harbour the viruses that cause Ebola, SARS, MERS and other so-called emerging infectious diseases. Often fatal in humans, an outbreak of any of these is likely to cause widespread panic – and bats have paid the price. Although they rarely spread these pathogens directly to humans, whole bat colonies are being killed in the name of public health. But where some see a problem, Teeling, a geneticist at University College Dublin in Ireland, sees an opportunity.

The thing is, bats are weird. They don’t just carry headline-grabbing viruses, they are also renowned for the huge number and diversity of pathogens they host. In other mammals these would result in sickness or death, but bats hardly ever succumb to viral diseases. They almost never get cancer, too. In fact, they generally live between three and 10 times longer than other mammals of their size – one male Brandt’s bat tagged in Siberia in 1962 was recaptured 41 years later, still sprightly enough to catch prey and dodge predators.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Europe was provisionally reported on 11 August. The town of Syracuse on the Italian island of Sicily reached 48.8°C, 0.8°C higher than the previous European record.

High temperatures are also being recorded elsewhere. In Tunisia, the capital Tunis hit 49°C on 11 August according to Reuters, more than 2 degrees higher than the previous record of 46.8°C in 1982.

These record extreme temperatures across a swathe of southern Europe and northern Africa are almost certainly a result of global warming. The hot and dry conditions have led to many devastating fires. Italy has declared a state of emergency, and in Greece thousands of people had to be evacuated from the island of Evia as flames spread. The immediate cause of the heatwave is a ridge of high pressure over the Mediterranean, forming what is known as a heat dome.

The previous record for Europe, according to the World Meteorological Organization, is 48°C in Athens in 1977. The new record has to be validated by the WMO before it becomes official, which means checking that the local weather station is accurate and correctly set up.

The world has warmed by 1.09°C above 1850 to 1900 levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report out earlier this week. This warming is making extreme weather such as heatwaves happen more often, and also making such events more severe.

THE striking swirls in this shot of the Sea of Marmara, in north-west Turkey, represent one of the latest examples of the destructive effects of pollution.

Last month, photographer Muhammed Enes Yildirim used a drone to capture these mesmerising patterns, which are formed by what is known as marine mucilage. Also called sea snot, it is a mixture of mucus and various microorganisms, including phytoplankton.

When these microorganisms receive extra nutrients – from untreated waste water, for example – they multiply and make an excessive amount of mucus, which clumps together to form the thick swathes.

Although marine mucilage has routinely plagued Turkey’s waters since 2007, this year it stretches from the surface down to about 30 metres, in what is the largest and most damaging example yet. Thousands of cubic metres have already been collected.

The marine mucilage has become a huge environmental problem in recent months as it has grown, suffocating marine life beneath and disrupting fishing and tourism.

Lockdowns due to covid-19 resulted in more domestic waste water and detergent being released into the sea, making clean-up efforts more challenging.

Researchers predict that ongoing climate change will worsen the situation, as warming seas cause more algal “blooms” and so more marine mucilage.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Alma and Tom gradually become closer in this offbeat love story Christine Fenzl Film I’m Your Man Maria Schrader Advertisement

CAN happiness flourish even when it is knowingly built on fabrication? Is perfection conducive to a healthy partnership? Can artificial and emotional intelligence truly coexist? Fresh from her Emmy-winning success with the Netflix miniseries Unorthodox, Maria Schrader leaves such questions hanging in I’m Your Man, her fourth film.

Adapted from Emma Braslavsky’s short story Ich bin dein Mensch, this German-language tale stars Downton Abbey‘s Dan Stevens as Tom, the ideal life partner. He is a handsome sharp-dresser with blue eyes that could pierce a stone, a penchant for romantic gestures and a willingness to cater to every whim. He is also a humanoid robot.

Love in the time of algorithms has been explored in the Amazon anthology Soulmates and Netflix’s Osmosis and The One. However, the central coupling here is born out of necessity rather than a search for “the one”.

Academic Alma (Maren Eggert) has reluctantly agreed to house Tom in a three-week experiment, which will help finance her research. She is completely uninterested in sharing a bed, or even a conversation, with this apparent kindred spirit, created to make her happy. “Leaving me alone should be no problem at all,” she tells Tom, who can’t compute her disdain. “That’s what makes me happiest.”

I’m Your Man is a curiosity. You could call it a sci-fi rom, yet there is little if any sci-fi or, indeed, rom. The tech behind Tom comes into play just once when he briefly malfunctions, while the film’s Berlin setting is a near-future whose aesthetic is more soft pastels than dark dystopia.

Despite Tom’s best efforts to ignite a spark using the millions of data strands at his disposal, he is thwarted by a dismissive Alma at every turn. “Ninety-three per cent of German women dream of this,” he remarks, after running a candlelit bath, strewn with rose petals. “Guess which group I belong to,” comes the reply.

It is only when Tom tones down the programmed cliches and starts responding less, well, robotically that the iciness thaws. He senses the sadness behind Alma’s steely exterior, and his matter-of-fact, yet effective, probing renders their “couples counsellor” (Toni Erdmann‘s Sandra Hüller) obsolete. Before long, Alma surprises herself by defending Tom from a colleague with no sense of personal space.

If I’m Your Man had emerged from Hollywood, this would be the cue for wedding bells. But European arthouse tends to avoid wrapping things up neatly in a bow. Although she slowly succumbs to Tom’s attributes, both physical and mental, Alma always remains aware that she is being manipulated by his constant recalibration. Happily-ever-after never looks likely.

Still, the two stars ensure you remain invested in this relationship, wherever it leads. Eggert offsets Alma’s abrasiveness with a quiet vulnerability and compassion, particularly in the scenes with her cranky dad (Wolfgang Hübsch) who has dementia, which hint at her fear of ending up in a lonely state, too.

Meanwhile, Stevens is charm personified in a performance partly inspired by Cary Grant. His comic timing is exquisite, proving that his scene-stealing turn in last year’s Eurovision movie was no fluke.

Schrader has served up a new, if resolutely low-key, tragi-comic spin on the digital love story that combines depth, humour and, no matter how mechanical, heart.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra) Shutterstock / Ethan Daniels

Black howler monkeys move through their environment using mental maps that they modify and adapt as the landscape changes – a skill previously seen only in humans.

In 2016, Miguel de Guinea at Oxford Brookes University, UK, spent a year in Palenque National Park, Mexico, tracking groups of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) to observe how the primates traverse the complex rainforest landscape.

Tagging the monkeys with GPS tracking technology would have been too invasive, so de Guinea and a group of volunteers had to follow them on foot. “It was a bit exhausting at times,” he says. Tracking the monkeys frequently required the researchers to cross rivers and to climb to the pinnacles of ancient Mayan temples. But the results of their endeavours were surprising.

Advertisement

“We found that the monkeys follow certain routes,” says de Guinea, “but they structure and combine those routes in an efficient, human-like way.”

While most animals move through an environment semi-randomly or by instinct, humans are different. We tend to follow familiar routes encoded in mental maps. We also have a spatial sense of how locations are arranged in the landscape. This means that if an obstacle blocks a familiar path, we can change course – perhaps temporarily switching to another familiar route heading in a different direction – to navigate the obstacle and still reach our desired destination. As de Guinea’s team studied the black howler monkeys, they realised the primates do this too.

For example, the monkeys in the study would always approach favourite fruit trees from the same direction. What’s more, while the monkeys would rarely deviate from established routes, they had no problem doing so if, for instance, a tree forming part of a route had fallen down. In such cases, the monkeys quickly worked out how to connect the broken route to another familiar route, so they could navigate the obstacle and still reach their target.

They could also connect certain routes end to end in order to travel long distances, or they could take shortcuts from one route to another. The way the monkeys would jump from one route to another suggests that they have some concept of how these routes relate to each other in physical space, say the researchers.

In other words, the monkeys can easily amend their route-based view of the world with some knowledge of direction and geography, much like humans do. “It was a big effort,” says de Guinea, “but it was worth it to understand the fascinating cognitive skills that black howler monkeys demonstrate in the wild.”

Polluted air caused by smoke released from the record-breaking wildfires in the US last year has been linked to a strong increase in covid-19 cases and deaths.

Francesca Dominici at Harvard University and her colleagues say 19,742 recorded covid-19 cases and 748 covid-related deaths can be linked to spikes in tiny particulate matter, PM2.5, released by the blazes in California, Oregon and Washington.

Links between long-term exposure to dirty air and greater risk of death and severe illness from covid-19 have already been well-documented. But the new research puts numbers on how short-term exposure to pollution, in this case from wildfires, may have made the pandemic’s health impact worse.

Advertisement

“What this is saying is, number one, especially for the counties affected by wildfires, people should absolutely get vaccinated and wear a mask,” says Dominici.

The team looked at daily data on covid-19 cases and deaths and PM2.5 levels between March and December 2020 in 92 counties which cover 95 per cent of the population in California, Oregon and Washington. They then accounted for other possible explanations for links, including looking at the weather and Facebook data on how much people moved around, and considered a counterfactual world without the fires.

Across the counties as a whole, they found each extra 10 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre of air over 28 days was linked to an 11.7 per cent increase in coronavirus cases, and a 52.8 per cent increase in covid-19 deaths. Some counties saw PM2.5 levels higher than 500 micrograms per cubic metre for days in a row due to fires, well above the level deemed “hazardous” by US environmental authorities.

The impact of pollution on covid-19 cases and deaths varied widely between areas. Dominici says that is probably because “the trajectory of the pandemic within each county was very, very different”. The team thinks cases increased due to PM2.5 exposure because it led to more severe illness. This might also have had an impact even on people with mild illness. For instance, people with what would ordinarily have been an asymptomatic infection might have developed symptoms.

There are some caveats. Dominici says there may yet be other explanations for the link that the team didn’t account for. And the amount of PM2.5 people were estimated to be exposed to, using smoke satellite images, may not reflect their true exposure.

Nonetheless, the research implies there is another motivation to cut the carbon dioxide emissions which are projected to worsen wildfires in the western US as the world warms. “This also provides another reason why tackling climate change is so important,” says Dominici.

Escher’s Bond of Union is a lithograph, dating back to 1956 The M.C. Escher Company B.V. Baarn Holland Film M. C. Escher: Journey to infinity Robin Lutz Advertisement

ROBIN LUTZ’S documentary about Maurits Cornelis Escher begins near the end of his life. Escher, one of the Netherlands’s most famous artists, and by then in his late 60s, is discovered by California’s counterculture.

For the life of him he can’t understand why. Escher’s hyper-rational, mathematically sophisticated woodcuts aren’t even art as far as he is concerned. And now a bunch of hippies are zoning out on them. Colouring them. Making them into place mats. Mick Jagger even wants him to design an album cover.

Escher’s acid reply to Jagger is delivered with relish by actor-broadcaster Stephen Fry, who reads from the artist’s voluminous correspondence and diaries throughout the documentary.

English singer-songwriter Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills & Nash) had a better time of it. When he phoned to say what a great artist he thought Escher was, they got talking. Escher told Nash that he thought his own interest in symmetry, tiling and representing infinity disqualified him from being an artist, in the proper sense. Artists pursue beauty, he mused in his diary: “Perhaps I only pursue wonder.”

Advances in mathematics, computation and psychology have made nonsense of that distinction. Escher’s subject was perception. He might not have considered that art, but opinions have moved on there now.

Nash believed that Escher’s reputation would only grow posthumously. In his good-humoured and increasingly playful documentary, Lutz strongly agrees.

“The camera is an informed eye here, explaining Escher’s work, not turning it into visual effects”

Achieving, after a lifetime’s effort, a satisfying representation of infinity, Escher still berated himself: “I am starting to speak a language that is understood by very few,” he wrote. But isn’t this what true artists do? Aren’t they supposed to become more like themselves and less like others?

It is interesting to compare him with his close contemporary, the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Both preferred study to self-expression. And both gave themselves a hard time: Gödel believed himself to be lazy; Escher reckoned that he couldn’t draw. Yet Escher enjoyed a lifetime of fascinated striving. “It is,” he once remarked of his career, “and remains, the game of a child.”

Escher is also revealed through photographs, home movies and interviews with two of his children. Clearly, he relished his marriage, family and home, though life wasn’t always easy. The second world war kept them largely housebound, and they nearly starved to death. Later, his wife Jetta slowly succumbed to dementia. You can call Escher’s art cold and distant, but the man was never that.

Lutz harnesses the talents of animators and graphic designers to create a film that starts in the real world, but slowly, subtly slides into the phantasmagoric, monochrome world of Escher’s imagination. Warped perspectives straighten to reveal their secrets. Long, panning shots combine with prints to reveal how tiles mutate into living forms, then back to geometrical figures. The camera is an informed eye here, explaining Escher’s work, not turning it into visual effects.

Escher believed the only person who could properly film his work was himself – and that the result would be awfully boring. I hope he is watching this, tucked away in some hidden dimension.

After six months driving on Mars, NASA’s Perseverance rover attempted to drill into the Martian surface to take its first sample on 6 August. Everything seemed to go smoothly, but when the rover’s operators checked the sample tube after it had been sealed and stored inside the rover, they found that it was empty.

“It went really well, other than that the rock behaved in a way that didn’t allow us to get any sample in the tube,” says Jennifer Trosper, the Perseverance project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. After combing through the data, the mission’s operators suspect that when the rover drilled into the rock to take a sample, it fell apart into a fine powder and sprinkled out of the tube.

“We need a more cooperative type of rock,” says Trosper. “This one was crumbly – it may have had a surface that was hard, but once we got in there all the grains just sort of came apart.” This didn’t happen during tests of the sampling system on Earth, nor has it been a problem with the other Mars rovers.

While it isn’t possible to unseal and reuse the sampling tube, researchers had requested a sample of the Martian air, and the sealed tube does contain that. “We weren’t trying to collect the atmospheric sample, but it’s not a waste of a tube,” says Trosper. Perseverance has 43 sample tubes, so there are still plenty of opportunities to collect Mars rocks.

Trosper says this disappointing attempt isn’t a cause for concern when it comes to future sampling attempts with Perseverance. During the next attempt, planned for early September, the team plans to use the scientific instruments onboard the rover to confirm that a sample was taken before they seal the tube and stash it inside the rover.

Eventually, the plan is that Perseverance will cache these samples on the surface of Mars to be picked up and brought back to Earth by a later NASA mission. Returning the samples to Earth will allow scientists to study them in much more detail than we can on Mars, especially when it comes to searching for possible signs of past life there.

Francesco Ciccolella

THE universe of good reasons for putting a live guinea pig in an insulated metal pot is small. I can think of only one: in France, in the winter of 1782, the chemist Antoine Lavoisier and his polymath friend Pierre-Simon Laplace placed their unwitting subject into a double-walled metal chamber, the world’s first calorimeter, and sealed the lid. They had packed snow into the space between the walls, and by comparing the rate at which the guinea pig’s body heat melted the snow to the rate of carbon dioxide it exhaled, they discovered metabolism – the “fire of life” that drives our very existence. At last, science had a physical measure of the life force that enables us to grow, reproduce and move. Physiologists like myself have been counting calories ever since.

Today, a widespread obsession with fitness and body weight has led to a new era of calorie counting. Diet books and magazine workouts promise a kind of shiny metabolic nirvana of calories burned, villainous foods avoided, waistlines melted and health and vitality restored. The reasons they fail – and they almost always do – are as varied as the schemes themselves, but the common theme is a fundamental misunderstanding of metabolism. Yes, diet and exercise are critically important for our health, but they don’t work in the ways we are usually taught. Our bodies aren’t simple calorie-burning engines that we can easily manipulate to keep us looking trim and feeling good. They are complex and dynamic metabolic systems meticulously shaped by evolution for survival and reproduction.

Satellite data can help policy-makers quickly identify areas of the world in need of aid and development, but research shows it can also contain bias against marginalised groups, potentially compromising policy goals.

Machine-learning systems that scan satellite images for indicators of poverty or disaster damage are becoming a popular tool for assessing humanitarian and development needs. But Lukas Kondmann and Xiao Xiang Zhu at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne say little attention is being paid to potential biases built into this data.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US has developed a drone interceptor that fires what appears to be a form of Silly String into their rotors, bringing them down with minimal risk of accidental damage.

The interceptor was created by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It is launched from a vehicle and guided by radar that can automatically identify and track small drones.

Once the interceptor has a target drone in sight, it releases string-like streamers – their exact composition is unknown – to disable it. The system can also launch multiple interceptors to deal with several incoming drones simultaneously, and the interceptors are reusable.

DARPA says it wants to provide drone defences for convoys and other mobile units in heavily populated areas, where normal military weapons would create too much risk of civilian casualties. Existing interceptor drones, like the Coyote already used by the US military, carry an explosive warhead, while other projects rely on nets or ramming, which require more precise aiming.

The agency has also developed other, unspecified, non-explosive anti-drone weapons and another interceptor which resembles a small aircraft, but hasn’t released a video demonstrating them. They should also be safer than explosive countermeasures.

“The issue of a hostile drone – potentially with explosives attached to it – falling to the ground and possibly injuring civilians exists,” says Robert Bunker, security analyst with C/O Futures. “But it’s a far better option than targeting such a drone with indiscriminate machine gun fire.”

Because it doesn’t require explosives, this type of interceptor might also be suitable for civilian use, such as defending airports, sports stadiums and other vulnerable sites. But Bunker notes that, if interceptors become common, counter-countermeasures will evolve.

“We could see a type of escalation where hostile fighter drones protect the bomber ones from the counter-drones, as we see with manned-aircraft,“ he says.

Jack Watling of UK defence think tank RUSI says that the streamer-firing interceptor appears conceptually sound, but the reliability and cost of the system may still be issues. From a military viewpoint it has only one function; unlike most weapons it cannot be used against other targets, which may make it unpopular, he says. “I would be surprised if this particular concept becomes widely fielded within the military.”

IMAGINE a world in which admission to the top universities – to Oxford or Cambridge, or to Harvard or Yale – were limited to people who were very tall. Very soon, tall people would conclude that it is the natural order of things for the taller to succeed and the shorter to fail.

This is the world we live in. Not with taller and smaller people (although taller people often are at an advantage). But there is one measure by which, in many places, we tend to decide who has access to the best opportunities and a seat at the top decision-making tables: what we call intelligence. After all, someone blessed with intelligence has, by definition, what it takes – don’t they?

We have things exactly the wrong way round. The lesson of research by myself and many others over decades is that, through historical accident, we have developed a conception of intelligence that is narrow, questionably scientific, self-serving and ultimately self-defeating. We see the consequences in the faltering response of many nations to the covid-19 pandemic, and a host of other problems such as climate change, increasing income disparities and air and water pollution. In many spheres, our ways of thinking about and nurturing intelligence haven’t brokered intelligent solutions to real-world problems.

We need a better way. Fortunately, at least the starting point for this is clear. By returning to a more scientifically grounded idea of intelligence, who can have it and how we set about cultivating it in ourselves and others, we can begin to reboot our decision-making smarts and reshape our world for the better.

World leaders must drastically scale up their plans to curb CO2 emissions if humanity is to avoid the worst consequences of a warming world outlined in last week’s report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Unfortunately, there is no sign of that happening yet, but observers say the publication should boost political action on emissions.

The report, coupled with current extreme weather events such as Greece’s wildfires and a record 48.8°C temperature in Europe, has been seen by many as a wake-up call that should galvanise societies to take action.

Environmental leaders have called for new versions of the climate plans that countries are meant to submit every five years as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement’s framework. Without stronger plans, “the Paris Agreement goals will be out of reach,” tweeted Patricia Espinosa at United Nations Climate Change, the body that oversees international climate talks, which will reach a crunch moment at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, UK, this November.

Nations’ current plans are estimated to put the world somewhere around the middle of the five emissions scenarios considered in the IPCC report. This scenario would see Earth warm by 2.7°C by the end of the century – well above the 1.5°C and 2°C goals of the Paris Agreement.

COP26 president Alok Sharma has asked countries to produce bolder plans before the meeting. Last week, he called for “major emitters to play their part”, a phrase that is typically used to refer to China, the US, the European Union and India, which together account for more than half of global emissions. In response to the IPCC report, China gave no hint that a new plan is in the works, instead referring back to its existing long-term plan of carbon neutrality by 2060.

Nonetheless, the IPCC’s work should give a boost to COP26 and politicians who are in favour of climate action, according to veterans of international climate talks. “I think the IPCC report is a massive wake-up call,” says Peter Betts, a former lead EU negotiator on climate and now an associate fellow at UK think tank Chatham House. “It is really worrying. Coupled with these extreme weather events, I think this does reinforce the politics for action.”

Most high-income nations have already upgraded their plans from their 2015 versions, so there is little hope for more action from them. In April, the US pledged a 50 per cent cut in CO2 emissions by 2050 and the EU committed itself to a 55 per cent reduction over the same period. “You’ve got pledges of action from all the big developed countries, apart from Australia, which are at very top of what we thought possible a year ago,” says Betts.

This means that the lion’s share of the gap between government pledges today and the action needed to meet the Paris Agreement’s warming goals must be closed by middle-income nations, says Betts. That doesn’t seem to be happening. “You’ve got some big emerging economies like Brazil and Indonesia basically not moving, or even going backwards, so this is a problem,” he says.

Whether a strong new plan is forthcoming from China, which emits more than a quarter of the world’s CO2 and currently only plans to peak CO2 emissions by 2030, will be crucial. “My guess is they will revise it. The question is, will they do something incremental that looks good or something transformational? You can construct a powerful set of reasons why it [China] will do something ambitious, and why it might do something incremental,” says Betts.

The IPCC report may help bolster the case for other governments too, even if they stop shy of a new climate plan. India, for example, was thought to be on the brink of issuing a net-zero goal ahead of US president Joe Biden’s climate summit in April, but failed to do so. We also know that South Korea, the world’s eleventh-biggest CO2 emitter, is working on a new plan.

The biggest political consequence of the IPCC report may simply be to put the issue back at the top of the agenda for governments distracted by the pandemic, economic problems and other pressing domestic concerns. “Leaders have an enormous number of issues on their plate every day, covid being the obvious one. This issue struggles to get to be the number one priority,” says a UK government source.

Referring to the IPCC report, the source says: “It just moves the issue up front and centre. It can [sometimes] be perceived as a longer-term agenda, or an agenda [only] for the heaviest-emitting countries or those already feeling the most impacts. The message [from the IPCC] is that it’s global and requires a global solution. This sets out very starkly for every world leader that this has got to be at the top of their inbox from now right through to Glasgow, so big enough decisions can be made to avert catastrophe.”

Low-income countries responded to the report by calling for more financing for climate mitigations, including high-income nations such as the US and UK delivering on their 2009 promise of $100 billion a year by 2020, which is only at $80 billion according to the latest estimate. “The IPCC report findings reinforces the urgency to step up and take action – with more ambitious [climate plans], long-term decarbonisation plans and more climate finance – well before the doors open at COP26,” said Sonam Wangdi at the Least Developed Countries Group in a statement.

One message of the report that may have an instant impact is that “it is now an established fact” that climate change is linked to extreme weather events like the heatwaves and floods that have hit countries from Canada to China this year. “I think the increasing ability to link specific events with confidence to climate change, that boosts the narrative [for action on emissions],” says Betts.

This stronger link could spur greater investment in adaptation to a warming world. “Now that people are joining the dots that climate change is here and it’s having nasty impacts, that has the potential to focus the minds of individuals,” says Bob Ward at the London School of Economics. “It’s no longer a theoretical, remote issue, but it’s here and now.” Societies will have to increase their resilience as many climate change effects are already locked in for decades, he says.

Liz Stephens at the University of Reading, UK, who works with humanitarian organisations including the Red Cross movement, says such groups will be calling for more investment in “anticipatory action” at COP26. This involves early warning systems for flooding and heatwaves caused by extreme weather, as well as making sure that those systems are used by communities. “The countries most at risk of climate change are really seeing the impacts of extreme events now. They will rightly be looking for support from countries that have caused climate change to help them adapt,” she says.

The report could also positively influence political debate about the cost of measures to make economies hit net zero. This will be high on the agenda in the UK in coming months, as the government outlines new elements of its net-zero strategy this autumn, including what to do about fossil fuel heating in homes, which is expected to cost billions of pounds to change.

In that respect, the report should strengthen the hand of politicians justifying the costs of strong action. Ward says: “The point about extreme weather is it’s damaging. While people go on about the cost of having to make changes [for net zero], they can now see on the other side of the ledger is this damage, which is not just economic but human too. People can now see there is no cost-free option here.”

A CRISIS urgently needs solving. Science can provide the tools to help, but we must be willing to change our lifestyles. Solutions will be very expensive, yet the cost of inaction is even higher.

We first did so in our leader of 7 March 2020, when total global cases of covid-19 numbered fewer than 100,000, and there was as yet officially no pandemic. “We are facing a global emergency, and politicians who appear to not believe in science are putting us all at …
