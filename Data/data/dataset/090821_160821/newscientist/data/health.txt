For the first time ever, Marburg virus disease has been confirmed in West Africa. The case was reported by health authorities in Guinea’s southern Gueckedou prefecture, where the country’s latest Ebola outbreak was declared over less than two months ago. Guinea is currently dealing with a third wave of covid-19 cases.

Guinea’s health ministry said that on 25 July the patient arrived at a local clinic in the Koundou area of Gueckedou for treatment and a medical investigation team was dispatched to investigate his worsening symptoms, including fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain and bleeding gums. He died on 2 August. A field laboratory in Gueckedou collected samples from the deceased patient and Guinea’s national haemorrhagic fever laboratory confirmed he had Marburg virus. The Pasteur Institute in Senegal also confirmed the result.

Described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a highly infectious virus that causes haemorrhagic fever, Marburg belongs to the same family as the Ebola virus.

Matshidiso Moeti, regional director for Africa at the WHO, noted that the ability of the country to quickly stem the spread of the disease largely relies on local health authorities and health officials being able to quickly detect the disease. Response to the outbreak is being built on Guinea’s past experience and expertise in managing Ebola, which is transmitted in a similar way, Moeti said.

The most recent outbreak of Marburg virus occurred in Uganda in 2017 during which three cases were confirmed. All three patients died. In 2005, the largest documented Marburg outbreak occurred in Angola, with 329 people dying out of a total of 374 cases.

While vaccines and some treatment options are now available for Ebola, there are none approved for Marburg aside from supportive care, including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms.

The government of Guinea said it is working with its partners to quickly implement contact tracing in order to find anyone who could have been in contact with the man who was confirmed to have contracted Marburg virus. It is also introducing public education and enlisting community members to raise awareness, as this is the first time that the disease has been recorded in the country.

WHO said it already has a team of infectious disease experts in the area, and that cross-border surveillance is being enhanced to quickly detect any cases, with neighbouring countries on alert.

“The Ebola control systems in place in Guinea and in neighbouring countries are crucial to the emergency response to the Marburg virus,” said a WHO statement.

A simple way to transfer sperm in the mail could find an application in scientific studies and animal husbandry.

Sperm is often transported nationally and internationally, but the glass vials typically used for transport are vulnerable to breaking in transit.

A team led by Daiyu Ito at the University of Yamanashi in Japan has now come up with a way to deliver sperm that removes the risk of sample loss. The method involves placing sperm on a sheet of paper and popping it in the post.

“Until now, sending mouse sperm to other researchers has required a freezing environment such as liquid nitrogen or a freezer,” says Ito. “Not only is the constant supply of liquid nitrogen and electricity needed for transportation expensive to maintain, but if there is a road disruption or power outage due to an earthquake, all the sperm will melt and become unavailable.”

The researchers thought that an alternative might be to freeze-dry sperm onto a surface and send it through the standard mail. After testing several materials, including filter paper and vinyl sheets, the team discovered that weighing paper – a form of paper used to hold samples being weighed in scientific analyses – was the best option. Mouse sperm could be freeze-dried onto the paper and still remain viable when it was retrieved later. Thousands of mouse sperm samples could be stored this way in a single book, which the researchers have called a “sperm book”.

To put the method to the test, the researchers freeze-dried mouse sperm to a sheet of weighing paper, before sandwiching the paper between plastic sheets for easier handling and sending it through the Japanese postal service, either in an envelope or attached to a postcard.

When the samples were retrieved after travelling 200 kilometres – from the University of Tokyo to the University of Yamanashi – over the course of two days, the researchers could use the sperm to produce healthy mice.

The simplicity of this delivery method means that there is potential for misuse, including the illegal transport of genetic material. This means new regulations will need to be considered, says Ito – whose team previously sent mouse sperm into space.

It is also perhaps unlikely that the new method will be used in human fertility treatments, says Ryosuke Kaneko at Osaka University in Japan, who wasn’t involved in the analysis.

“Given the potential for human assisted reproductive technologies to increase the risk of some diseases in the later years of offspring, caution should be exercised in applying the present results to the preservation of human sperm,” says Kaneko. “However, this study raises the intriguing idea that human spermatozoa could be preserved and transported by less cost, more secure, space-saving and simple methods.”

Encouraging food manufacturers to voluntarily reduce the calories, sugar or salt content of their products doesn’t work. That’s according to an analysis of changes in the nutritional content of food and drinks sold in English supermarkets between 2015 and 2018.

Over the years, Public Health England, a government agency, has set voluntary targets for reducing the calories, sugar and salt content of processed foods sold in the country. The voluntary targets were set in the hopes of encouraging manufacturers to change the nutritional content of their products rather than forcing reformulations.

Lauren Bandy and her colleagues at the University of Oxford have now assessed the impact of the targets.

“We basically found that there wasn’t really much change,” says Bandy. “The only change that we could see was with soft drinks.”

The soft drink change may be because sugary drinks have been subject to a UK tax introduced in 2018, she says.

The researchers observed a small increase in the number of products classified by the UK government as healthy on the basis of their nutrient profile, from 46 per cent in 2015 to 47 per cent in 2018. There was also an increase in the sale of healthy products, from 44 per cent in 2015 to 51 per cent in 2018. They attributed these increases to the sugar reductions in soft drinks encouraged by the 2018 tax.

“We need carrots as well as sticks when seeking to address the UK’s [obesity-generating] food environment,” says Stuart Gillespie at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington DC. “But when it comes to big food, the stick – in the form of a government-mandated tax – is far more effective.”

The products the team evaluated were from a number of food and beverage companies and didn’t include supermarket “own” brands.

“Some research has previously shown that private-label brands can often be healthier than their branded counterparts,” says Elizabeth Dunford at the George Institute for Global Health in Australia.

HEART inflammation triggered by some covid-19 vaccines has been a concern, especially in younger people, but a preliminary study suggests that in those most affected, it is six times more likely to occur after a coronavirus infection than after vaccination.

In the past few months, some cases of this condition, known as myocarditis, have been recorded following the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. This has prompted concern particularly in the US and Israel, as these two countries have led the way in vaccinating younger people.

The reaction happens most often in men and boys aged under 30 after their second dose, and is usually seen within 10 days, says Alma Iacob at Imperial College London. But many health bodies around the world say the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks for most people.

Now a study in the US has analysed how often myocarditis occurs following infection with the coronavirus. Researchers analysed the records of healthcare organisations that cover a fifth of the US population. They found that, during the first 12 months of the pandemic, males aged 12 to 17 were most likely to develop myocarditis within three months of catching covid-19, at a rate of about 450 cases per million infections.

This compares with 67 cases of myocarditis per million males of the same age following their second dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, according to figures from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Researchers added together cases after first and second doses to reach a total rate of 77 cases per million in this male age group triggered by vaccination, a sixth that seen after infection.

“450 cases of myocarditis per million covid-19 cases in young males”

“If you’re focused on heart inflammation, the safer bet is to take the vaccine,” says Mendel Singer at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, who helped carry out the study.

Signs of myocarditis include chest pain, breathlessness and palpitations. Symptoms range from so mild that they go unnoticed to severe, involving permanent heart damage or death. However, extreme forms are rare and no fatalities have been reported after vaccination in the US.

The causes of myocarditis are unclear. One idea is that it occurs when the immune system attacks the heart, but this hasn’t been proven. Neither is it known why it happens most often in younger males.

Mild cases are usually treated with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and most people recover within a few months, says Iacob. Other triggers of the condition include flu and the flu vaccine, some medications and some illegal drugs.

The small risk of myocarditis after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one reason why the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) hasn’t yet recommended this vaccine – the only one licensed for use in under-18s in the UK – for most children aged 12 and over. While countries such as Ireland and the US are letting teenagers get vaccinated, the JCVI said in July that only younger people who are highly vulnerable or living with someone with a weak immune system could have the jab.

Iacob says people who have been vaccinated or had covid-19 should be aware of possible symptoms of myocarditis, especially chest pain that is burning or sharp and worsens on changing position.

A new way of treating infertility in women has been suggested by a study that investigated the genes controlling the age of menopause.

When one of the genes was blocked from having an effect in female mice, the animals responded more strongly to infertility drugs often used to induce the ovaries to release multiple eggs during IVF treatment.

Menopause usually happens around the age of 50, with infertility occurring several years beforehand, but there is wide variation, with the process being influenced by the number of eggs left in the ovaries. Girls are born with about a million eggs and by the time women reach menopause, this has fallen to about a thousand. Age at menopause is affected by both the starting number of eggs and the rate at which they die.

The new study, undertaken by a large international consortium of researchers, looked at genetic variants that influence the age of menopause. It used existing records of 200,000 women of European descent who have offered their DNA for sequencing and filled in health questionnaires, such as in the UK Biobank project.

The researchers found 290 regions of DNA that collectively cause about a third of the genetic variation in the age at which menopause occurs and about 12 per cent of the total variation – as lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking also have an effect. The researchers also looked at records for nearly 80,000 women of East Asian ancestry and found similar results.

Many of the genes identified are known to be linked to processes of DNA repair. Some are active before birth, when a fetus’s eggs are made, while others seem to affect the rate at which eggs die in adulthood, says John Perry at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, a member of the research team.

The gene found to have the biggest effect is CHEK2, which was already known to be involved in a process of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Women with a variant that stops this gene from working go through menopause 3.5 years later than those with a working version, the study found.

When the team genetically modified female mice so that they had no CHEK2, their eggs died off more slowly as they aged. These mice also released more eggs when they were treated with gonadotrophin, which is used during IVF to stimulate egg development.

If we could develop a drug that blocks CHEK2, it could help women having IVF release more eggs, says Perry. “CHEK2 is probably causing viable eggs to die,” he says. “If you could slightly dial that down you could get more eggs. But you would need to be really sure you weren’t fertilising damaged eggs.”

The team is currently adding more women to the genetic study and Perry says the results could in future be turned into a blood test to tell women if they are at high risk of early menopause and loss of fertility.

“The findings pave the way for more-detailed studies that could lead to women being able to predict their menopausal age and to consider options to extend their reproductive age span,” Krina Zondervan at the University of Oxford said in a commentary article published alongside the new research paper.

Tokyo is seeing a record-breaking rise in covid-19 cases as thousands of athletes and coaches fly in from around the world for the postponed 2020 Olympic games. But Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga denies any link between the event and the surging number of infections.

Tokyo is currently in its fourth official state of emergency, which began on 12 July ahead of the Olympics and is now expected to last until 31 August. The measures include an alcohol ban in bars and restaurants and reduced opening hours. Okinawa is already under the same measures and Suga announced over the weekend that they would also be expanded to Saitama, Kanagawa, Chiba and Osaka. Less stringent measures will also be introduced in five other prefectures: Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Hyogo, Kyoto, and Fukuoka.

The Olympics were originally scheduled for 2020 but were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. But the Olympics are now taking place at a time when the country’s coronavirus situation is worse than it was the previous year, according to data on cases.

Tokyo saw a sharp rise in covid-19 cases from the start of July and rates last week had doubled from those seen the previous week. On 2 August, the city reported 3058 new cases and the infection rate in Tokyo now stands at 88 people per 100,000. Less than a third of the Japanese population has been fully vaccinated.

On 29 July, more than 10,000 new cases across Japan were reported for the first time. This record was beaten just days later when 12,340 cases were recorded on 1 August, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

“If the increase of infection does not stop, the severe symptoms cases will increase and the medical system may possibly be further under strain,” said Suga at a press conference.

Meanwhile, Shigeru Omi, chair of the government’s coronavirus subcommittee, told The Japan Times that there was “barely any prospect” of curtailing the outbreak.

“Lives over Olympics”

The Olympic games have been scaled down from original plans, with only a third of the originally expected 180,000 people entering the country. Audiences are banned at most events and athletes wear masks when not competing. But 27 new covid-19 cases linked to the games were announced on Friday, bringing the total so far to 220. At least one athlete has had to withdraw due to a positive test. Protests against the games have taken place in Tokyo, with hundreds marching on the country’s national stadium with placards urging the government to put “Lives over Olympics”.

Europe saw a similar rise in infections during the Euro 2020 tournament. A decline in cases over previous months came to an end in July in part because of large numbers of people travelling to matches, said the World Health Organization. Germany’s interior minister Horst Seehofer said at the time that the decision to allow crowds was been “utterly irresponsible”.

But Kevin Tyler at the University of East Anglia, UK, says there is no clear evidence of a link between the games and the rise in infections, because competitors are tightly bubbled, and that the surging case numbers are instead down to the delta variant having made its way to Japan.

“Ordinarily, there would be concern that influx and mixing of potentially infected people from all over the world might spread different variants and promote mixing which could be problematic in producing new variants by recombination, but the [Olympic] planning appears to be pretty careful to avoid that and segregate athletes from the wider population,” he says.

The International Olympic Committee didn’t respond to a request for comment.

DURING the coronavirus pandemic, we have all become amateur epidemiologists, readily discussing R numbers, herd immunity and test sensitivity in everyday conversation. Now, with the virus still nowhere near eliminated, we would do well to concern ourselves with the principles of viral evolution too.

It is a widespread misconception that viruses tend to evolve to become less deadly. To really grasp what a virus is likely to do, we must look at the opportunities it has to evolve and the selection pressures that could force it to change.

At the summit of Mt Everest – 8848 metres up – each breath delivers only a third of the oxygen it does at sea level imageBROKER/Alamy

MOUNTAINEERS Ralf Dujmovits and Nancy Hansen are no strangers to thin air, having collectively reached the summits of all eight of the world’s highest mountains. But when they entered the hypoxia chamber at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne in May 2018, they were effectively climbing one of the highest peaks of their careers. After a two-week acclimatisation, they spent 16 days breathing air thinner than at Everest base camp – including four days at the equivalent of 7112 metres. This is just shy of the “death zone” over 8000 metres, where the lack of oxygen impairs climbers’ judgement and increases their risk of heart attack and stroke.

Time and again, the two mountaineers – and those observing them – questioned whether they should keep going, but they did. If Dujmovits and Hansen could show that humans can tolerate extended periods of low oxygen, known as hypoxia, it would pave the way for an even more ambitious experiment: to test whether, sometimes, it might even be beneficial to starve people of oxygen.

This may sound strange. After all, our organs and tissues need oxygen. Indeed, astonishingly low oxygen levels in people with covid-19 have perplexed and panicked doctors (See “Happy hypoxia?”), and treatment guidelines recommend giving extra oxygen. After a heart attack or stroke, people are routinely given oxygen too, to ensure their tissues don’t die.

Yet, for all this, surprisingly, there are hints that hearts and spinal cord …

Harriet Noble/Studio Pi

“I BEND so I don’t break.” No one knows who first coined this phrase, but search for it online and you will find it accompanying numerous pictures of yogis in various states of contortion. Flexibility, according to common wisdom, is not only impressive to look at, but something we should actively work towards.

Scientifically, however, the question of whether we should stretch to become more flexible has been difficult to answer. Assumptions about the benefits of stretching to prevent sports injuries and greater flexibility being better for our overall physical fitness hadn’t been confirmed by studies. Does it matter if you can’t touch your toes, let alone do the splits? Even in sports science, where most of the research has been conducted, there has been little agreement.

In recent years, though, answers have started to emerge. The surprising outcome is that, while stretching may well be good for us, it is for reasons that have nothing to do with being able to get your leg behind your head.

One thing is for sure: stretching feels good, particularly after a long spell of being still. We aren’t the only species to have worked this out. As anyone with a dog or cat will know, many animals take a deep stretch after lying around. This kind of stretching, called pandiculation, is so common in nature that some have suggested it evolved as a reflex to wake up the muscles after a spell of stillness.

Pete Reynolds

THE wonders of the world tend to be quite conspicuous. You can hardly miss the Grand Canyon, say, or the Great Pyramid of Giza. You could, however, be forgiven for overlooking the great wonders of human biology. It is easy to take the brain or DNA for granted. And yet over the past year or so, living through the coronavirus pandemic, we have all come to better appreciate the marvel that is our immune system, a vast and diverse array of cells and molecules that defend us against viruses and other invaders.

One molecule in particular has taken centre stage: the antibody. These Y-shaped proteins, which we produce in response to infection, are a vital part of our defences. They are also the basis of many of the most important medicines. But we haven’t exhausted their potential yet – far from it.

Typically, we have used antibodies in medicine pretty much as they come in nature, even if we select and mass-produce the versions we need. Now we can do much more. By manipulating genes in the cells that produce antibodies, or splicing together fragments of the proteins themselves, we can re-engineer their structures to create bespoke immune molecules.

In my lab at the University of Manchester, UK, we use super-resolution microscopes to see how the immune system works on a molecular scale. We are just one of thousands of labs doing such work, which is fuelling a new age of antibody engineering.

A newly described species of wild tobacco that scientists found growing next to a highway truck stop in Western Australia is covered in sticky glands that trap and kill small insects, including gnats, aphids and flies.

While a range of carnivorous plants are known across the plant kingdom, this is the first wild tobacco plant discovered to kill insects. Dubbed Nicotiana insecticida, it was uncovered by a project looking for tobacco plants across Australia.

The team, which included Mark Chase of London’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, collected seeds from the insecticidal plant at a truck stop on the Northwest Coastal Highway, and then cultivated them at Kew, where the plants went on to develop the same sticky glandular hairs and to kill insects inside the greenhouses.

The insect-ensnaring hairs resemble those on carnivorous sundew plants, but it isn’t clear if the plant extracts any food from the insects it kills. “We have no evidence that there is any nutritional benefit to the plant,” says Chase, who adds that the team is arranging some tests to see whether the plant absorbs any nutrients.

But even if it doesn’t absorb nutrients, killing insects in this way could still be beneficial for N. insecticida. “It definitely protects the plants from insects like aphids,” says Chase.

Read more: Carnivorous pitcher plants are regularly eating vertebrate animals

The plants may also benefit when the dead insects decay. Chase says the species may be like South African Roridula plants, which kill insects in the same way. “There is a bug that lives on these plants and is not trapped by the sticky hairs. It eats the trapped insects and defecates on the ground, and the plant benefits from this,” says Chase. However, there is no evidence yet that this is what happens with N. insecticida.

Nicotina insecticida has sticky hairs that trap insects Maarten Christenhusz

The plant hasn’t yet been approved for commercial use by Australia, and the terms of the collecting permits issued to botanists like Chase strictly prohibit them from developing commercial applications. However, Chase says N. insecticida is fairly easy to grow and could perhaps be used as a biological control agent for killing aphids and fungus gnats in greenhouses.

The species is one of seven new-to-science species of Nicotiana described by the team. The others include Nicotiana salina, which grows along salt lakes on the eastern edge of the Western Australian wheatbelt, and Nicotiana walpa in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the Northern Territory, which only grows after storms strike the desert.

It has been a busy week for insecticidal plants – a study published on Monday revealed that a plant that grows in bogs along the west coast of North America uses its flowers to eat insects. Before now, researchers had no idea that Triantha occidentalis was carnivorous.

A plant that grows in bogs along the west coast of North America has been spotted using its flowers to eat insects. Until now, researchers had no idea it was carnivorous.

Carnivorous plants absorb nutrients from insects and sometimes vertebrates. Before now, there were 11 known groups of such plants, with the last being described in 2012.

Now, Qianshi Lin and his colleagues at the University of British Columbia in Canada have demonstrated that a small flowering plant called Triantha occidentalis is also a meat-eater.

“It is not just another species of known carnivorous plants,” says Lin. “This is a totally new group of carnivorous plants.”

The researchers decided to look at T. occidentalis after previous research found the plant had lost genes that were also missing in carnivorous plants. They examined the concentration of nitrogen within the plant and found it comparable to carnivorous plants, suggesting it could be acquiring the nitrogen from insects.

Read more: Carnivorous pitcher plants are regularly eating vertebrate animals

To find out more, the researchers placed fruit flies that had been fed nitrogen-15 isotopes onto the clustered flowers on the plant’s stems, which are known as inflorescences and had previously been noted to have sticky hairs that could be used for trapping insects. They later found this isotope inside the plant at higher concentrations than before the fruit flies were introduced, which indicated that it had consumed the fruit flies.

“Somewhat unique is that they capture insects with inflorescences,” says Gerhard Gebauer at the University of Bayreuth in Germany. “Most carnivorous plants capture insects with their leaves so this is unexpected in a certain way.”

Gebauer had previously suspected that plants within Triantha are carnivorous after observing that the nitrogen concentrations of Tofieldia calyculata, a plant in the same family found in the Austrian Alps, were different to those of non-carnivorous plants in the region.

“Nobody else before has expected carnivorous plants in this taxonomic group, except for [Tofieldia calyculata],” says Gebauer.

My, what blue wool you have Veryan Dale/Alamy Stock Photo

LIKE many constructions, it started small. But now thousands of children with autism are making friends and learning social skills by playing a version of online building game Minecraft.

Stuart Duncan got the idea through a popular blog he ran about his own experiences with autism as well as bringing up a son with autism. Other parents with autistic children started telling him that their kids were crazy about a game that let them explore a randomly generated wilderness. However, despite loving the game, many of the children were being bullied by other players.

So, in 2013, Duncan, a web developer in Timmins, Canada, set up a server to run a version of Minecraft exclusively for children with autism and their families. He thought the invite-only server would attract 10 or 20 people. To his surprise, hundreds requested to join in the first few days.

Now, almost three years later, running “Autcraft” is his full-time job. The community boasts nearly 7000 members, along with a team of admins to help manage its many activities. “Parents see such a benefit for themselves and their children,” says Duncan.

“Minecraft strips away the pressures and distractions of the real world. You can really just be yourself“

The server caught the eye of Kate Ringland at the University of California, Irvine. She has spent 60 hours inside this virtual world, watching how the kids play and chat to one another. Ringland sees Autcraft as not just another online community, but as a tool that helps autistic children practise social skills. She will present her work at the Human Factors in Computing conference in San Jose, California, next month.

In Minecraft, you manipulate blocks of materials like wood and stone to build whatever you like – from painstaking recreations of cities to simple computers. “This is a great way for them to play a game they love, but also have a social experience,” says Ringland. “It’s giving an alternative way for these kids to express themselves and communicate without the stresses of the physical life stuff.”

Everyday social situations can be challenging for autistic children, who may struggle to pick up on social cues or understand another person’s perspective. Duncan thinks Minecraft strips away the pressures typical of the real world. There is no noisy or unfamiliar environment to distract you, no pressure to track the other person’s facial expressions or worry about eye contact. “With Minecraft, you can really just be yourself,” he says. “The social interactions, the relationships, the communication – everything just boils down to you and your keyboard.”

To join Autcraft, you must fill out an application. Once approved, you are free to roam the landscape and build your own structures. You can also take part in group games – like massive battles against “withers”, a kind of ghostly villain – or build things as a team. But you have to stick to some rules. Harassing other players or destroying their property can get you banned. A spin-off server for teenagers is slightly more permissive.

Ringland observed players on Autcraft and combed through discussions on related online forums. She saw people build friendships and have fun together. She also saw kids expressing their feelings – joy over a good time in the game, and anxiety or sadness about problems in the real world. “There’s a lot of reflection going on,” she says. “Minecraft is supporting a lot of these social behaviours.”

Joining a community like Autcraft could be a good first step to feeling less socially anxious and more engaged, says Elizabeth Laugeson, director of the PEERS Clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles, which teaches young adults with autism how to build relationships. But it shouldn’t be the only outlet for learning these skills, she says. “Minecraft is not necessarily teaching the social skills they need to navigate the real world.”

Yet where it works, Autcraft shows how powerful it can be to create social environments centred on a common interest, says Matthew Lerner at Stony Brook University in New York. “It builds from the interests and passions of people with autism rather than trying to redirect or surprise them.”

Building connections Minecraft has helped Keith Stuart, games editor at The Guardian, build a relationship with his autistic son Zac, inspiring his forthcoming novel, A Boy Made of Blocks. “Most games have missions and objectives, pushing you in certain directions. Minecraft presents you with a world and a bunch of tools and you can do what you want. If Zac just wanted to roam the landscape hunting sheep or digging holes, he could. He is free to express himself. There are rules but they are very clear and don’t change. The powerful combination of openness and clear rules definitely appeals to my son. “I’ve written about this for The Guardian and had a flood of parents saying it is exactly what happened with their son or daughter. “As a parent of a child with autism, I worry about putting him in social situations. Autcraft and similar servers [see main story] try to create an environment in which people can express themselves without fear. That’s important to parents who are nervous about what their children will encounter in multiplayer online games. “Parents often have a managerial relationship with video games, but far from potentially being damaging to children, they can give us a new way to communicate. We learned so much about Zac and what he liked and what he wanted to be through talking to him about Minecraft.”

Objects we place in our workspace reinforce our sense of identity Melanie Acevedo/trunkarchive.com

IN THE summer of 2001, Sapna Cheryan was a new graduate interviewing for internships at tech firms in California’s Bay Area. At one company, she recalls, the workspace looked like a computer enthusiast’s basement hang-out, full of action figures and Nerf guns, with a soda-can model of the Golden Gate Bridge. To her, it seemed designed to promote an exclusive conception of the firm’s ideal employee. As a young woman of colour, she felt unwelcome, even alienated. She accepted a place at another company – one with a workspace that was bright and inviting.

Five years later, Cheryan’s next move was to Stanford University in California to start a PhD investigating how physical cues in our environment affect how we think and feel. She is among a growing number of psychologists and cognitive scientists whose research challenges the idea that the brain is like a computer. Computers are indifferent to their surroundings: a laptop works the same in a fluorescent-lit office or a leafy park. The same isn’t true of the human brain. In fact, Cheryan and others have found its performance to be exquisitely sensitive to the context in which it operates.

This research seems especially relevant right now. During the pandemic, many of us were abruptly forced to work and learn in different surroundings, and the effect of place on cognition came into sharp focus. As some of us return to offices and schools, we have an opportunity to reimagine these spaces in accordance with what researchers have …

Different snake species have independently evolved fangs that allow them to inject venom into other animals, either to attack prey or for defence. Now we know how: they turned small wrinkles inside the base of the fang – an ancient feature inherited by most living snakes – into deep channels to carry venom towards the tip.

Alessandro Palci at Flinders University in Australia and his colleagues wanted to explain the origins of venom fangs, which are found in so many species of snake that they must have evolved on several separate occasions.

They used high-resolution microCT scans to have a closer look at snake fangs. After examining fangs from 21 snake species and teeth in two lizard species they found a common feature. Inside, the dentine tissue near the base of the tooth or fang was folded into a series of vertical pleats extending towards the tooth tip. The researchers then took tissue samples from one lizard and three snake species to confirm the presence of these so-called plicidentine structures under the microscope.

“Before CT scanning there was really no way to look inside snake teeth in a satisfactory way,” says Andrew Durso at Florida Gulf Coast University, who wasn’t involved in the analysis. “They’re very small and very hard and so dissecting one was not really an option, especially if you want to visualise how it looks inside.”

Plicidentine is common in extinct reptiles but not as well-known in living animals, only previously reported in a few fish and three lizard species.

Different snakes have different types of venom fangs A. Palci

The team found plicidentine in both venomous and non-venomous snakes. Species that branch off near the base of the snake evolutionary tree – like non-venomous boas and pythons – have relatively small wrinkles.

But in the venomous snakes that branched off higher up the tree, the wrinkles are larger – and one wrinkle has developed into a deep channel that carries venom to the fang tip. “The plicidentine is always there but it’s probably a random mutation that causes the infoldings to grow bigger and form a groove,” says Palci.

This may be because, once any given snake evolved to produce venom, natural selection favoured those with larger plicidentine wrinkles to help channel the venom to the fang tip.

“If the venom gland is discharging venom close to the grooved tooth, then it’s a possibility the tooth will be selected for injecting venom,” says Palci.

The landmark report released yesterday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has left many people reeling about the current and future state of our planet. But Tamsin Edwards at King’s College London, a lead author on the report, says it is understandable that it takes time for the gravity of the situation to sink in. “I think many people aren’t that aware that we have already committed ourselves to changes that are irreversible. That is a profound thing to take on board,” she says.

Those changes include warmer ocean temperatures, ocean acidification and a decline in oxygen levels in our seas. All are now irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales because of humanity’s fossil fuel burning and other activities. “We are changing the planet. It will continue to change no matter what we do in terms of our emissions, for hundreds to thousands of years. That is beyond our comprehension in many ways,” says Edwards.

Her involvement in reviewing the global environmental crisis is intimately connected to her own personal health crisis. Edwards was appointed a lead author on the report in 2018, around the same time she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Three years ago, she delayed chemotherapy to attend a vital meeting in China with some of the 234 other authors of the report. The covid-19 pandemic pushed those meetings online, culminating in the past fortnight where the final text was approved by 195 governments, a process that adds to the report’s gravitas.

For Edwards, one key message from the report is the upgrade from human influence on global warming from “clear” in a 2013 IPCC report, to “unequivocal”. “The much, much stronger statements on human influence is really striking,” she says. “To see that human influence is the main driver of air temperatures, ocean temperatures, hot extremes, Arctic sea ice loss, glacier loss, sea level rise, and many other aspects as well, it’s an incredibly strong message.”

The IPCC’s findings may seem gloomy, but Edwards says they also show there is still hope. The report finds that in the very lowest of five scenarios for future CO 2 emissions, the world is likely to hit the Paris Agreement’s target of 1.5°C of warming in the next 20 years, before cooling later this century to 1.4°C.

“It is important to realise that it is still possible to limit warming to 1.5°C with not much overshoot, with immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in emissions. Obviously, optimism and pessimism isn’t the remit of our report. All we can do is lay out the evidence,” says Edwards.

Will the world listen to that evidence? Inger Andersen at the UN Environment Programme said on 9 August at a press conference that the world had failed to heed 30 years of warnings from the IPCC. “The world listened but didn’t hear. It listened but didn’t act strongly enough. As a result, climate change is a problem here, now,” she said.

Edwards says the response to the report has been positive, and has recognised that it isn’t just one study, but a review of 14,000 scientific papers. “I’ve seen a great willingness to listen,” she says. Moreover, the timing of the report, just three months before world leaders discuss political action on climate change at the COP26 conference in Glasgow, is helpful, says Edwards.

The report may be finished, but the work of Edwards, who is now clear of cancer, isn’t stopping. “I’ve always felt my strongest lever in climate change is to keep talking about it. I want to keep getting the science out there to the public and policy-makers, this year and beyond,” she says.

Roosting jam-packed together increases the spread of pathogens 167/Joel Sartore/Ocean/Corbis

EMMA TEELING loves bats. She is so keen on them that she has spent the past three summers clambering around Gothic churches in Brittany searching for greater mouse-eared bats under dusty eaves and in dark bell towers. She is aware that others do not share her passion. Bats have been demonised throughout history and across cultures. For most of us, Teeling’s little furry fliers are the crepuscular creatures of folklore, witchcraft and horror stories.

Indeed, the dread instilled by bats has only increased in recent years, with the discovery that they harbour the viruses that cause Ebola, SARS, MERS and other so-called emerging infectious diseases. Often fatal in humans, an outbreak of any of these is likely to cause widespread panic – and bats have paid the price. Although they rarely spread these pathogens directly to humans, whole bat colonies are being killed in the name of public health. But where some see a problem, Teeling, a geneticist at University College Dublin in Ireland, sees an opportunity.

The thing is, bats are weird. They don’t just carry headline-grabbing viruses, they are also renowned for the huge number and diversity of pathogens they host. In other mammals these would result in sickness or death, but bats hardly ever succumb to viral diseases. They almost never get cancer, too. In fact, they generally live between three and 10 times longer than other mammals of their size – one male Brandt’s bat tagged in Siberia in 1962 was recaptured 41 years later, still sprightly enough to catch prey and dodge predators.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Europe was provisionally reported on 11 August. The town of Syracuse on the Italian island of Sicily reached 48.8°C, 0.8°C higher than the previous European record.

High temperatures are also being recorded elsewhere. In Tunisia, the capital Tunis hit 49°C on 11 August according to Reuters, more than 2 degrees higher than the previous record of 46.8°C in 1982.

These record extreme temperatures across a swathe of southern Europe and northern Africa are almost certainly a result of global warming. The hot and dry conditions have led to many devastating fires. Italy has declared a state of emergency, and in Greece thousands of people had to be evacuated from the island of Evia as flames spread. The immediate cause of the heatwave is a ridge of high pressure over the Mediterranean, forming what is known as a heat dome.

The previous record for Europe, according to the World Meteorological Organization, is 48°C in Athens in 1977. The new record has to be validated by the WMO before it becomes official, which means checking that the local weather station is accurate and correctly set up.

THE striking swirls in this shot of the Sea of Marmara, in north-west Turkey, represent one of the latest examples of the destructive effects of pollution.

Last month, photographer Muhammed Enes Yildirim used a drone to capture these mesmerising patterns, which are formed by what is known as marine mucilage. Also called sea snot, it is a mixture of mucus and various microorganisms, including phytoplankton.

When these microorganisms receive extra nutrients – from untreated waste water, for example – they multiply and make an excessive amount of mucus, which clumps together to form the thick swathes.

Although marine mucilage has routinely plagued Turkey’s waters since 2007, this year it stretches from the surface down to about 30 metres, in what is the largest and most damaging example yet. Thousands of cubic metres have already been collected.

The marine mucilage has become a huge environmental problem in recent months as it has grown, suffocating marine life beneath and disrupting fishing and tourism.

Lockdowns due to covid-19 resulted in more domestic waste water and detergent being released into the sea, making clean-up efforts more challenging.

Researchers predict that ongoing climate change will worsen the situation, as warming seas cause more algal “blooms” and so more marine mucilage.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Alma and Tom gradually become closer in this offbeat love story Christine Fenzl Film I’m Your Man Maria Schrader Advertisement

CAN happiness flourish even when it is knowingly built on fabrication? Is perfection conducive to a healthy partnership? Can artificial and emotional intelligence truly coexist? Fresh from her Emmy-winning success with the Netflix miniseries Unorthodox, Maria Schrader leaves such questions hanging in I’m Your Man, her fourth film.

Adapted from Emma Braslavsky’s short story Ich bin dein Mensch, this German-language tale stars Downton Abbey‘s Dan Stevens as Tom, the ideal life partner. He is a handsome sharp-dresser with blue eyes that could pierce a stone, a penchant for romantic gestures and a willingness to cater to every whim. He is also a humanoid robot.

Love in the time of algorithms has been explored in the Amazon anthology Soulmates and Netflix’s Osmosis and The One. However, the central coupling here is born out of necessity rather than a search for “the one”.

Academic Alma (Maren Eggert) has reluctantly agreed to house Tom in a three-week experiment, which will help finance her research. She is completely uninterested in sharing a bed, or even a conversation, with this apparent kindred spirit, created to make her happy. “Leaving me alone should be no problem at all,” she tells Tom, who can’t compute her disdain. “That’s what makes me happiest.”

I’m Your Man is a curiosity. You could call it a sci-fi rom, yet there is little if any sci-fi or, indeed, rom. The tech behind Tom comes into play just once when he briefly malfunctions, while the film’s Berlin setting is a near-future whose aesthetic is more soft pastels than dark dystopia.

Despite Tom’s best efforts to ignite a spark using the millions of data strands at his disposal, he is thwarted by a dismissive Alma at every turn. “Ninety-three per cent of German women dream of this,” he remarks, after running a candlelit bath, strewn with rose petals. “Guess which group I belong to,” comes the reply.

It is only when Tom tones down the programmed cliches and starts responding less, well, robotically that the iciness thaws. He senses the sadness behind Alma’s steely exterior, and his matter-of-fact, yet effective, probing renders their “couples counsellor” (Toni Erdmann‘s Sandra Hüller) obsolete. Before long, Alma surprises herself by defending Tom from a colleague with no sense of personal space.

If I’m Your Man had emerged from Hollywood, this would be the cue for wedding bells. But European arthouse tends to avoid wrapping things up neatly in a bow. Although she slowly succumbs to Tom’s attributes, both physical and mental, Alma always remains aware that she is being manipulated by his constant recalibration. Happily-ever-after never looks likely.

Still, the two stars ensure you remain invested in this relationship, wherever it leads. Eggert offsets Alma’s abrasiveness with a quiet vulnerability and compassion, particularly in the scenes with her cranky dad (Wolfgang Hübsch) who has dementia, which hint at her fear of ending up in a lonely state, too.

Meanwhile, Stevens is charm personified in a performance partly inspired by Cary Grant. His comic timing is exquisite, proving that his scene-stealing turn in last year’s Eurovision movie was no fluke.

Schrader has served up a new, if resolutely low-key, tragi-comic spin on the digital love story that combines depth, humour and, no matter how mechanical, heart.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra) Shutterstock / Ethan Daniels

Black howler monkeys move through their environment using mental maps that they modify and adapt as the landscape changes – a skill previously seen only in humans.

In 2016, Miguel de Guinea at Oxford Brookes University, UK, spent a year in Palenque National Park, Mexico, tracking groups of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) to observe how the primates traverse the complex rainforest landscape.

Tagging the monkeys with GPS tracking technology would have been too invasive, so de Guinea and a group of volunteers had to follow them on foot. “It was a bit exhausting at times,” he says. Tracking the monkeys frequently required the researchers to cross rivers and to climb to the pinnacles of ancient Mayan temples. But the results of their endeavours were surprising.

“We found that the monkeys follow certain routes,” says de Guinea, “but they structure and combine those routes in an efficient, human-like way.”

While most animals move through an environment semi-randomly or by instinct, humans are different. We tend to follow familiar routes encoded in mental maps. We also have a spatial sense of how locations are arranged in the landscape. This means that if an obstacle blocks a familiar path, we can change course – perhaps temporarily switching to another familiar route heading in a different direction – to navigate the obstacle and still reach our desired destination. As de Guinea’s team studied the black howler monkeys, they realised the primates do this too.

For example, the monkeys in the study would always approach favourite fruit trees from the same direction. What’s more, while the monkeys would rarely deviate from established routes, they had no problem doing so if, for instance, a tree forming part of a route had fallen down. In such cases, the monkeys quickly worked out how to connect the broken route to another familiar route, so they could navigate the obstacle and still reach their target.

They could also connect certain routes end to end in order to travel long distances, or they could take shortcuts from one route to another. The way the monkeys would jump from one route to another suggests that they have some concept of how these routes relate to each other in physical space, say the researchers.

In other words, the monkeys can easily amend their route-based view of the world with some knowledge of direction and geography, much like humans do. “It was a big effort,” says de Guinea, “but it was worth it to understand the fascinating cognitive skills that black howler monkeys demonstrate in the wild.”

Polluted air caused by smoke released from the record-breaking wildfires in the US last year has been linked to a strong increase in covid-19 cases and deaths.

Francesca Dominici at Harvard University and her colleagues say 19,742 recorded covid-19 cases and 748 covid-related deaths can be linked to spikes in tiny particulate matter, PM2.5, released by the blazes in California, Oregon and Washington.

Links between long-term exposure to dirty air and greater risk of death and severe illness from covid-19 have already been well-documented. But the new research puts numbers on how short-term exposure to pollution, in this case from wildfires, may have made the pandemic’s health impact worse.

Advertisement

“What this is saying is, number one, especially for the counties affected by wildfires, people should absolutely get vaccinated and wear a mask,” says Dominici.

The team looked at daily data on covid-19 cases and deaths and PM2.5 levels between March and December 2020 in 92 counties which cover 95 per cent of the population in California, Oregon and Washington. They then accounted for other possible explanations for links, including looking at the weather and Facebook data on how much people moved around, and considered a counterfactual world without the fires.

Across the counties as a whole, they found each extra 10 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre of air over 28 days was linked to an 11.7 per cent increase in coronavirus cases, and a 52.8 per cent increase in covid-19 deaths. Some counties saw PM2.5 levels higher than 500 micrograms per cubic metre for days in a row due to fires, well above the level deemed “hazardous” by US environmental authorities.

The impact of pollution on covid-19 cases and deaths varied widely between areas. Dominici says that is probably because “the trajectory of the pandemic within each county was very, very different”. The team thinks cases increased due to PM2.5 exposure because it led to more severe illness. This might also have had an impact even on people with mild illness. For instance, people with what would ordinarily have been an asymptomatic infection might have developed symptoms.

There are some caveats. Dominici says there may yet be other explanations for the link that the team didn’t account for. And the amount of PM2.5 people were estimated to be exposed to, using smoke satellite images, may not reflect their true exposure.

Nonetheless, the research implies there is another motivation to cut the carbon dioxide emissions which are projected to worsen wildfires in the western US as the world warms. “This also provides another reason why tackling climate change is so important,” says Dominici.

ROBIN LUTZ’S documentary about Maurits Cornelis Escher begins near the end of his life. Escher, one of the Netherlands’s most famous artists, and by then in his late 60s, is discovered by California’s counterculture.

For the life of him he can’t understand why. Escher’s hyper-rational, mathematically sophisticated woodcuts aren’t even art as far as he is concerned. And now a bunch of hippies are zoning out on them. Colouring them. Making them into place mats. Mick Jagger even wants him to design an album cover.

Escher’s acid reply to Jagger is delivered with relish by actor-broadcaster Stephen Fry, who reads from the artist’s voluminous correspondence and diaries throughout the documentary.

English singer-songwriter Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills & Nash) had a better time of it. When he phoned to say what a great artist he thought Escher was, they got talking. Escher told Nash that he thought his own interest in symmetry, tiling and representing infinity disqualified him from being an artist, in the proper sense. Artists pursue beauty, he mused in his diary: “Perhaps I only pursue wonder.”

Advances in mathematics, computation and psychology have made nonsense of that distinction. Escher’s subject was perception. He might not have considered that art, but opinions have moved on there now.

Nash believed that Escher’s reputation would only grow posthumously. In his good-humoured and increasingly playful documentary, Lutz strongly agrees.

“The camera is an informed eye here, explaining Escher’s work, not turning it into visual effects”

Achieving, after a lifetime’s effort, a satisfying representation of infinity, Escher still berated himself: “I am starting to speak a language that is understood by very few,” he wrote. But isn’t this what true artists do? Aren’t they supposed to become more like themselves and less like others?

It is interesting to compare him with his close contemporary, the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Both preferred study to self-expression. And both gave themselves a hard time: Gödel believed himself to be lazy; Escher reckoned that he couldn’t draw. Yet Escher enjoyed a lifetime of fascinated striving. “It is,” he once remarked of his career, “and remains, the game of a child.”

Escher is also revealed through photographs, home movies and interviews with two of his children. Clearly, he relished his marriage, family and home, though life wasn’t always easy. The second world war kept them largely housebound, and they nearly starved to death. Later, his wife Jetta slowly succumbed to dementia. You can call Escher’s art cold and distant, but the man was never that.

Lutz harnesses the talents of animators and graphic designers to create a film that starts in the real world, but slowly, subtly slides into the phantasmagoric, monochrome world of Escher’s imagination. Warped perspectives straighten to reveal their secrets. Long, panning shots combine with prints to reveal how tiles mutate into living forms, then back to geometrical figures. The camera is an informed eye here, explaining Escher’s work, not turning it into visual effects.

Escher believed the only person who could properly film his work was himself – and that the result would be awfully boring. I hope he is watching this, tucked away in some hidden dimension.

Coral reefs around the world are threatened by warming temperatures which cause them to bleach – but they might get some relief through probiotics.

After six months driving on Mars, NASA’s Perseverance rover attempted to drill into the Martian surface to take its first sample on 6 August. Everything seemed to go smoothly, but when the rover’s operators checked the sample tube after it had been sealed and stored inside the rover, they found that it was empty.

“It went really well, other than that the rock behaved in a way that didn’t allow us to get any sample in the tube,” says Jennifer Trosper, the Perseverance project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. After combing through the data, the mission’s operators suspect that when the rover drilled into the rock to take a sample, it fell apart into a fine powder and sprinkled out of the tube.

“We need a more cooperative type of rock,” says Trosper. “This one was crumbly – it may have had a surface that was hard, but once we got in there all the grains just sort of came apart.” This didn’t happen during tests of the sampling system on Earth, nor has it been a problem with the other Mars rovers.

While it isn’t possible to unseal and reuse the sampling tube, researchers had requested a sample of the Martian air, and the sealed tube does contain that. “We weren’t trying to collect the atmospheric sample, but it’s not a waste of a tube,” says Trosper. Perseverance has 43 sample tubes, so there are still plenty of opportunities to collect Mars rocks.

Trosper says this disappointing attempt isn’t a cause for concern when it comes to future sampling attempts with Perseverance. During the next attempt, planned for early September, the team plans to use the scientific instruments onboard the rover to confirm that a sample was taken before they seal the tube and stash it inside the rover.

Eventually, the plan is that Perseverance will cache these samples on the surface of Mars to be picked up and brought back to Earth by a later NASA mission. Returning the samples to Earth will allow scientists to study them in much more detail than we can on Mars, especially when it comes to searching for possible signs of past life there.

Francesco Ciccolella

THE universe of good reasons for putting a live guinea pig in an insulated metal pot is small. I can think of only one: in France, in the winter of 1782, the chemist Antoine Lavoisier and his polymath friend Pierre-Simon Laplace placed their unwitting subject into a double-walled metal chamber, the world’s first calorimeter, and sealed the lid. They had packed snow into the space between the walls, and by comparing the rate at which the guinea pig’s body heat melted the snow to the rate of carbon dioxide it exhaled, they discovered metabolism – the “fire of life” that drives our very existence. At last, science had a physical measure of the life force that enables us to grow, reproduce and move. Physiologists like myself have been counting calories ever since.

Today, a widespread obsession with fitness and body weight has led to a new era of calorie counting. Diet books and magazine workouts promise a kind of shiny metabolic nirvana of calories burned, villainous foods avoided, waistlines melted and health and vitality restored. The reasons they fail – and they almost always do – are as varied as the schemes themselves, but the common theme is a fundamental misunderstanding of metabolism. Yes, diet and exercise are critically important for our health, but they don’t work in the ways we are usually taught. Our bodies aren’t simple calorie-burning engines that we can easily manipulate to keep us looking trim and feeling good. They are complex and dynamic metabolic systems meticulously shaped by evolution for survival and reproduction.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US has developed a drone interceptor that fires what appears to be a form of Silly String into their rotors, bringing them down with minimal risk of accidental damage.

The interceptor was created by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It is launched from a vehicle and guided by radar that can automatically identify and track small drones.

Once the interceptor has a target drone in sight, it releases string-like streamers – their exact composition is unknown – to disable it. The system can also launch multiple interceptors to deal with several incoming drones simultaneously, and the interceptors are reusable.

DARPA says it wants to provide drone defences for convoys and other mobile units in heavily populated areas, where normal military weapons would create too much risk of civilian casualties. Existing interceptor drones, like the Coyote already used by the US military, carry an explosive warhead, while other projects rely on nets or ramming, which require more precise aiming.

The agency has also developed other, unspecified, non-explosive anti-drone weapons and another interceptor which resembles a small aircraft, but hasn’t released a video demonstrating them. They should also be safer than explosive countermeasures.

“The issue of a hostile drone – potentially with explosives attached to it – falling to the ground and possibly injuring civilians exists,” says Robert Bunker, security analyst with C/O Futures. “But it’s a far better option than targeting such a drone with indiscriminate machine gun fire.”

Because it doesn’t require explosives, this type of interceptor might also be suitable for civilian use, such as defending airports, sports stadiums and other vulnerable sites. But Bunker notes that, if interceptors become common, counter-countermeasures will evolve.

“We could see a type of escalation where hostile fighter drones protect the bomber ones from the counter-drones, as we see with manned-aircraft,“ he says.

Jack Watling of UK defence think tank RUSI says that the streamer-firing interceptor appears conceptually sound, but the reliability and cost of the system may still be issues. From a military viewpoint it has only one function; unlike most weapons it cannot be used against other targets, which may make it unpopular, he says. “I would be surprised if this particular concept becomes widely fielded within the military.”

IMAGINE a world in which admission to the top universities – to Oxford or Cambridge, or to Harvard or Yale – were limited to people who were very tall. Very soon, tall people would conclude that it is the natural order of things for the taller to succeed and the shorter to fail.

This is the world we live in. Not with taller and smaller people (although taller people often are at an advantage). But there is one measure by which, in many places, we tend to decide who has access to the best opportunities and a seat at the top decision-making tables: what we call intelligence. After all, someone blessed with intelligence has, by definition, what it takes – don’t they?

We have things exactly the wrong way round. The lesson of research by myself and many others over decades is that, through historical accident, we have developed a conception of intelligence that is narrow, questionably scientific, self-serving and ultimately self-defeating. We see the consequences in the faltering response of many nations to the covid-19 pandemic, and a host of other problems such as climate change, increasing income disparities and air and water pollution. In many spheres, our ways of thinking about and nurturing intelligence haven’t brokered intelligent solutions to real-world problems.

We need a better way. Fortunately, at least the starting point for this is clear. By returning to a more scientifically grounded idea of intelligence, who can have it and how we set about cultivating it in ourselves and others, we can begin to reboot our decision-making smarts and reshape our world for the better.

World leaders must drastically scale up their plans to curb CO2 emissions if humanity is to avoid the worst consequences of a warming world outlined in last week’s report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Unfortunately, there is no sign of that happening yet, but observers say the publication should boost political action on emissions.

The report, coupled with current extreme weather events such as Greece’s wildfires and a record 48.8°C temperature in Europe, has been seen by many as a wake-up call that should galvanise societies to take action.

Environmental leaders have called for new versions of the climate plans that countries are meant to submit every five years as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement’s framework. Without stronger plans, “the Paris Agreement goals will be out of reach,” tweeted Patricia Espinosa at United Nations Climate Change, the body that oversees international climate talks, which will reach a crunch moment at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, UK, this November.

Nations’ current plans are estimated to put the world somewhere around the middle of the five emissions scenarios considered in the IPCC report. This scenario would see Earth warm by 2.7°C by the end of the century – well above the 1.5°C and 2°C goals of the Paris Agreement.

COP26 president Alok Sharma has asked countries to produce bolder plans before the meeting. Last week, he called for “major emitters to play their part”, a phrase that is typically used to refer to China, the US, the European Union and India, which together account for more than half of global emissions. In response to the IPCC report, China gave no hint that a new plan is in the works, instead referring back to its existing long-term plan of carbon neutrality by 2060.

Nonetheless, the IPCC’s work should give a boost to COP26 and politicians who are in favour of climate action, according to veterans of international climate talks. “I think the IPCC report is a massive wake-up call,” says Peter Betts, a former lead EU negotiator on climate and now an associate fellow at UK think tank Chatham House. “It is really worrying. Coupled with these extreme weather events, I think this does reinforce the politics for action.”

Most high-income nations have already upgraded their plans from their 2015 versions, so there is little hope for more action from them. In April, the US pledged a 50 per cent cut in CO2 emissions by 2050 and the EU committed itself to a 55 per cent reduction over the same period. “You’ve got pledges of action from all the big developed countries, apart from Australia, which are at very top of what we thought possible a year ago,” says Betts.

This means that the lion’s share of the gap between government pledges today and the action needed to meet the Paris Agreement’s warming goals must be closed by middle-income nations, says Betts. That doesn’t seem to be happening. “You’ve got some big emerging economies like Brazil and Indonesia basically not moving, or even going backwards, so this is a problem,” he says.

Whether a strong new plan is forthcoming from China, which emits more than a quarter of the world’s CO2 and currently only plans to peak CO2 emissions by 2030, will be crucial. “My guess is they will revise it. The question is, will they do something incremental that looks good or something transformational? You can construct a powerful set of reasons why it [China] will do something ambitious, and why it might do something incremental,” says Betts.

The IPCC report may help bolster the case for other governments too, even if they stop shy of a new climate plan. India, for example, was thought to be on the brink of issuing a net-zero goal ahead of US president Joe Biden’s climate summit in April, but failed to do so. We also know that South Korea, the world’s eleventh-biggest CO2 emitter, is working on a new plan.

The biggest political consequence of the IPCC report may simply be to put the issue back at the top of the agenda for governments distracted by the pandemic, economic problems and other pressing domestic concerns. “Leaders have an enormous number of issues on their plate every day, covid being the obvious one. This issue struggles to get to be the number one priority,” says a UK government source.

Referring to the IPCC report, the source says: “It just moves the issue up front and centre. It can [sometimes] be perceived as a longer-term agenda, or an agenda [only] for the heaviest-emitting countries or those already feeling the most impacts. The message [from the IPCC] is that it’s global and requires a global solution. This sets out very starkly for every world leader that this has got to be at the top of their inbox from now right through to Glasgow, so big enough decisions can be made to avert catastrophe.”

Low-income countries responded to the report by calling for more financing for climate mitigations, including high-income nations such as the US and UK delivering on their 2009 promise of $100 billion a year by 2020, which is only at $80 billion according to the latest estimate. “The IPCC report findings reinforces the urgency to step up and take action – with more ambitious [climate plans], long-term decarbonisation plans and more climate finance – well before the doors open at COP26,” said Sonam Wangdi at the Least Developed Countries Group in a statement.

One message of the report that may have an instant impact is that “it is now an established fact” that climate change is linked to extreme weather events like the heatwaves and floods that have hit countries from Canada to China this year. “I think the increasing ability to link specific events with confidence to climate change, that boosts the narrative [for action on emissions],” says Betts.

This stronger link could spur greater investment in adaptation to a warming world. “Now that people are joining the dots that climate change is here and it’s having nasty impacts, that has the potential to focus the minds of individuals,” says Bob Ward at the London School of Economics. “It’s no longer a theoretical, remote issue, but it’s here and now.” Societies will have to increase their resilience as many climate change effects are already locked in for decades, he says.

Liz Stephens at the University of Reading, UK, who works with humanitarian organisations including the Red Cross movement, says such groups will be calling for more investment in “anticipatory action” at COP26. This involves early warning systems for flooding and heatwaves caused by extreme weather, as well as making sure that those systems are used by communities. “The countries most at risk of climate change are really seeing the impacts of extreme events now. They will rightly be looking for support from countries that have caused climate change to help them adapt,” she says.

The report could also positively influence political debate about the cost of measures to make economies hit net zero. This will be high on the agenda in the UK in coming months, as the government outlines new elements of its net-zero strategy this autumn, including what to do about fossil fuel heating in homes, which is expected to cost billions of pounds to change.

In that respect, the report should strengthen the hand of politicians justifying the costs of strong action. Ward says: “The point about extreme weather is it’s damaging. While people go on about the cost of having to make changes [for net zero], they can now see on the other side of the ledger is this damage, which is not just economic but human too. People can now see there is no cost-free option here.”
